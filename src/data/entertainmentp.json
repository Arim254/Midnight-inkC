    "body": "\n\tIt’s been just over one year since WWE launched “Monday Night Raw” on Netflix, and the flagship show of the pro wrestling brand racked up some big numbers at the streamer. \n\n\tPer Netflix, subscribers watched over 525 million hours of WWE content in 2025. “Monday Night Raw” alone pulled in 340 million views, while premium live events broadcast on Netflix outside the US like WrestleMania and the Royal Rumble, as well as the weekly show “SmackDown,” accounted for 185 million views. \n\t\n\n\tIt was also recently announced that a massive trove of WWE library content will now be available to stream on Netflix in the US. \n\n\n\tSince Raw’s debut on Netflix in January 2025, the show has been on the Global Top 10 English TV chart 47 out of 52 weeks it has aired, averaging over 3 million viewers per week. Looking at individual countries, “Raw” has been a consistent presence in the the Top 10 chart in the US (51 weeks), Bolivia (49 weeks), Canada (48 weeks), the UK (40 weeks) and Mexico (38 weeks). \n\n\tWWE stars have also been a part of major Netflix events including Next on Netflix 2025, Netflix Tudum 2025: The Live Event, Netflix’s 2025 Upfront, the grand opening of Netflix Bites in Las Vegas, the grand openings of Netflix House Philadelphia and Dallas as well as NFL Christmas Gameday Live and the “Stranger Things 5” world premiere. There was also a “Stranger Things” crossover episode of “Raw” that aired Jan. 5, five days after the series finale.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn “No Other Choice,” Lee Byung-hun projects everyman desperation (think Pottersville-era Jimmy Stewart in “It’s a Wonderful Life”), movie star charisma (his looks are remarked upon in the film quite a bit) and the comic chops to pull off such a complex role.\n\n\tPark Chan-wook’s darkly humorous drama launched at the 2025 Venice Film Festival in competition, earning rave reviews. At Toronto, the film won the International People’s Choice Award. The film has been earning critics’ groups kudos and awards nominations, including three Gotham awards and three Golden Globes nominations — with Lee nominated for Globes best actor trophy. (This Variety extra edition went to press before the Golden Globes ceremony Jan. 11.)\n\t\n\n\tAnd no wonder: in these rocky economic times, “No Other Choice” is entirely relatable.\n\n\n\tLee plays Man-su, who has worked hard at a paper manufacturing plant for 25 years, devoted to his career while also helping to build, with his wife, a solid middle-class life for his family. Living the dream, right?\n\n\tWrong. Man-su is let go by new owners, and his comfortable life is upended. Job interviews are disastrous. His teenage son can’t believe they have to cancel Netflix. They even have to give their dogs to a relative to care for. And the job market is tough for a middle-aged manager. All this pushes Man-su to cook up a plan to identify the top candidates for jobs he’s gunning for — and murder them. Simple.\n\n\tBased on Donald Westlake’s noir “The Ax,” Park’s adaptation is a tale for our times, a comment on how little fast-moving businesses in their pursuit of riches value their workers.\n\t\n\n\tSouth Korean superstar Lee’s modulated performance in “No Other Choice” — angry, funny, loving, even slapstick — has been hailed by critics, and he’s not an unknown quantity to audiences outside his home territory, having made some big-budget Hollywood films like “G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra” and its sequel, “Red 2” and “Terminator Genisys.” He’s also toplined some of the biggest South Korean movies in the last couple of decades, including “Concrete Utopia,” “Masquerade,” “Inside Men,” “I Saw the Devil” and “Joint Security Area,” which kicked off his collaboration and friendship with Park.\n\n\tHis turn in “Choice” shows his range, especially for audiences who only know him from his steely, eerie turn on “Squid Game.”\n\n\tIn that global blockbuster series from Netflix, Lee’s Front Man is the opposite of Man-su, a powerful figure in the shadows who oversees a deadly game in which participants literally die in pursuit of prize money. He’s a puppet master with a tragic past but shows a flicker of humanity in the series’ finale — and maybe that’s respect, too — for player 456, Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae). He also gets an intense moment in Season 3 with Cate Blanchett in which they both telegraph a lot without saying anything.\n\n\tAnd if being in two of South Korea’s biggest exports over the last two years isn’t enough, Lee is also one of the voice actors in another Netflix phenomenon: “KPop Demon Hunters.”\n\n\tBut that’s Lee’s gift: The handsome superstar upending tropes in Parks’ latest skewering of society, jumping into an animated musical and letting the world know he’s more than just a Front Man for a degenerate game.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring the Variety Streaming Room presented by Dharma Productions, director Neeraj Ghaywan discussed the origins and production of “Homebound,” India’s Oscar-shortlisted international feature executive produced by Martin Scorsese.\n\n\tThe film is inspired by a New York Times op-ed by Basharat Peer and tells the true story of two marginalized young men in India, one who is Muslim and one Dalit. They leave their North Indian village to pursue government jobs in nearby cities, their journey highlighting the realities of contemporary India. “When we speak of people from marginalized communities, we often speak of them in statistics,” Ghaywan told Variety’s chief awards editor Clayton Davis. “There’s a need to humanize their experience.”\n\t\n\n\tGhaywan, who is Dalit, said the film draws from his own life, including years spent concealing his caste identity. Making “Homebound,” he said, was a way to reject the shame attached to that experience. “That shame is not mine to carry,” Ghaywan said, adding that the film centers on empathy across religious, ideological and social differences at a time of growing polarization.\n\n\tBringing that experience to the screen required intensive work with the film’s young leads, Ishaan Khatter and Vishal Jethwa. The actors participated in a two months of workshops and lived in North Indian villages to immerse themselves in the characters’ realities. “Great craft is not enough,” he said. “You have to understand the philosophy, the politics and the lived experience of the people you represent.”  Ghaywan encouraged the actors to bond off-screen as well, having them share personal stories and vulnerabilities to strengthen the friendship central to the film.\n\t\n\n\tThat depth of preparation proved essential for the film’s most challenging sequence, an emotionally intense bridge scene that Ghaywan says was the hardest to shoot. Khatter’s performance, in which his character yells into the horizon and loses his voice, was “a genuinely spiritual experience” that ultimately shapes the edit.\n\n\tAs the film’s awards attention grows, Ghaywan said representing India carries significant responsibility. “It’s not about expectations,” he said. “It’s about telling stories of people who are unseen by power.” He added that he hopes audiences walk away from the film with empathy. “That’s the only way for us to move forward.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Golden Globes returned Sunday night, bringing together film and television’s biggest names to celebrate the past year. Ahead of the ceremony, stars stopped by the Variety Golden Globes Pre-Show presented by Amazon Fire TV, hosted by Variety’s Marc Malkin and Angelique Jackson, to discuss their nominated work, upcoming projects and what it felt like to be part of the night. \n\n\tHere are some of the standout moments.\n\n\n\tElle Fanning Keeps ‘Hunger Games’ Details Under Wraps \n\t\n\n\tElle Fanning was careful when asked about the new “The Hunger Games” prequel, where she plays young Effie Trinket. When asked whether she lingered on set to catch surprise cameos from Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, Fanning offered a polite dodge: “I can’t confirm that. I wasn’t there, so I didn’t see them.” She did confirm what’s coming next, though — she’ll begin shooting “The Nightingale” in the coming months alongside her sister, Dakota Fanning. Reflecting on her nominated film “Sentimental Value,” Fanning said sharing the moment with the cast has been especially meaningful, praising co-star Stellan Skarsgård, who later won best supporting actor in a film: “We truly all just love each other.”\n\n\tHudson Williams Takes the Chaos in Stride \n\n\tFor Hudson Williams, the breakout star from “Heated Rivalry,” walking the Golden Globes carpet was loud — literally. “People were yelling at me,” he joked. Just two weeks after the Season 1 finale premiered, Williams and his co-star Connor Storrie were invited to not only attend, but present at the ceremony. When asked what went through his mind upon the invitation, Williams kept it simple, “Everything is surprising right now. So I just go, ‘Yeah, OK, what the hell.'”\n\t\n\n\tPaul Mescal Reflects on Shakespeare and Teases Beatles Biopics \n\n\tAttending the Golden Globes for the first time, Paul Mescal admitted the night felt surreal. “You go to drama school and make films, and you never assume something like this is going to happen,” he said. Despite being a nominee, Mescal said he hadn’t prepared an acceptance speech: “It just feels very loaded, so no, no speeches.” But he was happy to discuss how playing William Shakespeare informed his current work preparing to portray Paul McCartney in the upcoming Beatles biopics. “They definitely inform each other,” he said. “They’re both artists who changed the world.” Commenting on whether the Beatles cast might perform at an awards show, Mescal laughed it off: “I think that’s leading me down the garden path… I’ll be talking about that project for forever.”\n\n\t‘Adolescence’ Cast Stays Grounded Amid Awards Buzz \n\n\tThe cast of “Adolescence” approached their breakout awards moment with humility, emphasizing how fleeting the attention can be. “You might not be back here again,” Owen Cooper said. “So you can’t take it for granted.” Show creator Stephen Graham added, “The best expectation is no expectation.” The two nominated actors, plus their co-star Erin Doherty, ended up taking home awards, a moment they clearly savored after navigating the whirlwind of their first Globes experience.\n\n\tColman Domingo Wants More Cowardly Lion and Praises Jafaar Jackson \n\n\tColman Domingo arrived at the Globes with a busy year ahead, including “Euphoria” Season 3 and the Michael Jackson biopic “Michael.” Asked about the possibility of a Cowardly Lion spinoff of “Wicked: For Good,” Domingo didn’t rule it out: “I’d be into it,” he said. “I’d like more of that story.” Looking ahead to “Euphoria,” he praised creator Sam Levinson’s approach, calling the series “cinema” rather than television, and had particularly high praise for Jafaar Jackson, who stars as Michael Jackson in the upcoming biopic. “He’s a revelation,” Domingo said. “People are going to be incredibly moved.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery clapped back at Paramount Skydance’s lawsuit seeking more financial details on WBD’s deal with Netflix and said Paramount’s continued campaign to try to convince Warner Bros. shareholders that its $30/share offer is superior is an attempt to “distract” investors.\n\n\tIn a statement, WBD said Paramount’s lawsuit filed Monday in Delaware Chancery Court was “meritless.” The company said that Paramount, led by chairman and CEO David Ellison, “has yet to raise the price” of its offer to acquire WBD in its entirety.\n\t\n\n\t“Despite six weeks and just as many press releases from Paramount Skydance, it has yet to raise the price or address the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer,” WBD said in a statement Monday. “Instead, Paramount Skydance is seeking to distract with a meritless lawsuit and attacks on a board that has delivered an unprecedented amount of shareholder value. In spite of its multiple opportunities, Paramount Skydance continues to propose a transaction that our board unanimously concluded is not superior to the merger agreement with Netflix.”\n\n\n\tEllison, just weeks after the close of Skydance Media’s acquisition of Paramount Global in August 2025, kicked off what became a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery. Paramount has been seeking to buy WBD as a whole — but WBD’s board has rejected eight consecutive offers from Ellison and his backers, which include his dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. \n\n\tAfter evaluating offers from Paramount, Comcast and Netflix, the board of WBD opted to clinch a deal with Netflix. Under that agreement, Netflix would pay $27.75/share in cash and stock for Warner Bros.’s films and TV studios businesses, HBO and HBO Max, and games division. The Netflix sale is to be completed after WBD’s spin-off in the third quarter of 2026 of Discovery Global, which will comprise assets including CNN, TBS, HGTV, Food Network and Discovery+.\n\t\n\n\tDavid Ellison — who was ghosted by Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav in the hours leading up to WBD’s announcement of its deal with Netflix — has not given up his fight for WBD. He has continued to assert that Paramount Skydance’s proposal is a better deal for WBD shareholders.\n\n\tA key question Paramount has raised in advocating for its hostile takeover: how WBD is assigning value to Discovery Global.\n\n\tParamount’s Jan. 12 lawsuit, which names Zaslav and WBD’s other board members as defendants, seeks to force the media company to disclose how it is valuing Discovery Global in the context of the value of the overall Netflix transaction, including how much debt WBD will be offloading to Discovery Global.\n\n\tThose are crucial details in evaluating the total shareholder value of Netflix’s deal vs. Paramount’s offer, according to Paramount. According to Paramount’s Jan. 8 analysis, the total value of the Netflix transaction to WBD shareholders is $27.42/share, given the decline in Netflix’s share price since that deal was announced — implying that shares in Discovery Global have zero value under the Netflix deal.\n\n\tIn addition to suing WBD’s board, Paramount on Monday formally announced that it plans to nominate a rival slate of directors for election at the 2026 Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders meeting to push the board to engage with Paramount’s $30/share offer.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe artists behind the mega-hit “Zootopia 2” already had an established world to build on, but the sequel expands it in ways that required extensive research and a lot of discussion.\n\n\tJared Bush, writer and director of “Zootopia 2” with director Byron Howard, notes that in “Zootopia,” which he co-directed and co-wrote, “we talked about bias and stereotypes a lot. We wanted to make sure that this story continued those discussions. And I think that as we headed into this story, which is really centered on this relationship between a fox and a bunny, it’s really about their differences, and how easily those differences can worry us and make us feel like they’re insurmountable. It felt like an important thing to talk about.”\n\t\n\n\tThe sequel introduces new characters: Gary De’Snake (a reptile), the Lynxley family (lynxes) and Nibbles Maplestick (a beaver). There are also new environments like the Marsh Market, where a whole lot of marine mammals and a secret world of reptiles live.\n\n\n\tAnd while they found research that shows that mammals have an inherent bias against reptiles, the animators still had to make them part of the Zootopia world. “It’s not easy with snakes, because we found that you couldn’t really put clothing on snakes,” Bush, who is also chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios, says. So Gary’s snake grandmother was shown with old-fashioned spectacles and a Victorian collar.\n\n\tThe houses in the snakes’ village were long, undulating and interconnected — no walls separating them. “We did want to lean in on the idea that it was a small, close-knit community, that it felt cozy, that it felt welcoming, and it felt special. It was actually largely inspired by [Antoni] Gaudi’s architecture from Spain,” Bush notes.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe design for the fancy Zootennial Gala\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMaking lynxes the villains was also intentional. “Reptiles need warmth, right?” he says. “We wanted to have an animal that wanted cold. So the lynx is a cold-weather mammal. They are covered in fur. They actually can walk on top of the snow,” adding that in some snowy scenes, Pawbert (a double-crossing lynx voiced by Andy Samberg) doesn’t leave prints.\n\n\tBush notes that “in nature, 90% of a lynx’s diet is rabbit.” So having rabbit Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) going up against an animal that is her natural predator was important. And a lynx is feline, while Nick (Jason Bateman) is a fox, a canine, “and we liked cats versus dogs.” Lynxes are also opportunistic hunters, which vibed with what the Lynxley family was doing in Zootopia, and their size is not too intimidating.\n\n\t“We wanted them to be, scale-wise, something just a little bit bigger than Nick and Judy. So they’d feel intimidated” but not overwhelmed, like a bear would, Bush says.  “And so the lynx is for us — on top of being beautiful animals — something that we felt really fit the bill. But again, that’s months and months and months of research to figure out that that’s the right animal for that.”\n\n\tA new character with an au courant twist is conspiracy-loving internet star Nibbles Maplestick (voiced by Fortune Feimster). She easily navigates all worlds in Zootopia.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCrime-fighting friends and partners Nick and Judy, left; new character Nibbles Maplestick, right, a beaver with a big social media presence\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Everyone knows beavers are conspiracy theorists,” Bush says with a laugh. “They’re great planners. They are incredibly intelligent. And we wanted Nibbles — even though she kind of initially comes across as kind of an aw-shucks character — to flip the trope and, ultimately, she was incredibly smart and perceptive.”\n\n\tBeavers are also comfortable in water and on land, unlike Judy and Nick. “A lot of this movie is about pushing Judy and Nick out of their comfort zones, putting them into environments where they are the other,” Bush says. So they needed to get them into a neighborhood they had never been to and weren’t suited for. Nibbles leading them through Marsh Market proved to be the right place. “Marsh Market is for semi-aquatic animals. It’s for marine mammals,” Bush says, adding that it would be a very comfortable place for beavers, who are adept in water and on land.\n\t\n\n\tPlus, “I think maybe the thing I like the most is that a beaver’s tail has scales, and so, weirdly, it’s almost one of the closest mammals to a reptile,” Bush says. Nibbles is certainly friendly with the “outlaw” reptiles.\n\n\tJudy and Nick are completely outside their comfort zones in Marsh Market, which is a grittier, more working-class environment, and serves to introduce a layer of socio-economic class dynamics into the film. “Nick and Judy, early on, go to the fanciest party in town. This is a group that they’re never around. That’s intentional. We wanted to say, here’s the fanciest of the fancies and then on the opposite side of that is Marsh Market.”\n\n\tBush says that the animators took inspiration from the Louisiana bayous “but we also really looked at Southeast Asian floating markets. That’s a big part of that, because we’re talking about coastal communities in general.”\n\n\tCreating an environment for the animals of Marsh Market — walruses, manatees, seals, sea lions, turtles, etc. — “was really fun to figure out, because it is an environment unlike anything a human would build. It’s built to be both above water and below water at the same time. You have to put your brain into the mindset of the animals that live there, because they built it. And that means they would not want railings on docks, because they need to get in and out of the water easily. They would not have sharp edges. They would have conveyor belts to get the bigger animals, like a walrus or an elephant seal or sea lion, in and out of the water.”\n\n\tThere are areas for the animals to hang out and congregate in the water, on the surface and below, unmolested by boats, which are human transportation. And for land mammals Nick and Judy, even the customs of these water-based mammals are foreign to them. “A seal or a walrus moves very differently from what we see with our bipedal mammals. We spent a lot of time figuring out the ratio of animal to human-like qualities, because we found that, say, for a camel or giraffe or a fox, there’s sort of this sweet spot of how much animal to put in and how much person. We actually changed that ratio with seals and sea lions, because as they moved around, if they were too upright, it actually felt weird. It took you out of it. So, figuring out those dynamics was critical.”\n\t\n\n\tWorld-building takes research and patience. “Something I tell people all the time is that everything is intentional,” Bush says. “Literally, every single thing you see is intentional. Someone had to build that. Many people had to have an opinion about everything you see on screen, and that goes down to the wood grain in a chair that you’re not even paying attention to. But that matters.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt was a packed weekend leading up to Sunday’s Golden Globes ceremony, and among the events kicking off Saturday morning was A Celebration with Stephen Schwartz. \n\n\tSchwartz, who has spent the last two decades with “Wicked,” as the show’s composer and lyricist, was in town to treat a select crowd of about 70 people — which included Jimmy Jam, Siedah Garrett and “Wicked” producer Marc Platt — to a greatest hits concert at Steinway Piano in Beverly Hills.\n\t\n\n\tThe performance featured renditions of his two Oscar-shortlisted original songs, “The Girl in the Bubble” performed by Ariana Grande, and “No Place Like Home” performed by Cynthia Erivo. Emceeing the event was “Wicked: For Good” director Jon M. Chu.\n\n\n\tHe kicked off with a rendition of “Colors of the Wind” from Disney’s “Pocahontas” before performing “When You Believe,” the Oscar winning original song performed by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.\n\n\tChu came on stage to discuss the songwriting process behind “No Place Like Home,” a song that Elphaba sings early in the movie. It comes as the animals of Oz are leaving and going underground due to the Wizard’s growing power. Elphaba also has to come to terms with the sacrifice she is making by leaving Oz forever. \n\n\tWhile Schwartz explained the song’s themes — addressing belonging and the meaning of home — he noted how it seemed to reflect the current political divisions in today’s America.\n\n\tSchwartz told Chu, “Elphaba makes this enormous sacrifice, and she has to leave Oz forever. She has to be thought of forever as the villain who was conquered, who was ousted. In order to save Oz itself, she has to essentially sacrifice herself.”\n\t\n\n\tThe creative liberty of making two movies was being able to explore the true cost of sacrifice – something they could only imply in the Broadway show. “We thought it was important that there be a moment where we see how much she loves her home, how much she loves Oz, even though it hasn’t been a particularly kind or welcoming place to her.” Discussions with the creative team led to the idea of showing how oppressed the animals were. Schwartz explained, “Many of them are feeling they have to escape. Elphaba tries to persuade them not to, and stay and fight for their home. And one of them says to her, ‘Why are you doing this? Nobody here is going to be happy until you’re dead. Why do you want to stay?’”\n\n\tThis moment forces Elphaba to reckon with her decision, ultimately choosing to stay and fight for her homeland.\n\n\n\tThe song was written a few years ago, but even then, political division could be felt. “Are we going to be turned against one another, so that there’s always this huge divide, and Americans are hating their fellow Americans because of their ideologies, what is our responsibility to that?” He went on to say, “It’s a lot safer to just keep your head down, go about your life. Don’t do anything, don’t say anything. Maybe it’s the smarter choice, but for Elphaba, that’s not a choice she can make.”\n\n\tIn writing the lyrics, he noted “No Place Like Home” was the obvious title, it was important for him to capture the philosophical idea of the responsibility in saving your home. It also reflected Elphaba’s struggle as she tries to understand why she even cares at all when she’s hated.\n\n\tSchwartz further revealed that Marc Platt, who produced both films and the Broadway musical shared that Oz was not just a place, “It’s an idea. It’s a promise. And that found its way into the song. I feel that’s what America is too. America is not just a place, it is an idea.”\n\n\tThe composer went on to discussing the process behind “The Girl in a Bubble,” which he described as a metaphor for Grande’s character. Schwartz called it the moment where “Glinda gets real.” He went on to say, “She drops all the artifice that she has carried as a character, both as the popular girl, and then also as Glinda the Good who floats around in this bubble and sings to people in soprano.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the film, Glinda sees her reflection in mirrors and bubbles. Schwartz explained, “When you’re watching it, you keep getting fooled. You think you’re looking at Glinda, and then you realize you’re just seeing a reflection of Glinda.”\n\n\tAs the performance came to a close, Chu knocked on the Steinway piano, and said, “This machine kills facists,” which led to huge applause.\n\n\tWatch the performance below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMusic producer L.A. Reid has reached a settlement with Drew Dixon, a former Arista executive who accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2001.\n\n\tDixon filed the suit in 2023 under a New York law that temporarily suspended the statute of limitations for sex assault. She alleged that Reid sexually assaulted twice, first during a private flight and again later in his car. Reid was president and CEO of Arista at the time.\n\n\n\tThe case was scheduled to go to trial on Monday. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed.\n\t\n\n\tKenya Davis, Dixon’s attorney, applauded her in a statement announcing that the settlement had been reached.\n\n\t“Drew has been one of the most courageous and outspoken supporters of survivors of sexual abuse,” Davis said. “Her advocacy, including her instrumental role in advancing the Adult Survivors Act, has helped shift the balance of power in the music industry, creating a path to justice for survivors.”\n\n\tReid’s attorney, Imran Ansari, stressed that the settlement does not include an admission of wrongdoing.\n\n\t“Mr. Reid has amicably resolved this matter with Ms. Dixon without any admission of liability,” Ansari said.\n\n\tBoth Dixon and Reid were expected to take the stand at the trial in federal court in New York. John Legend was also expected to testify. Dixon had suggested that Reid failed to sign Legend as a means of retaliating against her for her refusal of his sexual advances.\n\n\tDixon has also alleged that she was raped by Russell Simmons in 1995, joining some 20 other women who have accused Simmons of sexual misconduct. She filed a lawsuit against Simmons in 2024, alleging that he had defamed her by denying the accusations. That suit remains pending and is in the discovery phase.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Mescal doesn’t do grandstanding. \n\n\tThe 29-year-old Irish actor has built a career on restraint, on what’s held back rather than what’s unleashed. In Chloé Zhao‘s “Hamnet,” he brings that understated power to his portrayal of William Shakespeare, a father devastated by the loss of his son.\n\n\t“I can count on one hand those kinds of big cathartic moments that someone has in their life,” Mescal explains over a Zoom call, just landing in L.A. the day before the Golden Globes, where he’s nominated for best supporting actor. “What makes my back go up when I watch performances in general, there’s that kind of grandstanding performances that I’m envious of actors being able to do, but I also just don’t recognize people when I see that.”\n\t\n\n\tIt’s that philosophy that grounds his performance in “Hamnet,” a film that explores two contrasts: grief and how couples fracture under unimaginable loss. Working opposite Jessie Buckley, Mescal found himself calibrating his performance to match the film’s subjective focus on her character while maintaining the emotional truth of a father’s anguish.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Agata Grzybowska\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“What I’m probably most proud of in this film is the balance that exists between Jessie and me, in moments of how we express something that is happening to us as a couple and as two individuals very differently,” he says. “Couples will understand — you can go through anything traumatic in a partnership or as a family, and oftentimes you’re experiencing the same thing, but through very, very, very different lenses.”\n\n\tThe role comes at a pivotal moment in Mescal’s career. Six years after “Normal People” introduced him to international and TV audiences, he’s now juggling multiple long-term commitments: four films about the Beatles for director Sam Mendes, where he’ll play Paul McCartney, and Richard Linklater’s “Merrily We Roll Along,” a 20-year project currently in its third or fourth year of filming. Yet he remains grounded, living outside the Hollywood system while his work gains recognition within it.\n\t\n\n\tAs for playing The Bard himself, Mescal found liberation in Shakespeare’s visual anonymity. “I think it is very freeing when you don’t know necessarily what someone looks like, because it also just frees up your imagination as an actor, that you don’t feel tied to likeness,” he notes. Instead, he focused on what connected him to the historical figure: “I’m an artist, and he’s an artist, and he’s not somebody who didn’t grow up in London. I felt this pull that Shakespeare has to get to London to get to this cultural center to express something, one that I felt when I wanted to become an actor.”\n\n\tRead excerpts from his interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul Mescal stars as William Shakespeare in director Chloé Zhao’s HAMNET\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFocus Features\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen you first read the script, what jumped out at you — or what made you nervous — about portraying a father experiencing every parent’s worst nightmare?\t\n\n\tThe big fear that I had — and it was probably something similar to “Aftersun” — but I think I learned a lot from that. With “Aftersun,” I was going into something that is very much about being a father and a parent, and I’m not those things. And I think I got a lot of confidence from that, because I think the root of being a parent, I assume, is that it’s rooted in love, and you don’t have to be one to play one. Having gone through something like that and built a real close bond with someone like Frankie, to then step into something like this. I wasn’t nervous about playing something I hadn’t experienced in life because of that experience. That gave me a shot of confidence to begin with.\n\n\tThe big challenge with this is that, obviously, you’re representing a lot of parents who have lost children, and that’s another layer on top. I approached it by reading up on what happens to particular couples when they lose a child. And I’m sure you know this, but it’s often a miracle when couples stay together.\n\t\n\t\tMuch of your work here relies on restraint, what’s withheld rather than spoken. How do you calibrate that as an actor, especially in a story that’s so emotionally loaded?\t\n\n\tIt’s probably true for my career in general — restraint. I like operating in that place where there’s restraint. I would maybe argue that this definitely has a lot of restraint, but I think there are big moments where you have to plant your feet in this film and let rip a bit. As much as I love working in a kind of restrained capacity, because I think that’s just true of people, I can count on one hand those kinds of big cathartic moments that someone has in their life. What makes my back go up when I watch performances in general there’s that kind of grandstanding performances that I’m envious of actors being able to do, but I also just don’t recognize people when I see that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYour performance is very internal, while Jessie Buckley’s is more physical and outward. How did you work together to create that balance?\t\n\n\tThat’s because it’s the nature of what Chloé was interested in as well. I think it would have been a mistake if I had gone big and Jessie went big, or vice versa. You have to understand what the film is about, and it is very much — for the first 70 percent — subjectively looking at Agnes. Anya is very much the protagonist. You’ve got to be a good dance partner. You’ve got to see what you’re getting. I was getting so much from Jessie, and she’s just so, I can’t actively like to think about what I’m doing when I’m on set.\n\n\tI spend a lot of time in the prep process trying to imagine certain iterations of scenes, but then it’s basically an imaginative exercise where, like, what would happen if Jessie was doing this — you’re kind of just flirting with ideas of what a scene could potentially look like. And then when you’re there, I’m not thinking about how my face is moving or what I’m doing. I’m building a set of rules in my head about who this person is and how they interact with the world.\n\t\n\t\tDo you still have moments of imposter syndrome?\t\n\n\tI’m nominated with Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, and these people that I’ve watched my entire life. The whole category is made up of massive film stars. When you see your name written out — and I know it sounds nonsensical — but it would be strange to me to get used to this, you know. I didn’t grow up having a reference point for what Hollywood or this industry looks like.\n\n\tTo be honest, this portion of the industry isn’t necessarily the one I live in. I’ve made one film over here in the United States, and I’m very grateful that my work and the world that we live in now — the studio system of Hollywood isn’t the epicenter of the world anymore. It’s still the epicenter of the film industry. But I can make films in Turkey, and they can get seen. I get to live my life outside of it, without feeling beholden to LA, this place, or Hollywood.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the most difficult scene for you to shoot?\t\n\n\tThere are two that jump to mind, but they’re rooted in the fact that Jessie built a very special relationship, which I think is very telling of the setup Chloé put in place. She’s just a very important person in my life. We had these first four weeks, because we shot semi-chronologically, we were running around, falling in love, and really just attached to each other creatively. And then we started getting into the heavier sections.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s that scene where Will comes back from London, he gives her the gift, and he’s like, “What do you see?” And when she says nothing, and he looks up to her — it was so hard not fight for us to consciously not find each other, which I think is communicated nonverbally in the film. When you have to be not teammates, it’s very, very challenging, but I think great for the film.\n\n\tThe other one is similarly tied. When Jessie was going through the birth and death scenes, I was off set for about seven or eight days. It’s a shock to the system. You’re in every day, and then you’re separated from your imaginary family. The first thing that I shot coming in that day was listening outside the door. Hamnet has just died, and I’m just standing in this blacked-out tent waiting to come in. I think the first take Chloé used in the film of me arriving back is the first take; it’s essentially me seeing them for the first time in like two weeks. That was intense.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re committed to playing Paul McCartney in four Beatles films for Sam Mendes and participating in Richard Linklater’s 20-year “Merrily We Roll Along” project. What can you tell us about it, and what does that long-term commitment feel like?\t\n\n\tTo be honest, I can say very little — actually contractually, but also I’m kind of keen to say very little about it, because I’m excited that people want to know so much about it. I think the endeavor is totally singular. The four of us inside it are pinching ourselves. On a personal level, I’m so thrilled to be working on something at this scale, but also rooted in performance with Sam and great writers. But also just to be living and working in London and to have some sort of stability in what has been like a kind of mad six, seven years since “Normal People” came out.\n\n\tI don’t want to get into the Beatles thing, not coyly, but actually because I think the world hopefully will benefit from knowing as little as possible going into it. We’re a while away from finishing. That’s my job for all of 2026.\n\t\n\t\tThe directors you’re working with this year — Sam Mendes and Richard Linklater — that must feel like a pinch-yourself moment.\t\n\n\tThat’s another reference to a pinch-yourself moment. The directors that I’m going to be working with this year — Sam Mendes and Richard Linklater — I’m like, I’m happy. At least I’ll be working on one thing for the next 20 years.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you want people to know about your collaboration with Chloé Zhao and Jessie Buckley on “Hamnet?”\t\n\n\tIt’s very difficult to express adequately the public side of this job, but there’s a real love and camaraderie between us. It’s not even camaraderie. It’s like I love — and it’s a collaboration, and it’s not even just to do with work anymore. We’ve kind of seen a lot of the inside of each other — me, Chloé and Jessie — and I feel very protected by them. I feel very protective of them, and I’m very proud of what we made together.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tTimothée Chalamet may have won big at the 2026 Golden Globes but he stayed loyal to his streetwear roots when it came to his red carpet ensemble. The 30 year-old actor swapped out “Marty Supreme” orange for an all-black fit at the awards ceremony, topping off a three-piece velvet ensemble from Chrome Hearts with a pair of trusty $200 Timberland boots.\n\n\tThe Timberlands weren’t a one-off stunt so much as a continuation of Chalamet’s long-running flirtation with New York workwear style. The actor has frequently folded classic Timberlands into his off-duty rotation, wearing the waterproof boots with baggy denim, hoodies and oversized coats during press tours and street appearances. Rather than going for a traditional button-down look for the Globes, he opted for a polished version of his go-style, which meant reaching for his trusty Timberlands instead of classic patent leather dress shoes. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPenske Media via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe New Hampshire-founded brand has long been embraced by musicians and actors who resist polish. The boot has been worn by everyone from Jay-Z and Nas — who helped cement its hip-hop legacy in the ’90s — to more recent A-listers like Rihanna, who has styled classic wheat Timbs with oversized coats and streetwear silhouettes, and A$AP Rocky, whose fashion credibility has helped pull the boot further into luxury conversations. On the actor side, Leonardo DiCaprio has long worn Timberlands off-camera, while Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid have incorporated them into model-off-duty looks. \n\n\tAs for the rest of Chalamet’s Golden Globes night? He went on to win the best actor award for “Marty Supreme,” cementing his place in the Oscars race. Check out Variety’s full list of 2026 Oscar predictions here. \n\n\n\tShop Chalemet’s exact Timberland boots below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Recording Academy and CBS have announced that Emmy Award-winning comedian Trevor Noah will return as host of the Grammy Awards one “final” time on Sunday, Feb. 1. \n\n\tThis will be Noah’s sixth time as host of the Grammy Awards and he will also serve as an executive producer of the show, which takes place at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles and airs live on CBS 8–11:30 p.m. ET/5–8:30 p.m. PT. Noah’s first year hosting the show was in 2021, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\t\n\n\tThe show’s executive producer, Ben Winston of Fulwell Entertainment, says, “I am beyond thrilled to welcome Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys for his sixth, and sadly, final time. He’s been the most phenomenal host of the show. He’s so smart, so funny, and such a true fan of the artists and music. His impact on the show has been truly spectacular, and we can’t wait to do it together one last time.”\n\n\n\tThe show will air one last time on the CBS Television Network and will be available to stream live and on-demand on Paramount+ (live and on demand for Paramount+ Premium subscribers, or on demand for Paramount+ Essential subscribers the day after the special airs). The show has aired on CBS every year since 1973; the Grammys’ 10-year deal with Disney, announced in 2024, begins next year.\n\n\tKendrick Lamar leads the list of 2026 Grammy nominees with nine nods, followed by Lady Gaga and producers Jack Antonoff and Cirkut with seven; Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter, Leon Thomas, and engineer Serban Ghenea with six; and Clipse, Doechii, SZA, Turnstile, and Tyler, the Creator and producers Souwave and Andrew Watt with five.\n\t\n\n\tPerformers and presenters are expected to be announced in the coming days. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAcademy Award winner Zoe Saldaña is officially the highest-grossing actor of all time, thanks to “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”\n\n\tSaldaña has starred in the three highest-grossing films of all time — 2009’s “Avatar” and its 2022 sequel “The Way of Water,” which hold the No. 1 and 3 spots respectively, as well as 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame,” sandwiched at No. 2. She is also the first actress to appear in four movies that have generated more than $2 billion globally, including 2018’s “Avengers: Infinity War.” In addition to “Avatar” and her other Marvel Cinematic Universe appearances as Gamora (she was in three “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies), Saldaña also portrayed Nyota Uhura in a “Star Trek” trilogy, which generated more than $1 billion worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tAs of 2024, Saldaña’s global box office haul totaled more than $14 billion, putting her as the third-highest grossing actor behind fellow MCU stars Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson. However, Saldaña was propelled to the No. 1 spot after this December’s “Avatar” threequel, which has earned $1.23 billion to date. Now her films have amassed a combined $15.47 billion, according to a tally by the Numbers.\n\n\n\tSaldaña had a major year in 2025: In March, she won the best supporting actress Oscar for her show-stopping performance in “Emilia Pérez” and made history as the first Dominican American to win an Academy Award. The audacious musical, from auteur Jacques Audiard, earned Saldaña prizes at the Cannes Film Festival, where the film debuted, as well as a clean sweep of awards season accolades, including a SAG award, BAFTA award, Golden Globe and Critics Choice award.\n\t\n\n\t“It feels really good,” Saldaña recently told Variety about having “Oscar winner” as her new prefix. “My husband [director Marco Perego Saldaña] is so funny. He has this joke; he goes, ‘Z, you can’t do anything right now without people announcing you as “Academy Award winner.” You can’t rob a bank, because it’ll be like, “Academy Award winner…”‘ I’m like, ‘Oh my God,'” she said, laughing. “But it’s true. I’m honored. I’m very happy. I’m also like, ‘OK, let’s continue to work.'”\n\n\tIn “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Saldaña reprises her role as Na’vi warrior Neytiri, whose relationship with human soldier-turned-Na’vi leader Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is the focus of the franchise’s story. To transform the Afro-Latina actor into the blue-skinned, 8-foot-tall humanoid, the movie utilizes an innovative form of performance capture technology, pioneered by filmmaker James Cameron.\n\n\t“The reason why this world is so real to so many people is because the acting was the most important element for Jim,” Saldaña explained. “Performance capture gives the actor the ability not to have to rely so much on all the things that can sometimes be very distracting in regular live-action. Performance capture gives you the gift of connection and putting all of your heart and all of your energy into that scene, into that moment.”\n\n\tSaldaña is expected to return for “Avatar 4” (slated for December 2029) and “Avatar 5” (planned to debut December 2031) — so expect her to continue raking in the box office dollars.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAdrien Brody and Tessa Thompson will make their Broadway debuts in “The Fear of 13,” a searing play about a wrongly convinced death row prisoner.\n\n\t“The Fear of 13” tells the true story of Nick Yarris (Brody), a Pennsylvania native who spends more than two decades on death row for a rape and murder he insists he didn’t commit. Through a series of prison visits with a volunteer named Jackie (Thompson), Nick shares the impulses and consequences that shaped his life. Described as “devastating, darkly funny, and life-affirming,” the show forces the pair to “confront what justice demands, what belief requires, and the perilous distance between true freedom and the illusion of self- determination,” according to the official logline.\n\t\n\n\tLindsey Ferrentino (“The Queen of Versailles”) adapted the play from the 2015 documentary by British filmmaker David Sington. David Cromer, who won a Tony for “The Band’s Visit” and helmed George Clooney’s Broadway debut in “Good Night, and Good Luck,” is directing “The Fear of 13.” Producers are Seaview, Wessex Grove and Gavin Kalin Productions.\n\n\n\tPerformances will begin on March 19 at Broadway’s James Earl Jones Theatre ahead of opening night on April 15. \n\n\tBrody, an Academy Award winner for “The Pianist” and “The Brutalist,” made his London stage debut with “The Fear of 13” last October. The Independent gave the production a three-star review and wrote that Brody gives “a powerful performance that doesn’t let this wronged man feel like a straightforward victim.”\n\n\tWhen his casting across the Pond was announced, Brody called “The Fear of 13” a “story steeped in truth, that exposes systematic injustice and apathy through hope and humanity.” \n\t\n\n\t“I love the theatre and although I have not been on the stage in many years I have been searching for the right material and this was so clearly the one,” Brody told the Guardian.\n",

He was 68.\n\n\tMembers of The Scott Adams School (formerly called Coffee With Scott Adams) shared the news of Adams’ death on Tuesday. \n\n\tAdams started writing blog posts praising Donald Trump in 2015, and his daily video podcast featured a range of conservative guests. His writings and podcasts began to question the Holocaust and oppose the COVID vaccine.\n\t\n\n\tIn February 2023, “Dilbert” was dropped from syndicated newspapers in the United States following comments made by Adams on his “Real Coffee with Scott Adams” live stream that Black people were a “hate group.” In March 2023, Adams relaunched “Dilbert” as “Dilbert Reborn” on the subscription site Locals.\n\n\n\tAdams revealed his cancer diagnosis in May, the same day former President Joe Biden announced he had an “aggressive” form of prostate cancer. “I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has. I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones, but I’ve had it longer than he’s had it — well, longer than he’s admitted having it,” Adams said. “I expect to be checking out from this domain sometime this summer.”\n\n\tAlthough he endorsed Trump twice, he added, “I’d like to extend my respect and compassion for the ex-president and his family.  They’re going through an especially tough time, it’s a terrible disease. If you’re wondering if I’ll get better, the answer is no, it will only get worse,” he said. “There’s only one direction this goes now.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Windham, New York in 1957, Adams started drawing comics at age 6, citing the “Peanuts” comics as an early inspiration. Adams graduated with a BA in economics from Hartwick College in 1979, moving to California that same year to begin his career. From 1979 to 1986, Adams held various office jobs at Crocker National Banker, including computer programmer, budget analyst and teller.\n\n\tIn 1986, Adams earned an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and began working at Pacific Bell, during which time he created the “Dilbert” comic, whose title was suggested by Adams’ former boss. Adams launched the comic with United Media while at Pacific Bell, and would go on to draw inspiration from his Pacific Bell coworkers for a number of “Dilbert” characters. \n\n\tBy 1994, “Dilbert” was syndicated in more than 400 newspapers, and in 1995 Adams left Pacific Bell to become a full-time cartoonist. In 1996, he published his first book, “The Dilbert Principle.” In 1997, Adams was awarded the National Cartoonists Society‘s Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist and Best Newspaper Comic Strip.\n\n\tThe “Dilbert” comic was adapted as a television series in 1999, for which Adams served as executive producer and showrunner. The series ran for two seasons on UPN and was nominated for a 1999 Primetime Emmy. In addition to his work as a cartoonist, Adams also wrote books on theology, including “The Religion War.” \n\n\tAdams married Shelly Miles in 2006 and was the stepfather to her two children, Savannah and Justin, the latter of whom died of a fentanyl overdose in 2018. Miles and Adams divorced in 2014. In December 2019, Adams announced his engagement to Kristina Basham; the two were married in July 2020 and divorced in March 2022.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTV giants Banjiay and All3Media owner RedBirdIMI are in talks to merge their TV production businesses, Variety has confirmed.\n\n\tAccording to a source, the two have been discussing merging Banijay‘s Entertainment & Life unit with All3Media, which produces “The Traitors.”\n\n\tIf it were to go through, the combined entity would become one the world’s largest production groups, overseeing numerous subsidiary companies and a vast library of titles, including “Big Brother,” “Peaky Blinders” and “Race Across the World.”\n\t\n\n\tBanijay and All3Media declined to comment.\n\n\n\tAccording to an earlier report in Reuters, the talks — aimed at competing with the growing dominance of streaming giants — began towards the end of 2025 after Banijay ended its pursuit of ITV Studios. It asserted that while the talks were at an “advanced stage” no agreement had been reached and there was no certainty of any deal. The joint entity would have around $6.65 billion in revenue based on 2024 figures. \n\n\tReports emerged in 2025 that Redbird IMI had held talks with ITV to merge All3Media, which it acquired in 2024, and ITV Studios. ITV has since opened talks to sell its broadcast arm to Comcast, which would leave ITV Studios as a standalone unit.\n\n\tRedBird IMI’s U.S. partner RedBird Capital is backing Paramount Skydance’s bid for Warner Bros Discovery.\n\n\tThe Banijay Group — which completed its acquisition of Endemol Shine in 2000 — owns more than 130 productions companies, including Kudos, Tiger Aspect, The Forge and Zeppotron. All3Media, alongside “Traitors” banners IDTV and Studio Lambert, has a portfolio including Lion Television, Raw, Silverback, Two Brother Pictures and Neal Street Productions (which is producing The Beatles’ biopics for Sony). \n",

    "body": "\n\tDon Lemon dug into his past to help boost his future.\n\n\tIn a not-too-distant era, Lemon played an interesting part in CNN’s longstanding coverage of New Year’s Eve. When Anderson Cooper and his co-host — Kathy Griffin or Andy Cooper — wrapped their hosting duties for the night, the spotlight would shift to Lemon, who usually held forth in a southern city and was less, ah, formal than his cable-news colleagues. He might imbibe. He might get his ear pierced. In one memorable moment, Lemon told viewers he was a “grown-a– man” who was “able to share my point of view on television and it freaks people out and you know what? You can kiss my behind, I do not care. I don’t care.”\n\t\n\n\tNo surprise, such stuff went viralLemon banked on that very aspect of when he returned to coverage of New Year’s Eve in December — the first time he done so since leaving CNN in 2023. This time, however, he was working for himself, and not a mainstream media organization.\n\n\n\t“It’s not very often you get to this stage of your life and get to reinvent yourself and learn new things,” says Lemon, during a recent interview. He has embraced the so-called “creator” economy by taking to digital venues such as YouTube and Instagram and building his own series of interviews and news discussions. His exit from CNN after it was put under the aegis of executives from the former Discovery Communications, “forced me” to pivot, and, as a result, he adds, “I feel younger and more a part of the culture and the zeitgeist than when” he worked at the news outlet.\n\n\tDon Lemon’s New Year’s Eve special generated more than 30 million views across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube, with the six-and-a-half-hour livestream receiving more than 600,000 live viewers across YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook. Clips from the special on TikTok generated 3.1 million views and won the digital host more than 3,000 new followers. On Instagram and Facebook, the clips generated 26 million views and increased his follower count by 20,000.\n\n\tMeanwhile, CNN’s New Year’s Eve coverage, led by Cooper and Andy Cohen, wooed an average of nearly 2.77 million viewers overall on traditional TV between 8 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.\n\t\n\n\tLemon wasn’t trying to compete with what he calls “New York New Year’s Eve,” knowing full well that ABC’s longtime “Dick Clark’s Rockin’ New Year’s Eve” and CNN’s special coverage are staples for a certain viewership set.  Instead, he focused on New Orleans and treated the opportunity like a football game. Viewers could watch him visit the street on which his party would take place, hold a pre-event show that he likened to a tailgate, and get ready ahead of the actual event. He tapped local officials, local chefs and used his live stream to raise funds for Manning Family Children’s, a local pediatric hospital.\n\n\tHe wasn’t entirely sure he would be able to pull the whole thing off. He hired the production crew and camera personnel, and had to make certain the event space had the proper connectivity that would stay intact throughout the day. He also had to make sure his coverage had a sponsor, and his team lined up Don Julio tequila.\n\n\t“I’ve had to learn not just editorial, but the technology and the business part of it,” says Lemon.\n\n\tFans of his New Year’s antics on CNN might have enjoyed a cameo via remote by Brooke Baldwin, the former CNN afternoon anchor who used to appear alongside Lemon on New Year’s Eve, He was even in discussions with Kathy Griffin, he says, about making a possible appearance.\n\n\tLemon appears more casual. He’s no longer wearing jackets and dress shirts. But such work is anything but easy, he says. At first, he was doing shows behind a desk in a traditional studio, but learned people wanted to see him doing interviews with people on the street in unvarnished fashion. “I had to untrain myself” and discard some TV habits. And he had to juggle new tasks as well “You have to be relentless and shameless. You can’t judge yourself,” he says. “You have to read ads. You have to do it, and you have to be constantly present.”\n\n\tHis New Year’s success has Lemon ready to double down on big events throughout 2036. Look for him at the Grammys and, hopefully, the Super Bowl.\n\n\tLemon’s new work on creator media may seem radically different from his time on CNN, but some people might see it as an extension. The host in 2022 was working on a weekly talk show for CNN+, a streaming service that was quickly scuttled after its launch. Lemon had also pressed to try new ideas in his late primetime hours. He anchored CNN at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., and had long wanted to do a show with people “just sitting on big lounge chairs or club chairs and couches, and doing more of a relaxed show,” he recalls. CNN at the time told him the concept would be difficult to execute. “All of a sudden, Greg Gutfeld is doing it,” he says referring to the Fox News host who leads a late-night-styled program at 10 p.m. “I think it would have been great, but, oh well, I can still do it now.”\n\n\tIndeed, the appeal of Lemon’ s new job is that he can try anything at least once, so long as he tests concepts viewers feel are authentic and interesting, Still, when you lead the show as well as the business and logistics behind it, the job never ends. “It’s a lot of work,” says Lemon, “and you cannot let your foot off the pedal.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe U.K.’s home entertainment sector reached an all-time high of £5.7 billion ($7.6 billion) in 2025, marking a 10% increase year-over-year, according to new data released Tuesday by the British Association for Screen Entertainment in partnership with the Official Charts Company.\n\n\tThe record-breaking figures encompass streaming services, digital transactions and physical media sales, with the broader U.K. media and entertainment industry climbing 8% to reach $45.6 billion, up from $40.2 billion in 2024.\n\t\n\n\tUniversal’s “Wicked” emerged as the year’s top home entertainment title, generating $23.7 million in combined sales and rentals across all formats, according to Official Charts Company data. The musical adaptation, which stars British actors Cynthia Erivo and Jonathan Bailey and was filmed in the U.K., grossed $82 million at the U.K. box office in 2024. Its sequel, “Wicked: For Good,” earned $62 million theatrically in 2025 ahead of its home entertainment debut on Jan. 2.\n\n\n\tBritish talent dominated the year’s top five home entertainment titles. Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator II,” with key battle sequences filmed in the U.K., secured second place with $9.5 million in sales and rentals. The papal thriller “Conclave,” starring Ralph Fiennes and based on Robert Harris’ novel, topped the rental charts with nearly $5.4 million and won best British film at the 2025 BAFTAs.\n\n\t“Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy,” produced by Working Title with a predominantly British cast and directed by Michael Morris, claimed fourth place with $9.9 million. Gareth Edwards’ “Jurassic World: Rebirth,” featuring Jonathan Bailey, rounded out the top five with $8.2 million in home entertainment revenue, adding to its $48.7 million theatrical haul.\n\t\n\n\t“The U.K. entertainment industry is a globally admired powerhouse of talent and innovation that has excelled in 2025,” said Liz Bales, chief executive of BASE. “The strength of the U.K. entertainment industry is bolstered by the diversity of channels and choices for consumers who, alongside the array of streaming services being embraced, are flocking to buy and rent options in growing numbers.”\n\n\tThe digital marketplace showed particular strength, with the combined digital sales market rising 4.5% to $328.3 million. Digital purchases grew 7.4% in value, while the rental market increased 1.7% to reach $183.6 million. Premium video-on-demand releases also expanded, with 79 titles launching at higher price points fresh from theatrical runs in 2025, compared to 62 in 2024.\n\n\tPhysical media maintained its appeal with collectors and mainstream audiences alike. Warner Bros. Pictures’ “Superman” (2025) topped the Blu-ray chart, contributing to a 3.2% increase in the format’s overall value. “Downton Abbey: The Finale” sold 56,500 DVD units worth $761,120 in just two weeks following its Dec. 15 release, securing third place on the year-end Official DVD Chart.\n\n\tClassic titles continued to perform strongly, with the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy selling 13,800 units for $1.1 million, while perennial holiday favorites “Elf” and “The Polar Express” moved 120,100 and 77,500 units respectively in the final week of 2025.\n\n\tStreaming remained the dominant viewing choice, with 20.5 million U.K. households subscribing to at least one service, representing 69.5% of the population. Netflix led with 17.6 million subscribers in autumn 2025, bolstered by titles including award-winner “Adolescence” and animated series “KPop Demon Hunters.” Prime Video reached 13.6 million homes, while Disney+ served 7.5 million households and Paramount+ reached 3.5 million homes. Smaller platforms also posted gains, with Discovery growing to 3.2 million homes, Apple TV expanding to 2.8 million homes and Sky’s Now reaching 2 million homes.\n\n\tThe introduction of advertising-supported tiers across major streaming platforms contributed to the sector’s overall value increase, according to BASE.\n\n\tHBO’s “House of the Dragon” dominated TV sales for the third consecutive year, while “Doctor Who: The Savages,” which originally aired in 1966, claimed second place, demonstrating continued demand for classic television content on physical media.\n\t\n\n\tThe U.K. box office grew 1% in 2025, with Warner Bros. Pictures’ “A Minecraft Movie” leading theatrical revenues at $76.9 million while also capturing sixth place in home entertainment with $10.1 million in sales and rentals.\n\n\tBASE plans to release comprehensive market data and analysis later this month.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\tOfficial Video Chart 2025 (All Digital; Blu-ray and DVD, EST, TVOD)1. “Wicked”2. “Gladiator II”3. “Conclave”4. “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy”5. “Jurassic World: Rebirth”\n\n\tOfficial Film Chart 2025 (All Digital Retail; Blu-ray and DVD, EST)1. “Wicked”2. “A Minecraft Movie”3. “Gladiator II”4. “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy”5. “Jurassic World: Rebirth”\n\n\tOfficial Film Download Chart 2025 (EST)1. “Wicked”2. “A Minecraft Movie”3. “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy”4. “Gladiator II”5. “Jurassic World: Rebirth”\n\n\tOfficial Film Digital Rental Chart 2025 (VOD)1. “Conclave”2. “Gladiator II”3. “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy”4. “Wicked”5. “Jurassic World: Rebirth”\n\n\tOfficial Video Chart 2025 (All Blu-ray & DVD)1. “Wicked”2. “Gladiator II”3. “Jurassic World: Rebirth”4. “Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning”5. “Paddington in Peru”\n\n\tOfficial Blu-ray Chart 20251. “Superman” (2025)2. “Wicked”3. “Gladiator II”4. “Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning”5. “Nosferatu” (2024)\n\n\tOfficial DVD Chart 20251. “Wicked”2. “Gladiator II”3. “Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale”4. “Paddington in Peru”5. “Jurassic World: Rebirth”\n\n\tOfficial TV on Video Chart 20251. “House of the Dragon” Season 22. “Doctor Who: The Savages”3. “The Penguin”4. “Fallout” Season 15. “The Last of Us” Season 2​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

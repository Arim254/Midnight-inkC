We chose this incredible group of actors because they bring humor, humanity, and an infectious sense of fun that perfectly captures the spirit of the franchise.”\n\n\tThe “Backyard Sports” animated special is executive produced by Chris Waters, Lindsay Barnett, Avi Savitski and Ari Pinchot.

    "body": "\n\tGerman-born British composer Max Richter, who recently collaborated with Chloé Zhao on her Golden Globe-winning “Hamnet,” will be celebrated by the Berlin Film Festival with its Berlinale Camera award.\n\n\tRichter, whose credits besides “Hamnet” include titles such as “Waltz with Bashir,” “Ad Astra,” “Mary Queen of Scots” and HBO series “The Leftovers,” will receive the Berlin honor from Zhao on Feb. 18, at Berlin’s Haus der Berliner Festspiele, followed by a panel discussion.\n\t\n\n\tThe composer, whose work combines classical techniques with electronic elements, is also known for solo projects such as his seminal 2004 album “The Blue Notebooks,” and his magnum opus “Sleep” (2015), an 8.5-hour exploration of sound and the sleeping mind, co-created with Yulia Mahr. Richter’s latest solo album “In A Landscape” was released in 2024.\n\n\n\t“With over one billion streams and numerous awards — including the European Film Award for ‘Waltz with Bashir’ and a Grammy nomination for “Ad Astra” — Richter has left a lasting mark on contemporary film music,” the fest said in a statement.\n\n\t“Max Richter is one of the great contemporary composers, and film fans can count themselves lucky that he has such a profound passion for cinema,” Berlinale Director Tricia Tuttle said in the statement. “His compositions for film are more than accompaniment; they are narratives that make the heart of a story audible and deepen and transform the cinematic language.”\n\n\tRichter has long-standing ties to the Berlin fest. In 2009, he served as a mentor at the Berlinale Talent Campus (now called Berlinale Talents). He returned most recently in 2024 for the world premiere of Johan Renck’s sc-fi film “Spaceman,” starring Adam Sandler, for which he wrote the score.\n\t\n\n\tPrevious Berlinale Camera Award honorees include Agnes Varda, Rainer Rother, Richard Linklater, and Edgar Reitz. \n\n\tThe upcoming 76th Berlin Film Festival will run Feb. 12-22. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tIt was the night of the updo at the 2026 Golden Globes. Stars such as Amanda Seyfried, Jenna Ortega and Zoe Kravitz descended on the Beverly Hilton on Sunday night in a variety of pulled-back hairstyles — from low chignons to center-parted buns.\n\n\tSeyfried, who was nominated for “A Testament to Ann Lee” and “Long Bright River,”  donned a particularly refined updo that perfectly complemented the statuesque silhouette of her custom ivory Atelier Versace gown. The strapless sweetheart dress, cut to accentuate her waist and finished with delicate draping that flowed into a dramatic train, was paired with Tiffany & Co. diamonds.\n\n\n\t“I wanted the hair to feel ethereal and timeless, soft yet sculpted, with a subtle nod to 1930s glamour,” Seyfried’s hairstylist Renato Campora tells Variety. “It’s all about building a flawless foundation and layering in intention, so the final look feels polished, romantic, and effortlessly golden from every angle.”\n\n\tCampora exclusively used a lineup of ghd hot tools and accessories to achieve Seyfried’s Golden Globes hairstyle. Below, Renato walks through his step-by-step process (and the exact products he used):\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Begin on clean, towel-dried hair. Using the ghd Paddle Brush, rough-dry hair to about 50% with the ghd Helios Professional Hair Dryer.“\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Section hair into two-inch sections and create a smooth, glossy blowout using the ghd Ceramic Radial Brush in Size 3, focusing on precision and shine to build a flawless foundation.​”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Once dry, resection the hair and refine each panel with the ghd Chronos Max for a sleek, polished finish. Create a deep side part and section out a triangular section at the front for later.”\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Using the ghd Oval Dressing Brush, brush the remaining hair smoothly down and back into a low ponytail, keeping everything clean and controlled.​”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Set the front section with a classic Marcel wave using the ghd Chronos Curve Classic Iron, pinning each curl to cool.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t “Curl the ponytail length with the ghd Chronos Curve Grand Iron to build shape, then wrap and pin into a seamless low bun. Once secure, return to the front, gently brush out and place the wave with the ghd Oval Dressing Brush, softly framing the face and blending into the bun.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tStar power drove viewers home in 2025, with Eva Green, Romain Duris and Vincent Cassel in “The Three Musketeers: Milady,” Guillaume Canet’s action vehicle “Ad Vitam,” and acclaimed auteur Leos Carax’s singular self-portrait “It’s Not Me” ranking among the year’s most popular French titles on broadcast and streaming.\n\n\tCanet’s Netflix original topped 70 million views, while the Alexandre Dumas adaptation aired on 27 channels across nine countries. Meanwhile, Carax’s 41-minute essay — initially conceived as an exhibition piece for Paris’ Centre Pompidou — found a far wider audience, reaching viewers in 33 countries, released on two SVOD platforms.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to 2025 figures released ahead of this year’s Unifrance Rendezvous in Paris, one-offs and feature films dominated French small-screen exports, accounting for 80.6% of titles sold internationally. Global specialty platforms Criterion Channel, Mubi, and Shudder were key drivers, together delivering 49% of all SVOD new releases, while broadcasters in Spain, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Italy emerged as the most active linear markets, with French titles making up roughly 10% of new foreign programming in each. \n\n\n\tTraditional television remained the strongest showcase for French fare. First-time broadcasts of foreign works included 6.9% French titles, placing France third worldwide by representation. Spain led in both volume (1,836 titles) and market share (10.7%), with pay-TV and specialty channels carrying the largest slates. Streaming trailed slightly: French titles accounted for 3.8% of new international SVOD releases, ranking sixth among nationalities, with Germany and Turkey leading by volume (544 titles) and market share (9.9%). Global platforms, meanwhile, delivered roughly two-thirds of all French SVOD premieres. \n\t\n\n\tShining new light on familiar subjects also proved a winning formula for French nonfiction. Series such as “Clash of Ancient Warriors” — picked up by 15 channels across nine countries — and Arte’s “Nicole Kidman, Eyes Wide Open,” which has aired on 14 foreign channels, underscored the genre’s strong international appeal. \n\n\tSpeaking to Variety at a previous Unifrance Rendezvous, director Patrick Boudet detailed the so-called “French touch” that shaped his biographical documentary. \n\n\t“Nicole is Australian, which in a way brings her closer to a European identity,” Boudet said. “I wanted to avoid a gossip-driven approach. [Instead, I wanted] to show that Nicole is not just an actor, but also an auteur, a creator. She has no ambition to write or direct, but through her films she expresses something that touches her and conveys her view of the world.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeta, the social-media giant that is the parent of Facebook and Instagram, appointed veteran banking industry exec Dina Powell McCormick — a former adviser to President Trump — as president and vice chairman.\n\n\tPowell McCormick will help “guide the company’s overall strategy and execution” and will “partner with the compute and infrastructure teams to ensure our multibillion-dollar investments execute against our goals and drive positive economic impact in the communities where we operate around the world,” Meta said Monday. \n\t\n\n\tAccording to Meta co-founder, chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, she will have “a particular focus on partnering with governments and sovereigns to build, deploy, invest in, and finance Meta’s AI and infrastructure,” he wrote in a Facebook post.\n\n\n\tPresident Trump applauded her appointment. “Congratulations to DINA POWELL MCCORMICK, WHO HAS JUST BEEN NAMED THE NEW PRESIDENT OF META. A great choice by Mark Z!!!” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social account. “She is a fantastic, and very talented, person, who served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction! President DJT”\n\n\tPowell McCormick is married to Sen. David McCormick, the Republican junior senator from Pennsylvania, who was elected in 2024. In another tie Meta has forged with the Trump administration, the company last year appointed UFC CEO Dana White, a longtime friend of Donald Trump, to its board of directors.\n\n\tRegarding Powell McCormick’s new role at Meta, Zuckerberg said in a statement: “Dina’s experience at the highest levels of global finance, combined with her deep relationships around the world, makes her uniquely suited to help Meta manage this next phase of growth as the company’s president and vice chairman.”\n\t\n\n\tPowell McCormick has served as a member of Meta’s board of directors since April 2025. In that role, she has been “deeply engaged as we’ve accelerated our pursuit of frontier AI and personal superintelligence,” according to the tech company.\n\n\tMost recently, Powell McCormick was vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. Earlier, she spent 16 years at Goldman Sachs as a partner in senior leadership roles, including serving on the firm’s management committee and leading its global sovereign investment banking business.\n\n\tIn public service, Powell McCormick was deputy national security adviser to Trump during Trump’s first term and served as a senior White House adviser and assistant secretary of state for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice under President George W. Bush. Powell McCormick is the co-author, with her husband, of the bestselling book “Who Believed in You: The Power of Transformative Mentorship.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMark Ruffalo attended the Golden Globes as a nominee for his performance in HBO’s “Task,” but he wasn’t feeling entirely celebratory. Stopping to talk to USA Today on the red carpet, Ruffalo called out Donald Trump and said he couldn’t bullshit when it came to how “not normal” it is to attend a glitzy awards ceremony just days after the death of Renee Good. The actor was one of several celebrities wearing a “Be Good” pin to honor Good, who was killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis last week.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s for Renee Nicole Good, who was murdered,” Ruffalo said about wearing the pin before calling out J.D. Vance and other political figures who defended the shooting as self-defense. “We have a vice president who is lying about what’s happening.”\n\n\n\t“We’re in the middle of a war with Venezuela that we illegally invaded. [Trump] is telling the world that international law doesn’t matter to him. The only thing that matters to him is his own morality,” Ruffalo continued, nodding to Trump telling The New York Times that “my own morality” and “my own mind” are his only limits when it comes to global power.\n\n\t“The guy is a convicted felon,” Ruffalo said of Trump. “He’s the worst human being. If we’re relying on this guy’s morality for the most powerful country in the world, then we’re all in a lot of trouble. So this is for [Renee]. This is for the people in the United States who are terrorized and scared today. I know I’m one of them. I love this country, and what I’m seeing here happening is not America.”\n\n\tWhen asked why it was important to send a political message while attending the Globes, Ruffalo answered: “Listen, I want to pretend like this — I want to be here to celebrate, and I am here to celebrate, and I’m proud to have a Golden Globe nomination. But also, this is not normal anymore, and so I don’t know how I how I could be quiet, and I’m feeling a little sick, so it’s hard to BS right now.”\n\t\n\n\tJean Smart, Natasha Lyonne and Wanda Sykes also wore pins to the Globes in an effort coordinated by the ACLU. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tA former heavyweight of French broadcasting, Gilles Pélisson arrived at Unifrance at a moment of transition for France’s film and TV promotion body. Three years after taking over the presidency — following a long tenure as CEO of leading commercial network TF1 — Pélisson now oversees an organization reshaped by structural merger with TV France International, tightening funding sources and a rapidly changing marketplace. Forming a dynamic duo with Unifrance’s managing director Daniela Elstner, Pélisson had set clear goals from the outset. “The first priority was to consolidate the association’s fundamentals, particularly its funding,” he says in an interview with Variety just before the start of the Unifrance Rendez-Vous in Paris, pointing to the importance of securing Unifrance’s largely public financial base. Support from National Film Board (CNC) was “renewed and significantly increased, by €2 million per year,” a development he describes as “extremely important.” At the same time, Unifrance “strengthened our partnership with the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs,” enabling the launch of new initiatives such as ‘Tomorrow in sight,’ a new label celebrating young voices of French cinema and television. Pélisson, who previously headed Accor, Eurodisney and Bouygues Telecom before taking the helm of TF1, has also been able to tap into “private-sector support” to “complement public funding” in backing Unifrance. As such, Pélisson was the driving force behind the creation of the Unifrance endowment fund in 2024. The results are already tangible, with “three major partners on board: Accor Group, BNP Paribas and Champagne Pommery,” giving the organization “a more stable and resilient financial foundation,” he says. Pélisson has also worked hand-in-hand with Estlner to expand Unifrance’s footprint at major international festivals, developing Unifrance Clubs “in Cannes, but also in Berlin and Venice.” These hubs are designed to bring together French delegations, talent and international press, with the aim of creating “exceptional conditions that encourage exchanges, visibility and a strong collective presence for French cinema abroad.”Three years after the merger with TV France International, Unifrance is now operating “as a single team promoting both French cinema and audiovisual works.” The results, Pélisson notes, speak for themselves: “‘Les Gouttes de Dieu’ won at the International Emmy Awards,” while “‘HPI’ has also been a major international success.” Together, he says, “these successes create real pride and confirm that this strategy makes sense.”\n\n\n\n\tBut Pélisson is also conscious of the volatility of the box office for indie movies. Commenting on the international B.O. results in 2025, he says French films reached “around 42 million admissions,” a figure he calls “encouraging given the current context,” with standout titles including The Oscar-winning Latvian animated film “Flow,” Luc Besson’s “Dracula” and the TAT-produced animated fare “Falcon Express.” Ultimately, he sees animation and international co-productions as the two key trends bolstering the international presence of French cinema at festivals and  in theaters. In the U.S. – a market he sees as “weakened” due to shorter theatrical windows — Unifrance is active with several key events such as the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema in New York, the Unifrance Trophy in Los Angeles and masterclasses in American universities.As Unifrance enters its next phase, Pélisson is optimistic about appeal of local filmmakers, producers and talent. “The richness of French production remains intact,” he says, pointing to “The Phantom of the Opera” starring Deva Cassel and Romain Duris; a new adaptation of “Les Misérables” directed by Fred Cavayé and starring Vincent Lindon and Tahar Rahim; and Antonin Baudry’s two-part saga “De Gaulle” from Pathé. There is also a new film by Arthur Harrari starring Lea Seydoux.What do you see as your biggest achievements at Unifrance so far?\n\n\tThe first priority was to consolidate the association’s fundamentals, particularly its funding, which remains largely public. Support from the CNC was renewed and significantly increased, by €2 million per year, which is extremely important. We also strengthened our partnership with the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, which enabled us to launch new initiatives such as ‘Tomorrow in sight.’ Procirep also continues to be a very strong and committed partner.\n\t\n\n\tYou have also diversified Unifrance’s sources of funding. Why was that important?\n\n\tWe wanted to complement public funding with private-sector support. That is why we created a Unifrance endowment fund in 2024. We are now seeing the results, with three major partners on board: Accor Group, BNP Paribas and Champagne Pommery. This gives the association a more stable and resilient financial foundation.\n\n\tUnifrance has expanded its presence at major international festivals. What is the objective?\n\n\tWe have developed the Unifrance Clubs in Cannes, but also in Berlin and Venice. These spaces serve as hubs for French delegations, talent and the international press. The idea is to create exceptional conditions that encourage exchanges, visibility and a strong collective presence for French cinema abroad.\n\n\tHow do you assess the success of the merger between Unifrance and TV France International?\n\t\n\n\tThe merger process began before my arrival, and three years later we are fully into a new phase. We now operate as a single team promoting both French cinema and audiovisual works.  “Les Gouttes de Dieu” won at the International Emmy Awards. “HPI” has also been a major international success, among others. These successes create real pride and confirm that this strategy makes sense.\n\n\tDo the Rendez-Vous in Paris remain a key annual event? \n\n\tAbsolutely. They open the international year. We welcome around 500 buyers from all over the world and nearly 80 French companies, all under one roof. It is both a symbolic and highly effective showcase for French works.\n\n\tYou have also developed a more consumer-facing strategy with ‘MyFrenchStories.’ Why?\n\n\tWe wanted to speak directly to audiences, particularly younger viewers and those who do not always have access to cinemas. Digital platforms offer a powerful tool. ‘MyFrenchStories’ features short-form content — interviews, creative insights from composers and screenwriters — that explains cinemafrom the inside and helps reconnect audiences with the theatrical experience.\n\n\tSupporting emerging talent remains a core mission?\n\n\tAbsolutely. The 10 to Watch initiative is a major pillar of our strategy. These talents are showcased in Paris and Cannes, then supported internationally throughout the year, from Tokyo to New York. It is a genuine visibility accelerator and a key part of Unifrance’s role.\n\n\tHow do you rate the international performance of French cinema today?\n\n\tIt requires a great deal of humility. International box office results do not automatically mirror domestic performance. Some films that perform modestly in France can do extremely well abroad, and vice versa. For example, films like “Dracula” or “Jane Austin a gâché ma vie” did not perform strongly in France but became real hits internationally. In 2025, we are slightly up on last year, at around 42 million admissions, which is encouraging given the current context.\n\n\tWhich films stood out internationally in 2025?\n\n\tIn 2025, “Flow” clearly stood out as the French coproduction film that performed best internationally. With almost 4M admissions, “Dracula” is the best French film in terms of box office in 2025, followed by “Falcon Express” with 2.3 million admissions.\n\t\n\n\tWhat major trends are you seeing? \n\n\tTwo key trends stand out: animation and international co-productions.  French animation, in particular, is exceptionally strong, driven by the creativity of its writers and studios. It remains an area in which France is a global leader. Films like “Arco” are archetypal of French animation: strong storytelling and creativity. Unifrance has a solid relationship with the Annecy Animation Film Festival which will continue even more in the future. We also see a good momentum around international co-productions.\n\n\tYou mentioned that minority French productions play an important role in the international figures. How so? \n\n\tWhen we talk about international performance, we also have to look at films where France is a minority co-producer. These films are part of our ecosystem and contribute to the overall strength of French cinema abroad. This year, for example, you have titles like “I’m Still Here”, which is a Brazilian movie with French minority participation, “A Secret Agent” and “Sentimental Value”. These films may not always be perceived as “French” by the general public, but they are very important for us, both in terms of artistic presence and international circulation. They show that French involvement in international co-productions is significant, and that our influence goes well beyond strictly majority French films.\n\n\tStreaming platforms remain a sensitive issue. Why?\n\n\tBecause of the lack of transparency. We have very clear data for theatrical box office and linear television, but very limited visibility for platforms, even though films are being released in over 150 countries. This lack of data is damaging for the industry, for the understanding of a film’s life cycle, and for the proper valuation of works.\n\n\tHave the United States become a more challenging market? \n\n\tYes, undeniably. Shortened theatrical windows weaken cinema exhibition. Going to the movies in the U.S. has almost become a militant act. That said, theaters still play a crucial symbolic role in creating value and prestige, including for platforms, and this role has not disappeared. There are also distributors like Neon and Sony Classics that are resilient and believe in French cinema. \n\n\tHow does Unifrance operate in the U.S. market?\n\n\tThrough events. Rendez-Vous with French Cinema in New York, the Unifrance Trophy in Los Angeles, masterclasses in American universities… For one week, French cinema can truly resonate in a major city like New York. And of course, we are fully behind the Oscar Campaigns of our French productions, especially regarding the film “It Was Just an Accident” by Jafar Panahi – shortlisted for Best International Film.\n\t\n\n\tAre you optimistic about the years ahead?\n\n\tYes. The richness of French production remains intact, with many first features, major upcoming projects and a very strong presence in international festivals. France remains the second most selected country after the United States. That is a powerful signal. There are also many ambitious projects coming up this year. We have films like “The Phantom of the Opera”, a new adaptation of “Les Misérables” a period film by Fred Cavayé, and the two-part saga on de Gaulle. There is also a new film by Arthur Harrari starring Lea Seydoux. These are projects with clear international reach.\n",

I’ll do it your way,” Mayer wrote on social media. “Fkn’ A… Thanks for letting me ride alongside you. It sure was a pleasure. If you say it’s not the end, then I’ll believe you. I’ll meet you in the music. Come find me anytime.”\n\n\n\tWeir’s death, due to underlying lung issues after a battle with cancer, was announced on Saturday. He was 78.\n\t\n\n\tWhile seemingly an unlikely pair of collaborators — Mayer, while a world-class guitarist, was better known as a pop artist and was 30 years younger than Weir — the two performed together for a decade. They first united when Mayer was guest-hosting “The Late Late Show” and invited Weir to join him for a performance on the show. He went on to join Dead and Co., the latest and probably final incarnation of the Grateful Dead following the death of frontman and cofounder Jerry Garcia in 1995, and perform multiple tours with the group, which also featured Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart, its founding and longtime drummers, respectively. \n\n\tDead and Co. finished what was billed a farewell tour in July 2023, but played well-reviewed residencies at the Las Vegas Sphere in the following two years. The group’s final public performance with Weir took placed last August with three shows in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park — in the neighborhood that spawned the Grateful Dead in 1965 — to celebrate the group’s 60th anniversary. The group also performed at the MusiCares gala celebration during Grammy Week last year, where they were honored as Persons of the Year (pictured above). \n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

The Lions supporter is adamant he simply called DK by his full name ... while DK's circle told Chad Johnson he used a racial slur.\n      \n    \n          The fan, Ryan Kennedy, has since denied ever using any such language.\n      \n    \n          Whatever happened, the NFL still hit Metcalf with a hefty punishment for his role in the ugly incident.\n      \n    \n          Without their star receiver, Pittsburgh barely made the playoffs, losing their week 17 game against the Browns, before clinching the AFC North crown with a win over the Ravens, thanks to a missed field goal in the waning moments of the game.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The No. 4-seeded Steelers are hopeful that Metcalf's return will spark a playoff run as they open at home against the No. 5 Houston Texans on Monday night.\n      \n    \n          Metcalf has more than twice as many yards as any of the team's other wideouts. He's been productive in this postseason before, too -- he has five touchdowns and 451 yards in four playoff games.\n      \n      ",

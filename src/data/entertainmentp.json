    "body": "\n\tCésar winner Nadia Tereszkiewicz (“The Crime Is Mine,” “Forever Young”) is set to star in “Souveraines,” the feature debut of acclaimed filmmaker Rémi Allier. \n\n\tAllier won a César for his 2017 short “Little Hands,” later shortlisted for the Oscars. His debut follows a fiercely bonded mother and daughter involved in eco-terrorism within a cell of radical, conspiracy-driven activists. After sabotaging a wind turbine, the mother is arrested and loses custody, placing the girl with her aunt, who exposes her to a different worldview. Torn between the two women, the girl remains deeply influenced by her mother’s beliefs, convinced that a vast elite conspiracy threatens society. \n\t\n\n\tProduced by Lionel Massol and Pauline Seigland of Films Grand Huit (“Ghost Trail”) with Benoît Roland of Wrong Men (“The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo”), “Souveraines” will shoot later this year. \n\n\n\tBrittany-based Films Grand Huit is also readying “Disorder,” the next feature from Giacomo Abruzzese, whose 2023 debut “Disco Boy” premiered in competition in Berlin, winning the Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution. Co-produced with Dugong in Italy, the Italian-language film is set in 1990s Milan, amid the rise of private television and a new ruling class. Selected for the Marché du Film’s Investor Circle, the project has received support from Italy’s MIC and the Franco-Italian fund, with production planned for late 2026. KMBO will handle French distribution. \n\n\tAlready in the can, Grand Huit’s “Vanishing Goats” will hit French theaters in April, shortly before shooting begins on “Une de perdue, une de perdue.” \n\t\n\n\tWritten, directed by, and starring theater luminary Marie Remond, “Vanishing Goats” follows a French director trying to extricate herself from a toxic relationship just as she lands her big break. Shooting in June, Mathilde Elu’s queer romcom “Une de perdue, une de perdue” follows a bike trip along the Breton coast, turning landscapes and encounters into a journey of emotional emancipation. The cast includes standup comic Laura Felpin (“Banger”), singer-songwriter Pomme (“Spirit of Ecstasy”), Louise Chevillotte (“Benedetta”), and Harpo Guit (“Mother Schmuckers”).\n\n\tFurther down the line, Seigland and Massol are developing features like “Les Reves Tempetes” with “Ghost Trail” director Jonathan Millet, “Deepfake” from Ismaël Joffroy Chandoutis, “Ici Repose” by Moly Kane and “La disparition des dinosaures,” courtesy of Élie Girard. \n\n\tTereszkiewicz and Millet have both been named Unifrance Talents to Watch at the previous two editions of the Unifrance Rendez-Vous in Paris.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatt Damon and Ben Affleck recently appeared on the “Joe Rogan Experience” to promote their new Netflix film “The Rip,” and the long-time friends and collaborators shared their thoughts on how the streamer is changing the way movies are made. \n\n\tDamon pointed out that because viewers give a “very different level of attention” to a movie at home versus in a theater, Netflix wants to push the action set pieces toward the front of the runtime. He also said there are behind-the-scenes discussions about reiterating “the plot three or four times in the dialogue” to account for people being on their phones.\n\t\n\n\t“The standard way to make an action movie that we learned was, you usually have three set pieces. One in the first act, one in the second, one in the third,” Damon explained. “You spend most of your money on that one in the third act. That’s your finale. And now they’re like, ‘Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay. And it wouldn’t be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they’re watching.’”\n\n\n\tAffleck then cut in, adding that the streamer formula for successful content isn’t the only way. He used Netflix’s recent limited series hit “Adolescence” as a shining example.\n\n\t“But then you look at ‘Adolescence,’ and it didn’t do any of that shit,” Affleck said. “And it’s fucking great. And it’s dark too. It’s tragic and intense. [It’s about] this guy who finds out his kid is accused of murder. There are long shots of the back of their heads. They get in the car, nobody says anything.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile Damon thought shows like “Adolescence” are “the exception,” Affleck said he felt the show “demonstrates you don’t have to do” the Netflix tricks to please audiences.\n\n\tWatch the entire “Joe Rogan Experience” episode with Damon and Affleck here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Wizarding World is taking on “Heated Rivalry.”\n\n\tOn this week’s “SNL,” host Finn Wolfhard starred as Harry Potter in a sketch mocking the new HBO series adaptation of the fantasy novels. But in this version, thanks to being “hastily rewritten after the success of a certain other HBO show,” Harry quickly becomes enamored with Ron (Ben Marshall) and the show is renamed “Heated Wizardry.” It’s also said to be “the first series written entirely by girls who wear tails.”\n\t\n\n\tOf course, wand and broom puns and innuendo arrive quickly, as “the only thing hotter than hockey is Quidditch.” After seeing Harry and Ron’s meet cute, Harry is seen flying away from Ron on the Quidditch pitch without any bottoms and more sexy Hogwarts shenanigans take place.\n\n\n\tIn the segment, James Austin Johnson plays Severus Snape, Jason Momoa stops by to play Hagrid, Ashley Padilla plays Professor McGonagall and Kenan Thompson takes on Alastor Moody. \n",

    "body": "\n\tFlanked by his closest collaborators, director Cédric Klapisch collected this year’s French Cinema Award at a warm, familial ceremony at France’s Ministry of Culture on Jan. 15.\n\n\tJoined by his longtime screenwriter Santiago Amigorena and his emblematic actor Zinedine Soualem — key creative partners for more than three decades — along with the cast of his latest feature, “Colors of Time,” Klapisch was celebrated for a career that has consistently looked beyond national borders.\n\t\n\n\tLaunched by Unifrance in 2016, the French Cinema Award honors a figure whose work has helped carry Gallic cinema worldwide. Past recipients include Isabelle Huppert, Juliette Binoche, Virginie Efira, and filmmakers Olivier Assayas, Rebecca Zlotowski, and Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano. Klapisch, however, doesn’t just promote his films abroad: his work is defined by movement and global exchange, crystallized in the critically and commercially adored “Spanish Apartment” series, which across three features and an Amazon series follows an extended clan across three continents.\n\n\n\tAccepting the prize, Klapisch pointed to travel as a central artistic catalyst, noting that a promotional tour for 2002’s “Pot Luck” — the first in the series — directly inspired its follow-up, “Russian Dolls.”\n\n\t“Some journeys give birth to new films,” he said. “Travel is a fundamental part of my cinema. That’s the reason I made ‘Pot Luck’ — and why I’m standing here today.”\n\n\tRaised in Paris, Klapisch launched his career with an MFA at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, an experience he said left a lasting mark.\n\t\n\n\t“I began my adult life in the U.S., and today I honestly wonder whether young French people still feel the same pull to go there,” he added. “It’s less obvious now. Meanwhile, something new is happening: major American actors and directors are coming to France. That simply didn’t exist before. There’s been a reversal. Movement no longer flows in the same direction.” \n\n\tReflecting on what he called “a strange, pivotal moment” for the film business, Klapisch turned his focus closer to home. “There’s constant talk about box office numbers, admissions, and international circulation — and this is even more pronounced abroad,” he said. “But France is truly unique because of its system, and the CNC in particular. I will always defend the CNC. It must continue to exist. It supports cinematic creation. I’ve often said the CNC is a protected space where creation can happen, and I believe deeply in that model.”\n\n\tFittingly, CNC president Gaëtan Bruel was on hand to hear the praise, joining French Culture Minister Rachida Dati, Unifrance president Gilles Pélisson, and executive director Daniela Elstner in saluting Klapisch at this year’s Unifrance Rendez-Vous in Paris.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDaniela Elstner, Cedric Klapisch, Rachida Dati, Gilles Pélisson \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChloé Leclercq / Unifrance\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFinn Wolfhard‘s “SNL” monologue was crashed by two of his best-known co-stars.\n\n\tCaleb McLaughlin and Gaten Matarazzo, who starred on “Stranger Things” with Wolfhard, joined the actor in his monologue as he spoke about growing up onscreen and how he’s now an adult. \n\n\t“My voice changed on camera, my first kiss was on camera, and the first time I learned what a woman looks like down there was on there as well,” before cutting to a howling Demogorgon.\n\t\n\n\tUnfortunately, he doesn’t like the taste of alcohol, spitting up his first drink all over Marcello Hernández.\n\n\n\tThen the boys come out and talk about how strange it has been growing up onscreen, and all of the things people would say about them on Reddit. But at the end they joked that they are now ready to star in…”adult films.”\n\n\tLater in the episode, a sketch considered what might happen with some “Stranger Things” spinoffs, include “Mike in Manhattan,” a “Sex and the City”-esque series starring Wolfhard, McLaughlin and Matarazzo. The sketch also took a shot at Will’s lengthy-coming out scene, saying that it’s still going on. It also included “The Wheeler Report” news show from Nancy, and a spinoff with Steve Harrington as an inner-city teacher.\n\n\tThe sketch also included a scene from the rumored ninth episode that started an internet conspiracy theory.\n\n\tWatch Wolfhard’s monologue below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMark Jones, a veteran animation writer and the director of B-horror comedy classics like “Leprechaun” and “Rumpelstiltskin,” died on Jan. 16 in Los Angeles after a brief stay at West Hills Hospital. He was 72.\n\n\tGeorge Saadi, a friend and collaborator of Jones’, confirmed his death to Variety. His 73rd birthday was Saturday, Jan. 17, and he missed the date by only a few hours.\n\n\n\tJones was best known for writing and directing the 1992 cult classic “Leprechaun,” starring Jennifer Aniston and Warwick Davis. The film spawned seven sequels. “Leprechaun Returns,” the most recent installment, was released in 2018. His other notable credits include 1995’s “Rumpelstiltskin,” a feature-length retelling of the classic fairytale, and 1997’s “NightMan,” a made-for-TV movie about a musician who is struck by lightning and gains the power to hear the frequency of evil.\n\t\n\n\tJones got his start working on Saturday morning cartoons. He sold his first script to Filmation Studios before landing at DePatie Freleng, where he wrote “Mister Magoo” and “Pink Panther.” He then moved to legendary animation house Hanna-Barbera, where he wrote and story edited for shows like “Super Friends” and several “Scooby Doo” projects.\n\n\n\tSome of his other notable animation writing credits include “Fangface,” “Yogi’s Space Race,” “Plastic Man,” “Heathcliff” and “Mister T.”\n\n\tJones also worked on several live-action series through the ‘80s and early ‘90s. These included “The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo,” “Riptide,” “The A-Team,” “The Fall Guy” and “Superboy.” His most recent feature directing credits include 2013’s “Scorned,” 2008’s “Triloquist” and 2004’s “Quiet Kill.”\n\t\n\n\tA private memorial service for Jones is planned for the near future.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s no spoiler that Cillian Murphy makes his return to the hit zombie franchise that made his name more than two decades on in “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple.” Danny Boyle, who gave the actor his big screen break in “28 Days Later,” revealed the info after the actor notably failed to show up in last year’s sequel “28 Years Later” (it turned out that, no, he wasn’t the emaciated zombie seen rising from a field).\n\n\tBut those who don’t want to know how and when he appears in Nia DaCosta‘s blood-soaked sequel to the sequel — in cinemas with Sony Pictures — may want to stop reading now. \n\t\n\n\tMurphy does indeed return in “The Bone Temple,” reprising his role as Jim, the bicycle courier who famously woke up from a coma to find a London deserted and devastated by the Rage virus back in 2001. But it’s not until right at the very end of the new film — and in a distinctly quiet scene that calms the tone down dramatically from the wildly unhinged mayhem seen over the previous 90 minutes. For director Nia DaCosta, working from Alex Garland’s script, that was entirely the point of what she hoped to achieve. \n\n\n\t“Because it’s not a big ‘return of the superhero’ franchise moment,” she explains to Variety. “It’s the return of the bike messenger.”\n\n\tAfter reaching the climax of a prolonged and escalating period of madness with Ralph Fiennes’ Dr Kelson, Jack O’Connell’s Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal and Chi Lewis-Parry’s Alpha zombie Samson, the film makes a sudden shift to a whole new setting, showing Murphy’s Jim living in relative isolated safety, quite possibly in the same remote cottage he was left at the end of “28 Days Later.” A quarter century on and he now has a daughter (who he’s seen helping prepare for a history exam). \n\t\n\n\t“The fact that Alex wrote him teaching his daughter history and that’s how he wanted to introduce him back into the story, I was like, ok, so that’s how we shoot it,” DaCosta says. “So it’s grounded. It’s not this big, bombastic moment. And I think it’s powerful enough just to see him.” \n\n\tIt was certainly powerful enough to have audiences erupt into cheers in early screenings. \n\n\tAs it happens, audiences may have recognized Murphy’s voice much earlier. As DaCosta was figuring out the title sequence of “The Bone Temple” and how to introduce the name of the new film on screen, she decided that what she needed to do was deploy a scene from the past. “So we did it with sound, and the sound you hear is Cillian’s from the first film saying ‘Hello’,” she says. “So he actually appears in the film very early on.”\n\n\tFans of the franchise may also note a hat tip to it’s origins in the big reveal with Murphy later on, with DaCosta using the original eerie track “In a Heartbeat,” composed by John Murphy for “28 Days Later.”\n\n\t“That was the biggest franchise-y thing we did,” she says. \n\n\tMuch like the final scene in “28 Years Later” that introduced O’Conell’s Crystal, the last act in “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” with Murphy heavily suggests that there’s more to come. Thankfully, Sony has already greenlit a follow-up, with Garland back on writing duties.\n\n\tDaCosta claims it was “so much fun” making the film (and also admits it was “100%” a reaction to having made a major MCU tentpole in “The Marvels” and then an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s “Hedda”). But sadly it’s largely irrelevant whether or not she’d want to come back to direct the next one. \n\n\tAs she notes: “Danny called dibs.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” mocked President Donald Trump’s egomania around the Nobel Peace Prize as well as the U.S. military action in Venezuela and Kristi Noem’s incredibly callous response to the ICE shooting in Minneapolis in the cold open for the show’s first episode of 2026.\n\n\tThere was no shortage of political material to catch up on, and “SNL” made the most of it in a faux Trump news conference and cabinet meeting. Colin Jost played an unhinged Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Jeremy Culhane played Vice President JD Vance, who whined about his recent trip to Greenland in a nod to Trump’s real-life outrageous threats that the U.S. should take over the Danish territory.\n\t\n\n\t“I came here to do two things,” Culhane’s Vance said. “Kick bubble gum and chew ass. And I’m all out of bubble gum.”\n\n\n\tJames Austin Johnson’s Trump opened the segment at a podium with the Presidential seal talking about the Christmas holiday. \n\n\t“I got what I wanted — my very own someone else’s Nobel Prize,” Johnson’s Trump said, a nod to the bizarre development in which Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado presented her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump, in a bid to curry favor with him amid the upheaval in her home country . \n\n\t“In my stocking I got Maduro — Nicolás Maduro. We did a reverse-Santa on him. We came down the chimney with a bag and took him away,” Johnson’s Trump said, referring to the U.S.’s highly criticized move to capture the Venezuelan strongman who is now in jail in New York facing drug trafficking charges.\n\n\tJohnson’s Trump made a reference to “Frankenstein” director Guillermo del Toro by mentioning “my little cabinet of curiousities,” referring to his cabinet members as “various monsters and nightmares from the twisted mind of Guillermo del Trump.”\n\t\n\n\n\tFor Homeland Security Secretary Noem, Ashley Padilla came out in the cowboy hat similar to the one the real-life Noem wore as she sought to defend the shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by ICE agents on Jan. 7. “I want to give a quick shout out to my hair and makeup team who absolutely hate me,” Padilla’s Noem said.\n\n\tAs for the horrendous situation in Minneapolis, Padilla’s Noem asked “Have we been perfect? Yes.” Then she gave a recruitment pitch for ICE. “Is your neck wider than your head? Are you currently wearing a Punisher T-shirt? Have you ever punched a hole in the wall because your son took a dance class? Grab a gun and saddle up, big boy.” \n\n\tJost then made a noisy entrance as Hegseth, who chugged an energy drink from an oversized mug and bragging about the military operation executed in Venezuela on Jan. 1. “We went into Venezuela — we tea-bagged their country,” Jost’s Hegseth said. \n\n\t“We’re rocking out with our C’s out all over the world,” Hegseth said while using a small weight in a sexually suggestive manner. He indicated that Iran was next in line to face the force of the U.S. force, in reference to the political protests that have left hundreds of people dead in the Middle Eastern country. “You don’t dare kill your protestors — that’s our thing,” Jost’s Hegseth warned. “We’re going to F you right back.” \n\n\tJohnson’s Trump came back to the podium to finish out the news conference. “Even I know you’re doing that wrong,” he said, pointing to Jost’s over-amped Hegseth. “The midterms are canceled,” he declared before going into the classic “Live from New York, it’s ‘Saturday Night” transition into the credits.\n\n\t In the final minutes of the show, before the cast gathered on stage for the traditional closing, the show paid tribute to Bob Weir, the founding member of the Grateful Dead, who died Jan. 10 at age 78. The legendary jam band also fronted by the late Jerry Garcia made two appearances on “SNL,” first in 1978 and then two years later.\n\n\t(Pictured: James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump and Colin Jost as Pete Hegseth in the cold open for the Jan. 17 episode of “Saturday Night Live.”)\n",

    "body": "\n\tJamie-Lynn Sigler got emotional during a recent interview with ABC (via Entertainment Weekly) in which she discussed her recent guest spot on “Grey’s Anatomy” as a doctor with multiple sclerosis. She said the role was extremely personal, given that she was diagnosed with the condition 25 years ago and felt she needed to “keep it a secret” out of fear of losing work.\n\n\tShe told ABC, “To think back 25 years ago — when I was diagnosed and having to keep it a secret, thinking that if anybody knew that I had MS, that meant that I would never work again — and to now be in a position where my having MS inspired a role in a storyline on a show like ‘Grey’s Anatomy,’ I never would have believed you.”\n\t\n\n\tSigler, who was working on the legendary HBO drama “The Sopranos” at the time, was 20 years old when she was diagnosed with MS. She didn’t go public with the news until 2017, when she sat down with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\n\tOn Jan. 15, Sigler appeared on “Grey’s Anatomy” as Dr. Laura Kaplan, a urologist with MS. In her episode, she gives Dr. Richard Webber, played by James Pickens Jr., advice on how to best treat his prostate cancer.\n\n\tSigler said her goal with the part was to “show someone in their power” and give an authentic depiction of someone living and thriving with MS.\n\n\t“My very first take, where I do say the words that ‘I have MS,’ was very emotional for me,” she said.\n",

    "description": "\n\tCBS News got more than it bargained for when it arranged for an interview earlier this week between President Donald Trump and anchor Tony Dokoupil ",
    "body": "\n\tCBS News got more than it bargained for when it arranged for an interview earlier this week between President Donald Trump and anchor Tony Dokoupil on his still-nascent tenure on “CBS Evening News.”\n\n\tAccording to a report published Saturday by The New York Times, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told producers and the anchor that Trump did not want the exchange edited. “He said, ‘Make sure you don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,’ Leavitt told Dokoupil and his executive producer, Kim Harvey. “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.'”\n\t\n\n\tSuch behavior is not unexpected when it comes to the Trump administration. Trump won a $16 million settlement from CBS News’ parent company, Paramount, after he he sued over the way a “60 Minutes” interview with former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris was edited in 2024. Legal experts felt Trump’s suit lacked merit, but Paramount was in a squeeze — it needed U.S. regulatory approval to sell itself to its new owner, now called Paramount Skydance. Trump has also won legal fees from Walt Disney Co., and worked to entangle other media outlets in legal skirmishes, including The Wall Street Journal and the BBC. Paramount’s decision led in part to the exit of two senior CBS News executives with oversight of “60 Minutes” and other operations.\n\n\n\tIn a statement Saturday, CBS News said Leavitt’s demands were not a factor in its decision to present Doukopil’s 13-minute long interview with Trump, at a Ford plant in Michigan, in full: “The moment we booked this interview we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety.”\n\t\n\n\tEven so, CBS News has caved to a similar demand in the past, a move that can be seen to sacrifice its journalistic independence. In September, CBS News agreed to stop editing taped interviews with newsmakers who appear on its Sunday public-affairs program “Face the Nation” following complaints from the Trump administration over an appearance on the show by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. She made made a number of false or unproven statements during her intervifew about Kilmar Abergo Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was deported despite his having protected legal status in the United States. CBS News offered just a portion of the overall interview with Noem and made the full exchange available online.\n\n\tThe Trump threat comes even as CBS News has worked to give administration officials more time on its programs. Under recently installed editor in chief Bari Weiss, both “CBS Evening News” and “60 Minutes” have found more room for talks with officials including U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, for example, who spoke with Doukopil for three segments of a weekend broadcast following a U.S. military incursion on Venezuela. “60 Minutes” offered a report in October that had U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son in law, Jared Kushner, offer insight into an effort to end recent conflicts in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\tThe threat from the White House was issued as Paramount Skydance is jockeying to acquire the media assets of Warner Bros. Discovery, even though that company has already brokered a deal to sell its streaming and studio operations to Netflix. Such a pact will also require regulatory approval.\n",

While it certainly looks like a dog, the fluff ball could be some other type of animal, a stuffed toy, or ... taxidermy.\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n    \n          Also, what's its connection to Epstein? There must be one because it's in the files.\n      \n    \n          The unsatisfying answer is nobody seems to know ... yet. We spoke to Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, who's on the House Oversight Committee ... which, last month, successfully subpoena'd Epstein's estate to release a separate batch of documents.\n      \n    \n          He says he's never been given any context for the furry photo, or any other Epstein images that have come to light. Subramanyam tells us it looks like a dog, but he's unsure if it's dead or sleeping on the trash bag.\n      \n    \n          Now, there is this one clue -- a 2003 Vanity Fair article describes a \"stuffed black poodle\" Epstein had on top of a grand piano in his NYC townhouse.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          We did find a photo resembling that pooch in the files -- but it doesn't seem to be the same dog in the mystery pic.\n      \n    \n          So, was el creepo a serial taxidermist? Let us know what you think in the poll.\n      \n      ",

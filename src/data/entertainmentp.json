    "body": "\n\tRomantic comedy “Love Go Go Go!” debuted atop the China box office for the Feb. 13–15 weekend, taking RMB36.9 million ($5.2 million), according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tDirected by Philip Yung and starring Qin Xiaoxian and Wang Yinglu, the film follows the friction-filled romance between a compulsive spender and a cautious saver whose opposing financial philosophies spark a constant push-and-pull that eventually softens into a complex emotional connection.\n\t\n\n\tThe Spark Pictures release led a modest marketplace still in a holding pattern ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday period, with holdovers continuing to dominate the remainder of the chart.\n\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” moved to second place with $4.5 million, pushing its cumulative China gross to $642.4 million.\n\n\tCrime thriller “The Fire Raven” ranked third on $3.8 million, lifting its total to $71.8 million. The Sam Quah-directed film stars Peng Yuchang, Alan Aruna and Chang Ning and centers on a long-buried student murder case that resurfaces amid corruption and revenge.\n\n\tIn fourth, “Busted Water Pipes” added $2.3 million for an $18.3 million cumulative total. The Taopiaopiao release centers on an underperforming local police unit that fabricates minor cases to pad its record, only to uncover a genuine criminal conspiracy after a burst water main exposes a gang of tomb raiders posing as repair workers.\n\n\tRounding out the top five, a reissue of Damien Chazelle’s “La La Land” earned $2.3 million, taking its China total to $42.1 million.\n\n\tOverall weekend grosses reached $25.2 million, with 2026 year-to-date revenue standing at $359 million, down 86.8% from the same period in 2025. The Lunar New Year Holidays kick off Feb. 17 with the Chinese industry hoping it will bring succor to the parched box office. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDark Sky Films has acquired all North American distribution rights to “Blood Shine,” the latest feature from husband-and-wife filmmaking duo Emily Bennett and Justin Brooks. Described as a “striking blend of arthouse sensibility and visceral folk horror,” the film will be released later this year following a successful festival run that included the Sitges Film Festival, the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival and others.\n\n\tDark Sky’s sales division, MPI Media Group, is representing additional international territories at this year’s European Film Market in Berlin.\n\t\n\n\t“Blood Shine” stars Bennett (“Shelby Oaks”) as Clara, a devout zealot who worships the light through solitary, sacred rituals in upstate New York. David Call (“Insidious: The Red Door”) plays Brighton West, a troubled horror filmmaker who retreats upstate to complete his screenplay, only to encounter Clara and become entangled in her increasingly extreme spiritual practices. Convinced that her sadistic ceremonies will transform him into a god, Clara draws Brighton into a hallucinatory descent into faith, flesh, and the sublime. The cast also includes Brendan Sexton III (“Russian Doll”), Larry Fessenden (“MaXXXine”), and Toby Poser (“Hellbender”).\n\n\n\tThe distribution agreement was negotiated by Greg Newman, executive vice president of Dark Sky Films, and Aaron B. Koontz of Paper Street Pictures.\n\n\t“Blood Shine is a film that balances an arthouse sensibility with extremely visceral horror, and Dark Sky Films immediately understood that,” said Bennett and Brooks. “We’re incredibly excited to partner with them to unleash this bloody folk horror film to worldwide audiences.”\n\t\n\n\tBrooks served as director of photography on the film, with Brian Spears (“Smile 2,” “American Horror Story”) providing the film’s visceral gore effects. Producers include Alexander Schepsman, Garrett Fennelly and Zeus Kontoyannis via Zeus Pictures, and Aaron B. Koontz via Paper Street Pictures. Ashleigh Snead and Cameron Burns serve as co-producers via Paper Street. Executive producers are Michael McFadden, G. Riley Mills and Matt Sullivan. Bennett is represented by Nick McCabe of Anonymous Content.\n\n\t“We are thrilled to bring Blood Shine to North American audiences,” added Greg Newman, executive vice president of Dark Sky Films. “Emily Bennett and Justin Brooks have created a daring and visually arresting film that expands the boundaries of folk horror and really delivers.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Taste of Salt,” a narrative feature from Deepak Rauniyar inspired by the life of renowned Nepali chef Santosh Shah, has debuted at the 2026 Berlinale Co-Production Market.\n\n\tRauniyar’s 2016 feature “White Sun” won the Interfilm Award at Venice Film Festival, while his most recent film, “Pooja, Sir,” premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival.\n\n\tThe culinary coming-of-age story traces a journey from childhood hunger in Nepal’s Madhes region to the high-stakes world of global fine dining in London. Set across Nepal, India and the U.K., the film explores themes of migration, caste and exile through the universal language of food.\n\t\n\n\tThe project brings together two production houses: Kathmandu and Boston-based Aadi Films, co-founded by director Rauniyar and producer Asha Magrati, and U.K.-based Film and Music Entertainment, led by veteran producer Sam Taylor.\n\n\n\tTaylor’s credits include some 75 features, including the Oscar-nominated “Before the Rain.” “Deepak has a cinematic voice that sings with clarity,” Taylor said. “‘The Taste of Salt’ will feature an A-list star and is the next step in his creative journey. He remains true to the story as the film is based on real life both that of Chef Santosh, and his own.”\n\n\tChef Shah, whose rise to fame on “MasterChef: The Professionals” captivated global audiences, sees the selection as a victory for Nepali heritage.\n\n\t“I never imagined that my personal journey from Nepal to the world would become a film embraced by the international festival circuit even before its completion,” Shah said. “It is a powerful reminder that authentic stories, rooted in culture, can resonate globally. This film is not only my biography, it is a tribute to Nepal’s culinary heritage and the resilience behind it. I was already proud that my story is being taught in school curriculums in Nepal, but this early recognition at a top global festival is the next step. My mother will be proud.”\n\t\n\n\tRauniyar emphasized the timeliness of the story. “At a time when migration and identity are under attack worldwide, I feel an urgency to tell this story,” the director said. “‘The Taste of Salt’ is about denied citizenship, home and the everyday cost of exclusion.”\n\n\tThe film will follow Ram, a 30-year-old Nepal-born chef living in London, who lands an audition for “MasterChef.” Raised in the disenfranchised Madhesi community and sent to India alone at age 7, Ram navigates identity and belonging while climbing the culinary ranks. The story explores his relationship with Rita, a single mother from a more privileged background, and his ultimate journey back to Nepal.\n\n\tFilm and Music Entertainment was founded by Taylor in 2000 and has produced over 75 features with over 120 European production companies, winning multiple awards at Venice, Berlin, Sundance and Cannes.\n\n\tProduction is slated to begin in spring 2027. The feature will be shot in English and Nepalese.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEven Pope Francis has a hardback copy of his graphic novel. He has a loving relationship with his glamorous wife, who travels the world. As a globally renown cartoonist, he can afford a carer for his parents. \n\n\tOn face value, Ariel has it all. In fact, the protagonist of Daniel Burman’s “So Far, So Good,” Ariel has a bit too much: Five children from three marriages, two cats and two ageing parents.   \n\n\n\t“Has anybody seen my charger?” Ariel asks at breakfast in early Episode 1 of “So Far, So Good,” the latest from Oficina Burman, part of The Mediapro Studio which market premieres at this week’s Berlinale Series Market.\n\t\n\n\t“Has anybody seen my small padlock?” Ariel (Benjamin Vicuña) also enquires.  Though all his family is home, nobody answers. Emerging from his bedroom, he advances down a corridor towards the door, dodging children while a son makes an infernal racket playing the piano, the camera following crazily, as if shooting a scene in a war zone.  \n\n\tTurning 50, at the gym for the first time in 10 years to get into shape to accept an Vatican award for his work, Ariel starts lifting weights and has a hernia. The muscles on his left side, his doctor tells him not very encouragingly, looks like “Kobe meat about to disintegrate.”\n\n\tLaunching Oficina Burman in 2014, Burman has created notable series, such a “Iosi, the Regretful Spy,” an infiltrator thriller reckoned the best TV work at Berlin in 2022. \n\n\tOver the course of 30 years, Burman, a leading light of the New Argentine Cinema, has built a career teasing with upbeat humor the neuroses, complications and ironies of life. Created by Burman, and co-directed with Daniel Hendler who won a Berlin best actor Silver Bear for his performance in Burman’s “Lost Embrace,” “So Far, So Good” is no exception. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s also one of Burman’s most autobiographical works, he confesses. Fittingly and adding a sense of authenticity to “So Far, So Good” Burman is 10 minutes late for an interview with Variety because he’s at a doctor’s having a dodgy knee tended in an oxygen chamber before he travels to Berlin to present “So Far, So Good,” one of 20 titles at Berlinale Series Market Selects.  \n\n\tAriel’s hernia, his reduced mobility, weighs in as part of a larger picture, his lack of empowerment in mid-age crisis.\n\n\t“It is made flesh,” says Burman. But what weighs on Ariel is more “emotional” than “physical,” he goes on to say. \n\n\t“Over the last years, there’s been a very necessary movement of films and series about women with women characters. That’s very important. It’s as if this has happened, however, in detriment of portraits of male reality when in reality the two realities co-exist,” Burman reflects.\n\n\tSold by The Mediapro Studio Distribution, “So Far, So Good” has a male protagonist whose conflict, Burman says, is “not violence nor with femininity but more existential, the moment when he begins to be father of his parents, as if he’s going to stop being a son, and nobody is going to look after him, and that doesn’t make sense.”\n\n\tAriel is, however, in constant demand. When a Papal prelate urges him to write his acceptance speech over the upcoming weekend, Ariel explains to him that his weekends are not his own: “My son’s performing at a comedy show, the daughter I have to drive everywhere, the other son plays the piano all day, I have two babies, plus two cats, and surely one of my wife’s friends will host a barbecue an hour from home. And I was thinking of visiting my folks, checking that they’re still alive.”\n\n\tYet, the series bears no sense of victimization, Burman insists. Ariel is fruit of his own decisions and circumstances. “It was unimaginable just 10 years ago to make a series whose male protagonist needs attention. Now it’s a interesting take: the invisibility of a man of a certain age who needs affection and attention.”\n\n\tBurman calls “So Far, So Good” an “andropause comedy told with a lot of humor and emotion.”  \n\n\tThat emotion looks to lift off in later episodes. For Burman, “There’s an beautiful anecdote told in the series about groups of butterflies which are called kaleidoscopes, because it’s an optical illusion that they’re together, they’re not a family, just moving closely together. Many times families are an optical illusion as well.”  \n\t\n\n\t“Ariel realizes he’ll have to bear the weight of his parents’ decline and he can’t ask anybody else to do that. A butterfly leaves behind a cocoon and then flies. One changes every day, leaving things behind. Children leave and leave a toy. All these things left behind along one’s life journey is not a source of conflict but identity. We’re what’s left behind when there’s nothing left to share out or lose and can reconcile ourselves with the idea that we’re a left-behind,” Burman concludes.\n\n\t“So Far, So Good” is produced by Argentina’s Oficina Burman and Uruguay H.Q.-ed Cimarrón. Both The Mediapro Studio companies, they produce the six-part series for Flow, the Argentine cable TV, internet and SVOD operator. Flow has acquired distribution rights for Latin America and The Mediapro Studio Distribution for the rest of the world.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVienna-based ORF-Enterprise is bringing Portuguese mystery drama “Jones” to Berlin for its international market debut at the EFM Series Market, pitching the six-part series as a premium, export-facing whodunit with a supernatural hook.\n\n\tProduced by Caracol Studios for Portuguese pubcaster RTP, “Jones” is created and directed by Bruno Gascon (“Carga”) and toplined by British actor Amanda Abbington (“Sherlock,” “Mr. Selfridge”) alongside a Portuguese-led ensemble.\n\t\n\n\tThe story opens at a lavish Sintra estate, where a dysfunctional family gathers to celebrate an engagement, only for the night to end in murder and a house full of suspects. \n\n\n\tInspector Oliver Jones, played by José Pimentão (Netflix’s “1899”), takes the case with an unsettling advantage: he can communicate with the dead. \n\n\tThat gift locks him into an unlikely partnership with the victim herself, Júlia (Laura Dutra, “Vermelho Sangue”), whose sharp tongue and post-mortem presence keeps the investigation off-balance as competing versions of the truth surface.\n\n\tShot across Sintra and Vila Nova de Foz Côa, “Jones” fuses Agatha Christie-style puzzle-box mechanics with dark humor and family-drama pressure. \n\n\tAbbington plays Eve, a sharp-witted, slightly off-kilter actress whose obsession with the case pulls her into the investigative orbit and complicates the group dynamic. \n\n\tThe cast also includes Rafael Morais (“Rabo de Peixe”), Ivo Canelas (“Glória”), Rui Morisson (“Ordem Moral”), Raquel Rocha Vieira (“Rabo de Peixe”) and Paula de Magalhães (“Irreversível”). Cinematography is by Hugo Azevedo (“Rabo de Peixe”).\n\t\n\n\t“Jones” gets a Berlin Series Market platform on Monday, Feb. 16, with two episodes screening at CinemaxX 1, followed by a Q&A with Gascon and leads Abbington and Morais. \n\n\tAhead of the event, Armin Luttenberger, head of content sales international at ORF-Enterprise, answered a Variety Q&A on how ORF is positioning the series in the current market.\n\n\tHave you already started international sales on the series? In which territories and with which buyers have you already reached deals?\n\n\tYes, we’ve started international sales and have been actively taking the series out to the market. I can’t name buyers or territories publicly while negotiations are ongoing and subject to confidentiality, but momentum is strong and conversations are well advanced in several key markets.\n\n\tWhat specific gap in ORF-Enterprise’s drama catalog does “Jones” fill?\n\n\tFor ORF-Enterprise, it’s a premium, Portuguese-origin title with a distinctly international feel — the kind of genre-driven drama that travels easily while still feeling rooted and specific. It broadens our slate with a high-concept mystery engine and a strong “event series” positioning and establishes a truly European collaboration with Portuguese pubcaster RTP and the production powerhouse Caracol Studios. The best-selling ORF Original drama movies and series surely form the perfect foundation for the extension of our portfolio with “Jones.” We expect our entire fiction catalog to benefit equally from this fresh color adding to our international sales offering.\n\n\tHow are you pitching the series in the market — crime, family drama, supernatural mystery…?\n\n\tWe pitch it as a premium murder mystery/investigation thriller with a supernatural edge — grounded enough for crime buyers, elevated enough to stand out in a crowded field. The supernatural element isn’t decorative; it’s part of the storytelling mechanism and the hook.\n\n\tWhich buyer profile is most immediately receptive? Could you tell why?\n\n\tThe most immediately receptive buyers are those actively programming premium scripted genres: streamers, premium pay platforms, and ambitious broadcasters with a clear appetite for event crime. They respond because the series has a sharp logline, a strong binge pull, and clear marketing handles.\n\t\n\n\tWhat windowing model are you aiming for to maximize price and visibility?\n\n\tOur priority is to protect premium value and visibility in each territory with the right first-window partner — ideally with meaningful exclusivity where it strengthens positioning. From there, we build a smart secondary window strategy to extend reach and longevity without diluting the brand of the title.\n\n\tWhich territories are most responsive right now to Portuguese-origin premium drama, and what’s driving that demand?\n\n\tWe’re seeing the strongest responsiveness in markets that are already comfortable with premium European drama beyond the usual “big languages,” and where buyers are actively searching for fresh origin stories. The demand is being driven by audiences’ appetite for distinctive worlds paired with universal genre engines — and by platforms wanting curated, high-quality differentiation.\n\n\tThe series is in both Portuguese and English. In current negotiations, is multilingualism raising the ceiling or creating friction?\n\n\tMultilingualism is mostly a ceiling-raiser: it expands positioning options and widens the buyer pool. Practically, we tailor deliverables to market realities — leaning into subs-first where authenticity is a selling point and ensuring clean dubbing pathways where dubbing is the default — without compromising tone or pace.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Jones’\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFilm Heritage Foundation‘s newly restored version of Pradip Krishen and Arundhati Roy‘s cult film “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones” (1989) is making its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival, marking a remarkable second life for a film that virtually disappeared after a single television screening.\n\n\tThe restoration represents a significant milestone for Film Heritage Foundation, marking the first time one of its projects has been selected for Berlinale Classics. Foundation director Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, who is also serving on the festival’s international jury headed by Wim Wenders, will present the 4K restoration alongside director Pradip Krishen.\n\t\n\n\tBooker Prize-winning author Roy (“The God of Small Things”), who wrote the screenplay and starred in the Indian National Film Award-winning campus comedy, withdrew from the festival over the jury’s refusal to comment on Gaza. When asked about Roy’s withdrawal, Dungarpur offered no comment.\n\n\n\tThe 18-month restoration process began after Krishen donated his film materials to Film Heritage Foundation in 2024, including a 35mm release print, digital audiotapes, and the original shooting and dialogue scripts.\n\n\tSet in a Delhi architecture school during the mid-1970s, “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones” depicts student life through a lens rarely seen in Indian cinema at the time – English-speaking, westernized youth communicating in their own distinctive dialect. After airing once on Indian state broadcaster Doordarshan in 1989, the film vanished from circulation, becoming a cult favorite among those who tracked down degraded VHS copies or YouTube uploads.\n\t\n\n\tThe title character, Anand Grover – nicknamed “Annie” – is a perpetually failing fifth-year architecture student who keeps chickens in his dorm room. The Delhi University slang “gives it those ones” roughly translates to “does his usual thing,” which in Annie’s case means well-intentioned blundering and impractical idealism. His circle of friends includes Radha (played by Roy), a sharp-witted rebel, her boyfriend Arjun, a student called Mankind, and Kasozi from Uganda, who grinds his teeth while dreaming of dictator Idi Amin. The students’ antagonist is Prof. Y.D. Billimoria, whom they’ve dubbed Yamdoot, referring to the Hindu deity of death’s messenger.\n\n\tThe ensemble cast includes Roshan Seth, Arjun Raina, Rituraj, Isaac Thomas and Divya Seth. The film also marked the feature debut of superstar Shah Rukh Khan in a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance as Senior.\n\n\tShot with an intimate, documentary-like quality and featuring clever wordplay, the film depicts the friendships and youthful energy of students navigating academic life. Beneath the humor and hijinks lies a deeper current of anti-establishment sentiment and aspirations for social change.\n\n\tThe restoration proved technically challenging. Working from a 35mm release print blown up from the original 16mm negative, conservators discovered perforation damage, tears, scratches, shrinkage, mold and halos. Krishen helped Film Heritage Foundation access the 16mm original camera negative and sound negative from the National Film Archive of India. The elements required extensive manual repair before being sent to L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory in Bologna for digital restoration and color grading.\n\n\t“The color correction of the film was time-consuming as there was colour fading in several sections,” Dungarpur tells Variety. He worked closely with Krishen throughout the process to ensure color accuracy and preserve the film’s authentic grain, even traveling to Bologna to oversee the final grading frame by frame.\n\n\t“I was sharing work-in-progress scenes with Pradip to ensure that we got the colors right, to match the colors the way he had first shot the film and to ensure that we kept the authenticity of the grain of the film,” Dungarpur explains.\n\n\tSound restoration presented particular difficulties, with optical elements suffering from electrical noise, distortion, gaps and dropouts. Given the centrality of language and dialogue to the film’s appeal, Krishen prepared new subtitles for the restoration.\n\t\n\n\tDungarpur discovered the significance of the film while checking the print in Film Heritage Foundation’s conservation lab. “It struck me how contemporary the film seemed thirty seven years after it had its single outing on Doordarshan,” he says. “I felt that its slice-of-life approach to hostel life, its dialogue with its unique English patois, the uncertainties, pressures and ambiguity that faced young students, the camaraderie and small rebellions, would resonate with audiences even today. I felt that this cheeky, irreverent film should have its moment in the sun after decades of being lost in the shadows.”\n\n\tFor Dungarpur, who is also festival director of the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival, the Berlinale represents an opportunity to occupy multiple roles at one of cinema’s most prestigious events. “It is exciting to be at the Berlinale wearing so many hats, in a manner of speaking, as it gives me a truly holistic view of films from contemporary emerging talents to classics at one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world,” he says.\n\n\tDungarpur established Film Heritage Foundation in 2014 as India’s only non-governmental organization dedicated to film preservation. His documentary work includes “Celluloid Man” (2012), which won two National Film Awards, and the seven-hour “CzechMate – In Search of Jiri Menzel” (2020), voted among the British Film Institute’s top five films of the year. In 2025, he received the Vittorio Boarini Award for outstanding contributions to safeguarding cinema as cultural heritage.\n\n\tThe international jury headed by Wenders will select the Golden and Silver Bear awards from 20 films in competition at the festival, which runs through Feb. 22.\n\n\tThe restoration premiere will proceed with Krishen and Dungarpur presenting the film. “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones” features cinematography by Rajesh Joshi, editing by A. Thyagaraju and production design by Roy herself. The film was restored in 4K at L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory with funding provided by Film Heritage Foundation.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSeries from such creative heavyweights as Ken Burns, Ruben Ostlund and Fernando Meirelles galvanize the most powerful edition to date of the Berlinale Series Market, its TV forum and market.\n\n\tMore projects from top talent hitting the BSM include “The Granddaughter,” from İlker Çatak (“Yellow Letters”), whose “Yellow Letters” has emerged as an early Berlin 2026 Golden Bear frontrunner,; “Mugre Rosa,” from “Andor” helmer Alonso Ruizpalacios; “Hedgehogs in the Haze,” directed by Bosnia’s Danis Tanović an Oscar winner for “No Man’s Land”; “Seven Women,” from Angela Chaves, creator of Netflix hit “Desperate Lies”; and “Monika,” with “Sissi” co-head writer attached as a scribe.\n\t\n\n\tIn one sign of growth, the BSM, which runs through Feb. 18, gets a new prize, the Studio Babelsberg Production Excellence Award, given to an outstanding series in Berlinale Series Market Selects, a 20-title section of completed series screening at Berlin. \n\n\n\tThe BSM also adds Series Match, organized with Iberseries & Platino Industry, which hosts the producers of eight projects from Latin America, Spain and Germany, to pitch in one-to-one meetings at the Berlinale. \n\n\tMeanwhile, led by “Lord of the Flies,” from “Adolescence” co-creator Jack Thorne, and the Amazon-backed “The House of the Spirits,” a makeover of Isabel Allende’s novel, six series are featured in the Berlin Festival’s official lineup as Berlinale Special Series. \n\n\tBattling streaming service pull-back, still sagging post-pandemic box office, spiralling production costs and volatile public support systems, the world’s independent film producers still need to look to where potential industry growth could come from.\n\t\n\n\tBerlin 2026 has wisely highlighted three potential answers. launching a packed – and highly successful by reports – EFM Animation Days over Feb.12-14, plus a Feb 14’s genre-focused EFM Frontières Focus and now amped up Berlin Series Market. \n\n\t“Including series within the European Film Market and also within the official selection of the Berlinale isn’t just logical, it’s essential,” Tanja Meissner, director of Berlinale Pro, told Variety as the BSM line-up was announced.\n\n\tBerlinale Series Market titles also say much about state and priorities of the current independent TV industry, such as series’ need for timeliness and co-production.\n\n\tIn country terms, Spain has five BSM film titles across the festival BSM Selects and the BSM’s Co-Pro Series projects, set to be talked up at a marathon pitching session on Tuesday. No other country come near. “Creators are bringing forward shows with real narrative assurance—smart, incisive dialogue, rich character development, and a confident sense of pacing that hooks viewers from the outset,” BSM Co-ordinator Jana Daedelow tells Variety.\n\n\tThe film-to-TV talent diaspora continues, turbo-charging scripted series creativity. Set to pitch at Tuesday’s Co-Pro Series, “A Phone Rings in the Middle of the Night” marks the first fiction series from Östlund’s label Plattform Production, while “The Granddaughter” is Çatak’s first series of any type. \n\n\tAnd the series featured reflect audience demand as well as creator concern. About half of the BSM titles turn on true events, such as the dramatic 1971 jailbreak of 101 political prisoners in Uruguay in Meirelles’ “El Abuso.”  Co-Pro Series project “Angelmakers” turns on a true-life historical event where Romanian women arsenic poisoned their husbands returning from WWI.\n\n\tOr they tell stories of real people, such as “Monika,” the daughter of Leni Riefenstahl’s lover, who shot dead Che Guevara’s killer. Burns’ “The American Revolution” has a host of international actors bringing to life the key figures of the U.S. Revolution through their letters and other writings.\n\n\tMultiple BSM Selects series tackle hot-button issues: immigration (“Cold Haven”), climate change (“Phoenix”), life on the margins (“All Heroes Are Bastards”), soccer passions (“Raza Brava”), an underfunded health system (the buzzy “Emergency 53”) and the world’s water crisis (“The Struggle for Mother Water,” another buzz title).\n\t\n\n\tThe BSM bows just two weeks after Sweden’s Göteborg Festival’s TV Drama Vision event, where Ampere Analysis’ Guy Bisson noted in his keynote that “we are still at 75% peak TV,” with, globally, first-run TV commissions over 2024-25 still down 25% on the peak.\n\n\tTo score orders and sales, the industry is often playing to market demand — which is where crime really pays — but streaming services and broadcasters still need signature shows. Many producers at the BSM still harbor premium series ambition.  \n\n\t“‘Monika’ speaks directly to today’s demand for bold, high-end storytelling rooted in real events,” says producer Maria Elena Wood of the Series Match title.  \n\n\tWhen asked about a way forward for the TV industry, producers unanimously cite international co-production, which “remains a key opportunity, especially for projects with strong creative voices and clear international appeal,” says Arnar Benjamín Kristjánsson, at the Co-Pro Series with “Cold Haven.”\n\n\t“International markets and co-production forums such as Berlinale Co-Pro Series, Cinelink and Seriesly function less as deal-closing spaces and more as strategic platforms for long-term partnerships and financing alignment,” adds Lara Grozdanić, at the Co-Pro Series with “Hedgehogs in the Haze.”\n",

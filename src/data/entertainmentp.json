    "body": "\n\tSomeone at Amazon was clearly impressed by Kevin Hart and Kenan Thompson‘s Olympics commentary last year on Peacock.\n\n\tThe comedic duo, who offered a sports recap program on NBC’s Peacock during the 2024 Paris Olympics, aim to reprise their efforts with “Good Sports,” a 12-epsiode weekly sports talk show that will launch November 25th at 8 p.m. eastern on Amazon’s Prime Video. Amazon says the new episodes will stream each Tuesday evening across Amazon’s streaming service around the world.\n\t\n\n\tHart and Thompson will take on everything from professional sports like the NFL and NBA to neighborhood pick up games. They will also offer up exclusive interviews with athletes and actors, commentary on top stories and highlights, and original comedic field pieces. Some fans may have already seen the duo’s antics on Peacock, where they offered improvisational remarks on such things as a parade of boats traveling on the Seine during the 2024 Opening Ceremony. The U.S. boat, crammed with athletes and hangers-on, looked like “they were Coming to America,” Hart quipped. “Look at this. Give us your rich, your well-fed, your high jumpers.”\n\n\n\tAmazon launches the show amid a growing focus by many media companies on sports and sports-related programming. As more consumers move to streaming video, they are watching many of their favorite dramas, comedies and reality shows at times of their own choosing. Live sports, however, continue to lure the large audiences that advertisers crave. As more streaming outlets, including Prime Video, seek ad dollars to offset the costs of producing content for broadband audiences, they need programs that will appeal more strongly to Madison Avenue.\n\t\n\n\t“Kenan and I are bringing our own playbook for ‘Good Sports,’ and that’s a guaranteed win,” said Hart, who will also serve as an executive producer, in a statement. “This show gives us a chance to celebrate sports culture in a way that’s fresh, unfiltered, and full of laughs.”\n\n\tThe series will tape from a Los Angeles-area studio.\n\n\t“Doing the Olympics with Kevin was wild, but this? This is next-level,” said Thompson, who will also executive produce, in a separate statement. “’Good Sports’ is us just being ourselves — cracking jokes and probably pulling muscles we didn’t know we had. It’s gonna be a good time!”\n\n\t“Good Sports” is produced by Hart’s Hartbeat and Thompson’s Artists for Artists. The series is executive produced by Hart, Jeff Clanagan, Luke Kelly-Clyne, Meghan Hoffman, Mike Stein, and JC Del Barco II of Hartbeat; Kenan Thompson and Johnny Ryan Jr. of Artists for Artists; and David Nickoll and Colton Dunn. Michelle Mastellone serves as a producer.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJustin Baldoni‘s lawyers are making a bid to throw out Blake Lively‘s sexual harassment lawsuit before a federal trial set for next March.\n\n\tIn a motion for summary judgment filed Wednesday night, the attorneys argued that Lively’s allegations amount to little more than a “litany of minor grievances,” which should not be the basis for a harassment suit.\n\n\tLively has sued her “It Ends With Us” co-star and director, along with producers and publicists who worked on the film, claiming she faced retaliation for raising complaints about conduct on set. In particular, she alleges that she was the victim of a social media “smear campaign” in which Instagram commenters called her a “bully” and a “mean girl.”\n\t\n\n\tBaldoni’s lawyers argued that such activity does not rise to the level of an “adverse employment action,” which would be required to show retaliation.\n\n\tThey also argued that the only actions Baldoni and his allies took were defensive in nature, as they sought to protect their own reputations from Lively’s allegations.\n\n\t“Baldoni sought the advice of a crisis-management public relations firm, as any responsible person in his position would do,” his lawyers argued. “He did so for the benefit of both his professional reputation and the newly released film. He relied on media professionals to boost his image and assure that any coverage would be balanced and accurate. None of that is against the law.”\n\n\tLively’s team has cited text messages among Baldoni’s publicists, showing that they were closely monitoring the social media reaction to the spat between the two co-stars, and that they sought to “boost” posts that were favorable to Baldoni and critical of Lively.\n\t\n\n\tBaldoni and his allies previously sued Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, for defamation. That lawsuit was dismissed on the grounds that Baldoni cannot sue someone for suing him.\n\n\tThe summary judgment motion makes reference to evidence obtained during discovery, but much of that is redacted, as the material has been designated “confidential.”\n\n\tIn a separate action, social media guru Jed Wallace sued Lively in federal court in Texas, alleging that she had damaged his reputation by alleging that he was involved in Baldoni’s smear campaign. That complaint was dismissed by a federal judge in Austin on Wednesday, who ruled that the court did not have jurisdiction over Lively, who is based in New York.\n\n\tLively’s claims against Wallace were likewise dismissed in New York last week, on grounds that the New York court does not have jurisdiction over Wallace, who is based in Texas.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirectors are bringing laughs, tears — and an international lens.\n\n\tFor decades, awards season conversations about diversity have circled the same stage: the faces in front of the camera. Each Oscar cycle elicits scrutiny of who is — or isn’t — nominated in the acting categories. This year, the most vital shift in cinematic recognition is occurring behind the lens.\n\n\tThe best director race could present one of the most globally inclusive, stylistically eclectic and generationally diverse lineups in modern Academy history.\n\t\n\n\tThis isn’t the industry’s first attempt at inclusion. The 2010s belonged to a trio of Latino auteurs — Alfonso Cuarón, Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo del Toro — who collectively claimed five directing statuettes between 2013 and 2018. Yet this year’s field suggests something more democratic and less concentrated in a single narrative.\n\n\n\tStill, one figure looms large: eight-time nominee Paul Thomas Anderson brings his meticulous eye to the Civil War epic “One Battle After Another,” which may clinch him a long-elusive win.\n\n\t“It’s going to take something significant to take down the narrative that’s building around PTA,” a veteran studio publicist says. “Show the voters what it’s like to finally have the first Black directing winner, like Ryan Coogler, or the first woman to win twice — who was also the first woman of color to win before. How great would that feel?”\n\n\tChloé Zhao — the first woman of color to win best director for “Nomadland” — returns with the literary adaptation “Hamnet.” And Coogler expands his genre-defying vision with the horror-inflected “Sinners.”\n\t\n\n\tSeveral women are well positioned as contenders. Along with Zhao, Kathryn Bigelow — the first woman to win best director — reemerges with the nuclear-war thriller “A House of Dynamite.” Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania’s harrowing “The Voice of Hind Rajab” could make her the first Arab woman nominated for directing. Norwegian Mona Fastvold also enters the conversation with the Shaker musical “The Testament of Ann Lee.”\n\n\tOther international auteurs could join a promising slate: Iranian dissident Jafar Panahi’s revenge tale “It Was Just an Accident,” Brazilian provocateur Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent” and South Korean master Park Chan-wook’s dramedy “No Other Choice” — all might sneak in.\n\n\tGenre variety is another hallmark of the race. Beyond “Sinners,” James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” brings blockbuster spectacle, while Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked: For Good” proves musicals can be prestige contenders. Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia” and Del Toro’s “Frankenstein” represent the kind of formally daring work to which the Academy once seemed allergic.\n\n\tThen there’s the generational shift. Josh Safdie aims to make a splash with the manic comedy “Marty Supreme” — and an Oscar winner out of Timothée Chalamet.\n\n\t“The field is tough. It’s one of those years where I wish there were 10 director spots,” says an awards strategist.\n\n\tWhile expanding the field isn’t an option, what distinguishes this moment is its refusal to tokenize. This isn’t one woman, one director of color, one international filmmaker filling designated slots. It’s a genuine proliferation of perspectives that underscores cinema’s global nature — and the arbitrary boundaries that have long defined an “Oscar movie.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDirector of photography Lukasz Zal, director Chloé Zhao and actors Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal on the set of their film HAMNET, a Focus Features release\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgata Grzybowska\n\t\n\n\n\n\t*** = PREDICTED WINNER(All predicted nominees below are in alphabetical order)\n\t\n\t\tOscars Predictions Tracking(Nov. 13, 2025)\t\n\n\tBest Picture“Avatar: Fire and Ash” (20th Century Studios)“Frankenstein” (Netflix)“Hamnet” (Focus Features) “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)“Jay Kelly” (Netflix)“Marty Supreme” (A24)“One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) ***“Sentimental Value” (Neon)“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures)\n\n\tDirectorPaul Thomas Anderson, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) ***Jon M.

    "body": "\n\tThe NFL has often been called “the most dramatic reality show on TV” — and now a group of reality TV all-stars are aiming to prove that case. \n\n\tPeacock, NBC Sports and the NFL are partnering on a reality-themed simulcast for the Dec. 7 Sunday Night Football matchup between the Houston Texans and the Kansas City Chiefs. Dubbed “Reality Hot Seat,” the alternative broadcast will stream on Peacock and NFL+ and feature a handful of reality stars commenting on the game in real time. \n\t\n\n\t“Reality Hot Seat” will feature panelists including “Boston Rob” Mariano (“Survivor,” “The Traitors”), Heather Gay (“The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” “Surviving Mormonism with Heather Gay”), TV and podcast host Justin Sylvester and Kate Chastain (“Below Deck,” “The Traitors”). The four will deliver a play-by-play of the game, but framed as an unscripted event and with their takes geared toward reality TV fans.\n\n\n\t“Reality Hot Seat” will air that evening on Peacock and NFL+ beginning at 8 p.m. ET. Fans who don’t want the reality commentary will still be able to watch the  game via NBC Sports’ regular broadcast airing on NBC, Peacock and NFL+.\n\n\t“’Reality Hot Seat’ brings together two of the greatest passions, football and reality TV, both full of drama, strategy, and fiercely loyal fans,” said Bravo/Peacock unscripted chairman Frances Berwick. “We’re not reinventing the game; we’re simply watching it through a different lens that leans into the unscripted storylines already happening on the field. And with our host lineup, we’ve drafted the perfect team to bring that to life on Peacock.”\n\t\n\n\tSo Obsessed Productions is producing “Reality Hot Seat.” Jenny Slater and Bobby Mancke are executive producers.\n\n\t“This is a dream broadcast for football fans and reality TV fans alike,” said Jackie Chang, NFL director of media strategy and business development. “We are thrilled to partner with NBC and Peacock for an exciting and unique presentation of Sunday Night Football that will reach new audiences and showcase stars on and off the field.”\n\n\tMore details about “Reality Hot Seat” will be shared this weekend at BravoCon, where a Sunday Night Football/”Reality Hot Seat” activation, “Throw More Than Shade,” will allow fans to take bedazzled footballs and aim at reality TV inspired targets – in order to win “Reality Hot Seat” swag.\n\n\tHere’s a description of “Reality Hot Seat”: “Whether breaking down sideline tension like a ’Real Housewives’ dinner party, comparing quarterback-receiver chemistry to a ’Love Island’ recoupling, or analyzing coaching calls worthy of ’The Traitors’ roundtable, ’Reality Hot Seat’ digs into the dirt unfolding on the field – the calls, the reactions, the emotions that will have viewers talking come Monday morning. With surprises, special guests, exclusive sneak peeks – and maybe even a shotski or two – Peacock’s ’Reality Hot Seat’ brings the juiciest watch party right to your living room.”\n\n\tUnique and unusual pro football game altcasts have become more frequent in recent years as the NFL aims to grow and expand its fan base. Last year, ABC and ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” got a “The Simpsons” makeover on Disney+ via “The Simpsons Funday Football.” CBS and Nickelodeon have also collaborated on several NFL altcasts, including ones for “SpongeBob SquarePants.”\n\n\tHere’s the key art for “Reality Hot Seat”:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFour years ago, the microdrama industry as we know it didn’t exist. Today, it’s a global juggernaut racing toward $26 billion in annual revenues by 2030, fundamentally reshaping how audiences consume serialized storytelling on their smartphones.\n\n\tHollywood tried and failed to crack the microdrama code first. In 2020, Jeffrey Katzenberg launched Quibi with $1.75 billion in funding, A-list talent including Steven Spielberg and Guillermo del Toro, and episodes under 10 minutes designed for mobile viewing. Six months later, it shut down, having burned through over $1 billion. The service reached fewer than 1 million subscribers against a target of 7 million, with its content library sold to Roku for under $100 million. Quibi’s failure seemed to validate conventional wisdom: premium short-form video couldn’t compete with free platforms like YouTube and TikTok, and audiences wouldn’t pay for mobile-only content.\n\t\n\n\tBut China was already proving the opposite. While Quibi collapsed, a different model was quietly emerging — one that didn’t rely on Hollywood star power or prestige production values, but on data-driven iteration, platform integration and addictive serialized narratives adapted from web novels. This was duanju, the microdrama format that would generate billions in China by 2024.\n\n\n\tThe numbers tell a story of explosive growth in this Chinese-originated model. Revenues surged from $500 million in 2021 to $7 billion in 2024. Last year, Chinese microdrama revenues surpassed the country’s domestic box office for the first time. Meanwhile, the global market for microdrama outside China generated $1.4 billion in 2024 and is forecast to reach $9.5 billion by 2030, according to research firm Media Partners Asia’s latest strategic report.\n\t\n\n\tProduction costs remain low, but distribution is expensive, with success hinging on speed, scale and repeatable intellectual property.\n\n\t“The story right now on microdramas is really about scale and structure,” says Vivek Couto, executive director of Media Partners Asia. “It’s no longer a fad. It’s a new entertainment and monetization layer that sits between social media and streaming.”\n\n\tChina’s ecosystem demonstrates the potential when content is integrated into social media and payments infrastructure, while the U.S. market is proving the viability of global expansion.\n\n\tThe format itself is deceptively simple: serialized dramas, typically under two minutes per episode, shot vertically for mobile viewing, designed for binge consumption. But beneath that simplicity lies a sophisticated understanding of contemporary viewing habits and monetization strategies that traditional entertainment has struggled to match.\n\n\tThe microdrama boom runs on instantly legible tropes — whirlwind romance, ruthless CEOs, betrayed lovers, reincarnated rivals and revenge served in short bursts.\n\t\n\t\tFrom Zero to Mainstream in Three Phases\t\n\n\t“After four years of rapid global growth, the microdrama industry is now entering its third phase of evolution,” explains Ronan Wong, COO and co-founder of AR Asia, a leading industry player.\n\n\tPhase one began in 2021, when China’s domestic market surged from zero to $7 billion within just four years. Phase two saw the format expand from China to the global stage, particularly in North America, growing from zero to $4 billion in only two and a half years. “This phase proved one essential truth: storytelling is the key to success, and language is not a barrier,” Wong notes.\n\n\tNow, in phase three, countries around the world are developing their own microdrama ecosystems, producing content that reflects their unique cultures and local tastes. South Korea’s Vigloo, for instance, is applying K-drama storytelling expertise to the vertical format. Japan is emerging as the largest Asia-Pacific market beyond China, with revenues forecast to top $1.2 billion by 2030.\n\n\t“Southeast Asia is really becoming critical in microdrama markets,” notes Myat Pan Phyu, analyst at Media Partners Asia. “Thailand stands out with this 360-degree model where they distribute microdramas through both OTT [streaming] apps and mobile networks, pursuing dual monetization strategy through both ad layers and subscription layers.”\n\t\n\n\tSoutheast Asia and Latin America represent promising growth regions, while India remains in an exploratory phase.\n\t\n\t\tThe China Model: Integration Is Everything\t\n\n\tChina’s microdrama ecosystem has become mainstream entertainment, with more than 830 million viewers consuming the format, of which nearly 60% of whom pay for content or make transactions. The industry is anchored by three major players: ByteDance’s Red Fruit, Tencent‘s WeChat Video Accounts and Kuaishou’s Xi Fan. Each has built dedicated apps separate from premium long-form video, tightly integrated with social and payments ecosystems.\n\n\t“China remains the global blueprint for microdramas, serving as the innovation lab and global export engine for the format,” says Adrian Tong, senior analyst at Media Partners Asia. “ByteDance and Kuaishou drive stand-alone discovery ecosystems built around algorithmic personalization, whereas Tencent embeds microdramas within its super app WeChat mini programs, creating seamless discovery, payment and social sharing loops.”\n\n\tThese platforms leverage vast IP pipelines from online literature platforms COL, China Literature and Tomato Novel, converting their blockbuster web novels into serialized vertical dramas. By 2030, advertising will contribute 56% of Chinese microdrama revenues, with subscriptions at 39% and commerce at 5%.\n\n\tTimothy Oh Jia Wei, general manager of COL, explains the company’s breakthrough insight: “Vertical content has existed since the launch of TikTok and Instagram stories, but the question is whether people are paying for it. The golden question that we answered was, ‘What kind of content is worth paying for?’”\n\n\tThe market is also entering a new phase with the rise of S-class productions — premium microdramas budgeted at $400,000 to $600,000, featuring cinematic values, professional casts and franchise potential. These flagship titles are redefining quality benchmarks while broadening monetization possibilities.\n\t\n\t\tThe American Experiment: Profitability vs. Scale\t\n\n\tThe U.S. has emerged as the most lucrative territory outside China, with revenues reaching $819 million in 2024, projected to rise to $3.8 billion by 2030. Audience adoption is driven by affluent, urban women aged 30 to 60, who binge on romance, CEO-story arcs and revenge-driven narratives.\n\t\n\n\tTwo platforms dominate: DramaBox and ReelShort. According to Media Partners Asia, DramaBox has demonstrated that profitability is achievable, reporting $323 million in revenue and $10 million in net profit in 2024. Its model blends subscriptions, episodic unlocks and advertising. ReelShort, meanwhile, achieved greater scale, approximately $400 million in 2024, but remains loss-making due to heavy marketing costs and amortization.\n\n\tCustomer acquisition costs remain a critical challenge, according to traffic marketing agency QianFan, which rolls over $50 million across Meta, Instagram, TikTok and other global ad networks. QianFan has found that three-minute marketing materials generally perform better than shorter formats, with ROI varying between 0.7 and 1.6 depending on titles. “An in-depth study of daily data and responses plus an instant reaction from data into action is crucial to win,” the company says.\n\t\n\t\tThe Creator Economy: Speed Over IP Protection\t\n\n\tFor writers and producers entering this space, microdramas require a fundamental mindset shift. Justin Saucedo and Vivian “Anan” Wang of Lunar Ticks, a Los Angeles-based vertical writing team, made the transition to microdramas from traditional film and TV during the pandemic.\n\n\t“The first realization was about a key difference between horizontals and verticals,” they explain. “Horizontals aim to push culture forward, expand audience’s horizons or challenge them to think and grow. Verticals want to entertain people. That’s it. They give the audience what they want without judgment, lessons or lectures.”\n\n\tThe writing process itself demands new skills. “Writing verticals is a crash course in identifying what is unnecessary and deleting it,” Saucedo and Wang note. Episodes under 90 seconds require ruthless economy of storytelling, with every moment engineered for maximum emotional impact and cliffhanger potential.\n\n\tTraditional notions of IP protection also break down in this velocity-driven market. “You don’t survive in verticals by protecting IP. You survive through speed and iteration,” the Lunar Ticks team observes. “Vertical storylines and tropes function like ingredients for a recipe. Anyone can use them, but a quality product comes down to skill and experience.”\n\n\tNeil Choi, founder and CEO of SpoonLabs, which operates the Vigloo platform, applies Korean entertainment’s proven track record to the format. “China’s duanju model has achieved remarkable success both domestically and abroad by perfecting the formula of adapting stories deeply rooted in Chinese culture for global audiences,” Choi says. “Vigloo originates from Korea, a market that has proved for decades that local storytelling can resonate globally. Our strategy is to take that proven storytelling DNA and adapt it for the vertical viewing format.”\n\t\n\n\tVigloo’s content managers come from global studios such as Disney and CJ ENM. The platform plans to release more than 100 original U.S. series by the end of 2025, featuring emerging talents and genres ranging from romantasy (romance + elements like vampires and werewolves) to rom-coms and steamy romance. Nearly half of Vigloo’s revenue now comes from the U.S. market.\n\t\n\t\tAI: The Accelerant\t\n\n\tArtificial intelligence is rapidly becoming embedded across the microdrama value chain. In China, AI is already used for personalized discovery, faster iteration, genre testing, branching storylines and viral loops. Globally, AI is primarily deployed for localization and dubbing, but its role in compressing production costs and expanding creative experimentation is expected to grow significantly.\n\n\tAdrian Cheng, chair of microdrama company Crisp and organizer of the upcoming Seoul conference the Future Is Vertical, sees the technology as transformative. Cheng describes AI as integral to Crisp’s DNA — not a debate, but a given. He sees it as a transformative force in cutting costs, accelerating production and enabling new creative models.\n\n\tVertical studio Holywater, backed by Fox Entertainment, is also leaning heavily on AI to accelerate creative testing and localization. “We run AI pilots to test ideas before committing full budgets,” says co-CEO Anatolii Kasianov. “It assists in dubbing, subtitling and workflow optimization — letting us see which scenes resonate before a human crew shoots them.”\n\n\tHolywater co-founder Bogdan Nesvit adds that the aim is to build “an ecosystem, not just a studio.” “Microdramas are only the start — we’re already developing micro-thrillers, micro-horror, micro-action,” he says. “It’s about scaling storytelling, not shrinking it.”\n\t\n\t\tWhat Comes Next?\t\n\n\tRonan Wong of AR Asia draws a provocative parallel to understand the industry’s trajectory. “Looking back at the history of entertainment, there is a striking parallel to be found in casual games,” he says. “Both casual games and microdramas share key characteristics: they are direct-to-consumer, digitally marketed, low-cost to produce, short in lifecycle and often rely on in-app purchase monetization models and homogenized content.”\n\n\tIf casual games offer a reference point, the microdrama industry may follow a similar path of rapid expansion, followed by consolidation around platforms that control distribution and can manage customer acquisition costs efficiently.\n\t\n\n\t“Technology transforms the industry, but storytelling endures through the centuries,” Wong reflects. “The mobile-based, vertical format is simply a new container for timeless narratives — just as the TV set once was. From ancient Greek drama to today’s microdramas, we’re still telling stories of love, revenge, comedy and tragedy. There’s no need to over-dramatize the microdrama industry — any story that resonates with human instinct will always find its audience.”\n\n\tThe question facing the industry is whether microdramas represent a sustainable category or a transitional format. With revenues forecast to reach $26 billion globally by 2030, major operators betting billions on customer acquisition, and technology platforms like TikTok and Google participating in industry events such as the Future Is Vertical conference, the format has moved decisively beyond experiment.\n\n\tWhat remains uncertain is which business models will prove sustainable, which markets will develop mature ecosystems beyond China and the U.S., and whether premium content can coexist with algorithmically optimized, data-driven production at scale.\n\n\tFor now, the vertical revolution continues to accelerate, rewriting the rules of serialized storytelling one micro episode at a time.\n",

    "description": "\n\tWhen “Stranger Things” premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016, the show’s cast was made up almost entirely of young people at the starts of their pro",
    "body": "\n\tWhen “Stranger Things” premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016, the show’s cast was made up almost entirely of young people at the starts of their professional lives. The show’s creators, Matt and Ross Duffer, have told a decidedly grown-up adventure story filled with ferocious monsters and equally terrifying adult authority figures. But they built “Stranger Things” on a foundation of pre-teen innocence and adolescent angst, as vividly reflected in the youthful faces of the dozen or so actors who would eventually come to populate its cast.\n\t\n\n\tAlongside veteran actors Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Cara Buono and Matthew Modine, the core “kid” group first consisted of children sitting on either side of 13 (Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp), while the “teens” were comprised of young adults barely over 20 (Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton and Joe Keery). As the show exploded in popularity, the cast expanded to include new kids played by Sadie Sink and Priah Ferguson (in Season 2), and a new teen played by Maya Hawke (in Season 3) — as well as a few other characters who, by and large, were killed off along the way. (R.I.P. Bob, Billy, Eddie.)\n\n\n\tWhile some of the “Stranger Things” series regulars had worked before, none of them — except Ryder — had experienced anything close to the phenomenon that the show became. Practically overnight, they transformed from unknowns into global household names, and as the story of Hawkins, Indiana progressed through its first four seasons, audiences got to “grow with the show in the same way that I got to grow with the ‘Harry Potter’ movies,” says Wolfhard. “I felt like I really knew those people, knew those characters. The way that you relate to them is so special.”\n\t\n\n\tAs with the “Harry Potter” films, “Stranger Things” is coming to an end almost a decade after it began, the first four episodes premiering Nov. 26, the next three at Christmas, and the finale on New Year’s Eve. Its original stars — all of them now adults, yes, even Ferguson — spent the entirety of 2024 in Atlanta filming the final eight episodes of the show, culminating with the feature length series finale that the Duffers, who wrote and directed the episode, have promised will provide a definitive end to every character’s story. (That includes young Holly Wheeler, now played by Nell Fisher, who takes a more central role in Season 5.)\n\n\tIn a series of interviews conducted by Variety from July through November, the Duffers and the cast of “Stranger Things” relayed the experience of concluding the show that has defined the most formative decade of their lives — and how, even as they knew the end was coming, none of them were quite prepared for how intense those last days would be for them. Here, in their own lightly edited — and spoiler-free — words, is the story of the final days of “Stranger Things.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMatt Duffer and Ross Duffer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrew Cooper/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe final table read took place on Sept. 8, 2024, on Stage 16 of the Atlanta production facility that was the home of “Stranger Things” for the majority of its five-season run. The occasion — attended by just a few people outside of the Duffers and the cast, including executive producer Shawn Levy — was unique in many ways, first and foremost because none of the actors had seen the finished script for the finale until that day.\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer (creator, writer, director): Ross and I don’t share anything with anybody. The actors poke around, especially Millie. She’s pretty good at guessing things, too. But everybody was reading it cold for the first time. Ross and I were nervous, because no one aside from us and maybe two other people had read the script.\n\n\tRoss Duffer (creator, writer, director): I know the actors are so protective of those characters, too. Some people knew some broad beats of the stuff that was going to happen, but generally, they didn’t know how they were going to end up.\n\n\tSadie Sink (Max Mayfield): I always get really nervous for table reads, but that was the most nerve-racking of them all. Usually, we get to look at it on our own time, and then come together and read it. But that was the first time it was just a completely cold read.\n\t\n\n\tCharlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers): It was really intimate. It was with Matt and Ross, the cast, and Shawn. In the past, we did these really big table reads for 50 or 60 people.\n\n\tNell Fisher (Holly Wheeler): For the first six episodes, we were on quite long, menacing tables with microphones in, like, an all-black room. But for the final episode, we were just kind of sitting around. Some people were on couches, some people were on bean bags, and it was all very relaxed.\n\n\tCharlie Heaton: The table read for us is our version of watching and experiencing it for the first time. And then there’s the heightened element of this is the last time we’re all going to sit together and read it and experience it.\n\n\tPriah Ferguson (Erica Sinclair): I was sad, but I was also excited to see how the story will end and how it all comes together.\n\n\tNatalia Dyer (Nancy Wheeler): The scripts are always very fun to read. They kind of jump off the page. So the table reads generally have always been something you look forward to. It’s like reading a book that you really enjoy. Often, it’s the first time you’ve seen each other for a while, and it’s for the first of the episodes, so there’s a lot of new beginning energy. I don’t think we normally would read the last ones together so much. So there’s definitely a different energy in that last one.\n\t\n\t\tIn truth, a few of the actors had already shot part of the finale script before the table read.\t\n\n\tNell Fisher: I had actually filmed some scenes from Episode 8, without having read the script, which was quite funny.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: There were certain scenes in the finale that took place in a summer setting that we had to shoot before we had completed the script. That was unusual, in that we did feed some pages completely out of context to our actors, and we had to shoot scenes from Episode 8 part way through production. It’s a horrible thing to do. You don’t want to be establishing continuity in that way, but it was necessary. It ended up working totally fine, thank God.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoah Schnapp, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Ross and Matt Duffer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtsushi Nishijima/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne crucial member of the cast — who plays the show’s main villain — couldn’t attend the table read.\t\n\n\tJamie Campbell Bower (Vecna/Henry Creel): I’ve discussed Henry and Vecna, and this idea of isolation and loneliness. There are lots of coincidences — well, seeming coincidences — that happen in life in general, and one of those for me was upon being asked to come in to read the final episode of “Stranger Things,” I decided to get COVID. So my read through for that final episode was done on Zoom in isolation whilst everybody else was in the room. I thought it quite a fitting end.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBefore the table read began, the Duffers were called upon to commemorate the occasion.\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Everybody started yelling, “Speech! Speech! Speech!” First of all, we give really bad speeches. Last time we gave one, Millie was like, “What was that?”\n\n\tCharlie Heaton: It was very beautiful. It was just this culmination of the whole thing.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I said, “Everything we wanted to say about the show, the experience of making the show, you as actors, and your characters — we tried to put all of that into the script. I’m not going to be able to say anything better than that. We write much better than we speak. Let’s just read the script.”\n\n\tNatalia Dyer: It felt very reverent. Everybody’s really anticipating this moment, and it also felt like a turning point, when you have it in your hands, and you finally have all these answers. It’s so complex and layered, all the things that you feel: You’re so grateful, you’re so happy, you’re so, so sad.\n\n\tCharlie Heaton: I was sitting in front of Noah and Finn. I assumed it might get emotional. But 20 minutes in — and we’re not even a third into the script — Noah is bawling his eyes out, like deep sobs. And then Finn was crying. That really set everyone off.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMillie Bobby Brown and Matt Duffer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtsushi Nishijima/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFinn Wolfhard (Mike Wheeler): It’s going to be interesting if that ever comes out, because it’ll be pretty embarrassing. The whole thing is just crying. I was like, “I’m not going to cry. I’m going to feel very normal, and it’s going to be great.” And then halfway through, I just started totally bawling my eyes out.\n\n\tNoah Schnapp (Will Byers): I can only imagine how that’s going to feel on screen, with scoring and real faces and not just words on a page, but it hit a lot of us. It felt like they were writing the end of our real people lives — it went beyond just the screenplay. I can’t spoil it, but like, I always connect my life to some of the beats that they wrote in the script.\n\n\tFinn Wolfhard: A lot of our dialogue was echoing stuff — like, the whole thing is about the end, it’s also final season for us. We all had dialogue in the final episode that we had said in some way or another in real life.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Honestly, as we were writing that last script, which is the longest we’ve ever spent on a script before, what they’re talking about wasn’t really a conscious thing. We were just talking about these characters. It really was once we did the final table read that it was like, “Oh, of course.” That is when I saw how much it was mirroring their real-life experience.\n\t\n\n\tCharlie Heaton: Joe, Natalia and Maya and I were sitting together, and there was a little moment at the end where we all just looked at each other and were like “Wow.” You feel so bonded to these people and have worked with them for 10 years. They’re like family. We all hugged at the end afterwards. It was a lot more emotional than I expected it to be.\n\n\tJamie Campbell Bower: We finished doing the read through, and then Matt and Ross came up [to my Zoom screen], and they were almost like, “Oh my gosh, you’re still here. Hi!” Just because I’ve been watching these people go through this emotional experience and thinking about how much this show has been there for people, I started to cry. All I could say to Matt and Ross was, “Thank you. Thank you for making this such a huge part of so many people’s lives.”\n\n\tDavid Harbour (Jim Hopper): The events that happen in that script pay off a lot of things that we started in the first season. The series begins with kids in the basement, and then when we leave the series, they’re not kids anymore. They’ve grown up. The passage of time is often just very moving in and of itself.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMaya Hawke, Joe Keery, Finn Wolfhard and Charlie Heaton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrew Cooper/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPaul Dichter (writer): I remember going up to Ross and I was like, “I’m done. I just heard the final script of the final episode of ‘Stranger Things’ read out loud, and it’s perfect. I’m a writer on the show, and I just now, just now, realize that I’m done after 10 years, and it feels crazy.” And he was like, “Uh huh.” He was not crying. I was like, “You don’t feel done, do you?” He’s like, “No, I got months of shooting, I got a year of post, I got editing.” I was like, “Yeah, you’re not taking this moment in. You’re not done. I’m done. And it feels crazy. And when you have that same moment” — which is honestly coming up very, very soon for them — “you’re going to feel this way too, times 10 or a million.”\n\n\tFinn Wolfhard: And it was on Gaten’s birthday, so we threw a little party for him afterwards, and went to Medieval Times. It was a great day.\n\t\n\t\tWhat actually happens in the finale remains a tightly guarded secret that will be revealed when the episode debuts on Netflix and in select movie theaters at 5pm PT / 8pm ET on Dec. 31. But speaking with Variety, the actors did share their experience of their final days on set. Thanks to some savvy work by the show’s production staff…\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We were actually able to structure it so every actor’s last day was their last scene.\n\t\n\n\tNatalia Dyer: There are so many ways that that could not work out. You have so many moving pieces: There’s schedules and filming and weather. The fact that they were able to pull that off, and they made a point of doing that, was really touching. Getting to do that with your character is really, really lovely. It really amps up the emotion of the moment and that day. It almost felt a little masochistic and indulgent — but in the best way possible.\n\n\tMaya Hawke (Robin Buckley): I will be forever grateful to them for allowing our last moment not to be like, “OK, and now throw a grenade at the monster again. Cut! That’s a wrap on Maya!” It was a monumental day, and they allowed it to really be that — and feel like that. \n\n\tCarmen Cuba (casting director): I hadn’t visited the set since the first season. It was outside. It was freezing. I was overwhelmed with how gigantic it was. I’ve worked on, I don’t know, four Ridley Scott movies. It was bigger. And the guys are just sort of the same in every part of their job. They’re calm, they’re direct, they’re articulate. I was like, “How are they doing that, with this epicness around?”\n\n\tMatt Duffer: There was a sense at the end of those days that this experience that we all had is something that none of us will likely ever have again. It was really hard. Each day was saying goodbye. Now, each of those actors only had to say goodbye once. Ross and I had to do it four different times.\n\t\n\t\tEach actor’s final day took on an even greater sense of occasion.\t\n\n\tNoah Schnapp: I went to every single person on that call sheet’s last day. I did not want to say goodbye to anybody. Every single goodbye hit me so much more than I expected. Like, I was at Winona’s last day, and I was like, “Oh, this is a work goodbye, we’ll see each other soon.” And then I was in her trailer, and I was like, “No! You can’t leave!” I was holding on to her, just sobbing. I didn’t want to say goodbye. I did not expect it to hit me so hard. I realized after that how important that relationship was to me. She really was a second mother to me growing up, and not having this show to keep us together was really hard, especially with her, because she’s hard to keep track of. I’m not always seeing Winona Ryder. So it was a hard goodbye.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCaleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder and Noah Schnapp\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtsushi Nishijima/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMillie Bobby Brown (Eleven/Jane Hopper): I bawled more than I expected I would. While I was at the point personally and professionally for the show to come to an end, I realized in that moment the finality was so real and I was maybe not emotionally prepared.\n\n\tNatalia Dyer: People came to my last day, and you just feel that: It’s really nice. There’s a family element to it. At the end, there was a lot of people supporting each other emotionally. Crew, as well. I think we really felt it all in a big way.\n\n\tJoe Keery (Steve Harrington): A lot of people came who weren’t working that day, and everyone was just sort of hanging out. The scene itself was really fun to work on, “fun” being sort of a loose word. It is kind of heavy. I think everybody was feeling the fatigue of shooting for a year. I mean, the amount of material that they got in one year is truly incredible. Everyone was looking forward to being done, but then once you get to the finish line, you look back and think, “Oh, man, can I just have one more?”\n\n\tCharlie Heaton: Me, Joe and Maya drove a VW van to work. You’re just going through everything for the last time, and you’re very aware of that. It’s the last time in hair and makeup. It’s the last time you get your mic on.\n\n\tMaya Hawke: They did such a beautiful job of choosing a last scene that mirrored the emotional experience that we were going through as people in ending the show. And that’s not a spoiler, because you don’t know my experience! But it was such a gift, because it allowed the feelings that we were working through with each other on that day to become a part of the scene, and to be this integrated emotional experience.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: At a certain point, these characters have become so enmeshed with the actors. Matt and I were just thinking about Robin, but, of course, Maya is Robin. She’s made Robin into who she is. It makes sense that that happened.\n\n\tMaya Hawke: I think it changed me as an actor forever. I am a different actor today, and I think a better actor, because of that opportunity to do a scene that was on such a high-stakes emotional day of my life that was also a high stakes emotional scene. I felt like I got to connect a red wire and a blue wire, and all of a sudden, I understood how to be present as an actor. I feel forever changed, and like I have access to a part of my emotional experience when I’m working that I didn’t used to have access to. It was just this extraordinary gift.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMaya Hawke and Brett Gelman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNiko Tavernise/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMillie Bobby Brown: It felt like a massive milestone in reaching this achievement that was finally coming to an end, like, “We did it!” But also the weight of this being the end was so heavy.\n\n\tMaya Hawke: I did spend 12 hours in a rolling cycle of weeping. I would start weeping, and then I’d have to pull myself together to go back to the beginning of a scene. And then in the middle of the scene, I would start weeping again. And then I would weep after it was over. It was a weepy, weepy day.\n\n\tRoss Duffer: It was hard to even get through take after take. You’re just going, “They’re feeling every moment of this.” Occasionally, they were actually too emotional when it was a little too early in the scene. We’re like, “You’re not supposed to be upset!”\n\n\tPriah Ferguson: I cried more at home. I tried to keep my composure around my castmates. But at home, I did cry.\n\n\tJamie Campbell Bower: On my final day, they called final checks, and my incredible team of hair and makeup people who I work with came over. I remember turning around to our first [assistant director] and just going, “No final checks here. This is not it. This can’t be the last time that we’re doing this.” So often that when you’re working on a film or a TV show, there’s always like, well, maybe we’ll come back. This, it was like, “No, this is it.” There is a finality to what we’re doing in this moment, which is quite a difficult thing to think about.\n\n\tSadie Sink: They did a really good job of giving us all the ending that we wanted and that the show really deserved. And I think that’s so important when dealing with something as special as the show was for all of us, when it’s a decade of our lives. It was important to give it the proper closure it deserved, and I think we all definitely got that.\n\n\tJamie Campbell Bower: Sadie was there on my last day — not in the scene that I was doing, but she just went, “Is this how it feels?” And I was like, “I don’t know. I don’t know how it’s going to feel for you, but this is how it feels for me right now.” She’s like, “You look like you’re in shock.” I was a bit. Somebody took a photograph of me. I looked like I’d come in from a world tour carrying all these bags, and I just dropped them. I just let go of the weight.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharlie Heaton, Natalia Dyer and Joe Keery\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClay Enos/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMaya Hawke: If you’d asked me three years ago, I would have said that I thought it would have been bittersweet, and it was — only in that it’s so sweet to love people so much. But the ending really was just bitter. It was just really sad to say goodbye to everybody. And not that it’s goodbye forever, but it will never be the same. You know, my first two seasons, I couldn’t ditch my “new kid” syndrome. I felt like a friend who’d been invited to Thanksgiving, you know? In the last season, I really felt like a part of the family. Which was sad in its own way, because it’s like, “Oh, I just got to be a part of the family, and now the family’s breaking up!”\n\n\tDavid Harbour: It’s like you’re asking me to talk about my family. All I can say is, there’s a lot of love in this entire thing, and there was a lot of love on that day.\n\t\n\t\tOccasionally, the warm and fuzzy vibes were splashed with a spot of vinegar.\t\n\n\tBrett Gelman (Murray Bauman): I gave two speeches, actually. I gave a speech that was very heartfelt. I was maybe not full-on crying, but on the verge. Everybody crowded around. I hugged everybody. I thought I was wrapped. And then Matt and Ross walked up to me and were like, “Hey man, we messed up. We need you for one more shot.” So then we did it and then I was wrapped again. And then I gave a funny speech where, like a real jerk, I said they should all be grateful, and that I’m sorry if I mistreated anyone. I don’t totally remember it.\n\t\n\t\tFor many of the show’s actors, their final day had the culminating feeling of a graduation: a day of elation and exhaustion, nostalgia and heartache.\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: The hardest was just saying goodbye to the young cast. They were so young when they started, and we’ve seen them grow a lot. Finishing the scenes with their characters, and saying goodbye and seeing them emotionally process it, I think that was where it really hit us.\n\n\tCaleb McLaughlin (Lucas Sinclair): I knew I was gonna cry because I kept asking everyone the last week, “You gonna cry tomorrow? I want to know if you’re gonna cry! Because I’m not.” I was probably the first person to cry, and didn’t stop crying.\n\n\tNoah Schnapp: Every minute was, like, counting down, “No, not another minute!” Like, I was standing in the bathroom, saying goodbye to every piece of this set. It felt really reminiscent of Season 1 childhood, all of us on set. Like, there was an ice cream truck and we were rolling around in the grass and playing tag, just being like kids again. All our moms showed up to set. They haven’t obviously come to set for us since, like, Season 2 and 3. They got a cute picture together.\n\t\n\n\tGaten Matarazzo (Dustin Henderson): It’s almost like a last day of school, when you’re not really hunkered down and doing your work, you’re just buzzing and zipping around and hugs and lots of sentimental conversations. And everybody who had worked on the show at any point, seemingly, was in the room at that time. It was probably a fire hazard.\n\n\tCaleb McLaughlin: It was an emotional roller coaster. All of the memories and all the moments that we’ve had on set just started up in my heart. I’m like, “Wow, you remember this happened? Remember when we did this?” I was like, Oh man, does it really have to end now?\n\t\n\t\tThe final day of production was on Dec. 20, 2024. No one wanted it to end.\t\n\n\tNell Fisher: My scene was actually the last scene that was shot. It was on the very last day. It was running a bit behind schedule, and so I had about three hours of just hanging around with the rest of the cast who were in my scene. I finished slightly earlier, but I waited until the final wrap, which was — I mean, it was incredible. I cried. Everyone cried! There were a lot of tears. I’m surprised Atlanta didn’t flood, to be honest.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAbove: Caleb McLaughlin, Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard and Noah Schnapp in the series premiere of “Stranger Things,” filmed in 2015; below: McLaughlin, Schnapp, Matarazzo and Wolfhard on the set of Season 5, photographed in 2024\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix/Courtesy Everett Collection; Atsushi Nishijima/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNoah Schnapp: I can’t get into real details of the scene, but when they yelled, “This is the last one,” we were in our set, and we just didn’t want to walk out.\n\n\tFinn Wolfhard: I remember looking at everyone and saying, “Let’s not go out. Let’s just be with each other as long as we possibly can in this moment before we go out.” Because then it becomes about everyone. It’s not just our thing anymore. It’s not just us.\n\n\tNoah Schnapp: We were just sitting there, kind of huddled up, hugging and crying for a solid 10 minutes of just silence — all these people outside waiting for us. I’ve never experienced anything like it.\n\n\tFinn Wolfhard: It was less than 10 minutes. I think it was probably like three or four minutes, just sitting there, just so we could feel like we’re doing it in our own way, and processing it together. It was really special to just be sitting around everyone and just taking it all in together. It was the most real feeling “Stranger Things” episode ever.\n\t\n\n\tNoah Schnapp: And then we left this set to our parents and all the actors and all the crew members that we’ve grown up with all just waiting there, clapping. It felt like a dream. And then there was balloons coming down, and then we all went around giving speeches and thank yous to everyone for being there for us and growing up with us. I could barely get through my speech.\n\n\tGaten Matarazzo: As many tears as there were — certainly on my part, on a day like that — it really did feel like a big party to celebrate the accomplishment that was this show in its entirety. And being able to be there from start to finish is a really cool perspective that I share with only a few members of the cast. They gave us a family in that show.\n\t\n\t\tEven Netflix chief creative officer Bela Bajaria attended the last day.\t\n\n\tBela Bajaria: It was really about seeing everybody and looking them into the eye and saying thank you for this incredible run, and how creative it was — just to be able to do that in person. It was really being there to witness all of these people together that have worked on this show for 10 years. There was a lot of gratitude and emotion for each other and what they had built. Every time they wrapped a character — just the applause and the tears and the hugs. I mean, they’ve been together for so long! Growing up, coming of age — literally coming of age on screen.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMatt Duffer, Sadie Sink, Nell Fisher, Caleb McLaughlin, Joe Chrest, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, Priah Ferguson, Alex Breaux, Gaten Matarazzo, Natalia Dyer, Brett Gelman, Noah Schnapp, Charlie Heaton, Jamie Campbell Bower, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Millie Bobby Brown, Amybeth McNulty, David Harbour, Shawn Levy, Jake Connelly, Ross Duffer, Cara Buono and guests at the “Stranger Things” Season 5 world premiere in Los Angeles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I’m never going to spend 10 years on something again, I don’t think, where you become this much of a family with the people who are working on it, get to know them as well as you do, and have them influence the show and the characters to the degree that these actors did.\n\n\tMaya Hawke: I should probably lie about this, but I’m at a loss without the show. I miss it so much? I think about being in Atlanta with everybody every day. \n\t\n\n\tCharlie Heaton: Everyone’s been like “What’s it like now that you finished?” And in my opinion, it ended so perfectly. It doesn’t feel like anything was left, and I wouldn’t change anything about how it ended. We wrapped and then we got to be with the kids when they wrapped, and we got to see them go through it and support them. It’s like a little death and you’re mourning, and then you wake up the next day and you feel a sense of loss. It was a really unique experience.\n\n\tFinn Wolfhard: I don’t think I’ll ever truly feel like it’s the end. The show will live on in so many ways that I hope it still feels relevant to people years down the line. As far as the actual end of the story goes, I don’t know. I mean, there’s a reason why we ended it, and it’s done. But who’s to say that the Duffers, in 10 years, when they get another idea, they do it? It’s up to them. I think it’s good that it’s the end, but part of me hopes it’s not.\n\n\tNoah Schnapp: It still doesn’t feel like the end yet. I mean, obviously, I’ll never forget that last day for the rest of my life, and that definitely felt like closing not just a chapter, but an era of my life. But still, I mean, we’re gearing up with so much to look forward to. Regardless of the hype and attention, just the fact that we all get to be together doing this for another few months is what I really look forward to, because that’s what really matters to me — all the people. So it doesn’t feel over yet. I’d say when the show’s out, the promotional tour is done, and there’s nothing really keeping us all together again, then it’s going to be like, “Oh wow, I really have to sit with this.” But for now, there’s still lots to come.\n\n\tJennifer Maas, Marc Malkin, Andrew McGowan and Leia Mendoza contributed to this story.\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe soccer paywall on Apple TV is coming down. \n\n\tUnder a revision to the 10-year deal Apple and Major League Soccer inked in 2022, beginning in 202",
    "body": "\n\tThe soccer paywall on Apple TV is coming down. \n\n\tUnder a revision to the 10-year deal Apple and Major League Soccer inked in 2022, beginning in 2026, all MLS matches will be available to stream for Apple TV subscribers at no additional cost.\n\n\tStarting next season, fans worldwide can watch every regular-season match, the annual Leagues Cup tournament, the MLS All-Star Game, the Michelob Ultra Campeones Cup, the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs and more — included with a subscription to Apple TV, currently priced at $12.99/month in the U.S. (Originally launched as Apple TV+, the company has rebranded it to drop the “+” sign.)\n\t\n\n\tApple’s most recent pricing for MLS Season Pass was $14.99 per month or $99 for the entire season. It first began streaming the league’s games in 2023. The standalone MLS Season Pass subscription on the Apple TV app will conclude at the end of the 2025 season. In addition, as part of the revised deal, MLS club season ticket members will receive a full Apple TV subscription as part of their 2026 full-season ticket membership (one per paid season ticket account).\n\n\n\tApple TV will provide all subscribers access to MLS matches — with no blackouts — as well as studio shows and on-demand content in more than 100 countries and regions. For Apple, the change is designed to enhanced the value of the Apple TV subscription, alongside the service’s original series, films and documentaries, as well as MLB’s “Friday Night Baseball” games and starting next year Formula 1 races in the U.S. under a five-year deal estimated to be worth $750 million.\n\n\t“Our partnership with Apple has always been about innovating for our fans,” MLS commissioner Don Garber said in a statement. “Bringing every MLS match to Apple TV takes that vision to the next level by making it easier than ever for fans everywhere to watch, connect, and be part of the game.”\n\t\n\n\tEddy Cue, Apple’s senior VP of Services, said in a statement: “We’re thrilled to bring MLS to more fans around the world next season on Apple TV. Every match, all in one place, alongside incredible Apple Originals — it’s a win for fans everywhere.”\n\n\tStarting this season, Apple TV made “Sunday Night Soccer” games available to all customers without an MLS Season Pass subscription.\n\n\tIn 2025, more than 200 matches were simulcast on both MLS Season Pass and Apple TV. “Sunday Night Soccer” matches on Apple TV (and MLS Season Pass) saw significantly more viewers than the average MLS match, which according to the league was a clear signal that Apple TV drives engagement.\n\n\tPictured above: Lionel Messi of Inter Miami CF controls the ball while under pressure from Daniel Lovitz of Nashville SC during the 2025 MLS Cup Playoff match at Chase Stadium on Nov. 8 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n",

    "body": "\n\tL.A.-based Cineverse, the U.S. distributor of “Terrifier” and “The Toxic Avenger,” has teamed with Fandor to acquire all rights to North America on Lithuanian Weird Wave thriller “Jōhatsu.” \n\n\tThe film will debut via digital and Fandor early next year.\n\n\tFrom Lithuanian prize-winning producer Uljana Kim, with whom Alief  has worked since 2019’s “Sicvenezia Parthenon,” “Johatsu” world premiered at the 2024 Tallin Critics’ Picks Competition. It received its North American premiere at the Lincoln Center’s Scary Movies Series this Summer in NYC. \n\t\n\n\tDirected by Lina Lužytė and Nerijus Milerius, “Jōhatsu” begins with city morgue worker Lina (Zygimante Jakstaite) being unconvinced by the comportment of the dead man’s estranged wife when she comes to identify the body. \n\n\n\tLina begins to investigate but as clues lead her to a a grim Lithuanian port town, becomes fascinated by the phenomenon of jōhatsu, a Japanese terms for individuals who choose to disappear without trace. The film asks where Lina’s search will take her – some nasty individuals do to not want her to find the missing man. But, the film asks: What is she really looking for?”    \n\n\tLužytė has made two features, her latest, “Together For Ever” being selected for Karlovy Vary, 2016) and ”The Castle” (2020) and two documentaries after that, her latest being shot in Moria, the biggest refugee camp in Europe on the island of Lesvos, Greece. Milerius’ documentary “Exemplary Behaviour” about inmates sentenced to life, co-directed by Audrius Mickevičius and NerijusMilerius, won three awards at DOK Leipzig, including its Golden Dove and a Fipresci Prize. \n\t\n\n\t“Why do people decide to escape their comfortable routines and erase their traces from the world ready-made for them?” Lužytė and Milerius ask in a director’s statement. “Jōhatsu” marks not a momentarily distraction or a need for a retreat but a radical transformation when the whole history of a person as well as the person itself get erased. That’s exactly why Lina’s character is so precious to us.”\n\n\tLincoln Center program notes called “Jōhatsu” a “deceptively subdued thriller that locates terror in the impossibility of really knowing our fellow humans, the impenetrable obscurity of their motivations and actions – and, perhaps most frightening of all, the nagging awareness that our own most profound, private truths might be equally unknowable, even to ourselves.”\n\n\t“‘Jōhatsu’ is a beautifully crafted film that builds an atmosphere of quiet unease through its striking visuals and meticulous direction. Lina Lužytė and Nerijus Milerius have created something haunting, mysterious and deeply human – a work of art that stays with you long after it ends.  It’s exactly the kind of bold, original filmmaking our audience craves, and we’re thrilled to bring this remarkable work to Fandor audiences early next year,” says Eric Rowe, Cineverse Executive Director, Programming.\n\n\t“We are thrilled to be working with Cineverse and Fandor, an exciting time for independent cinema,” said Alief President Brett Walker. \n",

Stitt has only granted clemency to a prisoner only once during his tenure as governor.\n      \n\n          What's also interesting is the U.S. Supreme Court denied a request from Wood's lawyer to stay the execution.\n      \n    \n          Wood was convicted of felony murder in the 2002 death of Ronnie Wipf during an unsuccessful robbery. Wood's attorneys maintained his brother Zjaiton was the one who'd killed Wipf.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Zjaiton, who was sentenced to life without parole for his role in the murder, died in prison in 2019. He apparently admitted to being the one who'd stabbed Wipf to several individuals prior to his death.\n      \n    \n          Stitt issued a statement regarding the stopped execution, and he described Wood's new sentence as \"a severe punishment\" which would serve to keep the prisoner, whom he described as a \"violent offender,\" away from the public.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Tremane Wood\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Explains\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

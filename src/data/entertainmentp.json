    "body": "\n\tAmazon announced that it was eliminating about 16,000 jobs across its corporate departments, coming after it laid off 14,000 employees last October.\n\n\tAltogether, the 30,000 jobs represent almost 10% of the ecommerce giant’s headcount.\n\n\tThe news of the latest cutbacks was shared with Amazon employees in a memo Wednesday from Beth Galetti, senior VP of people experience and technology. \n\n\n\t“The reductions we are making today will impact approximately 16,000 roles across Amazon, and we’re again working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted,” Galetti said. The company will initially offer most affected U.S.-based employees 90 days “to look for a new role internally.” \n\t\n\n\tFor employees who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or “who choose not to look for one,” Amazon will provide severance pay, outplacement services and health insurance benefits.\n\n\tAccording to Galetti, the layoffs this week are not part of a cycle “where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate. That’s never been more important than it is today in a world that’s changing faster than ever.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrench international sales company Andana Films has boarded Tawfik Sabouni’s documentary “The Other Side of the Sun,” which will receive its world premiere as part of the Panorama section of this year’s Berlinale. \n\n\tIn the film, the director returned to the Syrian capital of Damascus in the immediate aftermath of the Assad regime’s collapse. There he met four fellow former detainees of the notorious former Saidnaya prison. Through re-enactments inside the prison itself, the documentary “turns memory into testimony, revealing resilience and an unbroken will to survive,” Andana said.\n\t\n\n\tDamascus-born Sabouni was arrested and ended up in Saidnaya after filming the Syrian uprising in March 2011. After his release, he studied film directing at INSAS in Brussels, graduating in 2022. He also worked as a director for radio and as a dubbing actor for TV. His short films “On the Edge of Madness” (2021) and “Stateless” (2022) screened at several international festivals.\n\n\n\tYears after his release from Saidnaya prison, also known as “the other side of the sun,” the director returned to the site of his captivity, which is no longer in use. Joined by fellow survivors, he re-enters the physical spaces of their imprisonment – not to re-open wounds but to “reclaim what systematic violence tried to erase, using carefully crafted re-enactments of daily rituals and moments of survival to express what words cannot,” according to a statement.\n\n\tThe viewers are confronted with the testimonies of Sabouni, Mahmoud Kadah, Abdelkafi Alhaj, Mohammad Hamki and Abdelhamid Jadou, all of whom suffered horrific, degrading treatment.\n\t\n\n\t“This film is a testimony carried by the voices of five survivors,” Sabouni explained. “Through our memories and our stories, it seeks to understand what happened behind the walls of Saidnaya and the reasons for the disappearances.”\n\n\t“Tawfik Sabouni offers a powerful film and an essential, lasting document about the prison of Saidnaya,” Stephan Riguet, managing director of Andana Films, said. “The film reveals the horror of a system and its executioners, while also bringing out a profound human beauty born from the protagonists’ listening and solidarity.”\n\n\tThe director co-developed the script with Laurine Estrade. DOP is Sameer Orabi, while the editing was in the hands of Dani Abo Louh. Bilal Sultani signed for the sound, with Lucas Lauwers responsible for the sound editing and Alek Goosse for sound mixing.\n\n\t“The Other Side of the Sun” is produced by Julie Freres for Dérives (Belgium), Jean-Baptiste Bonnet for Habilis Productions (France), and co-produced by Hanne Phlypo for Clin d’œil Films (Belgium). Ziad Ali of Art Maker Production handled production duties in Syria.\n\n\tThe film is co-produced by RTBF (Télévision belge), WIP – Wallonie Image Production, Shelter Prod, Al Jazeera Documentary Channel and the Red Sea Fund. It was supported by the Centre du Cinéma et de l’Audiovisuel de la Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles, the CNC, Région Normandie, SCAM, La Culture avec la Copie Privée, Flanders Audiovisual Fund (VAF), Taxshelter.be, ING, the Tax Shelter of the Federal Government of Belgium, Coopération belge au développement, the European Union and IMS.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLyric Hammersmith Theatre has unveiled the complete ensemble for the U.K. premiere of “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding,” the Tony Award-winning Broadway comedy that will run at the London venue from March 18 through April 25.\n\n\tSet in a bustling Harlem braiding salon, the comedy unfolds over one hot summer’s day as West African immigrant braiders serve neighborhood clients. The women navigate demanding customers, secrets and lies, laughter and betrayal, while grappling with their own aspirations in the city they call home.\n\t\n\n\tThe production reunites writer Jocelyn Bioh and director Monique Touko, the creative duo behind the 2023 hit “School Girls; Or, The African Mean Girls Play.”\n\n\n\tLeading the cast are Bola Akeju (“School Girls”) as Ndidi, Zainab Jah (“Boesman and Lena”) as Jaja, and Renee Bailey (“Call the Midwife”) as Vanessa/Sheila/Radia. The ensemble also includes babirye bukilwa (“Dreaming Whilst Black”) as Aminata, Demmy Ladipo (“Barber Shop Chronicles”) as James/Franklin/Olu/Eric, Dani Moseley (“Dreaming Whilst Black”) as Michelle/Chrissy/Laniece, Jadesola Odunjo (“School Girls”) as Miriam, Dolapo Oni (“Iya-Ile”) as Bea, and Karene Peter (“Rye Lane”) as Jennifer. Sewa Zamba will make their professional stage debut as Marie.\n\n\t“Jaja’s African Hair Braiding” premiered on Broadway as part of Manhattan Theatre Club’s 2023-2024 season, where it became one of the most talked-about shows of the year. The limited run was extended twice and its final performances were live-streamed due to demand before launching a U.S. tour at the end of 2024. The production secured two Tony Awards and gained six nominations, while accumulating eight nominations across the Drama Desk Awards, Drama League Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.\n\t\n\n\t“It is the joy and honor of my life to have ‘Jaja’s African Hair Braiding’ make its UK premiere at the Lyric Hammersmith under the incredible direction of Monique Touko,” Bioh said. “In many ways, this play is about the power of love and community – two things I felt exponentially after the overwhelming success of our production of ‘School Girls; Or, The African Mean Girls Play’ in 2023. I’m thrilled to be working with much of the same creative team and I hope to bring more laughter, joy and connection to U.K. audiences again. I can’t wait to welcome them into the shop.”\n\n\tTouko added: “To be bringing Jocelyn Bioh’s ‘Jaja’s African Hair Braiding’ to U.K. audiences is a real honor. Her stories contain heart, vibrancy and soul and populating this world was an absolute joy. We have assembled a talented bunch of actors from theatre and screen to bring Harlem to life in 2019 on one summers day. Meet our braiders and welcome to the shop.”\n\n\tRachel O’Riordan, artistic director of Lyric Hammersmith Theatre, said: “We’re delighted to welcome back writer Jocelyn Bioh and director Monique Touko – the talented duo behind the 2023 smash-hit ‘Schools Girls; Or, The African Mean Girls Play’ – for ‘Jaja’s African Hair Braiding.’ I cannot wait for audiences to meet the wonderful cast as they laugh, hope and dream on our beautiful stage.”\n\n\tThe creative team includes set design by Paul Wills, wigs, hair and makeup design by Cynthia De La Rosa, costume design by Jessica Cabassa, lighting design by Simisola Majekodunmi, sound design by Tony Gayle, video design by Dick Straker, and movement direction by Kloé Dean. Julia Horan CDG serves as casting director, with Xanthus as associate director and Gràinne Flynn as assistant director.\n\n\tThe production is a co-production between Lyric Hammersmith Theatre, Madison Wells Live, Chase This Productions and Joshua Berg Creative. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTiago Melo‘s sci-fi satirically tinged drama “Yellow Cake” has debuted its trailer ahead of the world premiere in the Tiger Competition at the International Film Festival Rotterdam. Urânio Filmes is handling world sales.\n\n\n\n\n\tThis is Tiago’s second feature film following “Azouge Nazare,” which premiered at IFFR in 2018 and won the Bright Future Award.\n\n\n\tThe film stars Rejane Faria, Valmir do Côco, Spencer Callahan and Tânia Maria, who also appears in Oscar nominated “The Secret Agent.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film is set in the Brazilian city of Picuí, in the Paraíba backlands. Here a group of scientists is trying to eradicate the deadly Aedes aegypti mosquito — the vector of dengue fever — through a secret experiment codenamed Yellow Cake.\n\n\n\tUsing uranium extracted from the region, the project aims to sterilize the mosquitoes and contain the spread of the disease. The nuclear physicist Rúbia Ribeiro (Faria) acts as the link between the Brazilian military command and the project’s controversial leader, Bill Raymond (Callahan), whose urgency to see results leads him to disregard safety protocols. When the experiment fails, it is up to Rúbia to join forces with local prospectors to reverse the imminent catastrophe.\n\n\tMelo said, “The starting point was to imagine an extreme public policy, conceived by foreign scientists, that attempts to solve a national problem—the spread of diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti—through nuclear testing. From there, the film unfolds as both a satire and a reflection on Brazil’s long-standing relationship with global powers that claim to ‘help,’ but often turn the country into a laboratory for their ideas.”\n\t\n\n\tThe screenplay is by Amanda Guimarães, Anna Carolina Francisco, Gabriel Domingues, Jeronimo Lemos and Melo.\n\n\t“Yellow Cake” is produced by Carol Ferreira, Leonardo Sette, Luiz Barbosa and Melo. The production companies are Lucinda, Jaraguá and Urânio. The co-producers are Olhar and Cinemascópio, the producers of “The Secret Agent.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tRichard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague,” a love letter to the French cinematic movement known as the New Wave, is leading the race at the Cesar Awards,",
    "body": "\n\tRichard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague,” a love letter to the French cinematic movement known as the New Wave, is leading the race at the Cesar Awards, France’s equivalent to the Oscars, with 10 nominations.\n\n\tThe black-and-white movie, which world premiered in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, previously won a raft prizes at the Lumiere Awards. It’s nominated for best film, director, original screenplay, cinematography, male newcomer for Jean-Luc Godard-lookalike Guillaume Marbeck, as well as editing, sound, original score and costume design. An homage to Godard’s cult 1960 movie “Breathless” that revives the New Wave era in 1960’s Paris, Linklater’s film was acquired by Netflix at Cannes and was shortlisted to represent France in the Oscar race, but Jafar Panahi’s politically charged “It Was Just an Accident” was ultimately chosen by the French Oscar committee. \n\t\n\n\tOther strong Cesar contenders include Carine Tardieu’s intimate drama “L’attachement,” Dominik Moll’s procedural “Case 137,” set during France’s yellow vests protests and Stéphane Demoustier’s “The Great Arch,” a historical drama starring Claes Bang, with eight nominations each. They’re followed by Hafsia Herzi’s queer coming-of-age story “The Little Sister,” which is in the running with seven noms, and Thierry Kliffa’s “The Richest Woman in the World,” a film loosely based on the 2010 Bettencourt Affair and starring Isabelle Huppert, with six nominations. “Arco,” Ugo Bienvenu’s poetic animated feature produced by Natalie Portman is nominated for four Cesar Awards, alongside Francois Ozon‘s “The Stranger,” an adaptation of Albert Camus’ classic.\n\t\n\n\tThe best director category showcases two female helmers: Tardieu, whose film “L’attachement” opened at Venice in 2024 and stars Valeria Bruni Tedeschi and Pio Marmaï; and Herzi, whose drama “The Little Sister” picked up best actress at Cannes for Nadia Melliti, as well as the Louis Delluc Prize from French critics. Linklater, Demoustier and Moll round up the category. \n\n\t“It Was Just an Accident,” meanwhile, is nominated for best film and best original screenplay. While Panahi’s movie shot in Persian, it was produced in France and as such is eligible in that category. Previous non-French-language movies which earned a best film nomination include “Mustang,” “The Pianist,” “Emilia Perez” and “Sils Maria.” Also nominated for best film this year are “L’attachement,” “Case 137,” “Nouvelle Vague” and “The Little Sister.”\n\n\tThe best actress category looks fiercely competitive with Huppert vying for a Cesar Award for her colorful performance in “The Richest Woman in the World,” alongside Leila Bekhti for “Once Upon My Mother,” Lea Drucker for “Case 137,” Valeria Bruni Tedeschi for “L’attachement” and Melanie Thierry for “La chambre de Mariana.”  \n\n\tBang is nominated for his part in “The Great Arch” as real-life Danish architect Otto von Spreckelsen, who won an open-call competition launched by French president François Mitterrand in 1982 and came to Paris to spearhead the epic project. The other leading actors nominated are Laurent Lafitte for his part opposite Huppert in “The Richest Woman in the World;” Bastien Bouillon in “Leave One Day;” Benjamin Voisin in “The Stranger;” and Pio Marmai in “L’attachement.” \n\n\t“The Great Arch” also landed three supporting actor nominations for Swan Arlaud, Michel Fau and Xavier Dolan. \n\n\tAnother breakout is “Nino” which garnered a best first film nom for Pauline Loquès, best male newcomer for Théodore Pellerin, and best supporting actress for Jeanne Balibar. \n\n\tIn the best international feature section, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Once Battle After Another” will face off against Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” and Oliver Laxe’s “Sirat,” alongside Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent” and Guan Hu’s “Black Dog.”\n\n\tAside from Lido alumni “L’attachement” and “The Stranger,” all the Cesar Awards frontrunners this year world premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. \n\t\n\n\tAs previously announced, French star Camille Cottin (“Call My Agent“) will host the ceremony on Feb. 26 at the Olympia theater in Paris, where Jim Carrey will receive the honorary Cesar Award, succeeding Julia Roberts.\n\n\tNominations for the 51st Cesar Awards are: \n\n\tBest Film\n\n\t“L’attachement”“Case 137”“Nouvelle Vague”“The Little Sister”“It Was Just an Accident”Best DirectorCarine Tardieu, “L’attachement”Dominik Moll, “Case 137”Stéphane Demoustier, “The Great Arch”Richard Linklater, “Nouvelle Vague”Hafsia Herzi, “The Little Sister”Best ActressLeïla Bekhti, “Ma Mère, Dieu et Sylvie Vartan”Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, “L’attachement”Léa Drucker, “Case 137”Isabelle Huppert, “The Richest Woman in the World”Mélanie Thierry, “La Chambre de Mariana”Best ActorClaes Bang, “The Great Arch”Bastien Bouillon, “Leave One Day”Laurent Lafitte, “The Richest Woman in the World”Pio Marmaï, “L’attachement”Benjamin Voisin, “The Stranger”Best Supporting ActressJeanne Balibar, “Nino”Dominique Blanc, “Partir Un Jour”Marina Foïs, “The Richest Woman in the World”Ji-Min Park, “La Petite DernièreVimala Pons, “L’attachement”Best Supporting ActorSwann Arlaud, “The Great Arch”Xavier Dolan, “The Great Arch”Michel Fau, “The Great Arch”Pierre Lottin, “The Stranger”Raphaël Personnaz, “The Richest Women in the World”Best Female NewcomerManon Clavel, “Kika”Suzanne Lindon, “La Venue de l’Avenir”Nadia Melliti, “La Petite Dernière”Camille Rutherford, “Jane Austen a Gâché Ma Vie”Anja Verderosa, “L’Épreuve du Feu”Best Male NewcomerIdir Azougli, “Météors”Sayyid El Alami, “La Pampa”Félix Lefebvre, “L’Épreuve du Feu”Guillaume Marbeck, “Nouvelle Vague”Théodore Pellerin, “Nino”Best Original ScreenplayDominik Moll, Gilles Marchand, “Case 137”Pauline Loquès, “Nino”Holly Gent, Vince Palma, “Nouvelle Vague”Franck Dubosc, Sarah Kaminsky, “Un Ours Dans le Jura”Jafar Panahi, “It Was Just an Accident”Best Adapted ScreenplayCarine Tardieu, Raphaëlle Moussafir, Agnès Feuvre, “L’attachement”Stéphane Demoustier, “The Great Arch”Hafsia Herzi, “The Little Sister”Best International Film“The Secret Agent,” Kleber Mendonça Filho“Black Dog,” Guan Hu“Sirât,” Oliver Laxe“One Battle After Another,” Paul Thomas Anderson“Sentimental Value,” Joachim Trier\n\n\tBest Original Score  Arnaud Toulon, “Arco”Olivier Marguerit, “Case 137”Fatima Al Qadiri, “The Stranger”Alex Beaupain, “The Richest Woman in the World”Amine Bouhafa, “The Little Sister”Best Sound“Arco”“Le Chant des Forêts”“Case 137”“Nouvelle Vague”“Leave One Day”Best CinematographyElin Kirschfink, “L’attachement”Patrick Ghiringhelli, “Case 137”Marine Atlan, “L’Engloutie”Manu Dacosse, “The Stranger”David Chambille, “Nouvelle VagueBest EditingStan Collet, “13 Jours, 13 Nuits”Christel Dewynter, “L’attachement”Laurent Rouan, “Case 137”Catherine Schwartz, “Nouvelle Vague”Géraldine Mangenot, “The Little Sister”Best Costume Design Céline Guignard, “La Condition”Corinne Bruand, “Dracula”Jürgen Doering, “The Richest Woman in the World”Pascaline Chavanne, “Nouvelle Vague”Pierre-Yves Gayraud, “La Venue de l’Avenir”Best Production Design Jean-Philippe Moreaux, “Dog 51”Catherine Cosme, “L’Inconnu de la Grande Arche”Riton Dupire-Clément, “Once Upon My Mother”Katia Wyszkop, “Nouvelle Vague”Marie Cheminel, “La Venue de l’Avenir”Best Visual EffectsCédric Fayolle, “Dog 51”Rodolphe Chabrier, Benoît de Longlée, “L’Homme qui Rétrécit”Lise Fischer, “The Great Arch”Alain Carsoux, “Nouvelle Vague”\n",

    "description": "\n\tStarring Gustaf Skarsgård (“Oppenheimer,” “Vikings”), the anticipated – and highly modern – reboot of “Wallander,” set up at Banijay Entertainment’s",
    "body": "\n\tStarring Gustaf Skarsgård (“Oppenheimer,” “Vikings”), the anticipated – and highly modern – reboot of “Wallander,” set up at Banijay Entertainment’s Jarowskij/Yellow Bird and Swedish broadcast network TV4, has added further key cast: Sophia Martinsson (“Festen,” “Bror”), Ana Gil De Melo Nascimento (“Sune,” “Gåsmamman,” “Jordskott”) and Göran Ragnerstam(“Arn,” “Kopps,” “Offside”).\n\n\tThe cast news comes as Jarowskij/Yellow Bird has also announced a new action-comedy for Netflix Nordics, “Permafrost.”\n\t\n\n\tMartinsson, 22, who landed the lead role of Zafirah in youth series “Festen,” now on its fourth season, will play Kurt Wallander’s estranged daughter. Martinsson’s roles also take in youth series “Bror,” Josephine in “Sannigen” Season 2, which bowed on Dec. 25, and movie “Nipster.”\n\n\n\tA prominent performer at Stockholm’s Royal Dramatic Theater whose extensive TV career takes in “Gåsmamman” (2016-17) and “Jordskott” (2017), Gil de Melo Nascimento will take on the role of wife Mona Wallander.\n\n\tA Guldbagge Swedish Academy Award best supporting actor winner for his performance in “Suxxes” (2002), the seasoned Ragnerstam, who has acted in over 50 series and films –  most recently “The Quiet Beekeeper” which opened this year’s Göteborg Film Festival on Jan. 23 – will be seen in “Wallander” as the father of the iconic detective. \n\n\tAdaptations of Henning Mankell’s celebrated Kurt Wallander novels, wgich have sold over 40 million copies, have generated a three-season Swedish series over 2005-13 whose broadcast on the U.K.’s BBC 4 heralded the breakout of Scandinavian series in international. Kenneth Branagh starred as the eponymous police inspector in a British TV version, running over 2008-16. \n\t\n\n\tThe importance of the three family figures in the new “Wallander” reboot sets it apart, however,  and grounds its modern-day tenor. In their classic European murder mystery versions – think Hércules Poirot – detectives are a source of authority and a sense of stability in a world of least suspected criminality. In the “Wallander” reboot, in contrast, Gustaf Skarsgård’s Wallander’s life is falling apart. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGöran Ragnerstam (‘Wallander’)\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“When we start the series, Wallander has just been divorced by his wife. It’s very fresh. He is still hoping for her to come back,” Elin Kvist, Jarowskij/Yellow Bird CEO, told Variety.\n\n\t“The series is really a dance between the two of them. It’s so much attraction, love and affection,” she added. “At the same time, she’s moved on, doesn’t want to come back and he has to realize that, which is really hurtful at times in the series. She really brings real, raw emotion.”\n\n\tAt the same time, Wallander is constantly worried about his daughter, who has a troubled past, seen over the series, but she wants to break free from her parents. Wallander’s father is getting older and also slipping away, no longer the person who he once could rely on. “So in a sense it’s as if Wallander is losing everyone,” Kvist added. \n\n\tUncertain about himself, Wallander lives in a today’s society, moeover, where “you need to take responsibility for your actions. Even if you’re sad or even if you’re alone, you can’t just act out, so that has been a very interesting adaptation of the character,” Kvist said. \n\n\tMoving into production in January, shooting in Stockholm and surroundings. “Permafrost,” produced by Jarowskij/Yellow Bird, is directed by Patrik Eklund (“The Conference”) from a scripts by Peter Arrhenius (“Clark”). \n\n\tKey cast takes in Björn Gustafsson, Aliette Opheim, Marie Richardsson, Maria Lundqvist, Jimmy Lindström,  Vera Vitali,  Peter Eggers, Leo Razzak, Fredrik Hiller and Bahador Foladi.\n\n\tIt turns on Marcus Tell and Ann Wilding, the Swedish police’s most unlikely duo, forced to unite when their seemingly vastly different investigations lead to the same dramatic conclusion: an attack during Stockholm’s Nobel Week. Lotta Westberg produces. \n\t\n\n\tThe announcement of “Permafrost” comes as seven of Netflix’s Top 10 most viewed non-English language films in history are in some way action movies: “Troll,” “Under Paris,” “Extraterritorial,” “Nowhere,” “The Great Flood,” “Counterattack” and “Ad Vitam.”\n\n\tCelebrated for “Parlamentet” and “Stockholm Live,” “Björn Gustafsson is Sweden’s most famous comedian. So it’s very much comedy driven but the case is taken very seriously. We haven’t done much action comedy here or indeed much action at all. So it’s very exciting and big for Sweden,” said Kvist.\n\n\tScandinavia’s TV scene was devastated by Viaplay’s pull-back from massive content investment in 2023.  \n\n\tJarowskij and Yellow Bird, known for “Milennium” and “Wallander” franchises, merged in September 2024, with Kvist appointed as CEO.\n\n\t“We can combine Jarowskij , a comedy drama company, with big crime and international co-production DNA from Yellow Bird. I think that match has been a very successful for us,” said Kvist.\n\n\tScandinavian producers “still have SVT and TV4 as strong broadcasters and then we have Netflix and Amazon and HBO Max coming back. Being a big company, we have a good and, I hope, stable market right now in the Nordics,” she added. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPermafrost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures Television has secured an option agreement with Thailand’s TV Thunder and Columbia Pictures‘ Aquaverse to develop “100 Choices,” SPT’s unscripted entertainment format, with production set to take place at the Columbia Pictures-themed water park in Thailand.\n\n\tThe comedy family format challenges contestants to answer a single question with 100 possible answers for a large cash prize. Given the near-impossible nature of the questions, participants compete in five physical challenges that allow them to eliminate potential answers based on their performance in each round. The game show combines strategy, physical prowess and teamwork as contestants work to narrow down their options.\n\t\n\n\tTV Thunder will adapt and produce the local version, customizing the format for a large-scale waterpark environment. Columbia Pictures’ Aquaverse, located in the seaside town of Bangsaray, near Pattaya, will serve as the production’s home base. The arrangement aims to engage family audiences while driving visibility for the theme park, which features rides and attractions based on Hollywood franchises including “Ghostbusters,” “Jumanji,” “Bad Boys” and “Hotel Transylvania.”\n\n\n\tSPT acquired global distribution rights to “100 Choices” after the format, created by Tokyo-based FANY Studio, was showcased at Singapore’s Asia TV Forum and Market in 2023. The studio unveiled the format to the international market at London Screenings in February 2025.\n\n\tThe Thailand deal follows the recent announcement that B17 Entertainment, part of SPT, is developing the format for GSN in the U.S., highlighting the studio’s strategy of expanding its global unscripted portfolio by pairing local production expertise with distinctive venue settings.\n",

Then he doubled down and insisted his apology is not a P.R. stunt ahead of his album release Friday ... Boteach is calling B.S.\n      \n\n          Rabbi Shmuley says Ye is a straight-up \"American Nazi\" and the biggest thing missing from the apology -- which Shmuley says probably cost around $75,000 -- is any mention of Kanye's \"Heil Hitler\" track.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Shmuley lives in Miami and says the song is being played in clubs in Miami and beyond ... and he tells us the three things he thinks Ye needs to do to make his apology feel more sincere ... watch the video.\n      \n    \n          Bottom line ... Rabbi Shmuley says Kanye has Jewish blood on his hands, albeit indirectly, and he unloads on him in epic fashion here.\n      \n    \n          Oy vey!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Kanye West\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Religion/ Spirituality\n              \n                          \n                Hip Hop\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Live\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

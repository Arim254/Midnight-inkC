There are ways that it can now feel diminished, as the streaming world absorbs some of its energy — in ways both positive (certain movies enjoy a more popular platform at home than they ever could have in theaters) and negative (the buzz/conversation/sheer presence factor of a theatrical release still transcends your living room). Yet looking over our list of the best films at Sundance this year, we couldn’t help but notice all the golden-oldie trends that remain in place. One movie, “The Invite,” provoked a ’90s-style bidding war and got sold for a headline-making $12 million, and guess what? It lives up to the hype. The documentaries, like “Give Me the Ball!” and “The Oldest Person in the World,” still ruled. And the sheer range of movies on our list has, frankly, left us a little astonished. Do you still think there’s such a thing as a “Sundance movie”? The beauty of Sundance is that the real answer to that has always been no. And it still is.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tChasing Summer\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tComedian Iliza Shlesinger escaped the state of Texas right after high school, but her hilarious, perceptive, deeply relatable comedy (directed with Judd Apatow-level skills by Josephine Decker) is all about looking back, as her overachieving character Jaime returns “home” after nearly 20 years away. Something embarrassing happened between Jaime and her teenage crush, Chase (“Smallville” star Tom Welling). She’s been out saving the world — that’s literally her job as a disaster relief worker — to prove herself to the bullies who’ve long since moved on. “Nobody’s thinking about high school anymore,” Chase says when they run into each other. He sure has changed, but has Jaime, who reverts back to her teenage self, flirting with a gallant, decades-younger kid (Garrett Wareing) at a kegger? Jaime has a lot of sorting out to do while in Texas, and Shlesigner’s insightful “you can’t go home again” story graciously lets her character fumble through it.

A two-hander set entirely within the steel-blue confines of an American men’s prison, Petra Volpe‘s drama charts with grace and sensitivity the initially reluctant but increasingly dependent connection between two inmates: a 60-year-old lifer (Rob Morgan) slipping into the fog of Alzheimer’s disease and a younger parole applicant (Kingsley Ben-Adir) enlisted to be the older man’s daily caretaker. Volpe has scant time for melodrama or farfetched buddy antics. But her film is all the more moving for that steady, solemn sense of mortal inevitability: As one man’s life gradually escapes his grasp, the other seeks to reclaim his while he still has time.

In other hands, this might have been a plausible rom-com. But Wain turns it into a fish-out-of-water comedy laced with flaky surreal dunked-in-media lunacy. It’s a smartened up homage to dumbing down, rooted in an ironic nostalgia for a Hollyweird that barely exists anymore.

At 82, King talks in rich percussive sound bites, and the film, looking back over her extraordinary life and career, showcases her feral power as an athlete, her movie-star charisma (in that thick shag haircut, she was like Diane Keaton’s jock sister), her revolutionary war for equal pay, and the trauma and triumph that surrounded her sexual identity. It all comes to a head in the 1973 “Battle of the Sexes” match between King and Bobby Riggs, which becomes one of the most thrilling documentary sequences in years.

But in Walter Thompson-Hernández’s one-of-a-kind Sundance discovery, the filmmaker — and his largely untrained ensemble — spend most of their time looking up to the skies, where passing airplanes represent the world beyond Los Angeles’ working-class Watts neighborhood. Talent-to-watch Thompson-Hernández gives them wings. Aiming to establish a new idiom to represent the community and conditions in which he was raised, the journalist-turned-director channels elements of surrealism, modern dance and Greek mythology that have never been combined in quite this way before.

Joe (Seth Rogen), a former indie-rock musician, and Angela (Wilde), a high-strung bundle of nerve endings, will fight about anything under the sun, because that’s now their way of connecting. Their upstairs neighbors, Pína (Penélope Cruz) and Hawk (Edward Norton), are everything Joe and Angela are not: mellow, glamorous, harmonious. They also turn out to be “enlightened” New Age addicts of group sex. For all the controlled rancor on display, what draws us in is the remarkable flow of the dialogue, and the quartet of actors are amazing. “The Invite” is so full of surprise, so fresh and up-to-the-minute in its perception of how relationships work (or don’t), that you watch it in a state of rapt immersion and delight. A lot of people are going to see themselves mirrored in this movie, which is humane enough to play a truth game that rings true.

Early one Sunday morning, while running through Golden Gate Park with her father (Channing Tatum), Josephine comes upon a shocking scene. Her parents’ instinct is to avoid the subject. “Josephine” eventually builds to a big courtroom moment where its title character courageously agrees to testify, but de Araújo seems less concerned with the verdict than she is with recognizing how the experience impacts Josephine, reshaping how she views the world going forward. While some might find it triggering, “Josephine” dares to confront the life-shattering intersection of sex and violence in our culture, facing the toughest of “adult situations” with clear eyes.

The statement implies that if their fate is to be haunted by an entity that takes the form of the person they are most attracted to, they would choose for that malevolent force to personify one other.

Is it by amassing the most assets? The most wisdom? Some might argue that success comes in living the longest — in outliving all your peers, to put it in slightly more macabre terms — although Sam Green’s delightfully insightful “The Oldest Person in the World” suggests there’s an age at which the gift of life starts to feel … excessive. With his sneakily profound and unexpectedly personal new nonfiction project, Green takes a deep look at the subject of mortality. In the tradition of Agnès Varda, he’s determined to glean whatever advice he can from the last few people born way back in the 19th century, but also with his own uncertain future, as the director was diagnosed with multiple myeloma during the making of this film.

The guests comprised a who’s who of that legendary period in the 1920s and ’30s when writers, actors, intellectuals and activists made Harlem a cultural hub of Black creativity and cultural ambition. Ten years after his father’s death, his son David completes this vivid and layered time capsule in which oral history is just one element of a historical excursion.

Writer-director Noah Segan’s nostalgia-powered character study quietly mourns a bygone era, when life was analog and so were its criminals. Longtime actor Segan’s sophomore feature feels like a warm embrace in defiance of an increasingly cold world that has lost its manners, along with the tactile elements worth holding onto. It’s the kind of unapologetically local love letter to the Big Apple and its less-illustrious denizens that New York deserves.

There is markedly less humor in the studied, achingly sober “Shame and Money,” which again examines social outsider status, but this time with wealth and class — whether inherited or suddenly acquired — as the dividing barriers. Though his latest is a slow burn offering little in the way of hope or levity, Morina doesn’t trade in one-note miserablism either: Intricately observed domestic dynamics keep the drama textured and humane, as does Astrit Kabashi’s layered performance as a man softly beaten down but screaming on the inside.

The story of three Black teenage boys falsely convicted of murdering their classmate (and subsequently sentenced to life), the movie spans several decades, functioning as both an archival portrait of Baltimore in the 1980s and a retroactive true-crime investigation. However, its conclusions are entirely unexpected, and entirely devastating.

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” has announced its next host and musical guest, with Connor Storrie set to take over Studio 8H on Feb. 28, joined by Mumford & Sons.\n\n\tThe booking continues a high-profile season for NBC’s long-running sketch series, which has leaned heavily into budding first-time hosts, pop-forward musical guests and a newly reconfigured cast following a major shakeup earlier this year.\n\n\n\tStorrie will make his first appearance on the show, arriving amid “Heated Rivalry” fever. Meanwhile, Mumford & Sons is promoting their upcoming album, “Prizefighter,” set to be released on Feb. 20.\n\t\n\n\tThe upcoming episode follows a January run that featured first-time hosts Finn Wolfhard, Teyana Taylor and Alexander Skarsgård, with musical guests A$AP Rocky, Geese and Cardi B. That stretch marked the show’s return after the holidays, helping set the tone for the back half of the season.\n\n\tThis season has also had notable changes behind the scenes and on camera. Bowen Yang departed the series after seven seasons following Ariana Grande’s hosting stint earlier this year — an exit that marked the end of an era for one of the show’s most prominent breakout stars.\n\n\tHis departure came alongside a larger cast reset that saw longtime players Heidi Gardner and Ego Nwodim exit, while several new faces joined the ensemble, including Jeremy Culhane, Veronika Slowikowska and Ben Marshall, of previously contributing “SNL” comedy trio Please Don’t Destroy.\n\n\tNow in its 51st season, “Saturday Night Live” continues to balance legacy appeal with new voices as it navigates a post-transition period under creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels.\n\t\n\n\t“SNL” airs Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET on NBC. See the announcement below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSteve Martin and Martin Short paid tribute to the late Catherine O’Hara Friday night, raising a glass to the star during their “The Best of Steve Martin and Martin Short” comedy show in Austin, Texas. \n\n\t“Catherine O’Hara, I met when she was 18 years of age, and all these years later, she has been the greatest, most brilliant, kindest, sweetest angel that any of us worked with,” said Short alongside Martin. “So god bless Catherine,” he added while toasting. \n\t\n\n\tAs the two stood on stage, a large image of the actress was on the screen behind them. The tribute came just hours after O’Hara’s death was announced on Friday. Her agency, CAA, confirmed she died at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness. She was 71. \n\n\n\tA longtime friend and collaborator, Short first met O’Hara on the Canadian sketch comedy series “Second City Television,” which ran from 1976 to 1984. Martin previously worked with the “Best in Show” and “Schitt’s Creek” actor on the 1994 film “A Simple Twist of Fate,” directed by Gillies MacKinnon. \n\n\tSince O’Hara’s death, a number of stars have shared heartfelt messages.  “Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you but I had so much more to say,” O’Hara’s “Home Alone” co-star Macaulay Culkin wrote on Instagram. “I love you. I’ll see you later.”\n\n\tSeth Rogan, who co-starred with O’Hara on “The Studio,” also shared his thoughts on Instagram. “Really don’t know what to say… I told O’Hara when I first met her I thought she was the funniest person I’d ever had the pleasure of watching on screen. ‘Home Alone’ was the movie that made me want to make movies,” Rogen wrote. “Getting to work with her was a true honour. She was hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous… she made me want to make our show good enough to be worthy of her presence in it. This is just devastating. We’re all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it.”\n",

It’s not just the on-screen that you see in that one, you know, camera shot,” Thompson said. “It’s so many people behind the scenes and years and years and years with each one of those people. So it’s gonna be a lot.”\n\t\n\n\tHe then joked, “I might have to just rip the bandaid and run out the back door and not say nothing to nobody and just write letters.”\n\n\n\tAs “SNL’s” longest tenured cast member, Thompson has seen plenty of his co-stars come and go. He said it is “usually always sad” when someone leaves the show. “SNL” Season 51 saw the departures of several long-time cast members, with the most recent exit being Bowen Yang.\n\n\t“It’s tough for me because I have yet to have the moment,” Thompson said. “You know, if I was on the other side of it, I’d be a little more like, ‘Yeah, you know, it’s all good,’ like, ‘Shake it off’ kind of thing. But, like, I’m dreading the moment. I might collapse in the moment because it’s been so many years and so many relationships and just…”\n\n\tHe continued, “That’s gonna be a drastic change at this point that I never thought, you know, ‘SNL’ would be such a large component in my life. I never thought I’d even get the job in the first place.”\n\n\tBack in May of 2025, Thompson hinted at the major cast shakeup in Season 51. Heidi Gardner, Devon Walker, Michael Longfellow and Emil Wakim all left before the season kicked off, with Yang being the last to leave partway through.\n\t\n\n\t“Especially this year where it feels like there’s maybe, possibly, a lot of change next year,” Thompson told Page Six. “You want everyone to stay forever, knowing that people may be making decisions this summer…it’s always like you want your kids to stay young.”\n\n\tA smattering of fresh faces joined “SNL” for Season 51, including Tommy Brennan, Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson and Veronika Slowikowska. Of the new additions, “SNL” mastermind Lorne Michaels told Entertainment Tonight, “Change is good. The people we’re bringing in, I’m really excited about.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Department of Justice on Friday released 3 million documents from the Jeffrey Epstein files, along with 2,000 videos and roughly 180,000 images. The latest batch included mention of celebrities like Jay-Z, Pusha T and Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\tMentions of the trio did not come from Epstein’s personal records nor reports corroborated by law enforcement. The two rappers and the disgraced Hollywood mogul were named in a tip to the FBI, which was archived as part of the Epstein investigation. The tip itself does not imply these individuals were investigated, nor does it in any way imply guilt for the accusations posed.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to an FBI crisis intake report included in the latest Epstein release, an anonymous victim, who claimed she had been drugged and sexually abused in several instances throughout the years, said Pusha T (Terrence LeVarr Thornton) was one of her “handlers.” Also in the report, the victim said she once woke up in a room with Weinstein and Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) with her. The report also stated that because the victim was drugged in both scenarios, her memory was clouded.\n\n\n\tReps for Jay-Z and Pusha T did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. \n\n\tDirector Mira Nair, the mother of New York mayor Zohran Mamdani, was also found in the new release. She was mentioned by name in an email from publicist Peggy Siegal to Epstein. Siegal wrote that she saw Nair at an after-party for the 2009 film “Amelia,” which Nair directed. The email implies no wrongdoing or investigation.\n\n\tA rep for Nair did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. \n\t\n\n\tMessages between Casey Wasserman, chairman of the LA28 Olympics committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of child sex trafficking in connection with Epstein, were also included in the files. In one correspondence, Maxwell offers Wasserman a massage that could “drive a man wild.”\n\n\tIn a statement obtained by Variety, Wasserman said his interactions with Maxwell occurred “over two decades ago” and were “long before her horrific crimes came to light.” He also denied any connection to Epstein.\n\n\tWasserman wrote, “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.”\n\n\tAfter a rare, bipartisan push from Congress, President Donald Trump in November signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law, which has since brought a surge of previously sealed material on the Epstein investigation into the public eye. Trump has his own complicated past with the late New York financier, but has adamantly denied any knowledge of his criminal behavior. Throughout Trump’s second term, the Epstein files have remained a cultural hot point as well as a political one, referenced on everything from “Saturday Night Live” to “South Park.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPete Davidson returned to “Saturday Night Live” for the cold open of the Jan. 31 episode, portraying border czar Tom Homan while he’s working with some woefully underprepared ICE agents in Minneapolis.\n\n\tDavidson opened the segment by saying, “I’m sure a lot of you are wondering why Greg Bovino, the last guy, was dismissed. I want to stress that it wasn’t because he did a bad job, or publicly lied about the shooting of an American citizen, or even, uh oh, dressed like a Nazi. It was that he was filmed doing these things, and the President no likey that. So I’m here now, and we need to tighten up. That starts with remembering the mission objective. Now, who could tell me why we’re here in Minneapolis?”\n\t\n\n\tOf course, the recruits had no clear answers.\n\n\n\tAs he continued, Davidson as Homan said, “Let’s talk about use of force. When do we want to use force? … It’s kind of a trick question, because we actually don’t want to use force. Remember, the job ultimately is about keeping America safe from … what?”\n\n\tA recruit, played by James Austin Johnson, answered, “This could be wrong, but Don Lemon?”\n\n\tUltimately, Homan agreed that the key was to avoid getting videotaped doing anything illegal: “Maybe just try not to get filmed!”\n\n\tThe episode was hosted by Alexander Skarsgård, with musical guest Cardi B. Pete Davidson launched his new Netflix video podcast “The Pete Davidson Show” on Friday, with MGK as his first guest.\n\n\tWatch the sketch below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJane Fonda on Friday spoke out in support of Don Lemon at a rally in Los Angeles after the former CNN anchor was arrested and indicted on charges of interfering with a religious service during a Minnesota ICE protest.\n\n\t“We are not ready to sit and be quiet. We have to speak up,” Fonda said (via TMZ). “Every American who believes in our Constitution has to speak up. Don Lemon is a professional journalist. He and his producer were doing their job, nothing more, nothing less. And he’s been arrested. And they’ll make up all kinds of defamatory things to say about him; that’s what they’re doing. That’s how autocrats act. We can’t fall for it. We have to speak up. When a red line is crossed like this, we cannot be silent.”\n\t\n\n\tShe added, “I know Don Lemon. My husband created CNN, and I will fight for their right to speak, which is guaranteed in our Constitution. They arrested the wrong Don.”\n\n\n\tA judge on Friday afternoon ordered Lemon to be released on his own recognizance. Outside the downtown L.A. courthouse, Lemon declared that his arrest would not hamper his work as an independent journalist.\n\n\t“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,” he said. “I will not stop ever. Last night, the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something that I have been doing for the last 30 years, and that is covering the news. The First Amendment of the Constitution protects me and countless other journalists who do what I do. I stand with all of them, and I will not be silenced. I look forward to my day in court.”\n\t\n\n\tFonda has long been an advocate for Hollywood’s most politically outspoken. In October of 2025, she relaunched the Committee for the First Amendment. Started by her father, Henry Fonda, the McCarthy-era initiative was designed to protect against attacks on free speech.\n\n\t“The McCarthy Era ended when Americans from across the political spectrum finally came together and stood up for the principles in the Constitution against the forces of repression,” Fonda said at the time. “Those forces have returned. And it is our turn to stand together in defense of our constitutional rights.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlexander Skarsgård was joined, on his “Saturday Night Live” hosting debut, by his father.\n\n\tSkarsgård had been stoic about what’s going on in his career: He didn’t mention his new films “Pillion” or “The Moment” in his monologue, during which he mimed playing the sax along with the “SNL” band.\n\n\tLater, in a sketch seeming to play off Stellan Skarsgård‘s success this year in “Sentimental Value,” Alexander and Chloe Fineman played cast members in a Scandinavian drama (titled “Stench of a Family”) who couldn’t help but cut up between takes, laughing at the absurdity of the story and their situation. Their characters’ father, who wants to die, is lying in a bathtub waiting to say goodbye. Once the two walk into the bathroom set, they find Stellan, concealed beneath the water with a fake Incredible Hulk prop on his hand. He provides the scene’s final joke, breaking the tension once and for all by raising his Hulk fist into the air.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the sketch below.\n\n\n\n\tStellan proved himself to play against his image there, and in a sketch lampooning the practices of immigrant parents, in which Alexander played a stoic Finn, whose only memory of affection from his father was accidentally touching knees in a sauna. He was joined, at the end of the sketch, by his real-life father, screaming, “The shame is yours! Live with it!”\n\n\tThe episode’s musical guest, Cardi B, showed up in this sketch as well, playing the wife of the character played by Marcello Hernández. In a wig with rollers in, Cardi grabbed the cigarette out of Hernández’s hand and made her own case as a potential future host.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Last Resort,” directed by Maria Sødahl, won the Dragon Award for Best Nordic Film at the Göteborg Film Festival on Saturday night.\n\n\tThe award comes with a whooping SEK 400,000 ($41,500) which, according to the organizers, makes it one of the world’s largest film prizes. \n\n\tThe jurors argued that Sødahl’s film, which is about a family who expects an exotic vacation but instead comes face-to-face with the harsh realities of a refugee crisis, “shows how the callousness bred by habitual cruelty diminishes us all, hollowing out our relationships – even with our partners and children.”\n\t\n\n\tThe jury, headed by “The Act of Killing” director Joshua Oppenheimer and including Fabrice Aragno, Lia Boysen, Sanna Lenken, and Gergely Pálos, added: “With pitch-perfect performances, a razor-sharp yet nuanced script, and not a trace of sentimentality, the film is a mirror in which we see ourselves with devastating clarity. If we refuse to confront our own complicity in the cruelty unfolding around us right now, the love we claim to live by cannot save us – because the compassion that underpins it is conditional.”\n\n\n\tThe film is sold by TrustNordisk. Sødahl, who’s Norwegian, previously directed Stellan Skarsgård and Andrea Bræin Hovig in well-received “Hope,” based on a personal story. \n\n\t“My previous films are shamelessly autobiographical,” Sødahl told Variety, arguing that her latest opens up to a “more complex universe.” \n\n\t“[It’s] a story where our Scandinavian protagonists start out as diplomatic humanists, until xenophobia leads them to act with primal violence and paranoia. The suspense is strong, and the gaze is unsentimental, in a story about us, for us and by us.”\n\t\n\n\tSweden’s Adam Lundgren – recently spotted in the arthouse hit “The Ugly Stepsister” – won a gender-neutral Best Acting award for “The Quiet Beekeeper,” which also opened the fest. \n\n\tThe jurors called it a “courageous, melancholic portrait of a life illuminated by longing and shadowed by loss – in which the unspoken carries more weight than words. When vulnerability finally dissolves the quiet façade, we are offered a delicate yet profound catharsis: love, and grief.”\n\n\tThe film also resonated with the viewers, claiming the Audience Award. \n\n\tEmilie Thalund’s “Weightless” won the Fipresci Award and the Sven Nykvist Cinematography Award for Louise McLaughlin. Meanwhile, Iván Blanco’s “Malandro Moon” won Best Nordic Documentary. \n\n\tDuring the event, the festival also spotlighted Noomi Rapace, who picked up the Nordic Honorary Dragon Award, and Polish director Agnieszka Holland (Honorary Dragon Award).  \n\n\tRapace dedicated the award to her son. “This award is so much bigger than me. There’re so many people behind me: My teachers, my mentors, the people around me,” she said during the ceremony. \n\n\t“I can’t speak about everyone, so I decided to speak about one person today: my son Lev, who has been my closest witness and my truth-teller. Who has grounded me and guided me, and who has been the person I learnt from the most. He always holds me accountable, makes me want to be braver and go further.”\n\n\tYou can find a full list of awards here:\n\n\tDragon Award Best Nordic Film\n\n\t“The Last Resort” by Maria Sødahl\n\n\tDragon Award Best Acting \n\n\tAdam Lundgren for “The Quiet Beekeeper”\n\n\tSven Nykvist Cinematography Award\n\n\tLouise McLaughlin for “Weightless”\n\n\tFIPRESCI Award\n\n\t“Weightless” by Emilie Thalund\n\n\tAudience Dragon Award Best Nordic Film\n\n\t“The Quiet Beekeeper” by Marcus Carlsson\n\n\tDragon Award Best Nordic Documentary\n\n\t“Malandro Moon” by Iván Blanco\n\n\tThe Ingmar Bergman Debut Award\n\n\t“Bouchra” by Meriem Bennani and Orian Barki\n\n\tDragon Award Best International Film\n\n\t“Calle Malaga” by Maryam Touzani\n\n\tYouth Jury Dragon Award \n\n\t“My Father’s Shadow” by Akinola Davies Jr.\n\n\tDraken Film Award \n\t\n\n\t“Uncle Ali and I” by Shahab Mehrabi\n\n\tHonorary Dragon Award \n\n\tAgnieszka Holland \n\n\tNordic Honorary Dragon Award \n\n\tNoomi Rapace \n\n\tStartsladden – Best Swedish Short\n\n\t“All That Remains of Me” by Christer Wahlberg \n\n\tStartsladden Cinematography Award \n\n\tChristine Leuhusen for “Without Kelly” \n\n\tStartsladden – Audience Award \n\n\t“All That Remains of Me”\n\n\tThe Church of Sweden Angelos Film Award\n\n\t“The Patron” by Julia Thelin. \n\n\tThe Nordic Series Script Award \n\n\tIngeborg Topsøe, writer of “Secrets We Keep”\n\n\tCreative Courage Award\n\n\t“Blood Cruise,” produced by Alexander Rönnberg from Northern Fableand and Will Tennant from Imaginarium Productions and commissioned by Johanna Gårdare and Sonja Nilsson Hermele from SVT.\n\n\tNordic Film Market Awards\n\n\t“Out of Athens” by Badrudin Ga’ur\n\n\t“Chentian” by Suha Arraf\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Studio” has canceled its panel at Apple TV’s upcoming press day after star Catherine O’Hara died on Friday.\n\n\t“The Studio” was just one of the many scheduled panelists at the Apple TV press day, set for Tuesday at the Barker Hangar in Los Angeles. The streamer announced the cancellation on Friday shortly after O’Hara’s death. According to the program, O’Hara was not slated to attend the panel alongside her scheduled co-stars Seth Rogen, Ike Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn and Chase Sui Wonders\n\t\n\n\t“We are all heartbroken by the loss of Catherine O’Hara,” Apple and Lionsgate said Friday in a joint statement. “An undeniable legend, icon, and incomparable talent, Catherine elevated every project she was a part of, including the singular genius she brought to her role on ‘The Studio,’ and every transcendent performance she gifted to us. Her artistic accomplishments will forever bring humor, light, and love for generations to come, and her brilliance and generosity of spirit touched everyone around her. We will hold her in our hearts always, and extend our thoughts and deepest sympathies to her husband Bo, and children, Matthew and Luke.”\n\n\n\tO’Hara’s manager announced Friday that the “Home Alone” star had died in her Los Angeles home after a brief illness. She was 71.\n\n\tO’Hara’s prolific comedy career started with the Canadian sketch comedy show “Second City Television” and ended with a late-career renaissance that included “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” “Schitt’s Creek” and “The Studio.” After her death, there was an outpour of remembrances and tributes from the Hollywood community.\n\t\n\n\t“Really don’t know what to say… I told O’Hara when I first met her I thought she was the funniest person I’d ever had the pleasure of watching on screen. ‘Home Alone’ was the movie that made me want to make movies,” Rogen, co-creator and star of “The Studio,” wrote on Instagram. “Getting to work with her was a true honour. She was hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous… she made me want to make our show good enough to be worthy of her presence in it. This is just devastating. We’re all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it.”\n",

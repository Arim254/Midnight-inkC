    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” has roared to a phenomenal start in China, setting multiple box office records and signaling strong momentum for the animated sequel’s global rollout.\n\n\tThe film, a buddy cop movie with anthropomorphic animals as the bickering partners, earned $34 million on its opening day in China, per numbers from Disney, marking the highest opening day and highest single-day box office ever for a U.S. animated film in the territory. The performance also represents the strongest opening day for any U.S. title in China since May 2021.\n\t\n\n\tThe opening day ranks as the 10th highest opening day of all time for a U.S. release in China overall. Social scores have been excellent, with the film earning a 9.7 rating on Maoyan, comparing favorably to the original “Zootopia” (9.5), “Inside Out 2” (9.1) and “Ralph Breaks The Internet” (8.8).\n\n\n\tGlobally, “Zootopia 2” has accumulated an estimated $81.1 million, with $39.5 million from domestic markets and $41.6 million from international territories. The film opened Wednesday in 17 markets, including France, Germany, Italy, China and Korea.\n\n\tThe domestic opening day performance marked the second highest Wednesday before Thanksgiving of all time, behind only “Moana 2” ($57.9 million), and the third highest domestic opening day for a Walt Disney Animation Studios animated title behind “Moana 2” and “Frozen 2” ($42.2 million).\n\n\tAudience reception has been strong across the board, with the film earning 95% from Rotten Tomatoes audiences, an “A” CinemaScore and 4.5 out of 5 stars from PostTrak.\n\n\tBeyond China, “Zootopia 2” secured the number one position in most international markets. In Korea, the opening day marked the fifth highest animated opening day of all time and the second highest opening day among all Walt Disney Animation Studios films behind “Frozen 2.” The film earned $1.7 million in the territory, with social scores of 9.30 on Naver and 98% on CGV.\n\t\n\n\tIn Europe, the film achieved the highest MPA animated opening day of 2025 in France, Germany and Italy, earning $2.4 million, $700,000 and $600,000 respectively.\n\n\tThe sequel continues its rollout this weekend and will be open in approximately 93% of the international landscape by Sunday, including all markets except Japan, which opens the following weekend.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt has been a while since the “Cold War” craze and its three Academy Award nominations, but its Polish breakout star Joanna Kulig will soon reunite with director Paweł Pawlikowski once again. \n\n\t“I’m singing in his next film,” she says. In the anticipated drama, starring Sandra Hüller, known as “1949/Vaterland,” Pawlikowski will explore the life of Thomas and Erika Mann in post-war Germany. \n\n\n\t“This will be our fourth collaboration. I’m so proud this film exists, especially in these difficult times post-pandemic and strikes. Cinema is still fighting back.”\n\t\n\n\tKulig’s extensive run on the awards circuit – which coincided with her becoming a mother to a baby boy – raised her international profile, but she resisted the pressure to pursue solely U.S. projects. At Torino Film Festival, she’s presenting Nora Jaenicke’s psychological thriller “Isola.”\n\n\t“Right after ‘Cold War,’ things got a bit crazy. I know some people expected me to stay [in the U.S.], but one reason why I’ve always admired Paweł Pawlikowski is that he has his own, very specific way of developing films. You have to find something that works for you and brings you peace and joy, instead of listening to all these external voices,” she notes. \n\n\t“’Cold War’ opened me up to multiculturalism and so many new opportunities. They probably wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for that film. However, I also want to have a family life, and I think I’ve achieved that balance right now.” \n\n\tFollowing Berlinale opener “She Came to Me” and Apple TV+ miniseries “Masters of the Air,” she’s focusing on European productions. \n\t\n\n\t“They’re much closer. With ‘Isola,’ I could do so many things in Warsaw. I’ve always wanted to have a base, a permanent place of my own, and I’ve managed to build it now. It’s funny, because people in Poland keep asking me: ‘Oh, so you’re back?’ I never left!,” she laughs.\n\n\t“We Poles are incredibly open to learning new languages and entering new working environments. There’s still this thought at the back of our head that we’re not good enough, which is a remnant from the communist era. My generation believed that the West was better somehow, but it’s time we learnt to appreciate ourselves.” \n\n\tBefore Pawlikowski’s latest, Kulig gets to sing in Jaenicke’s film as well, where she plays the much younger wife of a dying man, also named Joanna. Stuck on a remote island, she’s happy to welcome new caretaker Ada (Fanny Ardant), but Ada’s affection soon turns into obsession. \n\n\tJaenicke explains: “It was a Sicilian song because at first, the film was supposed to be set in Stromboli. We needed a brief moment when they could connect. They don’t need words; they just look at each other. This song really moves Ada and she gets to see a wild side of Joanna that wants to break free from being just a wife.” \n\n\t“When I got to know Joanna [Kulig], her character rewrote itself, in a way. She has this intense gaze and she can look so angelic, but then there’s a shift. I saw a little bit of a devil in her too.”\n\n\t“Isola” is produced by Manish Mundra, Ariens Damsi and Jaenicke for Drishyam Films International and Eliofilm. \n\n\tJaenicke, who is making her feature debut, also wanted to show Ardant in a different light. “We haven’t really seen her in a role like this before. Fanny said she liked Ada because ‘she isn’t likeable’.” \n\n\tThen again, nobody is likeable in “Isola.” According to co-star Marco Rossetti, playing Joanna’s love interest, Jaenicke’s film has a noir feel, with all the characters inflicting psychological and physical violence on each other and ultimately being united by their “ambiguous morality.”\n\n\t“It’s almost like some archetypal story,” the director sums up.\n\n\t“Ada comes into Joanna’s life when she’s already thinking about breaking free from her pattern: she always ends up with people who try to control her. In a way, it’s a feminist story. But then it’s another woman who suddenly dominates her, just like a man.” \n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Director Commentary (Updated Nov. 27, 2025): Park Chan-wook makes his first appearance in the projected best director lineup this season, signaling a meaningful shift in an already fluid race. His precision-crafted work on Neon’s “No Other Choice” has quietly built momentum across the fall festivals, winning audience awards, and as shown in the latest forecast, now stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the year’s most formidable contenders.\n\n\tElsewhere in the field, Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” continues to climb with purpose and resonance after its strong showing with Critics Choice’s shortlist announcement. The film’s blend of muscular storytelling and cultural urgency has made it one of the season’s most widely admired entries, keeping Coogler firmly entrenched among the top contenders. If the momentum holds, Coogler could make history as the first Black filmmaker to win the Oscar for best director — a barrier the Academy has yet to break in nearly 100 years. \n\n\tWith titles such as “One Battle After Another,” “Hamnet” and “Sentimental Value” continuing to secure industry admiration, the race remains competitive and incredibly unpredictable. As precursors begin to roll out next week and late-year screenings intensify, the field appears poised for further evolution.\n\n\tNext stop…the Gothams Awards in New York City, which will be handed out as James Cameron’s anticipated “Avatar: Fire and Ash” is premiering in L.A.\n\n\tBig week ahead.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed category classifications are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: \"Sentimental Value\" (Courtesy of Cannes Film Festival)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of 20th Century Studios\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Jean-Louis Fernandez/Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Credit: Quim Vives\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection / A24\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 1 of “Stranger Things.”\n\n\tNot even on the fantastical “Stranger Things” can Karen Wheeler kill a Demogorgon while armed only with her super-charged maternal protectiveness and a broken wine bottle. But she sure did try.\n\n\tKaren — the perpetually bewildered, out-of-the-loop mom of Mike, Nancy and Holly Wheeler, played since Season 1 by Cara Buono — finally is clued into the existence of Hawkins’ deadly other dimension when no less than a Demogorgon enters her home, hellbent (literally) on stealing her youngest child, Holly (Nell Fisher). Though she’s been drinking all night, and is intent on taking a nice, relaxing bath, Karen snaps into focus, desperate to save Holly. As the ABBA song “Fernando” plays, Karen holds Holly under the water of her bubble bath, disguising them. Then, in the kitchen, Karen pushes Holly away from the Demogorgon, breaks a wine bottle and determinedly says, “Stay away from my daughter!,” emphasizing every word. She then goes wild, stabbing away at the other-worldly creature. But Karen can’t win: By the time Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) get to the Wheeler house, she’s been mauled, nearly to death, as the Demo fulfills his orders to take Holly to the Upside Down.\n\n\tBuono has had a long, fruitful career, in theater, film and on television, where she’s appeared in such shows as “The Sopranos,” “Person of Interest,” “The Girl From Plainville” and many more. On “Mad Men,” she played the formidable Dr. Faye, who sees Don Draper for who he is, meaning that in the end, he couldn’t deal with her at all — but Buono was nominated for an Emmy for guest actress in a drama for the role.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoe Chrest as Ted Wheeler and Cara Buono as Karen Wheeler \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSince July 2016, Buono has played Karen, the stalwart but thwarted Wheeler mom on “Stranger Things.” Karen has always been on the periphery of the show’s action, with her children Mike and Nancy constantly heading into danger without her knowledge. Until “Stranger Things 5,” the Wheeler home has been a sanctuary for the kids and their friends, with its basement serving as a safe space and headquarters. Even if she’s dissatisfied with her marriage and her life — which manifested in her lusting after Billy, the doomed teenage lifeguard in Season 3 — Karen is there to cook for everyone, and hug them when they’re hurt and scared. “The show has been like a decade of my life, right?” Buono says. “Professionally and emotionally, as a mom — it’s rare to be part of something that long that’s become a cultural heartbeat. It did this impossible thing of touching people all over the world. I meet people from all over the world, and they relate to it.”\n\n\n\tHere, Buono reflects on her time on “Stranger Things” — getting the role, her backstory for Karen (“She’s a functioning alcoholic!”) and getting to kick ass for the first time in five seasons. The ass-kicking was especially gratifying after all this time, she says, and she especially delighted in reading a Season 5 script and seeing that creators Matt and Ross Duffer had written “Karen fucking Wheeler” in the stage directions. “It was just so fun,” Buono says, “with the whole cast and crew clapping.” \n\n\tAnd disclosure: Buono and I knew each other a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tHi!\t\n\n\tAre we allowed to talk as people who’ve known each other?\n\t\n\t\tI think so! I mean, I’m going to disclose that I’ve known you — let’s just say we knew each other in New York City in the late ’90s. \t\n\n\tWhen we were 10! When we were 10 years old. \n\n\t\n\t\tWhen we were very young people — children, really! OK, let’s get down to Karen business. What do you remember about what you knew about “Stranger Things” when you auditioned?\t\n\n\tWell, it was called “Montauk.” I got the script, and I just fell in love with it. I just loved the writing, and just wanted to be on it. I auditioned for it, as we all did back in the day, in person, before there was self-tape. I was in the mix, as they say — and I was obsessed with it. The Duffers were on Facebook at the time, when we were all on Facebook, and I wrote them a message and said, “Hey, I know I’m in the mix, but I want to be on your show, whether it’s Season 1 or Season 4. I just really believe in it. I just feel a connection to it.” I was really campaigning for it.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhy do you think you loved it so much?\t\n\n\tI love science fiction, and I love D & D. It’s just an instinct for me. I have a feeling. And then when I finally met the Duffers, I said, “OK, these are my people.” I think I was one of the few people they didn’t have to convince, because I was really gunning for it, and championing them. I liked the characters; I loved the story. It was one of those things I just read so quickly.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnd from what I gather, Season 1 was filmed in a bubble — no one knew what was going to happen. What were you thinking during Season 1?\t\n\n\tMy daughter just turned 3, so I was commuting from New York. It’s funny, it was going to shoot in Montauk, Long Island, and when it went to Atlanta, I almost passed because I said, “Oh, I can’t be away from my daughter that long.” But then I said, “Oh, whatever. I’ll just commute.”\n\n\tWhat was so lovely about Season 1 was everyone there loved the show. Everyone was happy to be there, and it was a lot of fun and excitement. And that that still carried on throughout all five seasons, for sure. We’d have lunch together, and hang out a little bit more. And the kids, of course, were just really young kids.\n\n\t\n\t\tOver the first four seasons, Karen is constantly being kept in the dark as to what’s going on with her children and with Hawkins in general. What was that like for you as an actor?\t\n\n\tI think in the ’80s, the clueless mom was prevalent, right? And I think that really works for the comedy of Karen, which I loved, playing — that cluelessness.\n\t\n\n\tAs an actor, I thought, OK, this is really funny, but how do I make this real for myself? And that’s when I came up with this idea that she’s drinking a lot and often, and probably by herself. We don’t see that, but she’s anesthetizing herself, I’d say, in her bedroom, and sneaking the wine. That’s how I justified for myself.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNell Fisher as Holly Wheeler \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid you ever feel left out? Like, I’m playing a character who’s left out, and therefore I feel left out?\t\n\n\tOh! No, I never felt left out. I just leaned into this idea of Karen being the ultra-clueless mom.\n\n\tAnd in fact, I had a plan for when the series ended, because I thought she’d just be like, “Oh well, that’s the end!” And still remain in the dark forever. I was going to do a YouTube series called “Cocktails With Karen.” Like, people claim this happened and, have conspiracy theories — and evolve into the Karen trope that we have now. I thought, “Oh, I’ll have this whole thing down the line. I’m gonna make a meal out of this one later on.”So I can’t do that anymore.\n\n\t\n\t\tSure can’t. Once you got the script for the second episode, were you like, whoa, this is a whole thing? It’s a massive set piece!\t\n\n\tI was emotional to read it. Of course, I always wanted Karen to be part of the storyline, and get in there and fight and be part of the action. They really leaned into that mom ferocity — like, this quiet character that we sort of underestimated, and then just giving her this moment of courage. I think the audience is going to be excited, but I don’t think they’re going to be surprised, in the sense that Karen is capable of doing it. I think they’ll say, “Yeah, of course — she’s going to definitely defend her family.”\n\t\n\t\tI interviewed Nell Fisher, and we talked about filming the scene in the tub, and how you developed a competition about staying underwater.\t\n\n\tWe did. We did! It was such a joy to work with her, because everyone’s grown up now, so now I had another kid on the set, right? We were very playful. It was just a lot of fun to do all the technical aspects of it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow long did it take to film the scene in the Wheeler house?\t\n\n\tWell, we shot the tank stuff. When you’re in the tank, you think, oh, it’s pretty easy to stay down, but your feet start rising — things would just go wrong. You’re like, “Oh, I need to weight around my waist to keep me down, to keep us from floating up.” These are things you just don’t know until you’re in the water! Making sure the wig stays on; Karen’s makeup always stays on. The mascara came out perfectly.\n\n\tAnd then the actual sequence, running out of the bathroom, down the stairs, into the kitchen, and the slipping on the kitchen floor. Because we come right from the tub to running, we’re drenched. We’re not just a little wet, we are soaking wet. You get dry pretty quickly, so we had to take a lot of breaks to get hosed down as if we had just got out of the tub. So if the hair started to look a little bit dry, they had to wet it down. You had to wet down the nightgown. You had to make sure it was sopping wet — dripping, dripping, dripping at all times.\n\t\n\t\tAt the premiere in L.A., the audience burst into applause when Karen breaks the bottle and tries to stab the Demogorgon. How did that feel? People Iove Karen! \t\n\n\tWith the young fans, I always get this thing of, “I wish you were my mom!” or “you’re such a cool mom.” And I think other parents relate to her devotion, and to her love of her kids. It was a lot of fun to hear the whole audience break into raucous cheering. And also seeing it on a big screen!\n\t\n\t\tWhat was it like to film the scene in the hospital when Karen is struggling to communicate about Mr. Whatsit to Nancy and Mike?\t\n\n\tWhen I saw the final scene of where Nancy finds Karen on the floor in the blood, it seemed like they added more blood in the special effects. But I remember them both showing up, and Millie going, “How does she live?!”\n\n\tThere has to be this balance of reality, but then also it’s “Stranger Things,” right? There are monsters, and there’s the Upside Down. So for me, waking up that moment, and her as a mom, just like, “Where’s my daughter?” I have to get up enough energy to communicate clearly enough information to go get her. She writes “Henry.”\n\t\n\t\tI was also like, “God, she’s so drunk. How is she managing any of this?”\t\n\n\tYour adrenaline can take over, and topple the drunkenness in that case. We’re making it work!\n\t\n\n\tBefore you see Karen sitting on the tub, I had her be much more drunk, and much more unstable. She’s a functioning alcoholic! I mean, to me, she’s been a functioning alcoholic for a long time — especially, I would imagine, after Billy died.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat are you excited for viewers to see in Volume 2?\t\n\n\tWell, we know she doesn’t die. And I love that they saw this for me, and they were always thinking of this. What I’ve learned from the best showrunners, the best creators, is they’ve always had the ending in mind from the beginning. And if you look at Season 1, the Demogorgon is reaching out for Holly at Joyce’s house, and then he comes back for Holly, right?\n\n\tWe see glimpses of Karen, little glimpses of her strength, little insights into her. Not much, but enough that it builds up to how she interacts as a mom — it makes sense. You can see that she’s gonna do this.\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Duffers told us that they tried to make it so everyone’s last day was their final scene. Was that the case for you? \t\n\n\tIn Season 1, I was day one, scene one, take one. And the last day, I was second to last scene, I think. I have two lines that I say at the end. I’ve never done so many takes for two lines, because every time I would open this door, I was about to cry. Like everybody! So it was nice to be in the company of people who are always on the verge of tears, who really understood the moment.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflx\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLook, I’ve been acting for a long time, and I’ve had incredible experiences, and I know when something is really, really special and unique. I’m so grateful for this opportunity, and the length of it. It wasn’t lost on any of us how truly special and meaningful this whole experience was. They let down all this confetti. And there was a big, big ending that was orchestrated with balloons and everything, but we still had to finish it up. I love that they designed it to shoot this scene the last day, and have it circle back to the very first day.\n\n\tAnd my family was there, and everyone’s family was there. I think someday I’ll come up with the right words for it, and be like, “Ah, I wish I would have said this about it.” But it’s just all deep in my heart.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Answer Volume 1 Burning Questions• Noah Schnapp on Will’s Game-Changing Discovery• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler and Working With Max• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume I of “Stranger Things.”\n\n\tNell Fisher, who turned 14 earlier this month, takes center stage as Holly Wheeler in the new (and final) season of “Stranger Things.” Through its first four seasons, the role of Holly — the younger sister of Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), who’ve been central to the show’s story since Season 1 — was played by twins Anniston and Tinsley Price, who were 3 years old when “Stranger Things” premiered in July 2016. Fisher, meanwhile, was living in New Zealand with her family, going to school and beginning to act, scoring a key role in the 2023 horror reboot “Evil Dead Rise.”\n\t\n\n\tFrom there, she auditioned to play Holly Wheeler in early 2023, and after getting the role, Fisher moved to Atlanta later that year to begin filming the final season of “Stranger Things.” And when the curtain rises on the Season 5 premiere, with its 18-month time jump, Holly plays a key role in the show’s endgame. As Volume 1 unfolds, Vecna reveals that Holly and the kids in her grade are somehow part of his evil plan to do … whatever it is he’s planning to do! As such, Vecna, appearing to Holly as the friendly, handsome and clean-cut Henry Creel — whom she calls Mr. Whatsit, inspired by her favorite book, “A Wrinkle in Time” — tries to warn Holly about monsters in Hawkins, Indiana, their town that’s under military quarantine. But since he’s the monster, Henry/Vecna sends a Demogorgon to kidnap Holly to take her to the Upside Down, successfully snatching her from her mom, Karen (Cara Buono), who puts up a valiant, doomed fight against the nearly indestructible monster.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOnce she’s taken, Holly thinks she’s hanging out with Henry (Jamie Campbell Bower) in the Creel house inside Vecna’s carefully constructed fantasy world, but in fact, her physical body is somewhere else entirely — a place where Vecna is controlling her. But it turns out she’s not alone: Max (Sadie Sink), who’s been in a coma since the events of the Season 4 finale (when she even died for a few minutes, becoming Vecna’s fourth victim), is there as well, and reveals herself to Holly at the end of Episode 3. After Holly’s initial shock wears off at the sight of Max, they join forces.\n\n\tFisher now lives in London again (where she was born), and with her parents, Toby and Laura, within earshot, she spoke with Variety over Zoom during a vacation on the Isle of Wight while on a recent school holiday.\n\t\n\t\tI noticed from your Instagram that you seem to have lived in both New Zealand and in the U.K. — for my first question, where are you from?\t\n\n\tI’m not quite sure how to answer this question! My mum is a Brit; my dad is a Kiwi. But my mum used to be a diplomat, and she was an ambassador to New Zealand. I lived in New Zealand for four years, which is where I started my acting. But it was quite a nice coincidence, because that’s where my dad’s from, and that’s where all his family are.\n\t\n\t\tNice! How did you start acting?\t\n\n\tWell, it turns out that the way you break into the industry is by going to New Zealand in the middle of a pandemic! New Zealand was COVID-free, so all the Hollywood studios sent work over to New Zealand. So in 2020, I got a role in “Evil Dead Rise.” I had done this micro-budget film before, but never anything like where I was like, “Oh yeah, I might want to, like, really continue doing this.” It all kind of just snowballed from there.\n\n\tI always have loved performing — like, any form of singing, dancing, acting. Yeah, it’s always been sort of a passion of mine. And my dad was an actor as well. He acted when he was around my age. He’s great; he helps me with all my auditions and stuff.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen we interviewed Matt and Ross Duffer for our cover story, Matt said he’d noticed you in the trailer for “Evil Dead Rise” before casting director Carmen Cuba brought you in to audition. What do you remember from getting the audition?\t\n\n\tSo first I got a self-tape for it. And I was really excited — but I hadn’t actually watched “Stranger Things” beforehand. I had been lobbying to forever. But my mum claimed that it would be too scary for me [long pause] — for her. I was so excited that I got this audition, and I also saw it as my chance to watch “Stranger Things”! But, yeah, I started it and just, like, binged it. I mean, it’s such an incredible TV series.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDo you remember when that was?\t\n\n\tThat was — I want to say March 2023. \n\n\t[Toby, Nell’s dad, says something.]\n\n\tFebruary 2023. \n\t\n\t\tAnd you were 10 or —? Maybe your dad remembers!\t\n\n\tI had just turned 11, but we didn’t actually start filming until January 2024. And so the Duffers thought that they were getting a small, cute, little blonde girl. And I think by the time we had started filming, I had shot up like four inches or something.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you learn that you got the role?\t\n\n\tI was in New Zealand, and I was filming “Bookworm,” which was a movie I did opposite Elijah Wood, and my dad comes up to me, and he says, “The Duffers want to call you.” And I’m like, OK, keep it together, keep it together. I jump on a Zoom call, and they just say that they wanted to offer me the job, and they were really looking forward to working with me. And they actually mentioned they had seen me in “Evil Dead,” which I thought was really cool. When I say I was speechless, I was speechless. I think I sat there with my mouth open for like a minute, and when I did speak, I was like, [long pause] “Thank you!”\n\t\n\t\tWhat had been your audition scene?\t\n\n\tThe scene with Mike in the school corridor, which is actually one of my favorite scenes. I loved filming it with Finn. And my other scene was the scene where I’m talking to the Tiffany cassette tape? Originally in the script, it was a Barbie. I found that scene quite tricky, because I’m rambling and talking out loud.\n\n\tLater in the audition process, I went to New York to do a chemistry read with Sadie, who I have most of my scenes with. I was, like, ridiculously nervous going in. I was, like, shaking. Then I met Sadie, and she put me instantly at ease, and we did the scene after I have just bumped into her in, I don’t even know how to put it —\n\t\n\t\tVecna’s mind space, or something?\t\n\n\tVecna’s mind space situation! It was so lovely meeting her. She’s such an incredible human being. And afterwards, she took me and my dad out for a really lovely lunch.\n\t\n\t\tMatt and Ross said that because the Price twins — who’d played Holly Wheeler until you did — were young that there was no real sense of who Holly was, she was kind of a blank slate. How did you work with them to create the character of Holly?\t\n\n\tAt the start of the series, she’s very much the baby of the Wheeler family. But she’s also not quite ignorant, like her parents are: She has been on the periphery of the Upside Down. In Season 1, she saw the Demogorgon reaching through the wall, and in Season 3, she noticed the trees moving. This season, she really comes face to face with the Upside Down, and with the danger. She’s finding out who she is.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou posted such a nice tribute to Holly in June — have you met the Price twins?\t\n\n\tYeah, I did actually. We went to a trampoline park together. It was so lovely meeting them. I’m really glad to be able to take the role over from them.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMatt and Ross said that before they met you, Holly was more shy. But that you’re so extroverted, and I’m quoting Ross now, they started “infusing Nell’s personality into Holly.” Did you know that was happening?\t\n\n\tI didn’t, actually! This is the first time I’m hearing about that. But that makes sense. I did see a couple script changes, where I did see Holly getting a bit more like out there. \n\t\n\t\tHolly’s older siblings, Nancy and Mike, have been fearless throughout the whole series. What parts of Nancy and Mike did you want to use to create your character?\t\n\n\tThere’s this really lovely scene in Episode 1 where Mike is talking to Holly, and she’s crying, she’s upset. She has this imaginary friend, and she’s very scared. And Mike talks about how he likes to imagine himself as someone else — as Mike the Brave — whenever he gets scared or nervous. Holly really looks up to her big siblings, and she is sort of distant from them — but I think they are people she really admires.\n\t\n\t\tWhen did you realize that it was going to be such a huge role?\t\n\n\tWell, in the audition process, I had a Zoom call with Matt and Ross, and they did say that Holly was going to be a big character. But I don’t think I realized quite how big until I read the script. I was like, “This is awesome!”\n\n\t[Her dad says something that sounds like, “They [inaudible] tell us she needed to spend a year in the U.S.” Nell laughs.]\n\t\n\t\tThey did tell you or didn’t tell you?\t\n\n\tThey didn’t.\n\t\n\t\tSo that was a surprise. What was it like joining the set of a show that’s in its fifth and final season? Were you scared?\t\n\n\tIt was definitely really daunting going in, because you’ve got these people who have worked together and known each other and been friends for almost 10 years now. Going in, I was really nervous, especially because Holly is a big character this season. I wasn’t sure how the others might receive me. But everyone was so welcoming, from the very first day. On my second day of filming, I was doing the breakfast scene with the Wheelers and the Byers, and every single one of them came up and said how lovely it was to meet me, and that they were really excited to see what I was doing this season. That just really put me at ease.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWho did you end up bonding with the most among the cast?\t\n\n\tI think everyone, really. I mean, I spent lots of time with Sadie, and I really enjoyed that. I learned a lot from her, and she’s so lovely. I also spent a lot of time with Cara, who plays my mum, in the bathtub in the Demogorgon attack sequence. We really did develop a close mother-daughter relationship.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about that scene! What was that like to film?\t\n\n\tIt was my favorite part of the year! I say that, and I was also covered in goo, and dripping wet for most of it. But it was so much fun. I loved working with Cara. I love doing stunts — being up in a harness. I think it’s quite crazy. When I watched it, I was like, “That’s about two minutes — but we spent, like, two weeks on it.”\n\n\tCara and I, when we were in the bathtub, we would have this hand signal where we would, like, squeeze each other’s hand three times if we needed to come up for air. \n\t\n\t\tI was going to ask how you filmed that part. Because there’s no way of doing it, I think, without actually being underwater, right?\t\n\n\tYes, it was this bathtub. It was cheated, so it was slightly bigger — one side was glass. We just went underwater, and we spent three days turning to prunes in the bathtub. We had an unspoken — but I think still there! — competition about who could stay under for the longest. And I think it got pretty intense, which probably helped with the acting!\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the competition?\t\n\n\tThe rules weren’t ever made very clear, but we would squeeze each other’s hands if we needed to come up for air and breathe. And as we progressed, the periods of time we stayed under just kept getting longer and longer, and it was clear that you didn’t want to be the person who came up first.\n\t\n\t\tSounds dangerous! Working with Jamie Campbell Bower in his Henry form, is it strange to think of how evil Vecna is?\t\n\n\tI mean, yes, he’s such a brilliant guy. I went to Atlanta for a week in 2023, in December, when we were doing table reads and costume fittings, and meeting the rest of the cast. I was in the middle of a costume fitting, and there was a knock on the door, and my dad went and got it, and he came back in, and he said, “Jamie Campbell Bower wants to meet you, but he’s happy to wait till the end of a fitting.”\n\t\n\n\tJamie was done with his day; he was all ready to go home. But he ended up waiting half an hour, 40 minutes, just so he could meet me and introduce himself.\n\t\n\t\tHad you heard of Tiffany or the song “I Think We’re Alone Now”? That was the soundtrack of my childhood, but I’m an ancient being!\t\n\n\tYeah, so I had heard it a couple times! My dad is quite into forcing his ’80s culture onto us. Which is a good thing most of the time! There’s a scene where I dance around the house, belting it at the top of my lungs. I had to freestyle the dance. I was, like, so nervous for it. But it was so much fun.\n\t\n\t\tMax ends up connecting with Holly in Vecna’s fantasy world — whatever it’s called, which Holly compares to Camazotz in “A Wrinkle in Time.” Mike has Dungeons and Dragons; Holly seems to have “A Wrinkle in Time.”\t\n\n\tBecause she’s very new to this world, and it’s impossible to wrap your head around, she likens it to her favorite book, which is “A Wrinkle in Time.” And so Henry is “IT” or “I.T” — there was quite a big discussion while we were filming whether it would be, whether I should say “I.T” or “IT.” And his mind is Camazotz, and Sadie is Meg’s dad.\n\n\tI’d read it before, but I reread it in preparation for the role. I really love it. It’s a great book\n\t\n\t\tAre you in regular school?\t\n\n\tYeah, I’m in normal school, which I really like. I am a bit of a geek. I do really love my school. It was quite hard last year, keeping up with all the schoolwork. 2024 was incredible, but it was also like, tiring — a year away from my family. This year, I’ve just been going back to school, being a normal kid for a bit. But I’m really excited to see what kind of next year brings.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re going to get a million roles based on this. But do you know what you’re doing next, if anything? \t\n\n\tI’ve got nothing set in stone. But it only really means something to me now, because this is the first time I actually feel like I’m an actor. And I feel like I belong in this world, and I’m no longer just like a sort of lucky kid who stumbled across a film set. And I feel like I’m here to stay now. I’m still really looking forward to just continuing to tell more stories.\n\t\n\t\tDid you like living in Atlanta, or were you happy to come home? Or both?\t\n\n\tI mean, both! I loved living in Atlanta. We rented out a little house in Cabbage Town, which is where most of the other cast were. I developed this strange life and routine. My grandparents are coffee fanatics, and we’d walk 15 minutes to go to the best coffee place, and then we’d come back and go off to set. I developed this really lovely little life that — yeah, I kind of miss it!\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Answer Volume 1 Burning Questions• Noah Schnapp on Will’s Game-Changing Discovery• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe French Embassy’s Institut français d’Indonésie (IFI) has launched the second edition of the Indonesia-France Film Lab, running Nov. 27 through Dec. 1 in Yogyakarta.\n\n\tThe initiative, presented as Indonesia France Film Lab X MTN Lab, takes place within the JAFF Market framework during the 27th Festival Sinema Prancis. The program is partnering with Indonesia’s Ministry of Culture under the Manajemen Talenta Nasional program, the Association of Indonesian Film Producers (APROFI), and the Asian Film Alliance Network (AFAN).\n\t\n\n\tSix emerging Indonesian director-producer teams developing their first or second features have been selected for the lab, which receives additional support from France’s Centre national du cinéma et de l’image animée (CNC) and La Fémis film school.\n\n\n\tThe program comprises two components: a scriptwriting workshop led by French script consultant Eric Collins from La Fémis, and an industry lab featuring five French film professionals. The roster includes Thomas Rosso, general coordinator of La Semaine de la Critique at Cannes; producers Xénia Maingot (Eaux Vives Productions), Jérémie Palanque (Woooz Pictures), Christophe Bruncher (Ici et Là Productions), and Marine Arrighi de Casanova (Apsara Films).\n\n\tSelected projects include M. Dhaffa Attoriq’s “A Mother’s Niqab” from 3 Pulau Pictures, Maarij Reka’s “The Boy with His Mother’s Statue” from Veneirs Films, and Daphne’s “The First Journey of Grief” from Aztec Production. Also chosen were Devina Sofiyanti’s “The Heirlooms” from Qun Films, Fanny Chotimah’s “The Last Dance” from Kembang Gula, and Trinisha Aksa’s “What to Wear for My Own Funeral” from Ujung Pandang Studios.\n\t\n\n\tLooking ahead to 2026, several lab projects will be presented at a CNC-organized co-production meeting featuring Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, with 15 selected projects total. Michel Plazanet, deputy director for European and international affairs at CNC, is participating in this year’s lab, following CNC president Gaëtan Bruel’s Jakarta visit in July.\n\n\tLa Semaine de la Critique has also announced Next Step Studio Indonesia, a short film co-creation program for emerging Indonesian directors launching in May 2026.\n\n\t“Building on the joint cultural strategy between France and Indonesia adopted by our two Presidents last May in Borobudur, the Indonesia-France Film Lab highlights our joint commitment to supporting emerging Indonesian filmmakers, who represent the next generation of talents – ‘the Indonesian new wave.’ It is co-organised and co-funded by the Indonesian ministry of Culture, the French Embassy and Aprofi. With its strengthened curriculum and the strong institutional support of the French National Center for Cinema (CNC) and La Fémis, considered as one of the world’s leading film schools, the Lab has become an important platform for fostering new co-production opportunities,” said Fabien Penone, French ambassador to Indonesia, Timor Leste and ASEAN.\n\n\t“For JAFF Market, the presence of this lab reinforces our mission to become a true meeting point between Indonesian talent and the global film community. It deepens our role as a catalyst – connecting filmmakers, producers, and institutions while creating long-term creative pathways. I see the Indonesia-France Film Lab lab as one of the most strategic collaborations we’ve built. It provides Indonesian filmmakers with direct, consistent access to mentors, methodologies, and artistic approaches that have shaped some of the world’s most influential cinema,” added Gita Fara, head of program for JAFF Market.\n\n\t“The Indonesia-France Lab is a wonderful platform that offers Indonesian filmmakers the opportunity to develop strong scripts, fostering potential for international collaboration and bringing Indonesian projects to the global market,” said Edwin Nazir, chairman of APROFI.\n\n\tSelected Projects:\n\n\t“A Mother’s Niqab” Director: M.

Also, in the main event we have Justin Gaethje versus Paddy Pimblett for the interim lightweight title to see who will face Ilia Topuria later this year on Paramount+. This card is absolutely stacked – every fight is a must-see. This deal is such a huge win for fans with no more pay-per-view. I look forward to 2026 being our best year ever.”\n\n\tAdditonal fights on the card include former UFC men’s bantamweight champion “Suga” Sean O’Malley (18-3-0) vs. Song “Kung Fu Kid” Yadong (22-8-1) as well as Waldo Cortes Acosta (16-2) vs. Derrick Lewis. \n\n\tSee the other fights on the card below. \n\t\n\n\tThe main card will begin at 9 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. PT.

All bouts will be available on Paramount+. \n\n\t“Paramount+ and UFC are transforming the mixed martial arts fan experience,” said Cindy Holland, chair of direct-to-consumer for Paramount. “Every division of Paramount is working in concert to ensure maximum visibility and unparalleled accessibility to current and future fans–making Paramount+ the definitive home of UFC.”\n\n\tUFC 324 is the first event under the $7.7 billion deal between the UFC and Paramount announced earlier this year. For the first time ever, UFC fans in the U.S. and Latin America will be able to watch all marquee numbered events and all UFC Fight Night events exclusively on Paramount+ with no pay-per-view charge. Subscribers in Australia will be able to watch the preliminary fights for all marquee numbered events and all 30 UFC Fight Night events. \n\n\tAdditional UFC 324 Fights: \n\n\tFeatherweights lock horns as No. 6 ranked contender Arnold Allen (20-3, fighting out of Trimley St. Martin, Suffolk, England) takes on No. 11 Jean Silva (16-3, fighting out of São Paulo, Brazil)\n\n\tFormer champions clash as No. 3 ranked women’s flyweight contender Alexa Grasso (16-5-1, fighting out of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico) takes on No. 6 ranked “Thug” Rose Namajunas (15-7, fighting out of Denver, Colo.) in the featured prelim\n\n\tDon’t blink as rising star Ateba Gautier (9-1, fighting out of Doula Cameroon) takes on Andrey Pulyaev (10-3, fighting out of Novosibirsk, Russia) in a middleweight bout\n",

    "description": "\n\tHallmark is bringing in country music royalty for their upcoming holiday film, “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas,” their first collaboration with the Opry",
    "body": "\n\tHallmark is bringing in country music royalty for their upcoming holiday film, “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas,” their first collaboration with the Opry as it celebrates its 100th year. But the cameos — by Pam Tillis, Megan Moroney and Brad Paisley, just to name a few — were only one bullet point on the long list of reasons it’s one of the most touching films of the year.\n\n\tThe power behind it started to hit star Nikki DeLoach, as she was getting her hair and makeup done backstage at the Opry, with Tillis sitting in the chair next to her.\n\t\n\n\t“The music’s on, and she’s just singing to it, and I’m just like, ‘Dear God, keep it together, Nikki. Voice of an angel! This is crazy,'” she told Variety in her dressing room at the Opry. DeLoach has been working with Hallmark Channel for 10 years and reads a lot of scripts. But this, time she didn’t even need to read it to agree to it.\n\n\t“There was no script yet. I heard ‘Grand Ole Opry,’ and I went, ‘Yes.’ Because it has been such a big part of my life since I was a little girl,” she said.\n\n\tDeLoach grew up in South Georgia and was extremely close with her father, whom she calls her “north star.” He passed away in 2021 after a battle with dementia.\n\n\t“Our love language was music. Because of him and my grandmother, I, at 3 years old, knew I wanted to be a performer. And between the two of them, they would get me to my dance lessons and my dad would drive me two hours each way to go to vocal lessons,” she explained. “He would say things like, ‘One day you could be up on that stage,’ and I would be like, ‘Daddy, don’t be ridiculous.’ And one of the places we always talked about going before he got sick was to the Grand Ole Opry together. I had never been because any opportunity that I had had was without him. I always said no, I’m going with my daddy. He got sick. We never got to come together.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “So when this movie came along, and I learned that I was going to be coming to the Grand Ole Opry and getting to set foot on that stage and be a part of this, it just felt divine, like a full circle moment that started when I was a kid and happened decades later. We can’t control timing. When the time is right, the time is right. From the moment I’ve been here, my face has hurt from smiling so hard. I can feel my dad everywhere.”\n\n\tOne thing her father always talked about was Vince Gill’s “silky tone.” Then, the first time she came to the Opry before filming began, she was given a tour and tickets to a show. Vince Gill was the performer.\n\n\t“It’s really a dream come true — not just professionally, but on such a deep personal level,” DeLoach said.\n\n\tDeLoach plays Gentry, a songwriter who gave up her dream after her father, a country icon, died in a tragic accident. In the film, she travels back in time and gets to spend precious time with her father (Rob Mayes). In one scene between the two, Gentry is overcome with emotion — as was DeLoach. Her mom was in tears watching the scene on set, as were the film’s producers, gathered around the monitors in video village.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It’s so hard because I don’t use my personal life in roles. I don’t work with substitution; it’s all imagination and building these characters from the ground up because your experiences as a human are very finite, but imagination is infinite. It also allows me to be able to be emotional, not once, but take two and take three and take four,” she said. “But obviously that truth still lives in there. There is no stopping my little girl self from realizing that the magic of getting to see my dad again, going back in time and having one more minute. Then having to say goodbye to him again and choosing between leaving that and going back to the present…. When I read that in the script, I sobbed like a baby. It’s so beautifully written. That’s real. It also felt like an honoring for anyone who’s lost someone.”\n\n\tDeLoach stars opposite Kris Polaha in the film, who plays Gentry’s lifelong friend and talent manager. The actors had worked together three times before — in “North Shore,” “Awkward,” and “Ringer” — never on a Hallmark project.\n\t\n\n\t“We were backstage and all the artists were preparing to go on stage, practicing in their rooms and doors wide open, so everybody can just hear,” she recalled. “Our jaws are on the ground and Kris just looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, ‘It was just supposed to be this. That’s why we never worked together before because we were waiting for this.'”\n\n\tThe film and its message reminded DeLoach what it is that Hallmark does so well and the reason, in her opinion, it’s only grown in the last decade.\n\n\t“Our why is very clear to me. This is for our audience — everything that we do is for the fans in mind. We don’t have a network without them, and they are a complete reflection of what we are trying to put out into the world, which is community, love, hope and faith and the knowing that at the end of the day, it’s going to be okay,” she explained. “I think that at the end of the 90 minutes of our movie, that’s what everybody feels. We can go through hard things and then we can also be okay in the end. That is what they’re seeking every time they put that TV on. I am that audience. I have navigated my child’s three heart surgeries. I have watched my dad fight one of the most brutal diseases. My grandfather, too. I have watched them take their last breaths in this world. I know that desire and that yearning to just find some space where you can just believe and hope and hold on to that and know that it’s going to be okay at the end of the day.”\n\n\t“A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” airs on Saturday, November 29, at 8 p.m. on Hallmark and streams the next day on Hallmark+.\n",

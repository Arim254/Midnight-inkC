    "body": "\n\tHulu has set the premiere date for “The Testaments,” the followup to the streamer’s hit series adaptation of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” \n\n\t“The Testaments” will drop its first three episodes on April 8, with new episodes dropping weekly thereafter. Like “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the new show is based on the Margaret Atwood novel of the same name. \n\n\tThe official synopsis of the series describes it as “a dramatic coming of age story set in Gilead.” It is said to follow “young teens Agnes (Chase Infiniti), dutiful and pious, and Daisy (Lucy Halliday), a new arrival and convert from beyond Gilead’s borders. As they navigate the gilded halls of Aunt Lydia’s (Ann Dowd) elite preparatory school for future wives, a place where obedience is instilled brutally and always with divine justification, their bond becomes the catalyst that will upend their past, their present, and their future.” \n\t\n\n\tThe cast of the series also includes Mabel Li, Amy Seimetz, Brad Alexander, Rowan Blanchard, Mattea Conforti, Zarrin Darnell-Martin, Eva Foote, Isolde Ardies, Shechinah Mpumlwana, Birva Pandya, and Kira Guloien.\n\n\n\tBruce Miller, who adapted “The Handmaid’s Tale” for TV, serves as the creator, executive producer, and showrunner on “The Testaments.” Warren Littlefield, Elisabeth Moss, Steve Stark, Shana Stein, Maya Goldsmith, John Weber, Sheila Hockin, Daniel Wilson, Fran Sears, and Mike Barker serve as executive producers. Barker also directed the first three episodes. MGM Television is the studio. \n\n\tInfiniti was officially announced as the series lead on “The Testaments” in February 2025. Since then, she has earned substantial praise and multiple award nominations for her role in the Oscar-nominated Paul Thomas Anderson film “One Battle After Another.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tAll3Media has bought a stake in Barnicle Brothers, a New York-based production company whose recent docu series “The Comeback: 2004 Boston Red Sox” won outstanding documentary series at last year’s Sports Emmy Awards. \n\n\tThe Barnicle deal – whose financial structure hasn’t been disclosed — underscores All3Media’s push to expand its unscripted business in the U.S., following the launch of Inner Drive Entertainment, run by Jon Barinholtz and Rob Belushi, and folded into Studio Lambert US; and the addition MindMeld Entertainment, with Jill Goslicky and Vivian Choi. \n\t\n\n\tFounded by Boston-born siblings Nick and Colin Barnicle in 2010, the company has been developing a strong slate of sports and music programming, spanning crime, features and human interest series.\n\n\n\tSome of their best known credits include the 2021 series, “This is a Robbery” which became the #1 watched show on Netflix; as well as the feature documentary “Carol and Johnny” about prolific bank robbers Johnny Williams and Carol Hawkins-Williams, which had its world premiere at Tribeca in 2022. The banner also produced “American Godfathers: The Five Families,” narrated and executive produced by Emmy award-winning Michael Imperioli, for the History Channel. Besides winning a prize at the Sports Emmy Awards, their docu series “”The Comeback: 2004 Boston Red Sox” also turned up in the top 10 most watched programmes on Netflix. Barnicle Brothers is currently in prod on its next feature documentary which will come out this fall. \n\n\t“Nick and Colin are the real deal – masters of storytelling with a crystal-clear creative vision and phenomenal track record,” said Jane Turton, All3Media CEO. “Their development slate is really strong, and I am very excited that All3Media will play a part in supporting them as they build their business,” Turton continued. \n\t\n\n\tThe Barnicle brothers, meanwhile, said, “It had become clear to us that we needed a partner to help us expand and enhance our future plans. We are thrilled that All3Media is now that partner.”\n\n\t“The All3Media team stands out for its dogged support of its producers, its love of storytelling, and for sharing our passion and mantra of ‘good stories, told well,'” the brothers continued. \n\n\tDeadline was first to report the deal. \n",

    "body": "\n\tNBCU publicist Natalia Cedres will join the Television Publicity Executives Committee’s 2026 leadership team, Variety has exclusively learned. The announcement was made by TPEC chair Wendy Zocks, who will remain in her role for another year. \n\n\tIn addition to Zocks, who founded Wendy Zocks Public Relations, TPEC returners also include Beck Media & Marketing CEO Todd Beck, Crunchyroll senior VP of communications Brian Eley, Schlosser Communications founder Joe Schlosser, Disney Branded Television publicist Nancy Insua and MGM+’s global head of PR Eileen Quast. PR executives Irina Bobker and Alice Rao will also return to the team. \n\t\n\n\t“Now in my fifth year in a leadership role for TPEC, I will continue my dedication to the growth of the organization,” said Zocks. “I am thrilled to welcome Natalia to the executive committee and excited to see our New York City presence expand. Many of our colleagues are facing new challenges and we will continue to be a resource for our members and bring opportunities to our membership through our TPEConnect initiative.” \n\n\n\tSince joining NBCUniversal in 2013, Cedres has been a powerhouse in television publicity. For her work as the lead publicist for the four-time Emmy-nominated hit series “This Is Us,” she earned the Maxwell Weinberg Award for television publicity at the 2017 ICG Publicist Guild Awards and the Outstanding Campaign for a Returning Drama at the 2023 TPEC Awards. Her campaign for “Saturday Night Live’s” 50th season and Anniversary Special was recognized with 12 Emmy wins and 20 nominations. \n\t\n\n\tAlongside the leadership news also comes the announcement that TPEC, dedicated to fostering collaboration between senior communications professionals across the television industry, has launched TPEConnect, “an initiative to increase networking and help navigate the changing landscape of programming publicity careers.”\n\n\tThe fourth annual TPEC awards, which honor the best in TV publicity, are now open to submissions. Two new categories, international series and press event, will be added to the awards this year. The Rising Star Award has also been named after industry veteran Robert Pietranton.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“How Brief,” Kelly McCormack‘s Sundance-selected short film inspired by the music of vanished ’50s singer-songwriter Connie Converse, has unveiled a stirring teaser.\n\n\tThe cast of the short, which world premiered at Sundance on Sunday night and will next screen at Manchester Film Festival, includes Tess Degenstein (who also wrote the film), “She-Hulk” star Tatiana Maslany (who is serving on Sundance’s world cinema dramatic competition jury) and Gray Powell (“The Last Frontier,” “Brilliant Minds”). McCormack is a filmmaker and performer, known for their award-winning feature “Sugar Daddy” and acting credits including Eva Victor’s buzzy “Sorry, Baby,” Julio Torres’ “Problemista,” Amazon’s “A League of Their Own” and “George and Tammy” with Jessica Chastain.\n\t\n\n\t“How Brief” is described as “a disappearing act set over the course of one night in 1962 when a restless woman returns to her childhood home for the last time,” according to its official synopsis. “Inspired by the music of singer-songwriter Connie Converse, and accompanied by the poetry of other women who have chosen to vanish, ‘How Brief’ explores one question posed to women: when is oblivion preferable to this life?”\n\n\n\tConverse was active in New York City’s Greenwich Village scene in the ’50s and was one of the first to champion the singer-songwriter genre of music. In 1974, she left her family home and was never seen or heard from again.\n\n\tConverse “wrote one haunting record in the 1950s, then engineered her own exodus,” McCormack says in their director’s statement. “To honor this radical act of self-determination and self-redaction, the short film felt like the appropriate format — told with as much luster and radiance as I could muster, while allowing our protagonist to evade us as she so desired.”\n\t\n\n\tMcCormack continues: The question that propelled this work was not why a woman would choose to disappear, but rather, why wouldn’t she? I wanted to capture all the terror and the glory that comes with accepting this fact. This film was the longest development process of my life, and at every step we took our time, lovingly building towards something short, as in Connie’s words, ‘like life, like your smile, like the fall of a leaf — how sad, how lovely, how short, how brief.'”\n\n\t“How Brief” was produced by Ariel Bond, Lucy McNulty and Jill Orsten and was edited by Kane Stewart. Watch the teaser below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAbby Phillip talks to CNN viewers six days a week on programs including “News Night” and “Table for Five.” But she may have even more to say in weeks to come.\n\n\tPhillip has tapped Envisionary Management, a management firm run by veteran talent representative Jon Rosen, to act on her behalf in discussions with media employers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Rosen referred a query to CNN, and CNN declined to make executives available for comment. Their alliance was stuck several months ago, according to these people. \n\t\n\n\tRosen, a former executive at WME,  in recent years has worked for media personalities including Bobby Flay, Robin Roberts, Willie Geist and Stephen A. Smith ,among others. In Smith’s case, Rosen assisted in devising a new contract with Walt Disney and ESPN that gives the sportscasting veteran the chance to develop other business under his own aegis.\n\n\n\tPhillip hasn’t been at CNN as long as anchors such as Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper, but her place in the network’s pantheon of personalities has become more noticeable in recent months. “News Night,” one of CNN’s more unorthodox programs, has won traction among key viewers — people between 25 and 54 — by featuring a roundtable of often ungovernable panelists who squabble over the headlines of the day, and routinely assent to Phillips’ journalist authority. She is able to navigate among outspoken personalities including conservative commentator Scott Jennings and centrist Republican Ana Navarro, as well as other partisans.\n\n\tThe show’s ratings are good for CNN, but the network continues to grapple with how to keep viewers coming in regularly. In 2025, CNN saw its primetime viewership in the 25-54 demographic fell 31% from the prior year, according to data from Nielsen, while its overall viewership in the same time period fell 16%.\n\t\n\n\tSome critics and observers have noticed how different the program is for CNN, which for years has tried to put more spotlight on newsgathering and less on so-called “hot talk.” CNN CEO Mark Thompson, who has championed other non-traditional offerings, including Saturday night comedy-news hybrids led by Roy Wood Jr. and Bill Maher, is said to have been a strong proponent of the format for Phillips’ show, which shares a name with a previous hour-long CNN program anchored by Aaron Brown.\n\n\tHer “Table for Five” offers a similar format on the network Saturday-morning schedule.\n\n\tPhillips’ representation decision surfaces as Warner Bros. Discovery is pursuing a spin off of its traditional cable assets after striking a deal to sell its studio and HBO Max streamer to Netflix.\n\n\tCNN may need to keep an eye on its relationships with key talent after its future parent becomes more dependent on the revenue and profit it generates. Warner recently disclosed  that CNN was expected to generate $600 million in profit in 2026, down from what was once $1 billion each year around the 2016 and 2020 elections. The company also projected that CNN generate revenue of $1.8 billion in 2026, rising by $100 million in each of the next four years to hit $2.2 billion by 2030.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGuy Fieri had to spend considerably more time working on Bosch’s new Super Bowl commercial than he does on the short-order fare regularly displayed on his Food Network program “Diners. Drive-ins and Dives.”\n\n\tOn the long-running series, recipes like Baked Lemonade Pork Chops and Deep-Fried Chicken Cordon Blue are assembled and plated in minutes.  preparations for Fieri’s’ appearance in the Big Game spot, on the other hand, went on for “about six months,” the celebrity chef acknowledges during a recent interview. “We spent all of ’25 doing it,” he says, including conversations about wardrobe, hairstyle and voice. Bosch even asked Fieri to consider shaving his signature goatee (he couldn’t, because he was in production on a different Food Network series).\n\t\n\n\tIn the spot, Fieri undergoes a makeover to portray “Just A Guy,” a character who “settles for whatever there is in the kitchen. “ But a potential Bosch customer would not. “I tell people all the time, whenever they’re cooking, they often don’t have enough BTUs, they don’t have the right equipment,” says Fieri. “One part of the puzzle to making great food is keeping the food fresh or fire fresh, and that includes having enough feet of connections to use for having of induction cooking or just whatever it is. You make the best dish in the world, and eat it on a plate that’s not properly cleaned or has soap residue, you got a big problem.”\n\n\n\tThe work represents Bosch’s second consecutive effort to stir things up at the Super Bowl, which will air February 8 on NBC, which has been seeking between $7 million and $10 million for a 30-second spot in the game.  In 2025, the maker of power tools and appliances tapped Antonia Banderas to portray a suave operative playing alongside an actor imitating professional wrestler Randy “Macho Man” Savage. The new commercial’s sole focus on Fieri suggests the company has been fine-tuning its marketing recipe.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s also Fieri’s second time on the Super Bowl ad roster. In 2022, he took on a role as “Mayor of Flavortown” to help Anheuser Busch InBev launch a new line of Bud Light Seltzer Hard Sodas. Executives at the time, he says, “let me have my say on, you know, what was right and what was not and where we needed to adapt,” something he feels is important for the overall effort.\n\n\tMaking a Super Bowl commercial can be even more intense than whipping up a big dinner for an important crowd. “Oh, they both have their level,” Fieri says, and the key thing to keep in mind is “not wanting to disappoint.” In both situations, says Fieri, “you find that you dig deepest when you’re in a pressure situation, or at least I do.”\n\n\tThe Food Network personality doesn’t strike endorsement deals willy-nilly. “Authenticity to me is it,” he says. “You can’t pay me to talk about something that I don’t believe in.” He scrutinized everything from corporate philanthropy to “just the way they treated the crew.”\n\n\t“I’ve got to feel right about it. They’ve got to feel right about it,” he says. “We’ve got to meet at the top of the mountain.” Or, in February , in close proximity to a well-scrutinized football game.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Paley Center for Media’s annual PaleyFest LA started out in its early run with a hefty slate of classic TV reunions before turning its focus in recent years to mostly current shows. But the 2026 edition promises a big one: The 50th anniversary of landmark ABC crime drama “Charlie’s Angels,” with stars Kate Jackson, Cheryl Ladd and Jaclyn Smith set to attend.\n\n\tAnother reunion this year also doubles as a celebration for the return of ABC’s and Hulu’s “Scrubs,” as that show gets a revival. Other PaleyFest LA panels this year include Apple TV’s “Pluribus,” “Shrinking” and “Your Friends & Neighbors,” HBO Max’s Emmy-winning “The Pitt” and Netflix series “Emily in Paris” and “Nobody Wants This.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Pitt,” “Shrinking” and “Nobody Wants This” had previously been announced. This year’s PaleyFest LA will once again be held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, from April 4 to April 12 — just weeks after the Oscars are held at that venue. \n\n\n\tThe PaleyFest is sponsored by Citi, while William S. Paley Foundation is the founding benefactor.

    "body": "\n\tAlex Gibney’s new Sundance documentary “Knife” includes never-before-seen footage of a brutal 2022 attack on Salman Rushdie in Chautauqua, N.Y.  \n\n\tRushdie, who had traveled to the bucolic resort town to give a discussion on free expression, was stabbed multiple times by Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old man who was upset about “The Satanic Verses,” a 1988 novel about the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad that inspired Ayatollah Khomeini to issue a death order on the novelist. It’s shocking to see Matar thrust his knife repeatedly into Rushdie’s neck, face and abdomen as onlookers rush to the stage to try to restrain the attacker. However, it was something that Rushdie believed needed to be shown in all its gory savagery.\n\t\n\n\t“People should see what terrorism looks like and experience it,” Rushdie said at Variety‘s Sundance Studio presented by Audible.\n\n\tThe documentary, the full title of which is “Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie,” includes footage of Rushdie in his hospital room in the days after the attack that was filmed by the author’s wife, Rachel Eliza Griffiths. The camera does not shy away from chronicling his wounds — Rushdie ultimately lost the eye that is shown bulging out of its socket, and his neck and chest are a horror show of stitched together pieces.\n\n\t“A few days after the attack, Salman was seeming more like himself, and he asked me if I would make some portraits of him to document what was happening,” Griffiths, who is a novelist and poet, said. “We then begin to kind of have these video diaries and conversations that we were making purely for ourselves in a moment of trauma. We could still be storytellers with the camera, and that felt really important.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter Rushdie returned to his normal life and began work on a memoir chronicling the experience, the couple enlisted Gibney to see if he could turn their footage into a documentary. They felt they needed someone with an outsider’s perspective. Gibney decided the film shouldn’t just be about the attack that nearly ended Rushdie’s life, but should also showcase bond that sustained him throughout his recovery. \n\n\t“It really was Alex’s idea that we needed to flesh out the story and have it not just limited to an account of a crime, that it should also be a human story about a relationship,” Rushdie said. \n\n\tThe film concludes with Rushdie and Griffiths returning to the amphitheater in Chautauqua where he was stabbed. \n\n\t“Quite early on in the process of of recovery, it became something that was just a bee in my bonnet that I felt I needed to go and show myself that I was standing up in the place where I fell down,” Rushdie said. “I felt that that would just be psychologically important for me.”\n\n\tIn the film, Rushdie sometimes expresses frustration over the fact that he will be remembered as much for the constant threat he faced in defense of free speech as for the novels he wrote. But “Knife” still sounds a clarion call, arguing that this American principal must be defended.\n\n\t“There are all sorts of assaults of free speech right now, and maybe this story helps people think about that and understand how valuable it is,” Rushdie said. “One of the reasons why people like me came to live in America was the First Amendment, and it’s enormous emphasis on freedom of expression.”\n\n\tFor his part, Gibney is upset at how the media conglomerates that own film and TV studios, as well as major news networks, have shied away from producing material that is critical of the Trump administration. Often the president has used lawsuits, such as the ones he filed against “60 Minutes” and ABC News, to exert control over coverage. \n\n\t“It’s shameful in terms of the way that many of the mainstream media organizations have bent the knee,” Gibney said. \n\n\tMore than three years after the attack, Rushdie insists he has no fear about going out into public, even though he is taking more security precautions. \n\n\t“I’m still lacking an eye, but emotionally I feel past it,” Rushdie said. “I realize that I’m kind of tougher than I thought I was.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tNow in his sixth year at the helm of the Grammy Awards, Harvey Mason Jr.’s tenure has been anything but easy. Amid the pandemic, last year’s wildfir",
    "body": "\n\tNow in his sixth year at the helm of the Grammy Awards, Harvey Mason Jr.’s tenure has been anything but easy. Amid the pandemic, last year’s wildfires in the Grammys’ home base of Los Angeles, the ugly ouster of his predecessor Deborah Dugan, and several controversies around winners and nominees — some valid, some less so — he has worked tirelessly to update the Record Academy’s membership and voters and all of its operations, bring estranged artists back into the fold, and has moved quickly and decisively when problems have arisen.\n\t\n\n\tPerhaps most significantly, he has mobilized the Grammys’ membership, staff, and its charitable partner MusiCares to help music people in need, between distributing over $25 million in pandemic relief and, along with fundraising during last year’s Grammys, a total of $24 million toward wildfire relief.\n\n\n\t“We’ve given out pretty much all the money over this last year to music people who needed help — that’s a massive stat,” he says. “I’m so proud of the show and proud of what our music community does when it comes together, and last year was a perfect example of that.”\n\n\tSunday’s show, taking place this Sunday at the Grammys’ longtime home of the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, will see Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga and Bad Bunny competing for the biggest awards, and performances from Sabrina Carpenter and all eight best new artist nominees, with many more performances expected to be announced this week. It will also mark the Grammys’ final show in a 50-year run with CBS, the Academy has signed a new $500 million, 10-year deal with Disney to bring the ceremony to ABC, Disney+ and Hulu.\n\t\n\n\tVariety spoke with Mason — himself a veteran songwriter, producer and musician with Jennifer Hudson, Toni Braxton, Lionel Richie and many others — late Friday about the show, the Disney deal, Trevor Noah’s sixth and final turn as host, the ongoing challenge of ensuring the Academy and the show reflect the music world as it is, and the latest controversy: a surprisingly low turnout for country music in the main awards.\n\n\tHow’s it going so far? \n\n\tIt’s going so well, I’m really enjoying this year and the fact that there’s not an external factor like fires or a pandemic — well, hopefully I don’t jinx it, but so far it’s going really well and the show is shaping up to be  incredible: great artists, a great range of genres and experiences, young people, icons, superstars. It feels really good.\n\n\tAre a lot more performer announcements coming?\n\n\tYeah, how they decide to roll it out is over my pay grade, but it’s a great lineup of artists this year.\n\n\tIt seems like they’re being announced later than usual. Was that intentional? \n\n\tI think that’s just the function of how the world works now, the attention economy and trying to make sure that things are announced closer to the show — “Oh, the performance by this artist is going to happen this week,” instead of announcing weeks ago. A lot of it is driven by our artist community, and we tend to announce when they ask. \n\n\tIt’s your last year with CBS — maybe not bad timing! — how do you feel about moving over to Disney and ABC next year?\n\n\tWe’ve definitely had an incredible run with CBS — 50 years, and we’ve done great things together. This will be our last show together and we’re going to celebrate that partnership. But we’re also excited about the future, and I think what ABC-Disney brings to the partnership is a fresh perspective, and obviously the reach of their platform and their ecosystem. It’s exciting and an opportunity to do more storytelling, more content around music and music people. So we’re thankful for our old partnership and excited about the new one. \n\n\tWhich other platforms are you referring to?\n\t\n\n\tThey just have such a wide ecosystem. It’s not just ABC, it’s Disney Plus,  Hulu,  ESPN, the parks, the cruise ships. They’re everywhere, and they place such an importance on creators and creativity and art and music. It’s a culture that’s exciting to us and an opportunity to do more and reach more people. \n\n\tWhy is Trevor stepping down? \n\n\tI don’t want to speculate, honestly, on why he’s stepping down. But what I will say is that he’s been an amazing host for us for six years. He’s a bit of a unicorn because to me he’s the perfect mix of funny and smart and entertaining, and quick on his feet. But the thing that I have really loved about him over the last six years is that you can tell he’s a music fan. When he gets on the stage, he’s geeking out on the performers and singing and dancing along with them. I can say for sure the show wouldn’t be where we are now without Trevor’s input.\n\n\tIs Ben Winston going to stay on? \n\n\tYes. \n\n\tLooking bigger picture at the membership, over the last six years you’ve… I don’t want to say upgraded —\n\n\tI like to say “evolved”!\n\n\tDo you feel like it’s where it needs to be at this moment, in terms of representation? \n\n\tAt the moment, yes, it is feeling very well balanced. But the moment is changing, and it continues to change every week, every month, all year long, and we’re going to keep an eye on how we can make sure we’re being reflective of what’s going on in music, so from time to time, we’ll need to add more members in different genres — maybe there’ll be a category member, producer, or an engineer that we’ll need more of. And that’s work that we do literally 365 days of the year.\n\n\tAnd as membership classes come up, we do the work, we reach into different communities, and we invite people to be a part of our membership because there’s nothing more important than our members. It’s never going to be exact, it’s never going to be perfect. But we will absolutely be paying attention to it and adjusting as we need to. \n\n\tDo you think that adjustments will be made in light of what was a surprisingly low representation for country music in the big categories this year? It’s almost red meat for the right wing that country, which is so popular, was closed out of a lot of the bigger categories. It’s what people used to say about hip-hop. \n\t\n\n\tYeah, and I really hope it doesn’t turn into that type of dialogue based around politics or right or left, because it really is not that; it’s really about what the voters choose to vote for every given year, and it is cyclical. There have been other times where there’s been different representation. We will be looking into all our genre categories and the voters associated with them and making sure they are balanced, like we do every year. And after this year, we’ll do it again.\n\n\tIt’s generally not based on who gets nominated, though, to tell you the truth. It’s based on, do we have a representative voting body of the different genres? And provided that we have the right percentage and ratios, then we’ll be in the right spot. We can’t tell what those people will vote for, but we can make sure that we have a representative voting body. \n\n\tDo you have any thoughts on why it turned out that way this year? In 2018, the year that both Kendrick Lamar and Jay-Z were big nominees, it felt like they split the vote. I know we’re talking about nominees here, but do you feel like something like that might have happened? It must be really difficult to pinpoint because it’s such a long process from the voting body to the end result. \n\n\tIt is, and it’s hard to predict why we get the results that we do. All I know is it’s heartbreaking for me when somebody’s not represented, whether that’s an individual artist or a genre, because I know how hard people work in this business. I want us to make sure we’re getting it right, so we continue to do everything we can as an organization, along with our elected leaders, to make sure we’re positioning our voters to make the best decisions they can.\n\n\tHow do you determine whether a genre or region is fairly represented?\n\n\tAgain, we look at the number of voters and make sure that it matches the amount of music that’s being created in that specific genre or region or that age group. There’s so many different ways of cross-sectioning it, but we have to make sure we have enough qualified voters representing genres not even just in the general field, but in the specific genre categories.\n\n\tI think the question you’re trying to get to is, [do a year’s results] change how we recruit? I would say it’s more towards the underpinning of the process, which is the number of members that we have that represent the genre, as opposed to being specifically around outcomes. \n\t\n\n\tDo you still have time to produce and make music? \n\n\tYes! I am getting in the studio late at night and whenever I have free time. I think staying in the studio and working with other writers and producers and artists keeps my eye on what’s going on in the industry and how we can make sure we’re serving our members. Me being a producer and a writer has given me unique access to the community because I know so many of the people that we represent artist-wise and member-wise. So when we have an issue or somebody has a complaint or a suggestion, I’ll oftentimes just reach out and call them directly and say, hey, I’d love to hear from you. So I’m thankful that I’m able to still do that. If I wasn’t making music, I would just dry up and shrivel away. \n",

    "body": "\n\tYe, formerly known as Kanye West, took out a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal on Monday to issue a formal apology for the disturbing behavior that has made him a pariah in recent years. The hip-hop titan said that he has been getting treatment for a brain condition after last year suffering “a four-month-long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life.”\n\n\tWriting about his manic state in 2025, and noting that he “hit rock bottom a few months ago, Ye said, “As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn’t want to be here anymore.”\n\t\n\n\tYe addressed his history of antisemitic rants, pro-Hitler declarations and embrace of the swastika in the statement, blaming the hate speech on how he “lost touch with reality.” He wrote: “I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment and meaningful change. It does not excuse what I did, though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people.” (Read the full text of the advertisement below.)\n\n\n\tThe lengthy statement begins with Ye addressing it “to those I’ve hurt.” He then discusses the well-known automobile accident he was in a quarter-century ago, shortly before his rise to superstardom. He says he suffered a frontal-lobe injury at that time that was not properly diagnosed until 2023, which he says was the cause of his bipolar condition — a diagnosis he at one time embraced, then was rejecting as false as recently as last year, but is now accepting again.\n\n\t“You feel like you’re seeing the world more clearly than ever, when in reality you’re losing your grip entirely… The scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don’t need help,” he writes in the ad. “It makes you blind, but convinced you have insight. You feel powerful, certain, unstoppable. I lost touch with reality.”\n\t\n\n\tYe had claimed in recent years that he did not suffer from bipolar disorder but rather a form of autism; he now says that it was doctors who were telling him he was autistic and not bipolar. He says he came to understand what he was really going through by reading Reddit forums about the brain disorder, and through help he got at the urging of his wife.\n\n\t“Having bipolar disorder is notable state of constant mental illness. When you go into a manic episode, you are ill at that point. When you are not in an episode, you are completely ‘normal’. And that’s when the wreckage from the illness hits the hardest. Hitting rock bottom a few months ago, my wife encouraged me to finally get help.”\n\n\tThis is not Ye’s first time apologizing for antisemitic statements, although it is the lengthiest and perhaps most significant. He previously offered penitence for his threat to go “Death-con 3” on Jewish people, then seemed to backtrack as he went on to sell the swastika shirts and record a song titled “Heil Hitler” to further antagonize Jews and others he believed were allied against him.\n\n\tAlthough his statement does not mention any current or upcoming work, Ye’s next album, the long-gestating album “Bully,” was recently shown on streaming sites as being set for release this Friday, which some believe may be tied in to the timing of the apology now.\n\n\tThe song “Heil Hitler” made news again last week when a Miami nightclub drew backlash for playing the incendiary track while white nationalist and avowed antisemite Nick Fuentes and brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate were visiting the club, as some patrons reportedly sang along with the title and raised arms in a Nazi salute.\n\n\tThe full text of Ye’s statement:\n\n\tTo Those I’ve Hurt:\n\n\tTwenty-five years ago, I was in a car accident that broke my jaw and caused injury to the right frontal lobe of my brain. At the time, the focus was on the visible damage — the fracture, the swelling, and the immediate physical trauma. The deeper injury, the one inside my skull, went unnoticed.\n\n\tComprehensive scans were not done, neurological exams were limited, and the possibility of a frontal-lobe injury was never raised. It wasn’t properly diagnosed until 2023. That medical oversight caused serious damage to my mental health and led to my bipolar type-1 diagnosis.\n\t\n\n\tBipolar disorder comes with its own defense system. Denial. When you’re manic, you don’t think you’re sick. You think everyone else is overreacting. You feel like you’re seeing the world more clearly than ever, when in reality you’re losing your grip entirely.\n\n\tOnce people label you as “crazy,” you feel as if you cannot contribute anything meaningful to the world. It’s easy for people to joke and laugh it off when in fact this is a very serious debilitating disease you can die from. According to the World Health Organization and Cambridge University, people with bipolar disorder have a life expectancy that is shortened by ten to fifteen years on average, and a 2x-3x higher all-cause mortality rate than the general population. This is on par with severe heart disease, type 1 diabetes, HIV, and cancer — all lethal and fatal if left untreated.\n\n\tThe scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don’t need help. It makes you blind, but convinced you have insight. You feel powerful, certain, unstoppable.\n\n\tI lost touch with reality. Things got worse the longer I ignored the problem. I said and did things I deeply regret. Some of the people I love the most, I treated the worst. You endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to have someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Looking back, I became detached from my true self.\n\n\tIn that fractured state, I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold T-shirts bearing it. One of the difficult aspects of having bipolar type-1 are the disconnected moments — many of which I still cannot recall — that led to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body-experience. I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change. It does not excuse what I did though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people.\n\n\tTo the black community — which held me down through all of the highs and lows and the darkest of times. The black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.\n\n\tIn early 2025, I fell into a four-month-long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life. As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn’t want to be here anymore.\n\t\n\n\tHaving bipolar disorder is notable state of constant mental illness. When you go into a manic episode, you are ill at that point. When you are not in an episode, you are completely ‘normal’. And that’s when the wreckage from the illness hits the hardest. Hitting rock bottom a few months ago, my wife encouraged me to finally get help.\n\n\tI have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places. Different people speak of being in manic or depressive episodes of a similar nature. I read their stories and realized that I was not alone. It’s not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing “symptoms of autism.”\n\n\tMy words as a leader in my community have global impact and influence. In my mania, I lost complete sight of that.\n\n\tAs I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise, and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design, and other new ideas to help the world.\n\n\tI’m not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness. I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home.”\n\n\tWith love,\n\n\tYe\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Andy tells us he's now living at a sober living facility near Beverly Hills as he continues focusing on his recovery. He says he's taking things one day at a time and staying focused on sobriety as he transitions into the next phase of his recovery.\n      \n    \n          We broke the story ... Andy entered a rehab facility in the Palm Springs area around the beginning of December with the help of his \"Celebrity Rehab\" costar and longtime friend Jennifer Gimenez, along with her husband, Tim Ryan.\n      \n    \n          When Andy spoke to us at the time, he said he was grateful to be getting help and motivated to turn things around.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported ... Jennifer and Tim were also able to secure Andy a \"full ride scholarship offer\" through their connections to the treatment center -- meaning his stay in rehab wasn't coming out of his own pocket.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    YouTube/Billy John\n          \n    \n          This all came after a troubling incident in December, when we broke the story of a video showing Andy slumped over on a Hollywood street while bystanders administered Narcan -- a medication used to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose -- to the passed out actor. Paramedics responded to the scene, though Andy was not taken to the hospital.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          A manager for the actor tells TMZ ... he's been hospitalized in Atlanta for the past three days. We're told Quinton was walking up the stairs in his apartment last week when his legs suddenly stopped functioning, causing him to collapse. He was rushed to the hospital.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to a GoFundMe page, organizers claim Quinton is \"on life support due to a severe blood infection.\" However, his manager tells us he's stable, communicating with his family and team, and receiving precisely the care needed at this time.\n      \n    \n          His manager tells us doctors are still running tests and evaluating Quinton's condition, and at this time, there's no definitive word on what caused the fall.\n      \n    \n          We're told Quinton and his family are taking things one step at a time. While they're asking for privacy during this period, his rep says they want fans to know they deeply appreciate the outpouring of love, prayers, and well wishes.\n      \n    \n          The health scare comes after a series of medical battles for the 40 year old actor. In March 2025, he was rushed to a California medical facility after developing a fever and coughing up blood.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          At the time, Aaron said doctors ran multiple tests and believed he was dealing with Type A flu and pneumonia. In 2019, he battled a severe upper respiratory infection.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          In October 2025, Quinton shared his dramatic 200 pound weight loss journey with us.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

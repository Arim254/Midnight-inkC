    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers for the Oct. 30 episode of “9-1-1.”\n\n\tHouston, we have no more problems. \n\n\tOn Thursday’s episode of “9-1-1,” Athena (Angela Bassett) and Hen (Aisha Hinds) finally made it back to Earth after a four-episode arc that had them journeying to and from space. What was meant to be a quick trip up and back as a reward for saving a billionaire’s life turned into Hen and Athena’s personal Apollo 13.\n\t\n\n\tWith help from Hen’s physicist wife Karen (Tracie Thoms) and Athena’s willingness to once again put her life on the line for the people closest to her, “9-1-1” avoided losing two major characters. “9-1-1” hasn’t been shy about killing off major characters, such as Peter Krause’s Captain Bobby Nash last season.\n\n\n\t“Listen, no one’s safe at any moment; we know that” Hinds told Variety. “When you have an adventure as intense as going into space and knowing the fabric, the nature and the DNA of ‘9-1-1’ — you can send us to the safest place on Earth and there is going to be a magnanimous mishap of sorts. So it was like, ‘Where does this go?'”\n\n\tAccording to Hinds, she and Bassett were not informed by “9-1-1” showrunner Tim Minear about their fates heading into the multi-episode arc, and instead the writers “slowly rolled it out for us.” \n\n\t“We didn’t know our next move until we were deep into this move — which was also what added to the adventure of it all,” Hinds said.\n\n\tA pivotal moment in the episode is when Athena insists she be the one to go out into space and attempt to fix the ship so that everyone can get home. Athena tells her best friend Hen that Hen needs to live for Karen and their young kids, but that Athena is willing to risk it all after her husband Bobby’s death, and now that her children are older. This present-day moment comes as viewers are seeing part of Athena’s past where she lost a beloved partner in the field, and grappled with how to move on and live without them.\n\t\n\n\t“It was that moment where I felt the fabric of their friendship,” Hinds said. “When I first signed on to do the show, one of the things they talked to me about was Hen’s character will be best friends with Angela’s character. And that was a selling point for me. And I felt the fabric of that friendship in that moment; grappling with watching her out there and knowing the danger. So all throughout I was like, ‘Are we gonna die? Do we die? And so it made getting out of there and Karen being the one to lead us out of there, that much more gratifying and satisfying. You got us out here in space. Athena’s literally walking in space to try to help save our lives. But she’s doing it willingly in a way that’s feeling like she has nothing more to live for, but helping us to all realize that there is so much more to life. And I’m so glad that she gave it all to be able to get out of there.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Christopher Willard\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut what does all this mean for Hen and Athena now that they need to return to normal life after facing an experience very few people in existence have ever been through?\n\n\t“It was certainly an incredibly traumatic experience, so much so that you get on the ground and all Athena can do is laugh hysterically and it becomes contagious,” Hinds said. “That’s the question is, do you laugh to keep from feeling all of the other emotions and thinking the real thoughts that come along with the fact that you just faced death in a real way, and the uncertainty of that? But then the flip side of looking at that is, now we’re even more fortified. What on Earth could really stop us at this point? What life experiences on the ground could really throw us? That gives us a fortified renewal for life, and an appreciation for our family and the opportunities to get to be reunited with them and do the work that we do.”\n\n\tHinds notes that Hen and Athena “may spend the rest of the season sort of grappling with those two things,” and then added: “Will the trauma of it overwhelm us, or are we so triumphant that we got to land on the ground and see our family again, and so therefore it’s us against the world at this point?”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAranya Sahay‘s “Humans in the Loop” has locked in dual distribution, with Netflix streaming the film stateside from Nov. 10 and boutique shingle One Rising orchestrating a limited theatrical run and impact campaign launching Nov. 7 in L.A.\n\n\tThe drama shadows an Indigenous woman laboring at a data-annotation facility in rural India, where she trains AI systems — exposing the unseen human toll that undergirds the global tech industry. Storiculture and Sauv Films produced the feature, with Mathivanan Rajendran, Sarabhi Ravichandran and Shilpa Kumar serving as producers. Sahay developed the project via a Museum of Imagined Futures fellowship.\n\t\n\n\tIndigenous filmmaker Bijjo Toppo executive produced and mentored Sahay, with Kiran Rao boarding as EP. Rao’s “Laapataa Ladies” represented India at last year’s Oscars race.\n\n\n\tThe film netted Fipresci India’s Grand Prix award. A U.S. release trailer has been unveiled.\n\n\tMisaq Kazimi has come aboard as EP to steer the U.S. campaign. He previously shepherded Iranian auteur Mohsen Makhmalbaf’s “The Gardener” through a similar release.\n\n\t“‘Humans in the Loop’ has the rare ability to merge intimate human storytelling with one of the most urgent global conversations of our time: how we can prevent social inequities from making their way into AI and instead use it to enhance underrepresented voices,” Kazimi said. “We’re excited to help bring the film to audiences in the U.S., whether it’s in theaters, university halls, or intimate community screenings, and engage in conversations around Responsible AI and the role of Indigenous life philosophies in shaping our future.”\n\t\n\n\tSahay added: “Having Misaq Kazimi in our team as an executive producer is the next big step in our journey. Misaq understands the heart of the film and its social relevance and is an impact filmmaker himself. We’re thrilled to share this story with U.S. audiences and to continue the conversations it has already sparked about the invisible labor that builds AI and an inclusive lens on technology.”\n\n\tThe seven-day L.A. run through Nov. 13 positions the film for awards consideration. Sahay will attend screenings for Q&As tackling the pic’s themes around AI ethics, global labor and representation. The campaign also encompasses university venues and community screenings.\n\n\tCast includes Sonal Madhushankar, Ridhima Singh, Geeta Guha, Anurag Lugun, Monika and Sahay. Monica Tiwari and Harshit Saini lensed the film, with Swaroop Reghu and Sahay editing. Kalhan Raina handled sound design, Saransh “Khwagbah” Sharma composed the score, Uday Oswal and Toshik Saraf served as colorists, and Shubham Solanki handled production design.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGayle King, who has been the face of CBS News‘ morning show for more than a decade, is expected to depart as an anchor of the morning program next year, according to four people with knowledge of the situation. King may shift to a different role at the news division that is being thoroughly overhauled under the new Paramount Skydance regime.\n\n\tKing’s existing contract is set to expire in May. There are signs CBS would like her to stay on board with the news division, potentially with a deal to produce her own programming for the network. Norah O’Donnell, who previously anchored “CBS Evening News,” stepped down from that role in January and transitioned to being a senior correspondent for CBS News, contributing to a range of programs and coverage.\n\t\n\n\tThe negotiations are about to ensue just as Paramount is cutting ties with dozens of staffers at CBS News and hundreds more across the larger company. King would be the latest in a parade of top CBS talent to leave their current roles as the company’s corporate ownership shifts from the Redstones, the former controlling shareholders, to the Ellisons, who have expressed a desire to move CBS News away from content they feel tilts too hard toward the liberal. Bari Weiss, a digital entrepreneur who launched the conservative opinion site The Free Press, was named editor in chief of CBS News earlier this month. King’s future at the division is high on the list of issues that Weiss needs to address.\n\n\n\tIn response to Variety‘s request for a comment about King’s future at ‘CBS Mornings,” a CBS News spokesperson said, “There have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.  She’s a truly valued part of CBS and we look forward to engaging with her about the future.” An attorney for King, Lawrence Shire of Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\t\n\n\tAs the Ellisons tightened their grip on Paramount, CBS has made significant changes. CBS canceled its signature late-night program, “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which will end in May, ahead of the official sale of Paramount to Skydance Media. And the network is parting ways with John Dickerson, one half of the current anchor team of “CBS Evening News.” On Wednesday, CBS News said it would overhaul its Saturday-morning program, and cut ties with its co-anchors Michelle Miller and Dana Jacobson, as well as the show’s executive producer, Brian Applegate. Lisa Ling and Nikki Battiste are among the other well-known staffers who will leave.\n\n\tMoving King is a risky maneuver, especially because morning-TV is built on the relationships viewers build with the hosts. If audiences feel King was pushed out for no good reason, they could be ripe for the picking by rivals like NBC’s “Today” or ABC’s “Good Morning America.” NBC News has discovered this challenge twice over years. Audiences didn’t warm to Deborah Norville when she became co-anchor of “Today” in 1989 because they perceived she had bumped the previous co-host, Jane Pauley. And viewers were disenchanted with “Today” in 2012, when Ann Curry was pushed from her co-anchor role after producers became concerned about the rapport between her and co-host Matt Lauer. Viewers, however, didn’t feel the same way, and “Today” continued to lose audience and ratings following her exit.\n\n\tAt the same time, CBS’s morning programs have long run in third place behind NBC and ABC, despite multiple changes of format and the talent behind the early-hours desk. “CBS Mornings” lured an average of just 1.8 million viewers during the five days ended October 20, according to data from Nielsen. During that same time frame, ABC’s “Good Morning America” captured an average of nearly 2.71 million, while NBC’s “Today” attracted an average of nearly 2.69 million. Paramount Skydance executives recruited Weiss to bring more energy to the CBS News programming schedule and CEO David Ellison has said he wants to appeal to a broader set of viewers across the nation.\n\n\tKing, who first entered a deal at CBS News in November 2011 and joined “CBS This Morning” the following January, has held forth in morning TV for 14 years — no small feat in the current media landscape. CBS gained some traction with her first program, “CBS This Morning,” which she worked on alongside Charlie Rose and Norah O’Donnell. When Rose left after allegations of sexual harassment, which he denied, King helped moved the show forward alongside Anthony Mason and Tony Dokoupil, then Dokoupil and Nate Burleson. The show is now known as “CBS Mornings.”\n\t\n\n\tWith the economics of news less certain with viewers moving to streaming and social media for their early facts, traditional TV-news venues have been parting ways with veteran anchors and correspondents or moving them into less costly positions. CBS’ O’Donnell, NBC News’ Hoda Kotb and Andrea Mitchell and Fox News’ Steve Doocy are among those who have shifted out of prominent daily anchor jobs in favor of new roles that keep them tethered to their networks, but give them less regular screen time. Veterans who have left their news employers over the past year include CNN’s Chris Wallace and Alisyn Camerota and Fox News’ Neil Cavuto.\n\n\tMeanwhile, NBC News and CNN are among the outlets that have cut or rearranged positions as they seek to move into new digital distribution models\n\n\tKing has created several landmark moments during her tenure. In 2019. she drew major attention for her interview with R. Kelly, keeping her composure as the singer-producer rose from his seat and shouted at her while denying the charges of child sexual abuse that later put him in prison. Earlier this year, King traveled to space on a Blue Origin flight alongside a crew of all female astronauts, including Katy Perry, Lauren Sánchez and others.\n\n\tShe has also helped CBS News cultivate a relationship with Oprah Winfrey, a close friend who has been a supporter of King since the two worked together earlier in their respective careers. For a time, King helped run Winfrey’s magazine published by Hearst, and would leave her morning-show duties for a full day of magazine work in the late morning and afternoon.\n\n\tSelome Hailu contributed to this story.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor much of the world, he had us at “Jerry Maguire,” or his “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” script, or “…Say Anything.” But for a select portion of his fandom, filmmaker Cameron Crowe really had us at the hello that was his early journalism career. Crowe first came to a kind of fame as a leading rock journo for Rolling Stone who just happened to be an emotionally intellectual teenager at the time — the time being one of rock ‘n’ roll’s golden ages in the 1970s, when he was tagging along on tour or in the studio with Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Lynyrd Skynyrd and just about every other major rocker of the period. It’s an era he mined for semi-fiction in the movie and stage musical “Almost Famous“; now he’s telling the even truer stories, and plenty he never got to before, about in his splendid new memoir, “The Uncool.”\n\t\n\n\tCrowe arrived already so fully developed as the world’s most precocious teen scribe in the ’70s that it was hard to imagine he would ever get much better as a prose stylist, however many decades he might keep at it. But “The Uncool” proves that he has, even with all the time taken away from concentrating strictly on the page to focusing on major motion pictures. It’s the kind of a book where you want to blow a chef’s kiss to sentence after well-honed sentence, written in a richly detailed, at times almost passionately epigrammatic fashion that he maybe could only have arrived at after exercising different muscles doing mostly screenplays for the last four decades. If it’s stories about the greatest musicians of all time you want, come for the Allman Brothers and Fleetwood Mac, or a description of Gram Parsons’ and Emmylou Harris’ first musical encounter, then stay for the just-as-compelling stories of his family life growing up in Indio and San Diego. Both these sides were well-explored in “Almost Famous,” but “The Uncool” brings them to a light and life that dramatic rendering could only begin to get at.\n\t\n\n\tThe focus here is on memories, but we also asked about his immediate future, which includes a long-planned biopic of his friend Joni Mitchell. (Instances of him returning to music journalism in recent years have included his interviews and liner notes for Mitchell’s retrospective boxed sets.) Variety talked with Crowe before he embarked on his own first tour — a book tour that will find him appearing in a handful of theaters around the country, having conversations with guests ranging from Jake Tepper to Sheryl Crow to Kate Hudson. Meanwhile, “The Uncool” is out this week.\n\t\n\t\tSome of the book has you tagging along with the great artists on tour dates, and some of it has you-are-there moments in the studio, like when you witness David Bowie making “Station to Station.” Is there a single project where you were kind of lingering around the edges that you most get excited to remember?\t\n\n\tWith some of the last movies that we’ve made, the lunchtime experience in the editorial room had been about, like, “What was Fleetwood Mac like around ‘Rumours’?” And it turned into like the Garrison Keillor-ization of some of these stories. At a certain point, I just felt like I need to write all this stuff down so that I have it. And it was also just a chance to put people in a place where we’re not looking back: We are with Glenn Frey in the moment, or we’re with David Bowie, or trying to convince Jimmy Page to pose for the cover of Rolling Stone, to access the fear and longing to actually pull it off and what that felt like. It was an exciting chance to not say “I remember,” but just to be in the moment with the writing.\n\n\tI did really want to write about the Bowie experience, because I thought the kind of Wikipedia-ization of his life, as rapturous as some of the writing is, kind of missed the thing that I felt from him, which was a nervous brilliance but also a real warmth. I mean, the fact that he wanted to kind of help me along the path as a so-called artist was unimaginable at the time, that somebody would even think that there was that kind of voice to be brought out in the stuff I was doing. So I really wanted to write about that.\n\t\n\t\tI was thinking of what kind of description you could give people that would make a lot of people buy this book. And one of the things that came to my mind is this is — forgive this for being the most glib and reductive thing possible! — you could tell them it’s “Almost Famous: The Novelization.”\t\n\n\tKind of — the actual events and the novelization combined. It wasn’t meant to be that way.\n\t\n\n\tI wanted to write about my family and the experience of how music found us and what it did, and the gift of my oldest sister, who I’d never written about [in “Almost Famous”]. Because over time I realized that so much of everything that I love as a writer and as a fan came from what she gave to me as a 9- and 10-year-old, before she died. [Crowe’s oldest sister, Cathy, died by suicide after periods of being institutionalized while he was growing up.] To me, for a long time, she was a towering adult that left us too soon. Then as I got older, I realized she was a teenager who loved music and loved the way music could transport her and take her out of a painful adolescence. And that was her gift to me. Like, “Here’s your ticket to a certain special kind of transcendent experience. See what you do with it.” There are people in your life that do that for you. And not all the time is it a sibling. But I wanted to write about her.\n\t\n\t\tIt sounds like this book might have started as an exercise in collecting and offering updates to your old pieces from way back then, and out of that branched your interest in doing an actual memoir, which this is. But the other book is still happening, it just got pushed back a little bit?\t\n\n\tIt’s true, it’s true. Well, I think they go hand in hand. But what I didn’t realize is that there was so much that I still wanted to say about Southern California and what that life was like and the way music sounded and felt. And I loved “Just Kids,” the Patti Smith book. I thought the Patti book was a magic trick. It made me feel like I was right there with her, and there wasn’t any kind of any soggy sentimentality about it. It was just “Come meet these people.” I loved the quiet generosity of it, and I just thought, “You know what? That’s a great place to be.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCameron Crowe’s new book “The Uncool”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSimon and Schuster\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe book has a finite time frame — mostly covering your rock journalism years, and your family life before and during that, and then ending with you writing the screenplay for “Fast Times at Ridgement High” and being on-set, and then doing the 1983 Tom Petty documentary that recently got re-released. You do flash-forward at the beginning and end to being in rehearsals for the “Almost Famous” musical in San Diego in 2019, and what was happening with your mom’s health then. But how easy was it to decide not to move much past the early ‘80s? And will there be another book someday that covers the film years?\t\n\n\tMaybe so. I mean, yeah, I’d like to do it. It’s a different book. Things really do change at that point. I didn’t want to do a book that was celebrity-heavy or that even might appear that way. And (being a film director) wasn’t a life I ever imagined when I was 15, or until Tom Petty said, “Pick up a camera.” It was a far away land. Just talking to Kris Kristofferson about the set of “Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid” (a 1973 story recounted in the book), it felt like he was talking about a far away, magical place where only special people were let in. And it kind of is.\n\t\n\n\tBut that wasn’t the feeling that this book is about, which is music and the way music informed everything that came after — including the movies in a big way. I wanted the characters to all have equal value. Like, Chuck, the guy that lived in our condominium complex, has equal value with Gram Parsons. These are all people that affect your life. And whether they’re later to be super well-known or not, at that age, you imprint so easily and strongly that I wanted to write about that too.\n\t\n\t\tObviously you weren’t trying to do a tell-all all of a sudden, but was there stuff that at the time, you didn’t feel like you could write about in your articles about the rock stars, but now, it’s appropriate?\t\n\n\tWell, the thing that I wanted to get across was what it was like to experience the music on stage or as it’s being created or, or when you’re close to that flame. In all those Rolling Stone stories, I wanted people to like have a front row seat with me. Sometimes I’d seen, in things like Grover Lewis’s piece on the Allman Brothers Band (which preceded Crowe’s own feature on the group), that it was weird, snarky gotcha stuff. And I loved the Allman Brothers Band. I didn’t get anything from reading his story except rage at how he sold out Duane Allman, one of my heroes. So I always wanted to write this story that made you meet those people and make a judgment yourself.\n\n\tIn-between the lines, obviously with the David Bowie stories, you could see that he was dabbling, at least, in satanism and drugs and things like that. You could feel it, and that was good enough for me. I wasn’t trying to take the spotlight off the thing I loved, which is the opportunity to talk to the musicians about their actual lives and emotions and stuff like that. And I didn’t feel like I was covering for anybody. They might’ve kept stuff from me, but generally I always felt like I had come away from being on the road with Led Zeppelin or something with the experience of what it was like to be in that tight circle of guys. It wasn’t a big entourage. There weren’t a million little backstage coves. It was like one room or they all were on one plane, and I wanted to capture the closeness of this huge band. And so that was most important in situations like that.\n\t\n\t\tYou probably devote the most space of any famous figure in the book to Bowie. It’s fascinating because it does seem like you had a very warm, even borderline-normal experience with him a lot of time. And then there are moments where he’s telling you that Satan is in the swimming pool, and suddenly we’re brought back to what a drug-fueled period this was for him. But generally he’s very cogent and clearheaded and very affectionate and supportive toward you, so we get a sense of him as real person who may be going through a little bit of a weird thing at times. We have this kind of chilly image of him during that “Station to Station” period, so the fact that he’s so warm toward you is almost shocking.\t\n\n\tYeah. He was relentlessly and restlessly creative, and he was always chasing… whether it was maybe finding a home in movies or writing his own autobiography, he was a seeker then. I think he judged himself more harshly than maybe anybody. When I last talked to him, I couldn’t figure out if he actually did remember the period that well or if he chose not to. I wrote liner notes for a “Station to Station” reissue; I wrote about the sessions and stuff. The note I got back from him was: “Please write more about the music.” And when I talked to him later, I knew why. He said, “I can’t vouch for anything that happened in that period. A lot of the stuff that you call great quotes to me now, I either don’t remember or they feel like the insane and amphetamine-fueled ramblings of a young man lost with only drug dealers to take care of him. I’m lucky I survived. I’m lucky I’m here to live the life that I’m living right now, so I choose not to go back there. And I couldn’t even get through your story when I tried to read it again this morning.”\n\t\n\n\tThe thing that I was going back and forth on was, did he remember and just didn’t want to, or did he legitimately forget what it was like in those times? And of course it was: he did remember. He just didn’t want to or need to introduce that guy to his current life. That was over. So I was a little bit of a souvenir of an old suitcase that he’d thrown away, and here I was going like, “But it’s the greatest suitcase! It was like the best thing!” He was like, “No, no, but at least I made some good music.” I went back and listened to the tape recently of that conversation (from later in his life), and he’s not wistful at all. It was like, “Thank you for your questions. I don’t recall and don’t think I will ever again.”\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of people who choose to remember or not remember… The most dramatic encounter you describe in the book is the one you had in the early ‘70s with Gregg Allman, which you fictionalized in “Almost Famous,” where he seems to have taken you as his confidante but suddenly he freaks out and terrorizes you. As you note, he had his own memoir where he told a different version of the story that didn’t make him seem nearly as scary. You recount how he demanded all the interview tapes you’d done for a cover story and seemed intent on destroying them — which, for a journalist, makes for a pulse-pounding an anecdote. In the book, you go into how it was so depressing to think you’d lost this cover story, you were thinking, “OK, I am going to listen to my mom now and become a lawyer after all, this is so bad.”\t\n\n\tYeah, if I even get out without getting beaten up or something. It all came back. I was scared. I just did the audio version of the book and it all came back. I had to stop and gather myself because it was so wrenching at the time, and I felt that I had scraped some wound (of Allman’s) wide open again, and that I was gonna be repaid with violence, possibly. It was so hurtful, and I really did not realize how deep it even went until I started writing this and then later just doing the audio book. It was emotionally violent.\n\n\tAnd so seeing Gregg again decades later, yeah, I think he had a sense memory that he had roughed me up. But for him the story had grown to its tour-bus kind of funny punchline ending, so the lore was meeting the reality when I stood with him. And I could tell it was like, “Oh fuck. Something happened here and there’s still something between us.” So when we posed for a picture together, I really felt like we were finding some kind of place where I was appreciative for the experience and he was apologetic for the pain that had happened. It all happened in a moment and in a flash. You can see it in the picture. I’m really happy to be there, and he’s kind of like figuring out what this particular crossroads is. But I got to thank him for “Almost Famous,” and he said, “You’re welcome. You’re welcome.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about your precocity at the time, and how you were perceived. Of course early on you talk about how nervous you were about being 14 or 15 and hanging with the rock stars. But after a certain point, we forget about that, and we’re just thinking about you as this very mature, seasoned journalist. And then all of a sudden you begin one chapter with “I was 14,” and we kind of snap back to, okay, this was unusual. Even later on, you mention that Bowie asked you how old you were, because he was suddenly curious, and you were 18 but you answered “19” because you thought the extra year sounded good. Hours. Did you have a sense, when people weren’t asking, that they had an idea of how old you were? Or did they assume you were older? And how old did you feel once you were into this life?\t\n\n\tIt’s funny. At a certain point, by the time I was 17 or something, I did feel like a seasoned journalist. You know, there’s a thing in “Heartbreakers Beach Party” (the 1983 Tom Petty documentary) where I’m going like, “I’m Cameron Crow, and I’ve been writing about rock for 10 years now.” I’m looking at it and I’m just going like, “You fucking look like Opie, man. What are you (trying to prove) with this “10 years”? Gimme a break!\n\n\tBut at the time, I remember thinking, “I’ve done this a while.” Because I thought loving Dick Cavett had punched a passport of some kind to having these conversations where we took each other seriously, even though I still had a baby face and was the age I was. I felt like after about 17 that I was okay and nobody was gonna say I was too young to be there, but I was still pretty young. And I think they did see a young person who was eager to know more, and for all the right reasons.\n\n\tNow, if we’re making a movie and somebody shows up and they’re like, “I’m so-and-so’s assistant, and I just wanted to be close to movies, and I can’t believe that this is how it’s done,” I see that person and I go, “Come along to the next location, check it out. You’ll be excited to see how we play music (on the set) and we do this.” So the roles get reversed. You just feel that having that certain kind of person around is gonna make you a little more excited, because you can look in their face and see the excitement you had, and that’s a person you want to take with you. And if you’re kind of the player coach, you’re like, “Hey, I’m glad you ended up here. Check out how it works.”\n\t\n\n\tBack then, a lot of people were “Check out how it works” with me, and I’m trying to be grateful to all of them when I tell their stories. Right down to Gram Parsons, who was really eager to answer my questions and not be a mystique-filled sphinx. It was really fun to meet some of these people at the time that I did.\n\t\n\t\tAnd the fact that they came to you sometimes, like, “I heard you’re a good guy” or something — they had heard things or sensed that you were  welcoming in a way they weren’t used to from journalists and would have this receptivity. Kris Kristofferson ends up dragging you along to family dinners and things because he wants to keep talking with you, even though Rita Coolidge and everyone are trying to drag him away from you.\t\n\n\tI loved listening. It’s like Kristofferson says at one point, “Boy, you’re really a great listener. This is one of my favorite conversations I’ve ever had.” Which means, basically, “The less you say, the more I dig this conversation.” But listening is an active part of a conversation, for sure.\n\n\tThe opportunities to stretch out and do big pieces were very limited. But still, people would spend time with me going over all this stuff. Talk about Pete Townshend. They had flown me to Atlanta to interview the Who for Playboy. Before we’d done the interview, Pete said, “I hope this isn’t ‘The Playboy Interview’ [the famously long-form Q&As the magazine was known for].” I was like, “Well, I wish it was The Playboy Interview. He goes, “I don’t. The Playboy Interview is a tombstone for a career. That’s what somebody does when you’re James Baldwin or you’re in the later stages of your career and you have something you want to say. I’m still a young man. I don’t want to do a big story with you. How about just a column? They’d flown me to Atlanta and put me on tour for, and he’s like, how about just a column?” Then we go to his room and we sit down and do a four-hour interview that goes into every little crevice and nook and cranny of his creative life. He poured himself inside out for a column in Playboy that’s going to be like 500 words.\n\n\tSo this was the kind of situation where I was spinning with joy and also the opportunity to do what my mom said, which is, “Seek out your heroes, seek ’em out. It won’t be bad.” And it often was not bad at all.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of your mom: You have all these great characters in your book, but none greater than your mom. You’ve mined her for material before, in the film and Broadway versions of “Almost Famous,” but we get such a greater picture of her in the book. She’s such a combination of being a total counterculture figure in one way and then a total square in another. She was all about “don’t do drugs,” which you mine for comedy, and even a whole comedic number in the musical. But then she’s also this kind of wild feminist/poet type of person, and possibly psychic, as you relate. Do you see a reflection of that combination in yourself? You title the book “The Uncool,” so you can relate with kind of being the square man out. But then you really are part of the in-crowd, and you obviously love the power of rock and roll for all the freedom it represents. So where do you see those sides of your mom that are so polarized and fun to write about maybe reflected in yourself?\t\n\n\tHmm. I love the question. She was a combination of theater and teaching, and any opportunity to teach, she would do it. Every time I shuffled through stacks of stuff on her desk (after she died in 2019), there would be faxes and notes and things that she left behind that tend to weirdly just kind of say the right thing at the right time. Like, “You never know, good luck or bad.” It was one of her sayings and it’s so true. Sometimes bad luck turns to something truly great.\n\n\tAnd I try and pass her teachings along to people, just because I being a warrior for optimism is a really good place to be. And she did really love that I found a voice in the world of journalism. I think now she would be really anxious to inspire young journalists not to give up because journalism is under attack right now. Her feelings would be very current. But the thing about my mom that was fun to write about is she just wanted to protect brain cells. That was a big, big thing.\n\n\tAnd if there was a hint of intellectualism, if there was a hint of a lesson in something, well, then she’d give it a try. “Yeah, come, come see this new folk singer, Bob Dylan.” But you know, “Iggy Pop — who is that man? This is not somebody who’s gonna teach you anything in this world.” And that was where she drew the line. Dick Cavett blazed a path, because Dick Cavett would have real conversations with Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin and stuff. So I was able to throw him up as an example of, like, “You can find wisdom in the oddest places, Mom, you know?” And I like making her a hero.\n\t\n\n\tBut the other thing is, my dad was a real hero to me too. And I liked bringing my dad into the picture. He was a more quiet presence. His birthday was yesterday and his effect echoes throughout the whole thing. He was a quiet, charming person who was a celebrated man in the military who left to kind of help our family and be present. And I wanted to give him the last word in the book, which, in a book that’s so much about music, is: “Always treasure the sound of the human voice.” I love giving that to him.\n\n\tOne last quick thing about that was so funny. My cousin came to see the “Almost Famous” musical in San Diego, and he didn’t know that my mom had died. He’s like, “Well, where’s Alice?” I’m like, “Well, besides in every performance of the play, she died.” He’s like, “Oh no.” And I go, “Yeah, man. You don’t know how many people come and see the play and look for my mom and then say, ‘You look just like her. You’re just like her, aren’t you?’” And I said, “I guess I am.” And he said, “You really don’t get it, do you?” I go, “What do you mean?” He goes, “You are your father. Don’t you see it?” And that really lingered with me too. So I wanted to kind of explore that and it’s really true.\n\t\n\t\tYou have a beautiful story near the end of the book about your dad staying up well past midnight on New Year’s Eve while you’re out at a party so he can tape a live Allman Brothers Band broadcast off the radio for you. It’s a touching way to wrap up the book, and with a character we never got to meet in “Almost Famous.”\t\n\n\tYeah. I mean, I like writing in that voice. With a (prospective) book about the years of making movies, I think there’s so many stories to be told, but it’s a different kind of path. It’s probably a little less happy/sad. This was the feeling I wanted to catch.\n\t\n\t\tBefore we go, can we ask the inevitable question that people want to know, about your Joni Mitchell movie?\t\n\n\tWorking on that baby, yes. We’re gonna do it next year. And I just feel really confident that we are telling that story in a way that you wouldn’t call a traditional so-called biopic. It’s the telling of her story with amazing input from the artist herself, who is opening her life, her closet, her collection of instruments, her notes, her everything for us to make a movie that is as emotionally authentic as her music. I just feel really lucky to have spent the last few years finding the way to tell the story that will give you a physical body rush as well as loving her story. … I can’t wait for you to check it out.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAll those casting stories that have been out there about women who supposedly are in or out, is that all wild speculation, or is there…\t\n\n\tNothing I can confirm. I’m just grateful that people are talking about it and that I get to tell the story. The Joy Division movie “Control” for me was the high-water standard in terms of like telling a great story that also gives you the absolute feel of Joy Division, so that you go back through the music and go, “Holy shit, now this music even means more to me.” And to be able to do that with Joni Mitchell is a labor of love beyond my wildest dreams.\n\t\n\t\tMusic journalism today — do you recognize it? Does it seem like a foreign thing to you? You often use the phrase in the book “the promise” in terms of what rock ‘n’ roll felt like in the 1970s at the moment you are capturing it. Is there a role for music journalism 50 years on from whatever that promise was? How does it it feel, as someone who’s just reading this stuff and not really doing it now?\t\n\n\tWell, I feel like I’m writing about music in different ways, in the movies that we’ve made, too. And that’s been fun. But, you know, I love music writing when it’s committed and passionate and not just blowing through a person’s life and career and maybe making a snarky observation or two and then onto the next. I love when you plant a flag for the music you want to write about, good or bad. And to me, I look no further than, I don’t know… Mikal Gilmore can write about music in a way that you feel his passion and it does this thing… and this is the thing that I love about music writing, and you don’t always see it: I love it when it makes you want to listen to the music. When somebody says something that makes you go, “Oh wow, I want to go back and listen to ‘Folklore’ again. I want to go back and listen to ‘Pleased to Meet Me.’ I now understand something I didn’t know before.” Or this person said to look over here and see this… That’s when it goes back to the thing that first made me write about music, which is pass a feeling onto a friend to experience themselves and share that delight in the transcendent thing that music can do for you. And when people acknowledge the wonder of music, when it works best, I can read it all day long.\n\t\n\n\tCameron Crowe’s book tour dates:Oct.29 | Washington, DC | Warner TheatreOct. 30 | Nashville, TN | CMA TheaterNov, 1 | Chicago, IL | Athenaeum CenterNov. 13 | San Diego (El Cajon), CA | The MagnoliaNov. 19 | Seattle, WA | Benaroya HallNov. 20-21 | Los Angeles, CA | The MontalbanNov. 23 | San Francisco, CA | Orpheum Theatre\n",

    "body": "\n\tApple saw a healthy 15% bump in its Services revenue for the most recent quarter, the highest growth rate this year, as it continues to represent the tech giant’s fastest business segment.\n\n\tApple’s Services business had record revenue of $28.75 billion for the September 2025 quarter, topping Wall Street forecasts for $28.17 billion. The segment includes the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple TV, Apple Music and iCloud. The company doesn’t report segment profit or detail revenue of individual services.\n\t\n\n\tOverall, Apple reported revenue of $102.5 billion, up 8% percent year over year, for its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, 2025. Diluted earnings per share were $1.85, up 13%. That beat analyst consensus estimates of $102.24 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.77.\n\n\n\tSales of iPhone, its largest product line, were $49.03 billion, up 6% year over year. That was a record for Apple for a September quarter — but short of Wall Street analyst expectations of $50.19 billion. The results included only a few weeks of sales of the latest iPhone 17 models, which began shipping Sept. 19.\n\n\tApple CEO Tim Cook, on the earnings call, said the December quarter is shaping up to be the biggest-ever for both total revenue and iPhone sales, citing strong demand for the iPhone 17 family. The company expects total revenue to increase 10%-12% for the year-end 2025 quarter, CFO Kevan Parekh said.\n\n\tCook also touted the recent 22 Emmy wins for Apple TV (which has been rebranded to drop the “+” sign), with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s comedy “The Studio” taking home 13 trophies, “Severance” winning eight and “Slow Horses” garnering one.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition, he called out Apple’s five-year deal for Formula 1 broadcast rights in the U.S., which starts in 2026. The deal, announced earlier this month, is worth about $750 million over the five-year term, Variety reported. “F1 is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports in the world,” said Cook.\n\n\tRegarding Trump’s tariffs, Cook said that Apple hasn’t raised prices on its products to account for those increased costs. The company incurred $1.1 billion in additional costs related to tariffs in the September quarter; it anticipates $1.4 billion in extra tariff costs in the year-end 2025 quarter, according to Parekh.\n\n\tAs he has said in the past, Cook said Apple would “pursue M&A” deals if those could boost the company’s business.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWith cruel ease, human error can transform normal life into a living purgatory. A sudden car collision or a bad fall can drastically upend one’s existence with swift force. Inspired by real events, Slovakia’s hard-to-watch yet remarkably affecting Oscar entry, “Father,” chronicles the aftermath of a tragedy caused by  unintended negligence. A devastating study in consuming guilt and evolving grief, the latest film from writer-director Tereza Nvotová grapples potently with the complicated nature of forgiveness, not only that which others grant us, but the one we harshly deny ourselves.\n\t\n\n\tLong uninterrupted takes provide a look into the life of a well-to-do family that will soon crumble. The camera of virtuoso cinematographer Adam Suzin behaves inconspicuously by design as it nimbly moves through the spaces, eventually pirouetting around the characters making us aware of its presence. The first of these set pieces drops us into an average morning as Michal (Milan Ondrík), the head of a magazine, finishes his daily run, showers and gets ready to head to the office as the city braces for a smoldering heatwave. On this seemingly mundane day, however, his wife Zuzka (Dominika Morávková) has tasked Michal with dropping their daughter Dominika (Dominika Zajcz) off at daycare.\n\n\n\tBut within a few hours of meetings and phone calls, which provide insight into Michal’s state of mind, including his concern with his physical appearance, the run-of-the-mill activities give way to a nightmare. Though he vividly remembers Dominika getting out of the car, the girl has been sitting in the scorching vehicle for hours. “I’ve killed her,” Michal screams in a catatonic state, as the agile camera floats around him. Nothing short of earth-shattering, Ondrík’s performance transitions from the nonchalant demeanor of a stressed man at work to the utter and immediate mental wreckage of losing a child, compounded by knowing he’s the one responsible for the horrific occurrence.\n\t\n\n\tHow Nvotová and co-writer Dusan Budzak handle Zuzka’s response to the unspeakably traumatic event is chief among their strong narrative choices. Though Zuzka’s own heartache is palpable, her restraint and compassion toward Michal feels almost superhuman. To see her still holding his hand and stating, though not without anger, that she understands he would never purposefully endanger their daughter, marks an unexpectedly powerful display of empathy. The subdued sadness with which the marvelous Morávková plays Zuzka works in strong contrast to Ondrík’s intensity, almost as if Zuzka’s strength was a self-imposed duty to prevent Michal from going over the edge.\n\n\t“Father” calls to mind “Rabbit Hole,” in which a couple also dealt with the death of their son. The key distinction is that, even if there’s a dream sequence that brings the viewer into Michal’s psyche, Nvotová’s film operates in unsentimental starkness.\n\n\tWhen the police return the car where young Dominika perished, Michal must drive it out of the station, but just a few miles away, he’s overcome with debilitating emotion. Watching him cry inconsolably at the wheel is gut-wrenching, precisely because it comes across as spontaneous, warranted and never melodramatic. “Father” hinges on the visceral truthfulness that Ondrík’s turn imprints whenever he’s on screen. The actor portrays the heart-ripping burden Michal feels with such unvarnished realism, it’s unsettling to watch — and that’s certainly a compliment to his ability for conveying such chaotic rawness. It’s the kind of revelatory performance that’s impossible to ignore and even more difficult to shake off.\n\n\tDuring the trial for his costly mistake, Michal, now sporting a full beard, exudes a palpable exhaustion, perhaps more spiritual than physical, which matches his despair-coated dialogue. When he says the outcome of the proceedings doesn’t concern him since nothing will bring his child back, one can’t help but believe every word. At one point, the camera flies away from the people in the room and looks through a high window. Outside, children play in a nearby park and people go about their day, unaware of the display of unbearable sorrow taking place just steps away. Rather than gimmicky, the camera movement proves graceful. Could we be watching from the perspective of a soul orbiting the living? Maybe Dominika herself is observing from above, a silent witness.\n\t\n\n\tThis otherwise devoted family man is reduced to a single lapse of judgment, presumably caused by his brain working on autopilot. And yet, how could a loving father ever forget his kid in the back of a boiling car? On a rational level, one can accept that Michal didn’t act with malice. But the court of public opinion and the emotions the case inherently ignites make a fair assessment challenging. Is there a world in which he could potentially be absolved — not only legally, but morally? And just as one gets the impression that “Father” will veer into a different tone, as Michal and Zuska momentarily surrender to a glimmer of hope, the rug is pulled from under them and they discover how others will always see them. At every turn it’s Nvotová’s outstanding direction, working between spontaneity and high-stakes orchestration, that yields a stirring feat.\n",

    "description": "\n\tLive Nation Canada and RBC have entered a multi-year partnership to reimagine the amphitheatre at Toronto’s waterfront. The venue will be renamed RB",
    "body": "\n\tLive Nation Canada and RBC have entered a multi-year partnership to reimagine the amphitheatre at Toronto’s waterfront. The venue will be renamed RBC Amphitheatre effective immediately and will transform into an expanded year-round venue by 2030.\n\n\tInspired by fan feedback, the reimagined venue will offer an enhanced live music experience. A new pedestrian bridge will be installed to improve access and ease crowd flow, while upgraded amenities include an increased number of places to purchase food and beverage onsite, upgraded hospitality areas and a new lookout deck with elevator access to the lawn. Fan-favourite features, like the open-lawn seating and city skyline views, will remain central to the venue’s identity.\n\t\n\n\t“As a champion of the music industry across Canada, RBC is an incredible partner for us,” said Michael Rapino, president and chief executive officer, Live Nation Entertainment. “The redevelopment of RBC Amphitheatre, formerly Budweiser Stage, strengthens Toronto’s position as a global entertainment hub and a must-play city for artists who are touring. With these changes, RBC Amphitheatre will become a world-class venue with unmatched acoustics, fan-friendly design and elevated hospitality experiences.”\n\n\n\t“Canada exports incredible musical talent to the world and that starts with the artists and fans who make our live music scene thrive,” said Dave McKay, president and chief executive officer, RBC. “With this partnership, RBC Amphitheatre will attract even more top performers to this beloved venue and bring fans exceptional new music and entertainment experiences. We’re also proud to invest in a live music destination that will create hundreds of new jobs, draw in thousands more visitors and help boost local businesses across the region.”\n\t\n\n\tRBC and Live Nation also announced that in 2026, Avion Rewards members will be able to use their Avion points to pay for tickets to any Live Nation Canada show on Ticketmaster.ca or the Ticketmaster Canada App. Look out for more details in the months ahead.\n\n\t+ Clipse (Pusha T and Malice) has signed to CAA for representation. \n\n\tThe Virginia-based hip-hop duo Clipse ended its 15-year hiatus with the critically acclaimed album, “Let God Sort Em Out,” released in July. Executive-produced by Pharrell Williams, “Let God” debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. The record has been submitted for the 2026 Grammys in the best rap album category.\n\n\tPusha T and Clipse are now managed by Kevin McMullan and Alex DePersia at By The Way. Their attorney is David Jacobs with Epstein Becker and Green.\n\n\t+ Dan Rosen has been appointed to lead Warner Music Group’s recorded music businesses in Southeast Asia — Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — as well as continuing to have responsibility for its recorded music and music publishing businesses in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\tIn his role as president of Warner Music Australasia and Southeast Asia, Rosen will continue to report to Lo Ting-Fai (known as Lofai), president, Warner Music APAC, and collaborate with a network of local experts across the eight territories.\n\n\tAs part of WMG’s investment in the region, Warner Music Australasia is evolving its domestic artist structure. This will build on the team’s recent success of taking Aussie and Kiwi artists to the global stage, including Balu Brigada, Boy Soda, Budjerah, Kita Alexander, and Thelma Plum.\n\n\tLofai says: “This region is richly diverse, full of extraordinary artists, talented entrepreneurs, and young passionate fans, who are highly engaged with a booming music ecosystem. Breaking more artists and turbocharging our business here is one of WMG’s top global priorities. Under Dan’s skilled leadership, our artists will tap into both the economic value and weight of population across all eight countries, providing a powerful springboard to global fame and fortune. Change is never easy but this is about doing something bold and winning big over the longterm.”\n\n\tRosen adds: “Our mission has always been to find dynamic ways to help our local artists go global, and for our global artists to grow passionate local fanbases. I’m honoured to lead a talented, focused team, and work with our amazing local partners, in these six diverse and exciting markets in Southeast Asia, while reinforcing our commitment to Australian and NZ artists. This move comes at an incredible time as there is a wealth of talent from this region that deserves a bigger global stage.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tTuesday, Oct. 28 \t\n\n\tASCAP, BMI and SOCAN revealed on Tuesday updated policies to accept registrations of musical compositions partially generated using artificial intelligence (AI) tools. These works will now be registered directly with the individual societies.\n\n\tAll three PRO registration policies define a partially AI-generated musical work as “one that combines elements of AI-generated musical content with elements of human authorship,” however musical compositions that are entirely created using AI tools will remain non-eligible. \n\n\tThese policy updates are in response to songwriters and composers increasingly incorporate a variety of AI tools into their creative process and workflow. The trio of organizations highlight their disapproval of AI technology companies ingesting and training models on copyrighted musical works without permission from, compensation for or credit to creators; “Not fair use, but theft,” reads the official announcement. \n\n\t“Songwriters and composers have always experimented with innovative tools as part of their creative process, and AI is no exception,” added Elizabeth Matthews, CEO, ASCAP. “We are clarifying our registration policy to now welcome partially AI-generated musical works because we believe AI can be a powerful tool for our members, as long as the law puts humans first and technology companies play fair and respect the rights of creators.”\n\n\t“This is an important first step in protecting human creativity as AI technologies evolve, while supporting the songwriters and composers who choose to use AI as a tool to enhance their creative process,” said Mike O’Neill, president and CEO, BMI. “All music creators will benefit from this aligned approach to the registration of partial AI-works that appropriately values creators’ contributions and ensures they are paid properly.”\n\n\t“This alignment creates a legal and ethical path forward for AI in music. It recognizes that music creators are embracing new tools, while reinforcing our commitment to what matters most: respect for their work and the protection of human creativity,” said Jennifer Brown, CEO, SOCAN. “The future of music can embrace AI and still remain deeply human.”\n\n\t+ Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) announced actor and entertainer Idris Elba has extended his global publishing agreement.\n\t\n\n\tAn adept songwriter, producer, musician, actor, director and DJ, Elba broke into the global music scene with 2022 single “Boasty” (with Wiley, Stefflon Don and Sean Paul) — which reached No. 1 on the UK Indie Chart and No. 5 on the R&B Chart — and “Vroom” with the FaNaTiX, Lil TJay, Davido, Koffee and Moelego for Gran Turismo 7.\n\n\tElba said: “Excited to be working with David Gray, Pete Simmons, Lincoln Elias, and the team at UMPG. Writing brings me real joy—and having great people around only elevates the process.”\n\n\t+ Primary Wave Music has announced two promotions across the company’s sync and creative teams. Peter Kurczaba will move up to vice president of sync, while Cleome Barber has been promoted to director, creative A&R. \n\n\tBoth are integral parts of the company’s sync and creative teams and will continue to report to Marty Silverstone, president of global sync, and Justin Shukat, president of Primary Wave Music, respectively. Kurczaba and Barber will both continue to work out of the company’s Los Angeles office.\n\n\tOf his promotion, Kurczaba noted, “After nearly a decade at Primary Wave, I continue to be inspired by the creativity, care, and collaboration that define our team. It’s been incredible to see our growth and impact under Marty’s leadership, and I’m excited to keep creating new opportunities for our iconic artists and songwriters.”\n\n\t“It’s such a privilege to be part of a team that values creativity, integrity, and passion above all,” said Barber. She continued, “As I step into this role, I am deeply grateful to every person that has championed me and my work over the years, particularly my mentors Justin Shukat and Jake Livingston!”\n\n\t+ Country artist Emily Rose has announced a new partnership with Postpartum Care USA in alignment with the release of a new music video for her single, “Don’t Talk About It.”\n\n\t“Don’t Talk About It” speaks directly to the postpartum journey, which impacts thousands of new moms, and addresses urgent, largely preventable postpartum issues like nutrient depletion, mental health challenges, and thyroid imbalance. With this song and music video, Rose is bringing music and healing together. Rose hopes her partnership with Postpartum Care USA will help raise awareness about postpartum depression and the resources available through PPCUSA.\n\t\n\n\t“I wrote this song in the depths of postpartum depression. I wasn’t getting the care I needed and was struggling in so many ways,” said Rose. “Writing has always been my outlet—a way to process emotions and begin to heal — so this song became a place where I could finally say out loud everything I was feeling. Looking back, if I had known about an organization like Postpartum Care USA, which is dedicated to supporting mothers’ health after birth, I might not have felt so alone. I probably could have learned healthier, less overwhelming ways to cope. I truly believe in their mission and the compassionate way they walk alongside moms during this vulnerable time.”\n\n\t+ Abbie Callahan has signed with WME for global representation across all areas.\n\n\t“I am beyond grateful to join the incredible team at WME,” said Callahan. “This year has been full of firsts. It is my first major festival season, my first record, and my first time really feeling like I am stepping into who I am as an artist. Having a team that believes in my vision means the world.”\n\n\tCallahan is quickly establishing herself as one of Nashville’s most promising new voices. In 2025, she made her debut at CMA Fest, Bonnaroo, and AMERICANAFEST.\n\n\t“Abbie’s talent is undeniable, and her vocals are both effortless and magnetic,” said WME agent Carrie Creasey. “She has an individuality that shines through in everything she does, from her voice to her sense of style, and that combination truly puts her in her own lane. WME is thrilled to be part of what will be an extraordinary career.”\n\n\tCallahan is managed by Travis Myatt and Willow Belenski at Twelve6 Entertainment.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“It: Welcome to Derry” hit 5.7 million viewers through in its first three days.\n\n\tThat total, a combination of Nielsen measurement of viewers on HBO’s linear channel and Warner Bros. Discovery’s own data regarding streams on HBO Max, puts the horror series in third place when compared to all other series premieres since HBO Max was launched. Only “House of the Dragon” and “The Last of Us” outrank it, according to WBD. (The company did not provide three-day totals to make comparisons with, though “House of the Dragon” premiered with just under 10 million viewers and “The Last of Us” premiered with 4.7 million viewers, both measured in just one day.)\n\t\n\n\tSet in the world established by the 1986 novel “It” by Stephen King, and expanding the cinematic universe from Andy Muschietti’s feature films “It” (2017) and “It Chapter Two” (2019), “It: Welcome to Derry” is the origin story of child-hunting clown monster Pennywise. As in the films, Bill Skarsgård plays Pennywise. The cast also includes Jovan Adepo, Taylour Paige, Chris Chalk, James Remar, Stephen Rider, Blake Cameron James, Arian S. Cartaya, Amanda Christine, Matilda Lawler, Clara Stack, Madeleine Stowe and Rudy Mancuso.\n\n\n\tMuschietti developed “It: Welcome to Derry” for television along with his sister Barbara Muschietti and Jason Fuchs. Executive producers include the Muschiettis through their Double Dream production company, Fuchs, Skarsgård, Brad Caleb Kane, David Coatsworth, Shelley Meals, Roy Lee and Dan Lin. Fuchs wrote the first episode and serves as co-showrunner with Kane, while Muschietti directs multiple episodes.\n",

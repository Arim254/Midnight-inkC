    "body": "\n\tThe 31st Critics Choice Awards winners both reflected where much of the industry sees the Oscar race — and, in key ways, upended it.\n\n\tWith the Golden Globes arriving next Sunday night and Oscar nomination voting opening the next day on Monday morning, the CCA ceremony served as one of the final, meaningful data points before Academy members begin filling out ballots. In that context, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” sweeping best picture, director and adapted screenplay sends an unmistakable message to the rest of the field: this is the film to beat. Historically, that combination is Oscar catnip — a filmmaker-driven vision paired with broad, cross-branch support. \n\t\n\n\tIn the preferential-ballot era, breadth routinely defeats intensity, and “One Battle After Another” now looks like the title most capable of surviving every round of redistribution.\n\n\n\tAnd yet, the sweep also comes with a built-in asterisk. Critics don’t vote for the Oscars. That has long been my No. 1 rule of awards prognosticating, and it still applies. But when a film satisfies critics while simultaneously delivering craft-forward storytelling that appeals to Academy voters across demographics, it becomes exceedingly difficult to dislodge. Expect “One Battle After Another” to gain real momentum as Oscar nominations approach, particularly in the crafts categories — and if it can retain some traction for its acting contenders, including Chase Infiniti and possibly tack on an additional piece of recognition like Regina Hall.\n\n\tA central question emerging now is whether “One Battle After Another” can complete Paul Thomas Anderson’s trifecta without also winning an acting or craft category. Historically, that path is rare. The last two films to win best picture without at least acting or crafts attached — “The Greatest Show on Earth” (1952) and “Spotlight” (2015). With Variety projecting “One Battle After Another” to approach the upper tier of all-time nomination totals, a scenario in which it converts so lightly on Oscar night would feel counterintuitive for a film that currently reads as inevitable. A more plausible outcome may resemble “The Shape of Water” (2017), which paired picture and director wins with selective below-the-line support.\n\t\n\n\tStill, this race is far from settled. Warner Bros. led all studios overall, thanks in large part to “Sinners,” which co-led all films with four wins:  original screenplay for Ryan Coogler, best young actor for Miles Caton, best casting and ensemble, and best score for Ludwig Göransson. That package suggests something a bit more than passion — it hints at a possible coalition. If “Sinners” can carry this momentum through the Golden Globes and convert it into support from SAG, the Writers Guild and other major guilds, it could emerge as the season’s late-breaking spoiler.\n\n\tAcademy voters have repeatedly shown a willingness to reward bold originality when paired with technical achievement, and “Sinners” is beginning to look like this year’s version of that formula. The original screenplay win is particularly notable. This is a category where the Academy frequently diverges from critics, often favoring dialogue-driven work over structural innovation. Coogler’s win shows the film has broken through in ways that could translate directly onto Oscar ballots, especially within the writers branch, which consistently punches above its weight in the best picture race.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJacob Elordi, winner of the Best Supporting Actor Award for “Frankenstein”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Critics Choice\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNetflix’s “Frankenstein” also walked away with four prizes, highlighted by a surprising best supporting actor win for Jacob Elordi as the Creature in Guillermo del Toro’s gothic epic. Until now, Elordi had claimed only two critics prizes this season — from the New York Film Critics Online and the Oklahoma Film Critics Circle — raising two immediate questions. Did he just solidify a nomination slot after weeks of being viewed as fringe behind Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn, Stellan Skarsgård and Paul Mescal? Or did we witness the Critics Choice version of the Aaron Taylor-Johnson effect, referencing his Golden Globe win for “Nocturnal Animals” that ultimately failed to translate to an Oscar nomination?\n\n\tThe major difference here is meaningful. “Frankenstein” is far more firmly embedded in the best picture conversation than “Nocturnal Animals” ever was. And crucially, no Critics Choice winner for best supporting actor has ever gone on to miss an Oscar nomination. On that basis alone, Elordi now looks safely in the lineup (at least pending SAG noms next week). Whether he becomes a serious win threat is a separate discussion — one that hinges on follow-through at the Golden Globes and BAFTA. Should that happen, the race will recalibrate quickly.\n\t\n\n\tThe acting races elsewhere remain fluid. Jessie Buckley’s win for portraying Agnes Shakespeare in Chloé Zhao’s grief-soaked drama “Hamnet” came with the most emotionally resonant speech of the night and offers voters a clear, focused way to reward a film that may come up short in best picture, given Buckley was the sole win for the movie. Her two closest competitors — Renate Reinsve and Rose Byrne — will have to play major catch up down the road if they want to catch Buckley.\n\n\tTimothée Chalamet’s best actor win for “Marty Supreme” further strengthens his frontrunner status heading into the Globes, where the organization’s genre-friendly body could amplify his lead.\n\n\tBut it is never that simple. At 30, Chalamet would become the second youngest best actor winner in Oscar history — and now, he’s the youngest ever to win Critics Choice. Remember, this is the same Academy that made Leonardo DiCaprio wait until 41 to decide to throw him a bone for climbing into a dead carcass in “The Revenant” (2015). This race has been tightly contested all season, with Chalamet trading critics wins with Michael B. Jordan for “Sinners,” while Ethan Hawke remains a serious factor for “Blue Moon” and DiCaprio stars in the best picture frontrunner. CCA history offers some cautionary tales: Critics Choice winners Chadwick Boseman (“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”), Christian Bale (“Vice”) and Michael Keaton (“Birdman”) are among those who lost their Oscars despite entering as perceived “no brainers.”\n\n\tAmy Madigan’s supporting actress win for “Weapons” was expected by many pundits, but questions remain about whether the Oscars are willing to reward a genre performance (especially one this cool) — and particularly if she emerges as the film’s sole nominee. If “Weapons” fails to land any additional noms such as casting or original screenplay, history can be unforgiving to those performers. Penélope Cruz’s win for “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” (2008) is the most recent example of a sole nominee winning in the supporting actress category, and that required a rare category switcharoo by Kate Winslet from supporting to lead for “The Reader,” who swept all the precursors. Before that, one has to look back to Marisa Tomei in “My Cousin Vinny” (1992), who was a surprise nominee on the day (and even more shocking winner on Oscar night). These are the exceptions, not the norms.\n\t\n\n\tBy all these somewhat vague measurements, there is still room for another contender (or two) to emerge. And with Oscar voting opening Monday morning, the next week may matter more than any ceremony that comes before.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” returned to the top of the China box office over the Jan. 2–4 frame, grossing RMB121.5 million ($17.1 million) to lift its cumulative total to RMB4.25 billion ($598 million), according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tJames Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” slipped to second place but remained robust, adding $15.8 million. The threequel has now reached $136.3 million in China after its Dec. 19 debut.\n\n\n\tMaoyan Movie’s crime thriller “The Fire Raven” placed third with $11.7 million, pushing its total to $30.3 million. Directed and written by Sam Quah, the film stars Peng Yuchang, Alan Aruna and Chang Ning and follows the reopening of a long-dormant murder case that exposes a wider network of corruption and revenge.\n\t\n\n\tHuace Film & TV’s “Back to the Past” opened in fourth place on $11.1 million, starting its run with a $24.1 million cume. The feature film adaptation of Hong Kong broadcaster TVB’s 2001 historical sci-fi series “A Step Into the Past” is produced by Louis Koo‘s One Cool Film Production, with Koo serving as producer. The project reunites the principal cast from the original television series 24 years after it first aired. Koo stars alongside Raymond Lam, Jessica Hsuan, Sonija Kwok, Joyce Tang and Michelle Saram, all reprising their original roles. New cast members include Bai Baihe, Michael Miu and Louis Cheung. The film marks the final screen appearance of the late Dick Liu Kai-chi.\n\n\tRounding out the top five, Paramount’s “The SpongeBob Movie” debuted with $2.1 million, bringing its early total to $4 million.\n\t\n\n\tOverall, the China box office generated $63.8 million for the weekend. The 2026 year-to-date gross now stands at $111.4 million, running 32.9% ahead of the same period last year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAhn Sung-ki, one of South Korean cinema’s most enduring and respected screen actors, whose six-decade career spanned more than 130 films and included landmark hits such as “Silmido” and “Radio Star,” has died. He was 74.\n\n\tHis death was confirmed by his agency, Artist Company, and Seoul’s Soonchunhyang University Hospital, which said Ahn had been battling blood cancer, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\n\tAhn entered the film industry as a child actor at age five, debuting in 1957’s “The Twilight Train.” He went on to appear in roughly 70 films as a child before stepping away from acting during his teenage years, AP reported.\n\t\n\n\tAfter studying Vietnamese at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies – where he graduated with top honors – Ahn initially struggled to re-establish himself in the industry. He returned to acting in 1977, with his adult breakthrough coming in Lee Jang-ho’s “Good, Windy Days” (1980), a generational drama that earned him the Grand Bell Award for best new actor.\n\n\tOver the decades that followed, Ahn became a central presence in modern Korean cinema, known for performances marked by restraint, authority and emotional clarity. His filmography included roles in “Mandara,” “Whale Hunting,” “White Badge,” “Two Cops,” the blockbuster military drama “Silmido,” and the music-industry drama “Radio Star,” in which he played the devoted manager of an aging singer.\n\n\tAhn won five Grand Bell Awards for best actor, a record, and was widely admired for a career defined by consistency and an absence of scandal. His steady public image and long-term credibility earned him a level of trust rare in the industry, according to AP.\n\t\n\n\tIn a 2023 interview cited by AP, Ahn said the expectations placed on him motivated him to live and work in a way that justified the public’s respect. He also said he avoided romantic scenes when he felt they were included only for effect, explaining that he was uncomfortable performing them without narrative necessity.\n\n\tBeyond his screen work, Ahn played an active role in Korea’s film community, serving as chair of the Korean Film Actors Association and advocating for performers during periods of industry change.\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife, Oh So-yeong, and their two sons. \n",

    "body": "\n\tUniversal Music Group’s Indian division has secured a significant minority stake in one of Bollywood’s leading production houses, gaining global soundtrack rights in the process, it was confirmed on Monday. \n\n\tUniversal Music India has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 30% equity stake in Excel Entertainment, valuing the Mumbai-based film and digital content studio at INR2,400 crores ($267 million). The strategic partnership grants UMG global distribution rights for all future original soundtracks from Excel’s projects.\n\t\n\n\tFounded in 1999 by producers Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar, Excel Entertainment has established itself as a major force in Indian cinema and streaming content. The studio’s slate includes critically acclaimed titles such as “Gully Boy” (India’s 2019 Academy Awards submission), “Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,” and “Dil Chahta Hai,” as well as Prime Video’s Emmy-nominated series “Inside Edge” and popular shows “Mirzapur” and “Made in Heaven.”\n\n\n\tUnder the agreement, UMG will launch a dedicated Excel music label with global distribution, while Universal Music Publishing Group becomes Excel’s exclusive music publishing partner. The arrangement creates opportunities for UMG’s existing artist roster to be featured in Excel’s future productions.\n\n\tDevraj Sanyal, chairman and CEO of Universal Music India and South Asia and senior VP of strategy for Africa, Middle East and Asia, will join Excel Entertainment’s board of directors. Sidhwani and Akhtar will continue overseeing creative direction and content decisions.\n\n\t“India’s entertainment landscape continues to grow from strength to strength, and this is the perfect moment to build meaningful global collaborations,” Sidhwani and Akhtar said in a joint statement. “We’re excited to partner with UMG in what we believe will be a truly creative and transformative alliance – one that unlocks fresh opportunities for artists and repertoire across music, film, and emerging formats. Together, we aim to take culturally rooted stories to the world.”\n\t\n\n\tVishal Ramchandani, Excel Entertainment’s CEO, added: “This partnership with UMG marks a pivotal step in our journey to broaden creative opportunities and tell Indian stories with a global lens. With a shared vision for innovation and excellence, we aim to transform Excel into a creative global studio – one that brings clutter-breaking, original content to audiences across platforms and geographies.”\n\n\tThe deal strengthens UMG’s position in India, currently the world’s 15th-largest recorded music market by revenue according to IFPI data. Original soundtracks remain central to India’s music consumption, with the genre showing continued growth among local listeners.\n\n\tAdam Granite, UMG’s CEO of Africa, Middle East and Asia, said: “Today’s announcement further strengthens UMG’s position in India, a dynamic and strategically important music market for the group globally. Original soundtracks remain at the heart of India’s fast-growing music market, with Indian listeners showing a growing desire to access more music in that genre. By investing in and partnering with Excel Entertainment, UMG will be uniquely positioned to contribute from the earliest stage to Excel’s future endeavours and throughout the creative process, providing huge benefits to both parties.”\n\n\tSanyal added: “Farhan and Ritesh have built an exceptionally impressive business, and we’re thrilled to be working with them on the next phase of their journey. The Indian film scene presents a hugely exciting opportunity for music and the music-led entertainment business, and Excel is the perfect partner for us to work with going forward.”\n\n\tIndia’s digital entertainment sector presents significant growth opportunities, with more than 375 million over-the-top viewers and 650 million smartphone users consuming content across multiple platforms.\n\n\tAZB & Partners served as legal counsel to UMG, with KPMG acting as transaction advisor. Morgan Stanley advised Excel Entertainment as financial advisor, with Khaitan & Co. providing legal counsel. Ernst & Young served as transaction advisor to Excel Entertainment.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Heated Rivalry” star François Arnaud is reacting to Miley Cyrus saying she is “so in” to contributing music to the hit HBO Max/Crave show’s second season.\n\n\tCyrus exclusively told me Saturday night at the Palm Springs International Film Festival gala that, despite not having seen the show yet, she’s up for doing a song for them.\n\n\t“Oh, I’m so in. Book me. Get me booked!” she said.\n\n\n\tArnaud told me at the Critics Choice Awards on Sunday, “I think we might get a little bit bigger budget for Season 2, but I don’t know if we get Miley budget.”\n\t\n\n\tBut then he added, “I think if she sees the show, she might give us a discount.” (Watch the full interview with Arnaud at the top of this story.)\n\n\tRumors were flying last week that Cyrus was a fan of the show because she apparently liked a “Heated Rivalry” post on social media. “I have not watched yet, but this is on my to-do list now,” she said. “It’s all I’ve heard about – every conversation I’ve had today has started with you, ‘You have to [watch it].’”\n\n\n\tArnaud also talked about what he’d like to see for his character Scott Hunter and his boyfriend Kip (played by Robbie G.K.) in Season 2. “I would want them to face the continuing challenges of someone uber-famous being with someone who didn’t choose that for his life at all and is forced into it,” he said.\n\n\tArnaud also joked, “I think Kip, for the second season has to stop working out. That’s what I want to see. Like he’s a smoothie boy. Why does he have the best body out of all of us?”\n\t\n\n\n\t“Sorry, Baby” filmmaker and star Eva Victor also revealed on the Critics Choice carpet that she’s a “Heated Rivalry” fan.\n\n\t“I got body sweats seeing him,” she said looking down the carpet at Aranud.\n\n\tOf the series, she said, “I’m dead over it. It’s the most sexually interesting thing I have ever seen in my life…On a brainiac level it’s sexually interesting and very tantalizing.”\n\n\tVictor continued, “When they said I want to go to the cottage, I blissed out. I was never so fully OK with my life mentally.”\n\n",

I love you. I couldn’t do this without you,” he said when accepting the best actor trophy. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart.” \n\n\n\tWhen the camera cut to Jenner, she mouthed “I love you” in response.\n\t\n\n\tDuring his speech, the actor also gave a shout-out to his fellow nominees. Chalamet was nominated alongside Leonardo DiCaprio for “One Battle After Another,” Joel Edgerton for “Train Dreams,” Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon,” Michael B. Jordan for “Sinners” and Wagner Moura for “The Secret Agent.”\n\n\tAfter hesitating, Chalamet admitted, “I’m more nervous than I thought I’d be.” He then went on to thank Josh Safdie, who co-wrote and directed the movie. “You made a story about a flawed man with a relatable dream, and you didn’t preach to the audience about what’s right and wrong. I think we should all be telling stories like that,” he said. “Thank you for this dream.”\n\n\tEarlier in the night, “Hacks” stars Meg Stalter and Paul W.

    "body": "\n\t“Hacks” stars Meg Stalter and Paul W. Downs had some fun on the Critics Choice Awards red carpet on Sunday afternoon as the pair donned bright orange vinyl outfits in a spoof of the outfits that Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner wore to the premiere of Chalamet’s new film “Marty Supreme.”\n\n\tStalter and Downs had the crowd howling with their commitment to the bit. Downs wore a ping pong paddle on a strap, crossbag style. Stalter sported a gigantic cross necklace reminiscent of Jenner’s necklace at the Dec. 17 premiere in New York. Set in the 1950s, “Marty Supreme” revolves around an everyday man’s quest to become the world champion of ping pong. Chalamet and his girlfriend Jenner turned heads last month with their bright-orange outfits, extending the orange theme that has been used in marketing the A24 film.\n\t\n\n\tDowns, who is also a co-creator and executive producer of “Hacks” with Lucia Aniello and Jen Statsky, said the goal was to “have fun” and enjoy themselves at the awards. “Hacks” is nominated for best comedy series and Downs is up for comedy supporting actor at Critics Choice, which recognize film and TV. Chalamet and “Marty Supreme” are also nommed.\n\n\n\t“We get to see people who make movies we love. We just thought, ‘Let’s have fun,'” Downs told Variety on the carpet as he headed into the kudos held at Santa Monica’s Barker Hangar. Downs noted that the vinyl material of his suit and Stalter’s long gown was perfect for the heavy rain that has deluged Southern California for days. \n\n\t“It’s waterproof,” he observed. “It’s really good in the rain — the water just slipped off the dress,” Stalter added.\n\t\n\n\tDowns gave “Marty Supreme” two thumbs up, saying that he “loved” the film from director Josh Safdie. Stalter admitted she hasn’t seen it yet even though she is friends with Jenner.\n\n\tStalter and Jenner have a “sushi Fridays” tradition. “We go out for sushi at least once a month,” she said. Chalamet does not usually join them: “It’s girl time,” Stalter explained.\n\n\tDowns was pressed on whether Chalamet ever be invited to play a role on “Hacks.” \n\n\t“I’m not sure what he would play, but we would make room,” Downs assured. \n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains light spoilers from Season 2, Episode 8 of “Landman,” “Handsome Touched Me,” which premiered Sunday, Jan. 4, on Pa",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains light spoilers from Season 2, Episode 8 of “Landman,” “Handsome Touched Me,” which premiered Sunday, Jan. 4, on Paramount+.\n\n\tIn a series full of scene stealers, Ali Larter more than holds her own on “Landman.” Playing Angela, the larger-than-life ex-wife and current fiancée of titular landman Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton), she is often on her own sidequests alongside her mini-me daughter, Ainsley (Michelle Randolph). This season, those missions have included spending a ton of money, shopping for mansions, planning themed dinners and, in this latest episode, winning a fortune at the casino while teaching old folks from the retirement home how to win at roulette.\n\t\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety at the beginning of the season, Larter said she finds joy in playing Angela and details how show co-creator and writer Taylor Sheridan pens such a unique character — even if not all of the series’ fans embrace her.\n\n\n\t“I think it’s incredible that Taylor’s writing for a woman in her late ’40s who’s still very alive in her body, who still wants to be intimate with her husband,” Larter said. “Is that why it’s so confusing to some people? I think that Taylor is a provocateur, and we’d like to put a mirror up to certain things, so I think that’s part of it.”\n\n\tLarter also said that she meets many fans who, beyond enjoying Angela, find her to be an aspirational character.\n\n\t“I love playing a woman that’s this alive,” she said. “[Angela and Tommy] kind of feel like they’re in high school again. They’re rekindling this love story, and for me to play a woman who just doesn’t care about all the judgment of others is so freeing. I have so many women come up to me who always want to have that … they want to find that little bit of Angela in them, because we’re always asked to live within the societal norms. There’s something so delicious about playing a character who does it by her rules, who just lives her life as she wants to live it, who loves hard and free. I think it’s exciting at this point in my career and at my age to get to play someone who’s this emotionally complex and bold.”\n\t\n\n\tLarter also tracks the frustration of some fans with the early episodes of the first season, when they didn’t know that Tommy’s family would be as integral to the show as his business acumen.\n\n\t“I’ll explain it to you,” she said. “People only saw the first two episodes, and Taylor loves to throw you a hook. Nobody knew when they saw the first two episodes that our show was really about the family. So you see this beautiful arc in the first season. He knows what he’s doing and has a vision and an idea for seasons of this show. I think that when you only see one or two episodes, it’s really hard to understand the kind of work that we put in for the entire season.”\n\n\tWatch a supercut of Angela being Angela below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel won the best talk show prize at the Critics Choice Awards and used his acceptance speech to roast Donald Trump and thank all of the celebrities who rallied behind him earlier this year after ABC pulled his late night show off the air after two large owners of affiliate TV stations, Nexstar and Sinclair, complained about a monologue in which Kimmel discussed Charlie Kirk’s alleged shooter. \n\n\t“Thanks to all the writers and actors and producers and union members, many of you who are in this room, who supported us, who really stepped forward us and reminded us that we do not take free speech for granted in this city or in this country,” Kimmel said on Jan. 4. “Your actions were important, and we appreciate them.”\n\t\n\n\t“And most of all, I want to thank our president, Donald Jennifer Trump, without whom, we would be going home empty-handed tonight,” Kimmel added. “So thank you, Mr. President, for all the many ridiculous things you do each and every day. It’s been a banner couple of weeks, and we can’t get wait to get back on the air tomorrow night to talk about them. Thank you, everyone.”\n\n\n\tVariety reported last month that Kimmel struck a new deal with Disney to extend his late-night run for another year, which will keep “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on the air through 2027. Kimmel regularly slams Trump during his nightly monologues. The host recently condemned the President’s response to the murder of filmmaker Rob Reiner, who Trump called “deranged” and speculated that his death was “due to the anger” he caused others by being anti-Trump.\n\t\n\n\t“What we need at a time like this, besides common sense when it comes to guns and mental health care, is compassion and leadership. We did not get that from our president, because he has none of it to give. Instead, we got a fool rambling about nonsense,” Kimmel said at the time. “It’s so hateful and vile. When I first saw it, I thought it was fake. My wife showed it to me this morning. I was like, ‘Even for him, that seemed like too much.’ But nothing is ever too much for him.”\n\n\tKimmel also called out Trump in a special Christmas Day address to the U.K. on Channel 4, where he remembered how “millions and millions of people stood up” when ABC pulled his show off the air, “and said: ‘No, this is not acceptable’. People who never watched my show, people who were on record saying they hate my show spoke out, they marched, they did this all to support the right to a free expression of speech and because so many people spoke out, we came back. Our show came back stronger than ever.”\n\n\t“We won, the President lost and now I’m back on the air every night givin’ the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking. That’s a word, right? I used it properly?” Kimmel added.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohn Mayer and McG have both spent a lot of time thinking about what is inherently special about the Chaplin Studios, the lot that previously was home to A&M Records, Henson Studios and, in its earliest decades, Charlie Chaplin’s production company. Between the two of them, Mayer may have spent the greatest amount of time thinking about the scents associated with the landmark Hollywood property, which they jointly purchased for a reported $44 million just over a year ago.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve asked a lot over the years about this: I don’t know what makes an old California studio smell like an old California studio,” Mayer says. “You cannot fake the smell. Ocean Way [the classic Hollywood recording studio] had it. The medical buildings in Beverly Hills, those green-carpet kind of medical buildings, have it. You walk in and you go, “I don’t know why Mickey Fine smells like that’,” he says, referring to the historic pharmacy. “I don’t know why the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge smells like it does. But if you have that classic California smell, keep it! Because you cannot buy it. There is no candle.”\n\n\n\tOn a deeper level, the musician says, “How do you thread the needle between that lived-in thing and looking forward and acknowledging modern-day? That’s something I try to do all the time. What are the best of both worlds, and what is great and sturdy about the past? What can you interlace in a way that doesn’t hold back the future and just gives it a little more strength and durability? And that’s what we’re having fun doing.”\n\n\tThere are $9 million in upgrades and renovations underway with the Chaplin Studios, but they know when to leave the elements that give the property personality alone. “You’ve gotta lean into the Wabi-sabi funk of this place, or you’re in the wrong place,” McG says.\n\t\n\n\tSentiments like these will be music to the ears of the many Southern Californians who look to Chaplin — or to A&M, or Henson, or however they grew up knowing it best — as a hopefully immutable touchstone of both the city of Los Angeles and its entertainment community. Whether you’re a historic preservationist or just a nostalgist, chances are you have some strong feelings about the lot, especially if you’ve worked or frequently visited there. Mayer and McG have not talked openly about their plans until now, but they met with a small group of journalists last month to first tour the lot, then sit down in Studio B talk at length about the property’s history and possibilities.\n\n\tOne of the things they are discussing for the first time publicly is how the sale came to be, and how they came to be in on it together, not having previously been buddies or even acquaintances up until this became a joint mission. They also addressed the widespread reports that Scientology was set to acquire the property, which did not sit entirely well with an entertainment community that had become accustomed to the lot being open for a wide variety of usages over the decades.\n\n\t“John and I strangely didn’t know each other all that well prior to our arranged marriage,” acknowledges McG. “I was sort of trying to take a run at it. I’d gotten to know Faryal (Ganjehei, the lot’s president and studio manager since 2000], and John kicked the tires for his purposes and tried to figure it out. And I just didn’t have enough dough, and I don’t think he wanted to deal with the headache. Then we finally got together and I was like, ‘I’m equipped to deal with the headache’ [of overseeing the entire lot]. He’s like, ‘Good. I want to tunnel into the [recording] studio and tunnel back out.’ And I go, ‘Perfect!’ And Irving Azoff gave me my first record deal in the ‘90s” — (McG was one of Sugar Ray’s primary instigators and had his own imprint before becoming one of the top music video directors of that decade) — “and we had a very good experience with that, and he obviously manages John. So Irving vouched for both of us: Chocolate, meet peanut butter. Reese’s, knock yourself out.”\n\n\tBut McG approached the possibility of a deal first as a solo act. “I even got it into escrow,” he reveals, “but I couldn’t close it; I didn’t have enough dough — this is before John. And I don’t know if we should talk about our competition…,” he wonders aloud. “I think [Henson] got way downstream with a family with deep ties to the Church of Scientology, and then that got out in public, and people were concerned about the manner in which it was going to be deployed. I’ll leave it at that. And then we got our foot back in the door and got our financial ducks in a row, and we were fortunate enough to make it happen.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMcG and John Mayer at Chaplin Studios (Photo: Daniel Prakopcyk)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrecht Van’t Hof\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMayer was coming from a place of having recorded at the A&M studios going back to 2005, and having locked in Studio C for his own purposes in 2018, getting to know the people who worked there. “I’ll piggyback off what McG said. It was in the press; it’s known. But it wasn’t necessarily about anyone else who was in the running. For me, this was about keeping the band together And all I really cared about was in my sort of near view, which is: This is a gang you can spend another 30 years working with. It would’ve really upset me deeply if everyone who comes to work every day and sees one another — it’s a very tightknit family — had to separate and dissipate, and I went and worked at one studio, and Faryal went and started somewhere in the middle of the ladder at another studio. I did not want to see all of us go different places. That’s it.\n\n\t“This was not about outsmarting anybody. This is about caring about so many people who see each other every day …. especially if you’re me and you’re an artist, and you don’t have any semblance of routine in your life, and I found it, like other artists find it here. … This is one of those times in life where you throw down for what matters, not for what you can brag about you were able to corner someone on… At a certain point… I know I said to the previous owners, ‘You have my attention, and I’m not here to play games anymore. And what does it take?’ And to have an emotional asset in your life is a really good thing. I think everyone’s always looking at assets from a very objective, hardcore, empirical value level. This is something I wake up and go to sleep every day knowing in my heart that I have a piece of in some way, or I’m responsible for other people’s piece of it.”\n\n\tSays McG: “I’m old enough to have seen the exodus of aerospace out of Southern California — [it] broke my heart — and old enough to have seen the exodus of Hollywood out of Southern California. So if we could take a small step in the direction of planting a flag and saying, ‘Hey, we’re trying to do the right thing and protect the people of the city that we care about, trying to show that you can make a film or television show or record and do it here with extraordinary people and extraordinary facilities’ — why not?”\n\t\n\n\tWith an estimated $9 million going into renovating the property and its facilities, on top of the substantial purchase price, no one is expecting it to be a profitable investment soon. They’re fine with that.\n\n\t“John makes a really good point about the dough,” McG says, “because I think a lot of financial people kicked us in the shins and said, ‘Not such a hot financial idea.’ And we just kind of shrugged because it was always emotional. It’s well-known that John is a premiere watch collector and a giant voice in that community. And I kind of wrapped my head around, if John buys a very interesting watch, it doesn’t pay a dividend; I’m sure his business manager told him he overpaid for it, all those things… But he gets to live with the watch, enjoy the watch, take it out for a test spin, do the thing, enjoy it. And it’s very likely to go from the value of one to the value of two over the course of time, even in the absence of making prudent financial sense. So I think that you’ve gotta look at it like one of John’s watches, if you will.”\n\n\t“Yeah, it would be one of my watches that I love wearing more than I care about the P&L or what the books say it is,” agrees Mayer. “You don’t hear, as you’re scrolling through on line, about making a contribution in some way — having something in your name that is less about a portfolio and more about having a piece of something and having a part in preserving something. There are people in L.A. who have never needed a recording studio and will never need to come here, who are going to be very happy that a building in L.A. that was known as one thing has changed hands and will continue to be known as the same thing.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChaplin Studios, formerly A&M and Henson Studios\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrecht Van’t Hof\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAre there other major investors that McG and Mayor will need to answer to as they steer the lot toward a hoped-for profit someday?\n\n\t“We didn’t really look up each other’s pant leg,” says McG. “We split it right down the middle. I brought in a couple of friends to help offset [some of the down payment]. My nephew gave me a couple bucks… It was a lot of money for me. We had to put down a lot cash to make the deal work… We all became sort of blinded with desire just to get it done at the end there.  But we got it done and, at the end of the day, what matters most is, it’s dually John and McG.”\n\t\n\n\t“Yeah, I mean, I think it’s just you and I on the paperwork,” says Mayer.\n\n\t“Yeah, there’s no ‘And therefore we also have to check with the big Daddy Warbucks character.’ It’s truly just us,” McG says.\n\n\t“I have a food truck business,” adds Mayer. “I just went into that … used my profits from the food truck.” He’s kidding, although, as is sometimes the case with him, it might take a beat or two to realize it.\n\n\tThe two co-owners got almost everything they wanted in procuring the lot — with a couple of symbolic exceptions that were denied by the property’s last two sets of owners. They were not allowed to use the A&M name, and the statue of Kermit dressed as Charlie Chaplin that had towered over the LaBrea front entrance for 25 years was carted off to go to a museum, despite a vociferous case being made to leave the frog where he stood.\n\n\t“The Hensons took the Kermit dressed as the Tramp and put it in a museum in Atlanta that’s dedicated to Jim Henson, which I think is terribly sad for the people of Los Angeles,” McG says. “I’ve always made it analogous to, like, if we all owned Randy’s Donuts, but we sold it to the barbecue place, I think between us and the barbecue person, just leave the donut up there… Griffith Park Observatory, Formosa Cafe, the Hollywood sign — we don’t have that much, so don’t keep cannibalizing and chipping away. A woman I work with takes her kids to school every day on this road, and she says, ‘My kids every day would say, “What’s up, Kerms?” Now, they don’t.’ And it breaks my heart, and I think that it’s an opportunity missed. I think it transcends the Henson family, respectfully, and transcends John or McG or anybody. I feel like at a certain point it belongs to the city, and I’m very sad to see it go. Oh, well.”\n\n\tWhen it came to renaming the facility from Henson Studios, there were issues of whether to go back in time and, if so, how far back.\n\n\tSays McG, “My company’s called Wonderland Sound and Vision, and of course, John’s breakout hit is ‘Your Body Is a Wonderland’…”\n\n\t“And my best song to date, by the way,” interjects Mayer, tongue firmly in cheek.\n\n\tMcG: “So a woman I work a lot with goes, ‘Are you guys gonna call it Your Body Is a Wonderland Sound and Vision? And I’m like, no.”\n\t\n\n\tAnother idea: “People for a long time were saying, just call it J&M,” Mayer notes. Another immediate no.\n\n\t“But we even took a run at just, ‘Hey, should we call it A&M?’” says McG. “Because I’m of a generation where I just regard this as A&M. I used to hang out on the docks begging everybody for CDs, so I associate it with that period. But there were problems with Universal Music Group being proprietary about this, that and the other.” Technically, A&M is part of a current label name — Interscope Geffen A&M — which represents some of the imprints that Universal bought and absorbed, although at this point the A&M part is more of a faintly nostalgic technicality than a distinct entity with any connection to the house that Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss built. “They just couldn’t see it,” says a frustrated Mayer. “They had A&M Records. This would’ve been A&M Studios. Two nodes… They couldn’t get it.”\n\n\tBut sometimes simpler is better (as anyone who has ever had to wrap their tongues around Interscope Geffen A&M can attest), and “Chaplin” is pretty simple.\n\n\t“It’s difficult to correctly launch the narrative of a new brand in 2026,” Mayer says. “And if you take any name you have in mind for a studio and put the word ‘studio’ after it, it exists online… It’s very hard to find a (new) name for a studio that still has vowels in it… What I liked about Chaplin is, it is a 100-year-old brand, and there’s this second life to it. I thought this could be really interesting, to have people in their twenties who are working on their first album go to a place called Chaplin, even if they’re not aware of what the connection is. How can you get those who understand the legendary contributions Charlie Chaplin made to film understand it, and have a new cohort of artists just see a name that looks and sounds good, hoping that at some point people go, ‘I didn’t know there was a person behind Chaplin’? You don’t go to buy a Ford Raptor and interface so much with Henry Ford and his legacy. But it’s important to keep legacies alive. I think it’s cooler to have it exist in a constant but very low-grade way, so that you have just kind of a pinky locked on it, but move forward.”\n\n\tA tour of the facility establishes that everything still around on the lot that has any connection to Chaplin’s era, which extended from 1917 through 1953, is being carefully preserved… except in cases of pure dry rot being uncovered.\n\t\n\n\tStanding out in front of the La Brea entrance on the exterior sidewalk, McG says, “We started to redo everything in the spirit of getting it exactly like it was when Chaplin built it. We did the research with the width of the strip oak that he put in for the hardwood floors and replaced them.” In front, “We chipped off the paint and we got the original colors from when Chaplin did it and did the analytics, so it was the exact brown and the exact white. We did all the landscaping to make it more beautiful for the forward-facing part of La Brea, just trying to give back to the city, since there’s a lot of blight around here, and we’re just trying to be a moment of light in that. And these wooden buildings are historically protected” — but not necessarily in the exact spots they were in the 1910s. “When they widened La Brea, they had to put ’em on logs and push ’em back.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMcG points out features on a vintage overhead view of the A&M/Henson lot, now Chaplin Studios\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSigns of Chaplin’s reign remain within. On a tour of the buildings, for instance, Ganjehei shows off a furnace where the silent film legend used to burn outtakes, after examining dailies in his screening room right across the front entrance. Some of Chaplin’s footprints remain in cement in an inner courtyard. In McG’s own office, there are stained glass windows that apparently date back to when Chaplin held court there. “A few years back, there was a really bad car accident on LaBrea, and the fire hydrant went up and the water destroyed the wall, and when we knocked down the wall for the repair work, these windows were discovered. It’s so beautiful that Mc G is now including it in his office,” Ganjehei says. The director says that other glass windows will be replaced with Mondrian-style glass to match the original.\n\n\tThere are other artifacts or entire buildings that remain from the silent era. On the slightly tawdry side, the studio overseer points to a mostly out-of-sight loft where “rumor has it that that’s where Chaplin would keep his concubines of sorts.” Chaplin’s original grooming and makeup chair sits near the entrance to Studio A. Down the hall, there is a table with books perched on it that propped up a studio saw a hundred years ago, still branded with the “C.C. Film Co.” logo. In the building still called “the mill,” is “apparently the oldest standing saw, minus the blades, in the West,” Ganjehei says. All this woodworking talk leads to anecdotes about how, in the A&M era, there would be shout-outs about “needing the carpenters,” only for Richard and Karen Carpenter to answer the call.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDetail of Charlie Chaplin-era woodsaw table at the Chaplin Studios\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharlie Chaplin’s makeup chair, on display at the Chaplin Studios\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMost of the footprint of the lot remains as it has been since the late ‘60s, when Jerry Moss and Herb Alpert bought it and transformed two of the three soundstages to five recording studios. Each of these six spaces where music or video productions are made has its own history.\n\n\tThe recording studios continued to be made available to outsiders during the quarter-century Henson had the place, while the soundstage was mostly utilized for Henson’s own kids’ shows, with exceptions.\n\n\tLately, the giant stage has been used for everything from “Knives Out: Wake Up Dead Man” pickup shots to a Stella McCartney fashion show to a benefit concert Mayer and his band did for a veterans’ charity. They have been looking at what kind of event should be held there during Grammy Week.\n\n\t“I want it to be the kind of place where, if the event is happening here, the address is the pull to go,” says Mayer. “That might sound a little superficial, but I think that’s an interesting way to create a goal. Can the address become ‘Ooh, there’s a thing at Chaplin. It doesn’t matter what it is, that’s a cool place to go hang.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChaplin Studios\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrecht Van’t Hof\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere are more outdoor chairs and tables, and more greenery and fountains, to “soften” the facility… not that everyone didn’t already just dig a nice bungalow. McG has gotten down into the dirt to do some of the planting himself, the studio manager avows.\n\n\t“What you see with these gardens and stuff… for me, the whole impetus of this place was, everywhere we shoot, literally around the world, when it’s wrapped, you’re like,’How fast can we get the fuck outta here?’” says the filmmaker. “Here, when you finish your work, it’s like, ‘Do you want a glass of wine? Do you wanna hang out and talk a little bit?’ And I find that so magical.”\n\n\tYou will not find Mayer literally getting into the dirt, himself. Although if you are in one of the studios and you happen to need a guitar part, and you come across Mayer in the hallway, he might oblige you, without taking a credit.\n\n\tAs for whether there is a need for this kind of advanced studio anymore, when home studios are capable of so much in the 2020s, Mayer has an answer: “It’s work from home versus working from the office. And I think it’s cool to hedge your bet on the side of humanity,” especially when you don’t know who you’ll meet on a bathroom break in the hallway or sipping wine on the patio.\n\t\n\n\tThat’s why they haven’t made any major renovations to the structure or look, especially, of the recording studios, knowing that part of the appeal is being able to go into the exact room — Studio C — where Joni Mitchell recorded “Blue” and several other albums. Mitchell came by the studio last month, to revisit the scene of the crime at a holiday party, and was no doubt pleased to see that it’s Henry Diltz photos of her that everyone who comes in first sees, establishing a Laurel Canyon vibe.\n\n\t“If artists walked in and immediately everything was LED back-lit…” says Mayer, letting that distasteful thought trail off. “There’s a nomenclature to being in the studio that lives in its own timeframe, and you just let people relate to that still. Even the tapestries… there’s just something about tapestries and string lights that make people want to write songs, even if it’s not the most modern, Tesla-fied thing.”\n\n\tAt times it can be a tough choice to upgrade, or not to upgrade, for fear of ruining the unknown ingredients that make a room unlike any other on the planet. \n\n\t““I was telling John a lot of the buildings are built like film sets,” McG says. “I remember getting the reports, where there would be gaps in a window where the breeze will come in, and someone is like, ‘For God’s sake, a spider could crawl through! You gotta seal those windows.’ And I’m just like, if I seal it, that California smell might be erased — I can’t do it.” They had hoped to renovate Chaplin’s private screening room, which is largely intact, but can’t, because there is a star music client — they won’t say who — who adopted it as a makeshift recording studio some time back and swears by the unique sound of the room, which obviously was not even designed for music-making. For now, it will remain piled with music equipment, not film projection; whoever isn’t budging from that valuable bit of lot real estate has to be a high-profile squatter.\n\n\tSometimes, an artist’s attachment to a room staying exactly as it is can border on superstition. Studio B, where McG and Mayer are presently sitting, was undergoing some important renovation work at the end of the ’70s when Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers needed a place to finish “Damn the Torpedos.” Petty and Jimmy Iovine so loved the sound they got there that architect Vincent Van Hoff  got a middle-of-the-night call saying, “You are not allowed to finish this room. Do not touch it.’ They were even trying to convince the senior manager to keep the tools in the corner” in case that was a factor. “So hence, all these years later, the floor, the ceiling, and the walls are unfinished.” There is also a giant crystal in Studio B, known as “the Karen crystal” in honor of Karen Carpenter; it’s a replacement for the one that Alpert and Ross originally had installed in the room, but they keep it lit 24 hours a day. \n\t\n\n\tGanjehel, the studio manager, will happily reel off past recordings of yore: The largest studio, A, can handle a 45-piece orchestra, and has been home to everything from vintage Burt Bacharach, Alpert and Sergio Mendes recordings to Guns N’ Roses’ “Use Your Illusion” projects to five out of the last six Paul McCartney albums to Justin Bieber’s recent “Swag” (volumes one and two). The smaller Studio D, on the other end of the hallway, has hosted the Doors, U2, Fleetwood Mac, Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, Miley Cyrus and the last two Harry Styles albums.\n\n\tBut don’t ever imagine the studio manager is ever going to give up who is currently woriing in the studio. “We don’t kiss and tell,” she says. Not even to major rock stars or a co-owner.\n\n\t“Lady Gaga a couple years ago was recording in Studio B, and the Stones were in studio A and D,” she recalls. “Mick Jagger comes up and says, ‘I hear Lady Gaga’s here.’ And we respond with, ‘We don’t discuss who’s here.’ But the bodyguards made it happen. Lady Gaga was sitting on this couch and I said, ‘Mick asked if you were here, but everything is so private and confidential and we really, really value that.’ And she said, ‘You can always tell Mick Jagger when I’m here.’ She recorded that duet with them [“Sweet Sounds of Heaven,” from their 2023 “Hackney Diamonds” album] two hours later.”\n\n\tSays Mayer, talking about the years before he bought the lot, “Faryal never let me know who else was here. And you might say that my half of this place was worth paying just to get the calendar every day, being let behind that very iron curtain of who was in the building every day, I’m still not over it, I don’t think.”\n\n\t“May I add, I’m not behind that iron curtain,” McG protests. “As recently as yesterday, Faryal was chewing my ear off because there was a truck loading in something, and she goes, ‘I have an artist coming’,” but she wouldn’t say who. “I’m shooting a fucking nude scene with Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hardy — I can handle the discretion of who the artist is! But I don’t say anything and I honor the code. So when I’ve earned it, that’ll be a hell of a day and I’ll definitely elbow John, like, ‘She let me in, dude.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChaplin Studios’ soundstage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrecht Van’t Hof\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith Bieber no longer on the premises, they can acknowledge press reports of an unusual recent request that made use of the large soundstage for a non-filming purpose.\n\t\n\n\tSays Mayer, “Faryal wrote me one Saturday morning: ‘Hey, Justin’s gonna be in the studio. He mentioned wanting a basketball court. What do you think about turning the soundstage into a basketball court for him?” I said, ‘Great, but I don’t know that you can do that.’ Two or three hours later on that night, I get an image of what looks like a perfect basketball court with a three-point line and a foul line and everything, all done with tape. The runners had figured out how to do it.”\n\n\tAs for whether whims like that need to be indulged, Mayer, perhaps not surprisingly, is on the side of the talent. “I staunchly defend artists both as being more normal than you think and way more screwed up than you think. And I try to protect the best parts of both of ’em. So if Justin Bieber had something that you could hear on ‘Swag’ that was nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys because he was able to shoot a little hoops on a break, then we’ve done our job.”\n\n\tThe match of personalities between Mayer and McG has been a good one, they avow, after 10 months of working together tightly, as two guys who both talk very fast and who can both use big words like “nomenclature” while talking that fast. To say nothing of shared ambitions.\n\n\t“I like high-octane personalities,” says Mayer. “I think it’s fair to say, McG, you have a high-octane personality. I have somewhat of a high-octane personality. And I know how to weave in and out of that, and I know how to let someone else rip when it’s time to rip.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMcG and John Mayer at the Chaplin Studios\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Willman/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPreservation was far from their only reason for acquiring the Chaplin Studios, but it’s neither negligible nor ignoble as a factor.\n\n\tSays McG, “I hope that organically it will be revealed: Oh, that was the tenure where John and McG were the torch bearers and hopefully will be regarded as they did a good job and they threw down for Los Angeles. They put their money where their mouth was. I love what Jason Reitman did with the Village Westwood theater, where he got a consortium of superheroes to kind of come in and save it. It’s like, we don’t need another six-story mixed-use. They’re not cool… We really should take a look at what made Los Angeles great and be of a mind that those things don’t grow on trees and not everything is disposable.”\n\t\n\n\tMayer has his own take on that. “I wonder if at some point, like 10 years from now, someone who’s gonna be 30 will stand outside of Supreme [the clothing store that moved into Tower Records’ old Sunset building] as it’s being closed down and go, ‘You just can’t keep anything good these days.’ They probably will, because I do think that probably every generation thinks that their thing is the thing that matters the most — except this building has five generations. So I think if you can [hold onto it], you should, right?”\n\n\t(More details about the lot can be found here, with specific information about the soundstage here and the recording studios here.)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChaplin Studios\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrecht Van’t Hof\n\t\n\n\n",

That's according to a show she had last night in Las Vegas, where she gave her relationship dealbreakers.\n      \n    \n          Just after singing her 1999 smash hit \"If You Had My Love,\" J Lo reflected on her love life over the quarter-century she's been performing the song.\n      \n    \n          The singer told the packed crowd, she sang it with hope at first, but over the years, she's also sung it when she was sad. Now, she says, she sings it in power.\n      \n\n          She explained ... \"Because the truth is, if you wanted to have my love, you would have to earn it. You would have to treat me right. You would have to respect me. You'd have to accept me for all that I am. You'd have to love me if you wanted my love.\"\n      \n    \n          But J Lo admitted love was complicated and didn't come without a price.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          \"You can't have love without heartbreak,\" she said.\n      \n    \n          In fact, the song itself may be closely tied to heartbreak. Drake used it as a sample on his song \"Teenage Fever\" amid rumors of a romantic fling between the two.\n      \n    \n          J Lo has, of course, weathered her share of ups and downs in her public love life. Her confirmed exes include Marc Anthony, Ben Affleck, Alex Rodriguez, and Diddy.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          She most recently finalized her divorce from Affleck last year.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jennifer Lopez\n              \n                          \n                Drake\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Jennifer Lopez Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Concerts and Tours\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tWME’s Music for Visual Media department and Allegro Talent Group have merged to form a film and music television division.\n\n\tEstablished in 2012 by Patty Macmillan, Allegro is a boutique agency specializing in representing composers and music supervisors. Together, WME and Allegro will bring together a strong roster of multi-hyphenate composers, many of whom are also successful across touring, producing, songwriting and directing.\n\n\n\tMacmillan and agent Lauren Kahler will join WME and continue to represent their existing clients, bringing new opportunities across film, television, games, live performance and beyond through WME’s cross-departmental collaboration.

Together, we look forward to creating expanded avenues for growth across film, television, games and emerging platforms.”\n\n\tMacmillan said, “From the beginning, our agency has been about meaningful relationships, creative trust, and long-term career guidance.” She added, “WME shares those values and this partnership allows us to build on our foundation while offering clients the scale and reach of a global powerhouse.”\n\n\tTogether, WME and Allegro have represented six of the best score Oscar winners out of the last 7 years.  Allegro’s clients include Hildur Guðnadóttir (“Joker”), Volker Bertelmann (“All Quiet on the Western Front”), Clément Ducol and Camille (“Emilia Perez”), Dustin O’Halloran “(Eleanor the Great”) and Natalie Holt (“Loki”).

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNO OTHER CHOICE, (aka EOJJEOLSUGA EOBSDA), LEE Byung-hun, 2025. © Neon /Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best International Feature Commentary (Updated Nov. 6, 2025): The Oscars race for international feature looks to be returning with 86 films competing to bring the statuette home for their respective homeland.\n\n\tWhile the Academy has yet to release its official list of eligible titles, the submitted films have already been strategically assigned into seven voter groups, each containing 12 to 13 films. The groupings are curated to ensure diversity in region, genre and running time. Voters must watch all films in their assigned group in order for their ballot to count. First-round voting will take place Dec. 9-12, with a 15-film shortlist scheduled to be announced Dec. 16.\n\n\tThis year’s contenders include buzzy festival breakouts from Cannes, high-profile auteur projects and debut features from emerging cinema markets. Norway’s “Sentimental Value,” co-written and directed by Joachim Trier, is among the most talked-about titles. Many pundits consider it a likely crossover contender for best picture, which by default, makes it the frontrunner for the prize.\n\n\tAlso drawing attention is the Palme d’Or winner “It Was Just an Accident,” France’s official entry, directed by the legendary Jafar Panahi. The politically charged drama has generated love across the international, and American festival circuit. South Korea’s “No Other Choice,” from Park Chan-wook, has built momentum following audience awards at Toronto and most recently, SCAD Savannah Film Festival. Park’s previous film, “Decision to Leave,” was a critical darling but failed to land a nom in 2022, leaving many people feeling he’s owed one.\n\n\tBrazil, last year’s Oscar winner in the category with “I’m Still Here,” returns with another bold entry — Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent,” a political thriller anchored by a widely praised lead turn from Wagner Moura, who could be among the best actor frontrunners. \n\n\tHungary also reenters the conversation with “Orphan,” a historical drama by László Nemes, who won the Oscar in 2016 for “Son of Saul.” Spain’s “Sirāt,” directed by Oliver Laxe and recently nominated for a Gotham Award, is another potential standout, along with Ukraine’s “2000 Meters to Andriivka” by Oscar-winning journalist-turned-director Mstyslav Chernov.\n\n\tTunisia’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” directed by Kaouther Ben Hania, continues the auteur’s strong Oscar track record. Ben Hania previously earned nods for both “The Man Who Sold His Skin” and “Four Daughters.” That film is among the many top-tier contenders from the Middle East including Hasan Hadi’s “The President’s Cake” from Iraq and Cherien Dabis’ “All That’s Left of You” from Jordan. \n\n\tOther noteworthy contenders include Palestine’s very own “Palestine 36” by Annemarie Jacir, which was picked up by Watermelon Pictures, and is set during the Arab Revolt of 1936 — a period Jacir describes as “a major turning point in our history.”\n\n\tTaiwan’s “Left-Handed Girl,” directed by Shih-Ching Tsou and co-written by four-time Oscar winner Sean Baker (“Anora”) has the backing of streaming giant Netflix, which will keep it top of mind when filling out ballots.\n\n\tFrance remains the all-time leader in nominations, with 42 nods and 12 wins from 72 submissions since 1948, but hasn’t taken home the statue since 1992’s “Indochine.” Italy, however, still holds the most wins with 14, from 33 nominations. This year Francesco Costabile’s dark melodrama “Familia” has been designated as Italy’s candidate, which launched from the 2024 from the Venice Film Festival. \n\n\tAs of 2025, 135 countries have submitted at least one film to the category, with 64 earning nominations and 30 winning at least once.\n\n\tAfter the shortlist is announced, any Academy member may vote to determine the final five nominees — who opts-in — and provided they’ve viewed all 15 shortlisted films. \n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, and eligibilities are subject to change. The list is not complete, and not all films have yet been qualified for Oscar consideration.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: \"The Voice Of Hind Rajab\" (Courtesy of the Venice Film Festival)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Sony Pictures Classics\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of SSIFF\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Credit: Cannes Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tKaty Perry‘s new single “Bandaids” has her reflecting on the end of her relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. Equally as frightening and emotionally-taxing is the single’s matching “Final Destination”-style video where Perry finds her positive outlook on life — notably at the core of her “143” album and era — has run dry.\n\n\t“It’s not what you did, it’s what you didn’t,” Perry sings in the introduction of the pop track. “You were there, but you weren’t.” \n\t\n\n\tThe video, directed by Christian Breslauer (SZA, Lizzo, Ariana Grande, Doja Cat), stitches together scenes where Perry’s carelessness leads her to nearly die — this ranges from electrocution (after leaving the “Light and Love Crystals” store) to car crashes and more.\n\n\tAt the end of the video, where Perry proclaims “if I had to do it all over again, I would still do it all over again,” she is left listening to the empowering chorus of her “Woman’s World” single at a gas station where she lights a cigarette and causes an explosion. \n\n\tPerry and Bloom announced their split earlier this summer after nine years together. They are now co-parenting their daughter, Daisy Dove. In the video, Perry finds a moment of calm amid the anxiety of her near-death encounters when she spots a white daisy growing from the ground — another symbol reflecting her real-life state of mind.\n\n\t“Bandaids” marks Perry’s first comeback following the release of her “143,” which she followed and supported with a global tour that concludes in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 7. The record — which featured 21 Savage, Kim Petras, Doechii and JID — debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 upon its release. \n\t\n\n\tWatch the video below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe cover of Rosalía’s fourth studio album, “Lux,” shows the Spanish (Catalan) artist cloaked in a nun’s habit. Beneath the white fabric, she cradles herself. Even the word “habit” resonates as both a symbolic garment and a daily practice, hinting at the religious virtues that underpin this triumphant and extraordinary four-part and 18-song opus. Unlike the razor-sharp, electronic world of her third and Grammy-winning album, “Motomami,” Rosalía’s latest places her inside an orchestra. You won’t find any obvious “hits” here; the focus is her voice and the ensemble-driven lift.\n\t\n\n\t“Lux” unfolds as a spiritual odyssey, built from the materials and references Rosalía has gathered and arranged with delicate intention over the past three years. It is as formidable a journey to make as it is to absorb, and that challenge is the very heart of the project. Far from contemporary pop, each note and lyric demands your full attention; the reward is transcendence, even as the material nudges you to annotate like a philosophy student with a highlighter in hand.\n\n\n\tIt’s worth remembering she is a conservatory-trained musician who famously attended the Catalonia College of Music, studying vocal flamenco performance in a prestigious program admitting only one student per year. The first solo female artist to win album of the year at the Latin Grammys since Shakira in 2006, Rosalía established herself as an aficionado of meaningful experimentation with the ethereal, flamenco-infused world of “El Mal Querer.” She doubled down on that innovation with “Motomami,” whose boundary-pushing collisions — ranging from reggaeton to pop, hip-hop and beyond — were unlike anything else happening in mainstream music (no matter the language) at the time. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s why listeners dove headfirst into the icy orchestral chaos of “Berghain,” a four-minute free-fall with Björk and Yves Tumor as the project’s first single. She does the unexpected throughout the entirety of “Lux,” challenging listeners not only with a drastic shift in musical direction from “Motomami,” but with a fully realized conceptual script. In promotional interviews, Rosalía has cited saints from around the world — often artists or unconventional women — as guiding lights. However far these references stretch, she fuses all eras, illuminating lessons of societal expectation, personal autonomy and the tension between devotion and desire. On “Novia Robot” (“Robot Girlfriend”), she sings in Mandarin (one of 13 languages featured): “All that you wanted / was a robot girlfriend / I’m sorry darling / but I’m real” — as an ode to Sun Bu’er, the Taoist poet-saint said to have disfigured herself with boiling oil to evade male attention and devote herself fully to her divine journey.\n\n\tThemes of sainthood thread throughout, but on “Porcelena,” the album’s ethos crystallizes: she accepts that she is simultaneously nothing and the “light of the world.” We glimpse her understanding of the self and the sacred — its terror, grief, ecstasy and suffering. These autobiographical flashes arrive in operatic waves. You hear them on songs like “La Perla,” where she calls out a “playboy” as an “emotional terrorist,” and “Focu Ranni,” a wrenching reflection on her broken engagement with reggaetón star Rauw Alejandro: “No one will throw rice at the sky… there’ll be no one to bless a love he’ll never truly know; I etched your name on my ribs / but my heart never had your initials.”\n\n\tThe instrumentals are as intricate and lush as her fervent vocal runs, which rise and collapse within seconds. Backed by walls of sound, you feel every tremor of her voice in her most fragile moments. It makes complete sense that she closes with images of her own funeral. On “Magnolis,” she sings: “They say if you see death pass by your side / in that long Mercedes / it’ll bring good luck / You’re all here / even my enemies cry today.” Her voice narrows to a whisper as she sings of this communion — between emptiness and divinity, and beyond relationships, money or the mundane. The void is not something to fill, she suggests, but rather it is a direct line to feeling God. \n\t\n\n\tIn a world oversaturated with noise, this level of artistic conviction reminds us that the boldest creators resist stasis. The deeper they turn inward, the more the world leans in to listen. \n",

    "body": "\n\tPauline Collins, the British actress known for her role in “Shirley Valentine,” died on Thursday in London. She was 85.\n\n\tThe BBC reported that Collins died peacefully in a care home surrounded by her family. Collins had Parkinson’s disease for several years. \n\n\t“Pauline was so many things to so many people, playing a variety of roles in her life. A bright, sparky, witty presence on stage and screen,” said Collins’ family in a statement to the BBC. “Her illustrious career saw her play politicians, mothers and queens. She will always be remembered as the iconic, strong-willed, vivacious and wise Shirley Valentine – a role that she made all her own. We were familiar with all those parts of her because her magic was contained in each one of them.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Exmouth, Devon, Collins was educated at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Before she started her career as an actress, she began her professional work as a teacher. In 1962, Collins made her West End debut in “Passion Flower Hotel” and got her first role in “Secrets of a Windmill Girl” in 1966.\n\n\tIn 1967, Collins appeared as Samantha Briggs in Doctor Who’s “The Faceless Ones,” starring alongside Patrick Troughton and Frazer Hines. Later in the ’70s, Collins played the role of Sarah in “Upstairs, Downstairs,” where she appeared regularly throughout the series.\n\n\tIn 1988, Collins starred in the one-woman play titled “Shirley Valentine,” then reprised her role on Broadway and in the film version in 1989. Playing a bored housewife who comes alive when she meets a man in Greece, Collins was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. \n\t\n\n\tAfter her role in “Shirley Valentine,” Collins starred in ITV’s “Forever Green,” created and written by Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham.\n\n\tIn 2001, Collins was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2001 Birthday Honours for services to drama. \n\n\tCollins is survived by her husband John Alderton, her three children, Nicholas, Kate, and Richard, and her family.\n",

    "body": "\n\tComcast has taken a step closer to making an offer for parts of Warner Bros. Discovery — but not WBD in its entirety — with the retention of two banking advisers, Variety has confirmed. \n\n\tComcast is among the players looking to potentially cut an M&A deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, which officially put itself on the block last month. Others seeking a play for WBD include David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, which has made offers for the whole company, and Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tComcast has hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to evaluate a potential bid for WBD assets and has gained access to WBD’s financial data, a source familiar with the matter said, confirming a report by Reuters.\n\n\n\tComcast is in the process of splitting off most of NBCUniversal’s cable networks into a new company, Versant, a transaction expected to be completed by the end of 2025. The thinking is that Comcast would look to bid for WBD’s streaming and studios business; Warner Bros. Discovery is itself has been in the process of separating into two entities, Warner Bros. (HBO Max and studios) and Discovery Global (TV networks and Discovery+).\n\n\tLast month Warner Bros. Discovery’s announced that it had received in-bound M&A interest from “multiple parties” and has commenced a process to review such offers. WBD’s board said it will consider  a deal structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. (the streaming and studios side) with a third-party acquirer alongside a spin-off of Discovery Global to shareholders. \n\n\tMike Cavanagh, Comcast’s co-CEO, told analysts during the cable and media giant’s Q3 earnings call last week that “the bar is high” for the company to consider a major merger of acquisition. But he didn’t rule anything out — and suggested that Comcast’s ability to secure federal approval for any transaction would improve once the Versant spinoff of its linear cable channels (other than Bravo) into is completed.\n\t\n\n\tCavanagh said that “what we’d be looking for and what we’re going to look like post-Versant spin, I think more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that’s out there.”\n\n\tEllison, who just closed the deal to form Paramount Skydance in August, has made three escalating bids for Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. The board of Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected all three as too low, including Ellison’s most recent one last month for $23.50/share.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Netflix is exploring a bid for some piece of WBD and retained investment bank Moelis & Co. to put together a prospective offer, Reuters reported last week. Moelis was the financial adviser to David Ellison’s Skydance Media in its takeover of Paramount Global to former Paramount Skydance.\n\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on its Q3 earnings interview last week that the company has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” indicating that an acquisition of WBD in its entirety — including networks like CNN, TBS, HGTV and Food Network — is off the table. Sarandos did say Netflix can be “choosy” about its M&A targets, but he added: “Nothing is a must-have for us to meet our goals that we have for the business.”\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, speaking on the media conglom’s Q3 earnings call Thursday, said, “You’ve all seen media reports as to potential interested parties, and I won’t comment on anything specific. But it’s fair to say that we have an active process underway. When you look at our films like ‘Superman,’ ‘Weapons’ and ‘One Battle After Another,’ the global reach of HBO Max and the diversity of our networks offerings, we’ve managed to bring the best, most treasured traditions of Warner Bros. forward into a new era of entertainment and new media landscape.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMore changes are underway at CBS’ “CIA,” the latest “FBI” offshoot. Showrunner Warren Leight, best known for his work on multiple seasons of “Law & Order: SVU,” has stepped back from his role as showrunner.\n\n\tIn July, Leight took over the role from David Hudgins. Sources tell Variety that Mike Weiss, the current showrunner of “FBI,” is in talks to take over while also continuing to showrun and executive produce “FBI.”\n\n\n\tProduction will be pausing on “CIA” briefly during the showrunner transition, but it is not anticipated that the changes will impact the premiere date, currently set for mid-season.\n\t\n\n\tThe one-hour crime drama is led by Tom Ellis and “Chicago Med” alum Nick Gehlfuss, who play “two unlikely partners – a fast-talking, rule-breaking loose cannon CIA case officer (Ellis), and a by-the-book, seasoned and smart FBI agent (Gehlfuss) who believes in the rule of law.”\n\n\tPer the official logline, “When this odd couple are assigned to work out of CIA’s New York Station, they must learn to work together to investigate cases and criminals posing threats on U.S. soil, finding that their differences may actually be their strength.” \n\n\tNatalee Linez also stars in the drama, and casting is underway for a new chief of station, a role previously played by Michael Michele. Michele recently exited the show.\n\n\t“CIA” and “FBI” are from Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, in association with Wolf Entertainment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTyler Perry is putting his spin on the classic holiday movie genre with his latest rom-com, “Finding Joy.”\n\n\tThe movie, now streaming on Prime Video, follows the unlikely love story of Joy and Ridge, played by Shannon Thornton and Tosin Morohunfola. The plot centers on Joy (Thornton), a New York-based fashion designer, who is overlooked at work. With the encouragement of her friends, Ashley (Brittany S. Hall) and Littia (Inayah), Joy, a hopeless romantic, follows her crush, Colton (Aaron O’Connell), to Colorado to meet his family — under the impression that the trip will take their relationship to the next level. But upon arrival, Joy quickly gets friend-zoned when her crush reveals he has a fiancée. Joy attempts to book a flight back to the city, but finds herself stranded in the middle of a snowstorm and suffers a near-fatal car crash. Ridge (Morohunfola) not only saves her life but also reshapes her outlook on everything — especially, love.\n\t\n\n\tBut “Finding Joy” isn’t your typical Hallmark-esque film where a successful single woman from the city adopts a newfound appreciation for Christmas in a small town after falling for a handsome, local man. Instead, the film separates itself from the genre’s cheesier elements by inviting audiences on a heartfelt journey that explores the true meaning of love, resilience and personal growth found in unexpected circumstances. Plus, Perry puts an emphasis on spotlighting Black love.​ \n\n\n\t“It’s Black,” Thornton tells Variety, emphasizing what makes this story unique. “It’s the Black experience. It’s how we actually talk to each other.”\n\t\n\n\t​Over the years, audiences have critiqued Perry for perpetuating negative stereotypes and centering Black women in limited storylines that are mired in struggle, hardships and trauma. However, “Finding Joy” veers away from those tropes and combines themes of grief, heartbreak and sisterhood to highlight hope, healing and the transformative power of love.\n\n\t“I love that it’s just unexpected, and they’re kind of just going with what they feel, and not really playing games,” Thornton says. “They’re forced together in almost unnatural circumstances, and they just came together in a beautiful and unexpected way. It’s a really nice, really adorable way to show Black love on screen.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShannon Thornton, Inayah, Brittany S. Hall in “Finding Joy.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChip Bergmann/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWorking with Perry was an adventure all its own. While it wasn’t Thornton’s first time taking part in one of Perry’s productions — she was a supporting player in his Netflix movie “Mea Culpa” — it was both the actors’ first time as his main stars.\n\n\t“He welcomed me with open arms,” Morohunfola says about meeting Perry for the first time. “He empowered me to feel like I could make the character my own and also honor his vision at the same time. I knew I was in good hands.”\n\n\tPerry’s famously fast production schedule took some getting used to, though. “Finding Joy” was shot in just five days, so the pressure was on. \n\n\t“It was a fun and exciting challenge for me as an actor,” Thornton says. “I’m like, ‘What can I do if I had this amount of time and not be reliant on so many takes?’ I’m really happy with what I did given the amount of time I had.”\n\n\tBut Thornton can’t take all the credit for memorizing the script so quickly; Perry had a group of readers on set who helped run lines. “I wasn’t sure I could do it, or if I was capable of memorizing so much in a short amount of time, but I did it,” she adds. “As an actor, I was able to make very honest choices and still be fully in it, and have little moments of nuance.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAaron O’Connell and Shannon Thornton in “Finding Joy.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChip Bergmann/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAudiences might recognize Thornton as Keyshawn from the Starz series “P-Valley.” But her role on the ensemble drama didn’t compare to what stepping into her first leading film role required, and she battled instances of “imposter syndrome” and “self-doubt.”\n\t\n\n\t​“I had a little bit of experience while shooting ‘P-Valley’ Season 2, when Keyshawn gets her own episode. I got that little feeling in my belly like, ‘Can I do this? Am I capable of carrying something like this on my own?’” Thornton says of preparing for the part. “It’s the little moments of doubting yourself. And you have to say, ‘I deserve to be here. I’m going to receive all of these great things coming my way. I’m absolutely capable.’ That’s when the training comes in, and all the hard work that you put in for years leading up to this moment.”\n\n\tThat’s one of the ways Thornton resonated with Joy, whose pursuit of launching her own fashion line resembled Thornton’s journey as an actor. (Thornton lived in New York for 11 years, trying to get her big break.) “That’s how I can relate to her,” Thornton says of sharing a similar backstory with the character. “The hustle of having something to do and somewhere to be as soon as you wake up. The discomfort of your situation being the catalyst that gets you going.”\n\n\tSimilarly, Morohunfola also identified with Ridge’s country upbringing — raised in Greensburg, Kan., Morohunfola’s was the only Black family in the small, rural town — but what resonated most was the love story unfolding between the two characters.\n\n\t“That happens all the time: people whom you don’t think that you’re supposed to be connected to, somehow you feel a connection with, and they unlock something in you that you never knew needed to be unlocked. That’s as human as could be,” he explains. “I’ve experienced that in the past. The best part of life is the magic of love in unexpected places.”\n\n\tMorohunfola admits he isn’t the biggest fan of holiday movies, but when he first read the script for “Finding Joy,” Ridge’s range of emotions stood out.\n\n\t“Not every holiday movie has depth, and that’s something that drew me to this one,” he explains. “When I saw Ridge, I immediately saw somebody more than two-dimensional. On the outside, he has a rough exterior, but underneath that, you’ve got a vulnerable, loving and caring person who needs the help of the right person to bring that out.”\n\n\tHe adds: “I always look for characters with layers that remind me of men that I’ve seen in my life and can identify with. There are a lot of people walking around with pain that makes them seem tough on the outside, but they’re capable of love like anybody else.”\n\t\n\n\tMorohunfola hopes that audiences will come away from the film having learned something about love.\n\n\t“This film does a good job of depicting how love doesn’t care about those boundaries,” Morohunfola says. “Joy thinks she’s high class and above Ridge as a city girl. Ridge is a rural, country boy who doesn’t care for social media or any basic modernity. But it doesn’t matter how different they are culturally, because what brings them together is stronger than any of that.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShannon Thornton in “Finding Joy.”\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBob Iger is getting ready for his encore farewell.\n\n\tThe Disney CEO is starting to lay the stepping stones to the expected news of plans for a regime change at the top of the Mouse House by the first quarter of next year. In October 2024, Disney’s board of directors vowed to spell out its succession plan for Iger, who will have held the top job for 20 years by the time his current contract ends in December 2026.\n\n\n\tIger reflected on his time at the Disney in an interview with British podcasters Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook, hosts of the long-running podcast series “The Rest is History.” The pair turned their focus to the creation of Disneyland in the mid-1950s for an installment published Wednesday. Iger has long been a fan of the podcast and agreed to give the hosts a sit-down interview, as well as a guided tour of Disney’s archives in Burbank and the Magic Kingdom in Anaheim.\n\t\n\n\tHolland and Sandbrook politely but firmly press Iger about the transition that is just around the corner. Iger stepped down as CEO of Disney after a 15-year run that made him the gold standard of media and entertainment executives. He left Disney entirely at the end of 2021. But Iger was back as CEO by November 2022 after his first successor, studio veteran Bob Chapek, had a rocky tenure at a volatile time for the economy and the nation overall. At present, industry speculation about Iger’s successor centers on two internal candidates, Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden and Disney Experiences chair Josh D’Amaro.\n\n\tIger made no direct reference to the Chapek shuffle or the handoff to come in discussing how he views his legacy, and what he has learned after four decades at the Walt Disney Co. and more than 50 years in the entertainment biz. Holland and Sandbrook pressed Iger about how he wanted to be remembered for his tenure as Mouse House chief. \n\t\n\n\t“Because of the company’s place in the world, I think the person running the company has a special responsibility of sorts, to maintain Disney’s position in the world as a beloved company, as an admired company, as a company that entertains really the world, everyone of all ages and from all different walks of life,” Iger says in the episode “Disneyland: The Modern American Utopia.”\n\n\t“More than anything else, I would want to be known as someone who was given the keys to this kingdom, so to speak. And quite a kingdom it is, and that I brought it to a place that even Walt would be proud of. And what that means is more great storytelling to a larger audience, more innovation, more risk-taking, more really creation of happiness. It’s really that simple,” Iger says. “At one point I thought, Well, OK, you’re now running Disney. What’s the most you want out of it? Well, not don’t screw it up, but it’s much more than that. I really have been mindful of the duty that I feel has been handed to me to make it even better than it’s ever been.”\n\n\tWhat does the road to the next 50 years of Disney, which marked its centennial in 2023, look like for his successor? Protect the brand, Iger advises.\n\n\t“The world is changing so rapidly and in such profound ways. As I think about the future, I would hope that my successors would be respectful of our past and well aware of the values that really created the value of the company in the first place, and carry them forward, but not let anything that’s been done in the past get in the way of bringing the company into the future,” Iger says. “And that’s really constant innovation, a constant exploration, constant desire to reinvent or to invent even more than anything else. That’s what I’d want. But I think we do occupy a place in the world as great storytellers, perhaps maybe the greatest in many respects. And I would hope that position would would continue for years and years, decades ahead.”\n\n\tMost of the interview was devoted to discussion of the innovations of Walt Disney himself, the creative visionary who died in 1966 at age 65. Iger proved to be a fount of knowledge about the company’s founder. His reverence for Walt Disney’s legacy of business derring-do coupled with a relentless push for innovation is clear as he runs through Walt Disney’s list of awe-inspiring achievements.\n\t\n\n\tThe yearning to invest in cutting-edge technology, R&D and experimental material is imbued in the DNA of a artist and entrepreneur from Missouri who bet his company on the gamble of releasing Hollywood’s first feature-length animated feature, 1937’s “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”\n\n\t“If you ask what everything is going to cost before you make everything, or even think about making something, then you end up not making a lot that you should have made,” Iger opines. \n\n\tWalt Disney was never one to be “cowed” by new technology, Iger added. Quite the contrary. He famously turned to the burgeoning medium of television to help raise the money to build Disneyland. Call it TV’s first docu-series.\n\n\t“Walt was, as we know, not only a great storyteller, but one of the all time, great salesmen of his time. , and he decided that not only to raise the money, but also to sell the product, he should have a television program. So he licensed to ABC, a program that essentially told the story of building Disneyland,” Iger says. “And so here I was as a 3-4-5 year-old, watching on small, black and white TV. Walt not only talk about building Disneyland, but watching it on the program actually rise from the ground in Orange County, California. And I remember it being incredibly aspirational. And I think actually it served that purpose to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people around the world seeing it, which seemed like something that never existed before, a form of entertainment that he really invented.”\n\n\tThe hosts pressed Iger on how Disney is grappling with the the globalization of media and culture in a brand that is synonymous with Americana past and present. \n\n\t“It’s not purposeful on our part to become less American. It is purposeful on our part, to become more inviting to the world and to be mindful of cultural distinctions and cultural passion. For instance, when we were building Shanghai, the design brief that I gave to the team was, let’s build something that is authentically Disney, but distinctly Chinese,” Iger says. \n\n\t“Because we wanted to build something that was very much Disney to them, and they had an idea in mind of what A Disneyland would be, but something that was extremely respectful of their own culture, so that they could feel as though it were theirs. Again, it’s more purposeful to fit in a respectful way than to distance ourselves from anything like letting the French drink wine,” he says. “I think there were learnings about entering a country and a culture with a little bit more sensitivity and respect. We took those learnings seriously, and as we designed Shanghai, we made sure that we didn’t make mistakes that had been made in the past.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the interview below: \n\n\n\n",

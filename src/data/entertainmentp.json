    "body": "\n\tTunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania, whose “The Voice of Hind Rajab” is a contender in the 2026 Oscars for Best International Feature, will receive a special tribute at Italy’s Biografilm Festival, the unique event billed as a cinematic celebration of human lives.\n\n\tBen Hania – who in September elicited the longest standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival for “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” which premiered to more than 20 minutes of thunderous applause and then won the Silver Lion – will be feted with the fest’s International Celebration of Lives Award. According to a statement, the honor is dedicated to “recognizing filmmakers whose work has left an indelible mark on contemporary cinema and the art of real-world storytelling.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director, whose two previous films — “The Man Who Sold His Skin” and “Four Daughters” — were also Oscar-nominated, has been touring the festival circuit with “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” which centers on a single, haunting voice: that of a real 5-year-old Palestinian girl trapped inside a car that was attacked by Israeli forces in Gaza and later found dead.\n\n\n\tThe Biografilm Festival tribute will see Ben Hania return to the Biografilm Festival following her appearance at the event’s 2024 edition for the Italian premiere of “Four Daughters” that weaves documentary and fiction, exploring the story of Tunisia’s Olfa Hamrouni who publicized the radicalization of her two teenage daughters who had left Tunisia to fight with ISIS.\n\n\tIn a joint statement Biografilm Festival artistic directors Chiara Liberti and Massimo Benvegnù expressed their enthusiasm for this year’s honoree: “In an era of rapid and ephemeral visual stimuli, Kaouther Ben Hania’s cinema provides a vital space for resistance and militancy,” they said. “Her evolution from the intimate, familial narrative of ‘Four Daughters’ to the urgent historical testimony of ‘The Voice of Hind Rajab’ demonstrates a rare mastery. We are honored to celebrate a director who does more than observe reality; she interrogates it with a courage that is as aesthetically bold as it is deeply ethical.”\n\t\n\n\tPrevious recipients of the Celebration of Lives Award award include Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola, Radu Jude, Olivier Assayas, and Francis Ford Coppola.\n\n\tThe 22nd edition of the Biografilm Festival will run in Bologna June 5-15\n",

    "body": "\n\tSenior heads across the U.K.’s news landscape have come together to form a coalition in the face of AI’s growing influence. \n\n\tIn an open letter, BBC director-general Tim Davie, Financial Times CEO Jon Slade, The Guardian CEO Anna Bateson, Sky News executive chairman David Rhodes, and Telegraph Media Group CEO Anna Jones have invited “global leaders across publishing, broadcasting, media and news” — to join as founding members of SPUR (the Standards for Publisher Usage Rights coalition). \n\t\n\n\tIn the letter, the five execs said that AI was “fundamentally reshaping how content is created, distributed, discovered and monetised” and asserted that “we need to come together to protect original journalism and secure the long-term sustainability of our industry.”\n\n\n\tWhile AI brought opportunity for publishers and audiences, it also raises “urgent questions about fairness, consent, attribution, transparency and trust,” they said. \n\n\t“Across the industry, our reporting, our archives, our original content, have become foundational training material for AI systems. This material has been scraped, copied and reused with no common standards to enable permission or payment, weakening the economic model that supports journalism. The lack of transparency about how AI answers are created risks eroding public trust in both the news and the technologies used to access it.”\n\n\tThe reported mission of SPUR is to “establish shared technical standards and responsible licensing frameworks that ensure AI developers can access high quality, reliable journalism in legitimate, responsible and convenient ways, while guaranteeing that publishers retain practical control of their content and receive fair value when it is used.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the letter, it will aim to develop shared industry standards, reduce friction in licensing and “bridge the gap” between publishers and AI developers, while also identifying “gaps in the technical tools needed to protect intellectual property.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile at the center of a tug-of-war between Paramount Skydance and Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery reported its fourth-quarter 2025 earnings results Thursday. \n\n\tAccording to the David Zaslav-led company, WBD narrowed its losses to $252 million during the October-December quarter and saw streaming subscribers reach nearly 132 million amid an increased international rollout for HBO Max.\n\n\n\t“With the successful recent launches of HBO Max in Germany and Italy, as well as the upcoming launches in the United Kingdom and Ireland on March 26th, we expect to finish the first quarter of 2026 with more than 140 million subscribers, well on our way to more than 150 million subscribers by year end,” Warner Bros. Discovery said in a letter to shareholders accompanying the financials.\n\t\n\n\tIn these materials, Warner Bros. Discovery stated CEO Zaslav and other WBD brass “will not be answering any questions” during the earnings call with analysts Thursday regarding WBD’s pending acquisition battle between intended buyer Netflix, which already has a merger agreement in place to buy WBD’s studio and streaming assets, and eager suitor Paramount, which just upped its bid for the whole company, including the linear networks.\n\n\t“While the Netflix Merger Agreement remains in effect and the Board continues to recommend the Netflix transaction and has not withdrawn or modified its recommendation, the Board recently determined that the latest proposal from Paramount Skydance could reasonably be expected to lead to a ‘company superior proposal’ as defined in the Netflix Merger Agreement,” the company wrote. “WBD continues to engage with PSKY to determine if a proposal that constitutes such a ‘company superior proposal’ can be reached. There can be no assurance that the Board will conclude that the transaction proposed by PSKY is superior to the merger with Netflix or that any definitive agreement or transaction will result from Warner Bros. Discovery’s discussions with PSKY. The Board remains committed to maximizing shareholder value and certainty while mitigating downside risks, and the Board will evaluate any proposal against that standard with the objective of delivering the best deal for our shareholders.”\n\t\n\n\tStreaming revenue was up 5% year-over-year to reach $2.8 billion. Sales for the studio segment were down 13% at $3.2 billion. WBD’s global TV channels division saw a 12% drop to $4.2 billion.\n\n\tWithin the streaming business, distribution sales were up 3% ($2.4 billion) and ad sales jumped 18% to $278 million. \n\n\tStreaming subscribers reached 131.6 million, an increase of 3.6 million customers vs. the July-September 2025 period. Domestic subscribers were up 1.2 million and international subscribers rose 2.4 million. Overall, streaming subscriptions were up 14.7 million vs. Q4 2024.\n\n\tTurning to WBD’s studios segment, box office was down 11%, TV revenue was down 18% and gaming sales dropped a whopping 34%.\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery’s global linear networks saw an 8% decrease in distribution revenue and 14% drop in ad sales. WBD attributes that advertising revenue decrease primarily to U.S. audience decline of 22% and the loss of its NBA rights.\n\n\tWall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 0 cents on $9.37 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG. WBD reported a diluted loss per share of 10 cents, or a net loss of $252 million, on $9.5 billion in revenue.\n\n\tFree cashflow stood at $1.4 billion. The company’s debt currently stands at $33.5 billion.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe governing body of the Berlin Film Festival has failed to reach a decision on whether to continue the contract of its festival director, Tricia Tuttle.\n\n\tThe non-decision came at an extraordinary meeting, called by Germany’s culture minister Wolfram Weimer, of the Berlin Film Festival’s governing body, KBB GmbH, on Thursday morning to discuss the “future direction” of the Berlinale. It is believed the meeting was convened in response to criticism of political statements made at the festival.\n\t\n\n\t“This morning, a supervisory board meeting of KBB GmbH took place in the Chancellery. The topic was the Berlinale,” said a spokesman for Weimer. “Talks on the Berlinale will continue in the coming days between the director, Tricia Tuttle, and the supervisory board.”\n\n\n\tAfter a story in German tabloid Bild on Wednesday suggested that Tuttle was about to be sacked, film business insiders and Berlinale staffer rallied to her defense. A petition supporting her, signed by film professionals – including luminaries such as Sean Baker, Todd Haynes, Tilda Swinton and Kleber Mendonça Filho – rapidly gathered around 700 names (it has now exceeded 1,000).\n\n\tThen, on Thursday morning, more than 500 staffers at the festival wrote an open letter to voice their support for Tuttle. \n\n\tThe letter stated: “We do not exaggerate when we say, as one, that it is unlikely the KBB Supervisory Board could have appointed a more intelligent, ethical and responsive leader for the Berlinale, nor one more dedicated to the core principles that make this festival a vital platform for cinema in Germany and internationally.\n\t\n\n\t“We hope this message will go some way to communicating the extent of the admiration and loyalty Tricia has inspired in all who are invested in the future of the Berlinale, and the future of cinema.”\n\n\tDuring its 76th edition, running Feb. 12-22, the festival was at first accused of censoring political talk when prominent attendees, including jury president Wim Wenders, declined to discuss politics. But the controversy blew up when on closing night, several prize-winners used their acceptance speeches to voice support for Palestine and Gaza.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscar-winning director Bille August, who recently scored a global hit with TV series “The Count of Monte Cristo,” is set for another high-end period show that this time will hark back to Ancient Rome and delve into the timely figure of Julius Caesar.\n\n\tUnderlining the project’s “contemporary” relevance, August, in an exclusive statement for Variety, pointed out that “The Republic of Rome was the first democracy to be undermined by a government that elected a dictator, granting him absolute powers.” \n\t\n\n\tThe series, working-titled “Julius Caesar,” will explore “the story of a great leader intoxicated by power,” the Danish director added, “uncovering the deep psychological complexities ultimately leading from the most epic feats to his downfall.”\n\n\n\tAugust, who won an Oscar for “Pelle the Conqueror,” and is also a double Palme d’Or winner for “Pelle” and “Smilla’s Sense Of Snow,” has reunited with screenwriter Greg Latter – whom he worked with on “Goodbye Bafana,” “Night Train to Lisbon” and upcoming film “Me, You” – on the “Julius Caesar” project. It’s being produced by Italy’s Mediawan-owned Palomar, the company that also lead-produced “Monte Cristo.”\n\n\tFilming, which will take place in Italy, is scheduled for early 2027. There are no casting details as yet.\n\n\t“In today’s world, shaken by the spectre of war, it seems to us that taking on the challenge of portraying an extraordinary character such as Julius Caesar – unique orator, infallible strategist, far-sighted politician and great commander — is more relevant than ever,” said Palomar founder and CEO Carlo Degli Esposti, who is also a member of the Mediawan board.\n\t\n\n\t“It has never been as crucial as today to highlight the story of such a contradictory man,” Degli Esposti continued. He called Julius Caesar ambitious and generous “but also cruel; a mixture of greatness and corruption exercised by power. By the desire to conquer power and maintain it, even at the cost of his life.”\n\n\tPrevious TV series that delved into the tale of Julius Caesar include 2005-2007 Emmy-winning HBO/BBC series “Rome” that chronicled the fall of the Roman Republic and Caesar’s rise to power; TNT’s pulpy 2002 miniseries “Caesar,” starring Jeremy Sisto in the title role; and 2023 BBC docudrama “Julius Caesar: The Making of a Dictator.”\n\n\tAugust’s lushly lensed adaptation of Alexandre Dumas’ “The Count of Monte Cristo,” toplining Sam Claflin (“Peaky Blinders”) and Ana Girardot (“The Returned”), scored record-breaking ratings on Italian state broadcaster RAI and was sold widely by Mediawan around the world.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrench director Alain Gomis‘ “DAO,” a sprawling family epic which world premiered in competition at the Berlin Film Festival, has been acquired by Janus Films for North American distribution. \n\n\tRepresented internationally by The Party Film Sales, the film marked Gomis’ return to the Berlinale nine years after winning the Silver Bear for “Félicité.” Gomis’ sixth feature, “DAO” emerged as one of the best reviewed films of the festival.\n\t\n\n\tVariety‘s Guy Lodge described the film as Gomis’ “most vibrantly expansive and accessible” film.\n\n\n\t“DAO” unfolds between a wedding in France and a commemorative ceremony in Guinea-Bissau. Gomis, who has Bissau-Guinean and Senegalese origins, wrote and directed the film which stars a mix of actors and newcomers, leading with Katy Correa and D’Johé Kouadio as a mother-and-daughter duo. \n\n\tAlthough “DAO” is more intimate than political, Gomis subtly addresses timely themes, such as the impact of colonization, displacement and inherited trauma.\n\n\t“Each family carries its secrets. Here, there’s something about people who were formed through an absence, whose image of themselves needs repairing,” he said in an interview with Variety. Referring to the generational gap between those who stayed in Africa, and those who emigrated, he explains that “some things weren’t explored, weren’t spoken. You grow up with the feeling that something is missing.”\n\n\tThe Party Film Sales has also closed major international deals on the film to Flamingo in Spain, Films That Matter in Germany, as well as Fivia and MCF MegaComFilm in ex-Yugoslavia.\n\t\n\n\tIn France, the film will be released theatrically on April 29 by Jour2fête, the sister company to The Party Film Sales. “DAO” was produced by Les Films du Worso and Srab Films (“Les Miserables”). \n",

    "body": "\n\tJoko Anwar’s horror-comedy “Ghost in the Cell” has secured distribution across multiple territories following its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival, with Barunson E&A unveiling sales from the European Film Market.\n\n\tWell Go USA has acquired North American rights to the Indonesia-South Korea co-production, which follows inmates in a violent Indonesian prison who must unite for survival when a supernatural entity begins targeting those with the darkest auras. Additional confirmed distributors include The World Pictures for Russia and CIS, La Aventura for Spain and Spanish-speaking territories, Calendar Studios for Taiwan, Shinesaeng Ad. Venture for Thailand theatrical rights, Purple Plan Pte for Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam theatrical rights, Filmbridge for Mongolia, and the previously announced Plaion Pictures for Germany and German-speaking territories. Negotiations are ongoing on several additional territories, including Benelux.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to bring ‘Ghost in the Cell’ to North America,” said Doris Pfardrescher, president and CEO of Well Go USA. “As longtime fans of Joko Anwar, having previously released his film ‘Gundala,’ we’ve seen firsthand how strongly his work resonates with audiences here. ‘Ghost in the Cell’ is an absolute blast – it’s wildly entertaining and deliciously gory in all the right ways.”\n\n\n\tPurple Plan Pte added: “We acquired ‘Ghost in the Cell’ because it’s bold, unapologetic, and wildly entertaining. Its gory, high-impact action and horror elements create a thrilling experience. Under the direction of prolific storyteller Joko Anwar, the film has a distinctive voice that sets it apart from others in the genre. We’re excited to bring it to Singapore, Vietnam and Cambodia giving audiences a brand-new horror experience.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film, which premiered in the Berlinale Forum, addresses Indonesia’s deforestation crisis through its supernatural premise. “The environmental and political realities have always been the origin of horror, not only as a sideshow,” Anwar told Variety in an interview. “I let the ghost carry the truth that the system made by humans refuses to articulate.”\n\n\tThe production represents a collaboration between Anwar and producer Tia Hasibuan through their Jakarta-based Come and See Pictures, alongside Rapi Films, Barunson E&A and Legacy Pictures. The ensemble cast features Abimana Aryasatya, Lukman Sardi, Bront Palarae, Aming, Rio Dewanto, Morgan Oey and Tora Sudiro.\n\n\tThe film is scheduled for Indonesian theatrical release in the second quarter of 2026.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tCatherine Deneuve has co-authored a book dedicated to the late icon, “Marilyn chérie,” which will come out in May to mark the centenary of her birth.\n\n\tIn the book, which she wrote with collector Sébastien Cauchon, Deneuve delivers a personal look at photographs of Monroe, including set photos, costume fittings, portraits by leading photographers, press images and amateur shots. The curated stills, many of which have never been published before, come from Cauchon’s private collection, among others.\n\t\n\n\tDeneuve, herself a cinema icon, is a longtime Monroe devotee and has been influenced by her work. She previously participated in the documentary, “Marilyn, dite Norma Jean,” which aired on television in 1987. Deneuve also starred with Monroe’s partner in “Some Like It Hot,” Jack Lemmon, in his first American film, “The April Fools,” in 1968; and with Yves Montand — who had starred opposite Monroe in “Let’s Make Love” — in Jean-Paul Rappeneau’s “Le Sauvage” in 1975.\n\n\n\t“So beautiful, so open, almost unknown. So generous with her body, her face tilted back, something childlike too — which never makes her seem indecent. The actress whose films I have seen all, never known, the most precious to me,” Deneuve writes in “Marilyn chérie.”\n\n\tThe 224-page book is set to be published by Flammarion, which holds the worldwide publishing rights. Deneuve and Cauchon retain the adaptation rights.\n\n\tCauchon, who currently works as an awards strategist, previously wrote the book “Marilyn 1962,” which was published by Stock in 2016 and was optioned for a miniseries project. His Marilyn Monroe photo archive collection was presented at an exhibition hosted by Cannes Film Festival chief Thierry Frémaux during the 2022 edition of the Lumière Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Royal Shakespeare Company has unveiled its 2026-27 season, headlined by Tony Award-winning Broadway star Jonathan Groff making his RSC debut as Rosalind in an all-male staging of Shakespeare’s “As You Like It,” directed by RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans.\n\n\tGroff, who can currently be seen starring in “Just in Time” at New York’s Circle in the Square Theatre, previously originated the roles of Melchior Gabor in “Spring Awakening” and Kristoff in Disney’s “Frozen” franchise, and claimed his Tony for his portrayal of Franklin Shepherd in the recent “Merrily We Roll Along” revival. He will be joined by Fisayo Akinade as Celia. Akinade earned screen recognition through Russell T. Davies’ Channel 4 series “Cucumber” and “Banana,” and appeared as Mr. Ajayi in the 2022 Netflix series “Heartstopper.” The production runs Sept. 26 through Nov. 7 in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.\n\t\n\n\tHarriet Walter will return to the company to reprise her role as Brutus in a revival of Phyllida Lloyd’s 2012 Donmar Warehouse production of “Julius Caesar,” originally staged under artistic director Josie Rourke and executive director Kate Pakenham. The all-female production is set in a women’s prison. The revival, co-produced with KPPL Productions, will tour to secondary schools across England from Sept. 21 through Oct. 23 before a run at The Other Place from Nov. 5-28.\n\n\n\tThe school tour anchors the RSC’s celebration of two decades of educational partnership work. The company’s Associate Schools Program now reaches more than 280 schools across 100 towns and cities in England. Each performance will be supported by workshops and post-show discussions, with the touring program culminating in a Young Creatives Festival at The Other Place on Nov. 21.\n\t\n\n\tThe Swan Theatre will stage a two-part dramatization of George Eliot’s “Middlemarch,” with Nina Raine writing the adaptation and Jeremy Herrin directing, in a co-production with Second Half Productions. Part 1 opens Oct. 1, Part 2 follows Oct. 10, with both running through Jan. 16.\n\n\tRounding out the season, theater company Told by an Idiot brings Alexandre Dumas’ “The Three Musketeers” to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in a new adaptation written and directed by company co-founder and artistic director Paul Hunter. The production runs Nov. 28 through Jan. 9.\n\n\tThe previously announced world premiere of “Game of Thrones: The Mad King,” written by Duncan Macmillan and directed by Dominic Cooke, arrives at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in summer 2026, in a co-production involving Simon Painter, Tim Lawson, Mark Manuel, Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures on behalf of HBO, and Sir Leonard Blavatnik and Danny Cohen for Access Entertainment. \n\n\tRSC co-artistic directors Daniel Evans and Tamara Harvey described the season as one where themes of “identity, transformation, freedom, justice and the liberation that comes from breaking free of expectations loom large this autumn, as classic stories and universal struggles take on powerful new resonance in the hands of some of the most exciting artists of today.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJoshua (Josh) Berger has joined the board of Two Daughters Entertainment as non-executive director and strategic advisor. \n\n\tThe appointment brings one of the U.K. entertainment industry’s most experienced executives to a company expanding beyond its TV roots into features and global IP.\n\n\tThe immediate catalyst is the company’s debut theatrical release, “The Land of Sometimes,” due in cinemas worldwide this spring. Beyond that, Two Daughters is moving toward greenlighting a second feature while developing a broader slate of original animated properties – a significant step up in ambition for a company founded by James Reatchlous in 2016.\n\t\n\n\tTwo Daughters built its reputation on “Moley,” an animated property that started life as a half-hour special and has since reached audiences in 180 countries across 30 languages, with distribution partnerships including Peacock in the U.S. and Youku/iQiyi in China.\n\n\n\t“The Land of Sometimes” assembles a notable cast and creative team. Ewan McGregor, Mel Brooks and Helena Bonham Carter head the voice cast, while Tim Rice, who won an Academy Award for his work on “The Lion King,” contributed original music and lyrics. Leon Joosen, whose credits include “Saving Santa,” directs. Among the executive producers are Bonnie Arnold, a veteran of the “Toy Story” and “How to Train Your Dragon” franchises, and the late Alan Yentob, the BBC figure behind “Billy Elliot,” alongside Reatchlous and CEO Simon Bobin.\n\n\tBerger spent 31 years at Warner Bros. Entertainment, rising to president and managing director of its U.K., Ireland and Spain operations before taking charge of “Harry Potter” global franchise development – a role that put him at the center of one of the entertainment industry’s most lucrative IP empires. He was also instrumental in the studio’s acquisition of Leavesden Studios and the development of Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter.\n\t\n\n\tBerger was appointed CBE in the Queen’s 2012 Birthday Honors for services to the U.K.’s creative industries. Beyond Warner Bros., he has been a prominent figure in British cultural life, serving as former chair and board member of the British Film Institute, as well as former board member of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Currently, he is founder and chair of Battersea Entertainment and chair of trustees at The BRIT School. His producing credits include Guy Ritchie’s “The Covenant,” the Broadway musical “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of The Temptations” and executive producer credit on “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore.”\n\n\t“Two Daughters Entertainment is entering an exciting new chapter. With its first feature about to be released, a strong slate coming behind it, and a clear ambition to build enduring global IP, this is a company with momentum, creative integrity and real heart. ‘Moley’ is already a distinctive international brand, and James and Simon have assembled an impressive team and vision. I’m delighted to be joining the board at such a significant moment and to support the company’s continued growth,” said Berger.\n\n\tReatchlous said: “Josh joining the board at this moment is incredibly meaningful for us. As we complete our first feature, prepare to greenlight our next, and continue to develop an exciting slate of original properties, his experience growing world-class IP and navigating global franchises is invaluable. We are thrilled to welcome him to Two Daughters.”\n\n\tAdded Simon Bobin, CEO of Two Daughters Entertainment: “Josh is one of the most respected leaders in the global entertainment industry. His insight into building premium franchises, scaling businesses internationally and supporting creative ambition comes at exactly the right time for Two Daughters. As we expand our film slate and IP portfolio, his guidance will be a huge asset to the company.”\n",

Carmen starred in the first installment of the film franchise in 2000, which contained at least one or two jokes that wouldn't pass today. But Carmen says the Wayans brothers are skilled enough to make a comedy for any time.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          She told us, \"I haven't seen the script, so I'm not exactly sure what the new 'Scary Movie' is exactly going to be about. But I think for the most part, it's so lighthearted and as long as it's in the right context, I think it'll be okay.\"\n      \n\n          She continued ... \"The Wayans are not careful, but they're geniuses at what they do, so it'll definitely be some fun.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Keenan Ivory, Marlon and Shawn Wayans returned to write the script for the movie, expected this June.

Witnesses tell us they were \"hugged up\" and \"really touchy-feely\" throughout the game ... making it crystal clear this wasn't just a friendly outing.\n      \n\n          Horne III runs his own law firm in Memphis, practicing criminal defense and personal injury law.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Of course, NeNe's love life has been closely followed over the years. She was married to Gregg Leakes from 1997 to 2011 before they remarried in 2013. They remained together until Gregg’s death from colon cancer in September 2021.\n      \n    \n          Following Gregg's passing, NeNe began dating fashion entrepreneur Nyonisela Sioh later that year. Their relationship made headlines amid legal drama involving his estranged wife, and by 2023 NeNe confirmed they were taking a break though reconciliation rumors later swirled.\n      \n    \n          We broke the story ... NeNe is set to appear on Bravo's \"The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: Roaring 20th.\" While she won’t be full-time, we're told she’ll have a notable presence.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to NeNe and Horne for comment … so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                NeNe Leakes\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

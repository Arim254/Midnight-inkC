    "body": "\n\tPaul Daniel “Ace” Frehley, co-founder and lead guitarist of the legendary rock band Kiss and a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, has died following injuries suffered during a fall last month, according to a statement from his family. He was 74.\n\n\tFrehley’s family wrote in the statement: “We are completely devastated and heartbroken. In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth. We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace’s memory will continue to live on forever!”\n\t\n\n\tHis longtime bandmates, Kiss‘ Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, wrote in a statement: “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley. He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of Kiss’ legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.” \n\n\n\tWhile Kiss, who performed in theatrical makeup and costumes, received little respect from music critics and the rock intelligentsia, their impact and influence on a generation of musicians and fans has been immense and enduring. The band’s songs were in many ways a gateway for their concerts and larger-than-life mystique: In an era that preceded MTV, their performances were almost overwhelmingly visual and experiential, with explosions, fire-breathing, smoke-spewing guitars and fireworks. Yet the mystique of Kiss was key: the bandmembers’ faces were not revealed for more than a decade, by which point Frehley and drummer Peter Criss had left the band. Frehley was known as “Space Ace” and cultivated an otherworldly image.\n\t\n\n\tFrehley joined cofounders Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons and Peter Criss late in 1972 and remained with the band for their most significant eras: He left in 1982 for a solo career, but rejoined when the original band reunited in 1996 for a highly lucrative reunion tour and remained until 2002. He worked a solo artist during the intervening years, with his band Frehley’s Comet and under his own name; in 1978, when all four members of Kiss released solo albums simultaneously, many fans felt that Frehley’s, which featured his hit cover of the song “New York Groove,” was the best.\n\n\tPaul Daniel Frehley was born to a musical family in the Bronx borough of New York City and received an electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. He never took lessons, and never looked back: With Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and the Who as his stated primary influences, he began playing in bands as a teenager and purportedly acquired his nickname from friends based on his ability to score dates with girls.\n\n\tHe dropped out of high school after one of his bands, Cathedral, began earning money, but later returned and got his diploma. He continued playing and by 1971, one of his bands, Molimo, signed with RCA Records and recorded several unreleased songs for the label. \n\n\tBut late the following year, a friend spotted an advertisement in the Village Voice that turned out to be for the lead guitar slot in the embryonic Kiss. Famously, Frehley went to the audition in Manhattan wearing one red sneaker and one orange one. Stanley, Simmons and Criss were dismayed by his appearance but sufficiently impressed with his fiery lead guitar work, and he was invited to join a few weeks later. The band, which was preceded by Stanley and Simmons’ previous group Wicked Lester, dubbed themselves Kiss in January 1973 and soon, inspired by the New York Dolls and Alice Cooper, began painting their faces and donning outrageous costumes for their concerts.\n\n\tKiss weathered cynicism and disinterest from the snobby New York music scene in their early months — Frehley worked as a taxi driver to pay the bills — but, crucially, united with manager Bill Aucoin in September 1973, who began plotting the band’s path to stardom with the bandmembers.\n\t\n\n\tThe band released its self-titled debut album in February of the following year, which featured some future favorites like “Firehouse,” “Black Diamond” and Frehley’s composition “Cold Gin,” but that album and the follow-ups “Hotter Than Hell” and “Dressed to Kill,” were only minor successes.\n\n\tHowever, the 1975 live set, “Kiss Alive!,” driven by a supercharged version of the song “Rock and Roll All Night,” combined with memorable television appearances and Aucoin’s business savvy to vault the band to superstardom. Their core audience was teenaged boys, who were delighted by their parents’ mortified reactions to this loud and heavily made-up group of “freaks.” The band’s painted faces soon began appearing on jean jackets across the United States, and their iconic logo — with a pair of lightning-bolt “S”s purloined from David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust era — on untold thousands of high school notebooks.\n\n\tThe band released its self-titled debut album in February of the following year, which featured some future favorites like “Firehouse,” “Black Diamond” and Frehley’s composition “Cold Gin,” that album and the follow-ups “Hotter Than Hell” and “Dressed to Kill,” were only minor successes.\n\n\tHowever, the 1975 live set, “Kiss Alive!,” combined with increasing buzz and memorable television appearances to vault the band to superstardom. Their core audience was teenaged boys, who were delighted by their parents’ mortified reactions to this heavily made-up group of “freaks” with their loud music. The band’s painted faces soon began appearing on jean jackets across the United States, and their iconic logo — with a pair of lightning-bolt “S”s purloined from David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust era — on untold thousands of high school notebooks.\n\n\tThe band united with Alice Cooper/Lou Reed producer Bob Ezrin for the vitally important follow-up studio album, “Destroyer,” which became their biggest release to date. Ezrin’s elaborate production (and strategic use of session musicians) powered such classics as “Detroit Rock City” and “Shout It Out Loud,” and the band followed Cooper’s example by including a sensitive (and image-defying) ballad, “Beth,” which was co-written and sung by Criss. The song quickly became the band’s biggest-ever hit single.\n\t\n\n\t“Destroyer” and the band’s increasingly elaborate concert productions (not to mention its ample and well-marketed merchandise, which grew to include everything from comic books and Halloween costumes to transistor radios and trading cards) quickly made them one of the biggest rock bands in the world.\n\n\tTwo more studio albums followed in rapid succession, “Rock and Roll Over” and “Love Gun,” the latter featuring Frehley’s first lead vocal on “Shock Me” (which was inspired by a near-electrocution during a concert in Florida). Another live album, “Alive II,” was released in the fall of 1977 and included a side of studio recordings, including Frehley’s second lead vocal, “Rocket Ride.”\n\n\tThe band’s anonymity was a big part of its allure. “Onstage I’m Ace Frehley, and offstage I’m a kid from the Bronx,” Frehley told Rolling Stone in 1977. “I consider myself lucky in a way. Mick Jagger will always be Mick Jagger, but I can take off my makeup and know who I am.”\n\n\tHowever, hubris began to set in, not least in the form of the four solo albums the band released simultaneously in September of 1978. Surprisingly — considering Stanley’s role as Kiss’ lead singer and the all-star cast Simmons assembled for his album — Frehley’s was widely considered by fans to be the best of the batch. He played a number of instruments on the album, wrote or co-wrote most of its songs, and was accompanied by some top New York session musicians — including drummer Anton Fig and bassist Will Lee, both of whom would later join the house band for David Letterman’s late-night television show — and production from Hendrix/ Led Zeppelin/ Kiss veteran Eddie Kramer. The album also featured a surprise hit single in his cover of Russ Ballard’s composition “New York Groove.”\n\n\tKiss returned in 1979 with the “Dynasty” album and the disco-influenced hit single “I Was Made for Loving You,” but the backlash had long since begun — and any embrace of disco by a rock band was regarded as sacrilege by most of the band’s fans. Criss and Frehley also had challenges with the band’s musical direction and, not least, substance abuse, which led to both of their departures, in 1980 and 1982, respectively, although Stanley and Simmons continued the band with other musicians.\n\t\n\n\tFrehley’s abuse of drugs and alcohol grew worse, and in May of 1983, he was arrested following a high-speed chase on the Bronx River Parkway in his 1981 DeLorean. He was charged with DUI, reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident after hitting four cars during the incident (luckily with no injuries). He spent two weeks in a hospital detox unit and was required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\n\tHe formed the solo outfit Frehley’s Comet and eventually signed with the heavy metal powerhouse label Megaforce Records, releasing a strong album (co-produced by Kramer) in the summer of 1987. The album included songwriting collaborations with Kiss drummer Eric Carr and “Wild Thing” writer Chip Taylor, as well as a song about his arrest called “Rock Soldiers” that included the lyric, “I cried, ‘I am invincible’ / Said I was high above the law / But my only high was just a lie / And now I’m glad I saw.” Released during the commercial heyday of heavy metal, the album was certified gold and relaunched Frehley’s career, although tours with Iron Maiden and Alice Cooper ended early, reportedly over money issues; also, his sobriety did not last. The band continued for another couple of years before Frehley dropped the name and worked as a solo artist.  \n\n\tIn 1996, he and Criss rejoined Kiss for a major reunion tour, and the group recorded the studio album, “Psycho Circus,” although Frehley contributed just one song and minimal instrumental work. THe reunited Kiss continued touring in the following years, staging what was ultimately its first “Farewell Tour” in 2001 (Stanley and Simmons completed what is apparently the last Kiss farewell tour in December 2023), and Frehley left in 2002.\n\n\tHe continued solo work, touring and guest appearances over the following years, releasing five albums between 2009 and 2024, working with such admirers as Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash, Pearl Jam’s Mike McCready, Cheap Trick’s Robin Zander and even Stanley and Simmons. His most recent album, “10,000 Volts,” was released in 2024.\n\n\tFrehley released an autobiography, “No Regrets – A Rock ‘N’ Roll Memoir,” in 2011, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Kiss in 2014. According to Stanley and Simmons, he was invited to join Kiss for encores during the final tour but declined, although Frehley disputed those accounts.\n\t\n\n\t“I never set my sights low,” he wrote in his autobiography. “I’ve always believed most people are ruined by the limitations they put on themselves.”\n\n\tFrehley is survived by his wife Jeanette, daughter Monique, brother Charles, sister Nancy Salvner, nieces Suncere Frehley and Julie Salvner, nephews Sky Frehley and Andrew Salvner, sister-in-law Michelanne and brother-in-law Ron Salvner.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran National Public Radio journalist Susan Stamberg, who became the first woman in the U.S. to anchor a nightly national news program with “All Things Considered,” died Thursday, according to NPR. She was 87.\n\n\tStamberg, who retired just six weeks ago, had a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was honored by the Broadcasting Hall of Fame and the National Radio Hall of Fame. \n\n\t“Susan’s voice was not only a cornerstone of NPR — it was a cornerstone of American life,” Katherine Maher, NPR’s president and chief executive, said in a statement to the Washington Post. “She showed that journalism could be both rigorous and deeply personal. She inspired countless journalists to believe they could explore life and truth, and lead with both authority and warmth.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn Susan Levitt in Newark, N.J., she graduated Barnard College and started out at WAMU public radio in Washington, D.C.\n\n\tShe joined NPR upon its founding in 1971, starting out as an audio editor who cut audio tape with a razor blade, and in 1972 became co-host of evening news magazine “All Things Considered.” Stamberg hosted “All Things Considered” for 14 years in an era when few women got a chance at the top radio and television spots. \n\n\tHer interviews often focused on the arts or quirky stories, rather than straight politics. She was also known for sharing her mother-in-law’s famous cranberry sauce recipe (it involves horseradish) with her listeners.\n\n\tAfter “All Things Considered,” Stamberg shifted to “Weekend Edition Sunday,” where she helped launch a puzzle segment and invited the brothers who would go on to do “Car Talk” to do a weekly segment on the show. She then became a special correspondent, often focusing on stories about culture and sometimes about Hollywood.\n\t\n\n\tShe is survived by her son Josh Stamberg, an actor, and two granddaughters. Her husband Louis Stamberg died in 2007.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“How do you have sex onstage?” That’s the central question of “Good Sex,” an unconventional play that spotlights intimacy coordinators. Here’s the unorthodox part: The show pairs together two unacquainted actors who have never rehearsed — or read — the material before performing live for the first time. \n\n\t“Good Sex” features a new couple each night of the four-performance engagement, which runs from Nov. 5 through Nov. 8 at Brooklyn’s Powerhouse Arts. John Cameron Mitchell (“Hedwig and the Angry Inch”) and Elliot Page (“Juno,” “The Umbrella Academy”) are the first announced pair for the limited run on Nov. 6; Morgan Spector (“The Gilded Age”) and Constance Wu (“Crazy Rich Asians”) on Nov. 7; and Brandon Flynn (“13 Reasons Why”) and Chris Perfetti (“Abbott Elementary”) on Nov. 8.  A yet-to-be announced pairing will lead the Nov. 5 performance.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast of rotating actors won’t be flying totally blind on stage, however. They will be joined by an intimacy coordinator: a growing role in Hollywood that’s designed to ensure the safety and comfort of actors during sex scenes. In attempting to answer that aforementioned question — about how to have sex on stage — “each night, two brand new performers tell a story of desire, betrayal and loneliness. They are strangers. But they are not alone — to help and guide them, they are joined on stage by an intimacy director, trained in the art of teaching people how to touch. So, you can rest assured that the sex will be safe. It will be consensual. And it will be good,” according to the official press release.\n\t\n\n\t“Good Sex” hails from Irish theater company Dead Centre through a collaboration with novelist and essayist Emilie Pine. Born out of the COVID pandemic, when touching was a “transgressive act and our bodies were sites of sickness,” as a press release explains, “Good Sex” is described as a “love story for a loveless age.” It premiered in 2022 as part of Dublin Theatre Festival and was funded by the Arts Council of Ireland. \n\n\t“Good Sex” is programmed as part of Powerhouse: International, a new arts festival produced by producer and Brooklyn Academy of Music’s former artistic director David Binder.\n\n\t“Powerhouse: International aims to bring international and local artists into dialogue. The collaboration of Ireland’s Dead Centre Theatre company with some of New York’s greatest actors is sure to make for a for a remarkable, unpredictable and thrilling night of theater,” Binder said. “I am thrilled to welcome all of these artists to Brooklyn.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKevin Costner lost his bid on Thursday to throw out a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment for setting up an unscripted rape scene during filming of “Horizon 2.”\n\n\tDevyn LaBella sued Costner and the production in May, alleging she was forced to perform in the scene without advance warning and without an intimacy coordinator present, in violation of SAG-AFTRA rules.\n\n\tCostner’s lawyer, Marty Singer, sought to throw out the suit under California’s anti-SLAPP law, which is designed to protect free speech from frivolous litigation. Judge Jon Takasugi denied the motion, finding that the facts alleged in the lawsuit are sufficient to proceed.\n\t\n\n\tKate McFarlane, one of LaBella’s attorneys, applauded the judge’s decision.\n\n\t“The creative process cannot and does not give men in power complete impunity to abuse women like Ms. LaBella,” McFarlane said in a statement. “We were confident we would prevail against Defendants on this frivolous motion, and we did. We anticipate Defendants will continue to employ similar tactics in an attempt to prevent their despicable conduct from ever reaching the eyes and ears of a jury. We won’t back down.”\n\n\tLaBella was working as a stunt double for Ella Hunt, who played the role of Juliette in the “Horizon” films. According to her lawsuit, during filming in May 2023, LaBella was asked to stand in for Hunt after Hunt refused to participate in the scene. She alleges that an actor was directed to pin her down, straddle her and violently rake up her skirt.\n\n\tLaBella alleges that she was traumatized and humiliated by the experience. The film’s intimacy coordinator later wrote up a report documenting violations of union protocols.\n\t\n\n\tIn response, Costner has argued that the allegations are “patently false” and were designed to damage and embarrass him in order to garner a “massive and unjustified payday.”\n\n\tCostner’s attorney submitted statements from several actors and crew members who said the scene was not a “simulated rape,” and that LaBella did not appear to object at the time.\n\n\tTo prevail on an anti-SLAPP motion, the defendant must show that they were engaged in First Amendment-protected expression on a matter of public concern. Costner’s lawyers argued that the “Horizon” films deal with “the horrific struggles endured by women” in the American West, “including their extreme vulnerability to rape and other forms of violence.”\n\n\tTakasugi was “somewhat skeptical” that the scene was intended to portray that, but acknowledged that the film is an expressive work protected under the First Amendment. However, the anti-SLAPP motion failed on the second prong, which requires the defendant to show that the claim lacks minimal merit. \n\n\tThe judge found that LaBella’s claims, taken as true, are not frivolous, and thus the motion was denied. The judge did throw out one of the 10 causes of action, an alleged violation of the Bane Act, which is intended to combat hate crimes. The judge found that there was no allegation of a threat of physical violence, which would be required to establish that claim.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNoah Schnapp joined his “Stranger Things” co-stars on the cover of Time magazine and recalled journalists prying for information about his sexuality during press junkets when he was just a young teenager. Schnapp publicly came out as gay in January 2023 at 18 years old. Public scrutiny around his sexuality had persisted for years, especially as “Stranger Things” worked towards his character, Will Byers, coming out as gay on the show.\n\n\t“When I was younger, I was obviously very scared of talking about it,” Schapp told the publication. “They would pry and ask me, ‘Is he gay? Are you gay?’ I was 12, 13. I didn’t know what to say.” \n\t\n\n\tSchnapp confirmed in a July 2022 interview with Variety that Will Byers was gay. “Stranger Things 4” was dominating the Netflix charts at the time, and the series had put Will’s sexuality front and center. When the actor publicly came out in a social media post months later, he wrote: “I guess I’m more similar to Will than I thought.”\n\n\t“Once I did fully embrace that Will was gay, it was just an exponential speed towards accepting it for myself,” Schnapp later told Variety in a cover story. “I would be in a completely different place if I didn’t have Will to portray, and to embrace and help me accept myself. I think if I never played that character, I probably would still be closeted.”\n\n\tSchnapp remembered how his original comments about Will being gay “blew up in the press,” and the reaction was overwhelmingly positive — much to his surprise. He added: “Everyone was like, ‘Oh, Will’s gay! Hooray!’ I saw all these comments on Instagram and TikTok. There was not one bad thing about him being gay. I was like, if he has all this support, then why should I worry about anything?”\n\t\n\n\t“Stranger Things 5,” which launches in November on Netflix, is the first season of the show to launch with Schnapp as an openly gay actor. Ahead of filming the final episodes, the actor admitted that “I think the way I act in Season 5, honestly, might be a little different. I will be fully aware of who I am. Knowing all of that about myself and being able to invest that in my character, I’m honestly just excited.”\n\n\t“Stranger Things 5” kicks off with Vol. 1 on Nov. 26.\n",

She said when she came to, the baby was gone.\n      \n    \n          Investigators found inconsistencies in Rebecca's story ... prompting a K9 search of the Haro family home and the seizure of Jake's car for evidence.\n      \n    \n          Then in August, authorities arrested Jake and Rebecca for murder -- and, Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin alleged Emmanuel was a victim of extended abuse and likely succumbed to his injuries.\n      \n    \n          Jake was seen shackled, accompanying law enforcement officers in August during a search for the baby in a field in Moreno Valley, in Riverside County, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Rebecca has a felony settlement conference scheduled for October 28, NBC Palm Springs reports. Jake's sentencing is set for November 3, the same day Rebecca will have a preliminary hearing, according to the Riverside County D.A.'s Office.\n      \n      ",

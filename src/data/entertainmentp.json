    "body": "\n\tBel Bechara and Sandro Serpa’s Brazilian drama “Low Light” (“Lusco-Fusco”), a Rafaella Costa production at Manjericão Filmes, emerged as one of the standout titles at Ventana Sur’s Copia Final sidebar, scooping the Cine+ OCS Award, the Estúdio Silver Award and the Send Files Award.\n\n\tThe prizes have given fresh momentum to a project that tackles domestic abuse and structural violence against women through a story of intergenerational solidarity.\n\t\n\n\tSet largely around a public elementary school, the film follows Vera, a young teacher trapped in an abusive relationship; Alda, the school’s cleaner who has grown old without learning to read or write; and Joana, Alda’s eight-year-old granddaughter and Vera’s pupil, who becomes the link between the two women. \n\n\n\tAs Vera and Alda find refuge in their friendship – a small, fiercely defended space where they can share pain, desire and fragile plans for the future – Joana absorbs, almost in real time, what it means to be a woman in Brazil in the mid-2020s.\n\n\tConceived during the pandemic, when femicides and assaults against women surged, “Low Light” springs from what its filmmakers describe as the need to show that confronting gender violence is not an individual crusade but a collective process. \n\n\tAlso penned by Bechara and Serpa, the script is built around three generations – child, young adult and older woman – and insists on finding hope in the everyday gestures of protection and alliance among women rather than in a single cathartic act.\n\n\tLongtime collaborators, the duo has built a distinctive body of work across seven 35mm shorts and three feature-length documentaries: “Música Serve pra Isso” (2013), “Histórias de Marabaixo” (2016) and “Hoje é o Primeiro Dia do Resto da Sua Vida” (2024). They also directed the 2018 fiction feature “Onde Quer Que Você Esteja” and continue to straddle fiction and non-fiction.\n\t\n\n\tOn the production side, Rafaella Costa’s Manjericão Filmes anchors the project. Founded in 2007, the São Paulo-based company has carved out a profile as a go-to partner for politically engaged, women-driven work with international reach. \n\n\tManjericão produced Lillah Halla’s “Power Alley” (“Levante”), which premiered at Cannes’ Critics Week in 2023, sold well, and won the Fipresci prize for best first feature across the parallel sections, and Caru Alves de Souza’s “My Name Is Baghdad,” Crystal Bear winner for best film at Berlin’s Generation 14plus in 2020.\n\n\tProduced in association with Macondo Filmes, “Low Light” won financing support via Brazil’s Paulo Gustavo Law. Before Ventana Sur, it already made noise in work-in-progress showcases such as Brasil Cinemundi and CineLatino’s Cinéma en Construction at the Audiovisual Hub. \n\n\tVariety spoke with Bechara, Serpa and Costa about the film’s origins, its visual language and their ambitions for its international career.\n\n\tWhat was the initial spark for “Low Light,” and when did you realise the intersecting stories of Vera, Alda and Joana could sustain a feature?\n\n\tBel Bechara and Sandro Serpa: During the pandemic in Brazil, we watched the numbers of femicides, rapes and other forms of violence against women rise sharply. We were living under a far-right government that openly encouraged gun ownership and treated women as inferior, even defending lower salaries for women because they could get pregnant. That misogynistic environment, combined with lockdown and people stuck together in very small spaces, created an explosion of domestic violence.\n\n\tFrom there, we sketched the first outline of “Lusco-Fusco,” understanding that confronting structural violence against women wouldn’t be an individual journey but a collective one – women helping and learning from other women. That’s why we built the film around three generations: an eight-year-old girl, a 28-year-old woman and a 54-year-old woman. \n\n\tJoana learns from her grandmother and her teacher what it means to be a woman in Brazil in 2025 and, at the same time, she is the one who brings hope, the one who leads the other two not to give up in their darkest moment.\n\n\tWe wanted to make a film about a very harsh subject without losing hope, believing in the power of friendship and protection among women.\n\t\n\n\tHow did you approach depicting domestic abuse and illiteracy while preserving Vera and Alda’s agency and dignity on screen?\n\n\tAlda and Vera face different forms of abuse and violence. Alda had to abandon herself and her education to fit the role expected of women: to care – for men, for the family. Today she works as a cleaner at the school and is also responsible for caring for Joana, her granddaughter, while the father, who lives with them, takes no responsibility at all.\n\n\tVera is trapped in an abusive relationship that follows the familiar “cycle of violence”: the man assaults her, disappears, returns remorseful and kind for a while, and then everything starts again. When this cycle isn’t broken, it can end in femicide.\n\n\tFrom the very first draft, we decided there would be no graphic violence on screen. The camera pulls back; we cut to the outside of the house; we focus only on the women in the most tense moments. Illiteracy is presented as a consequence of structural violence: once Alda gets closer to Vera and is encouraged to study, she can shift the power dynamics at home and move forward at work.\n\n\tTo preserve their dignity and agency, we worked through the script and very closely with our actresses. Sandra Corveloni a Palme d’Or best actress winner for Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas’ “Linha de Passe,” portrays an Alda who never pities herself. Amandyra’s Vera understands, when she sees the violence reach her friend, that it is impossible to accept this and she reacts.\n\n\tBut we did not seek personal catharsis or individual redemption, which would empty the discussion. The problem is structural, collective and persistent. They have their individual struggles, but they can still be lynched simply for being women. We point toward hope through sisterhood, mutual support and, ultimately, political organization.\n\n\tHow do you use light, space and texture to turn the title “Low Light” into a visual and emotional concept in the film?\n\n\tThe exact translation of “Lusco-Fusco” would be “Twilight,” but that title is already taken from a very famous vampire film. We chose “Low Light” thinking about this moment between darkness and light – dawn or dusk.\n\n\tWe worked on the characters’ emotional states in parallel with this idea. Vera hides in the dark when she isn’t well, and Alda quickly recognizes that code and steps in to help. In a key scene, Vera is drawn to the light of a concert by punk singer Karina Buhr and pushed to make a decision about her future. In the film’s low point, Alda and Vera are on the verge of giving up, surrendered to darkness, with no strength to react, and little Joana brings light – literally and metaphorically – into the scene.\n\t\n\n\tThere are also contrasts with brighter, more cheerful spaces, like the school during the day, which later appears lifeless and without light in early nighttime scenes. As Vera and Alda grow closer, it gradually regains color and vitality. The male characters always bring oppression and darkness; in the most tense moments of the “cycle of violence,” everything becomes heavier, and later things seem to improve. That dynamic is reflected in the environments and the lighting, following the logic of the cycle.\n\n\tWhat kind of visibility and concrete partnerships are you hoping to secure from the film’s presence at Copia Final at this stage?\n\n\tRafaella Costa: The Copia Final session at Ventana Sur is a key window to propel the film toward the world. We believe that our participation in the showcase, combined with the recognition and the awards we received, now gives the film the strength it needs to find the right partners to boost its international reach and commercial punch and help us reach our audience.\n\n\tOur next step is to secure a beautiful premiere at a major festival and then travel with the film across as many territories as possible, in partnership with a sales agent who will join us in this collaboration.\n\n\tHow does Manjericão Filmes’ track record shape your ambitions for “Low Light” in terms of artistic identity and festival and commercial strategy?\n\n\tCosta: Manjericão Filmes has consolidated its identity by producing works led by women and dedicated to the most urgent issues in their lives in contemporary Brazil: friendship, youth, politics and its violences, abortion, among others.\n\n\t“Low Light” continues the ethical and aesthetic vocation that guides our work. The film, which has already drawn attention in work-in-progress sessions in international markets, combines strong character work and precise writing, elements that point to both a solid premiere and a consistent trajectory on the international festival circuit.\n\n\tAt the same time, it is a film capable of engaging broader audiences, first in movie theaters and later on platforms. We are committed to building this path with the same care and artistic ambition that define Manjericão and its projects.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix’s stunning $83 billion takeover of Warner Bros., announced yesterday, sent French exhibitors into high alert in a market where Warner Bros. — alongside Disney and Universal — drive the local box office. \n\n\tFrance is simultaneously Netflix’s strongest international markets and one of its most combative, shaped by the country’s tough regulatory environment for streamers. The windowing rules – which force Netflix to wait 15 months after movies are theatrically released before being able to roll them out on its platform — have long caused tensions between Netflix and French exhibitors. It’s also the reason why the streamer deserted Cannes after the 2017 edition, when the festival set theatrical requirements that effectively keep Netflix films out of competition. France is in fact the only market in the world where Netflix might not be prevented from launching “Narnia” in IMAX theaters due to local regulations.\n\t\n\n\tThe windowing system, hailed as the backbone of France’s film economy, stands out as the next battleground. Netflix has already appealed to France’s Council of State in a bid to shorten their window to access movies sooner. That bid now carries far greater weight with one of France’s most powerful purveyors of U.S. blockbusters under Netflix’s control. But Richard Patry, president of France’s National Exhibitors Association (FNCF), made clear the guild “will fight back” in an interview with Variety.\n\n\n\tPatry was among the first to sound the alarm on how the takeover of Warner Bros. by Netflix could impact the core of France’s theatrical ecosystem, even if Ted Sarandos said on a conference call with investors and press on Friday that Netflix has no “opposition to movies in theaters,” and “expects” to release Warner Bros. films theatrically. “We’re hopeful that the antitrust boards in the U.S. and in Europe will examine very carefully the potential consequences of this deal,” Patry said, reflecting widespread concern inside a sector already weakened by declining theatrical admissions.\n\t\n\n\tMarc-Olivier Sebbag, the FNCF’s general delegate, stressed that today’s competitive market amplifies the risks. “The landscape today is very different from what it was when Disney and Fox merged; Netflix has a big chunk of the streaming market and Warner Bros. Discovery is already a consolidated giant,” he noted.\n\n\tPatry, who sits on the Cannes Film Festival board, played a significant role in the launch of a rule, in 2017, that demanded that every movie playing in competition gets a theatrical release in France, which effectively pushed Netflix out of the competition. “We waged a battle against Netflix at Cannes so that every movie in competition gets released in cinemas without exception, and we got a lot of pushback on it,” he said. “But we’re seeing now that even Cinema United is sharing our concern over the need to protect theatrical exhibition.”\n\n\tIn France, Warner Bros. holds a special place not only as a source of tentpoles but as the most “European” of the American studios, says Patry. Indeed, it’s the studio which in France was led for many years by now-Cannes president Iris Knobloch. During her tenure at the helm of Warner Bros. France, Knobloch greenlit Michel Hazanavicius’s silent film “The Artist” which world premiered at Cannes and went on to win five Oscars, including best picture, in 2012. \n\n\t“Warner Bros. has always had a well-defined editorial line and they deliver blockbusters that appeal to cinephiles,” Patry said. “They’re the most European of all the biggest U.S. studios.”\n\n\tWhat worries French exhibitors is not just the future of new U.S. tentpoles but also Warner’s library of classics, a crucial resource for heritage screenings and youth education initiatives — areas where France remains uniquely committed, Patry says. “Warner Bros. has been generous in letting French cinemas screen iconic movies from their library to educate youths, and now with Netflix we don’t know if this tradition will be perpetuated,” he continues. \n\n\tAmid the sector-wide alarm, Pathé Cinéma managing director Laure de Boissard sounded more upbeat about the prospects. “I’m optimistic,” she tells Variety, “because a move of this scale shows that Netflix still fundamentally believes in the value of cinema in movie theaters.”\n\t\n\n\t“Netflix’s message with this acquisition is actually quite clear: the theatrical business remains a strategic pillar,” she said. De Boissard also pointed to recent lessons from Disney’s streaming-first phase. “When the launch of Disney+ led them to pause theatrical releases for a while, they quickly realized, with their full 360-degree view, that it simply didn’t make economic sense,” she said. “They understood they had to put theaters back at the center of their strategy — even purely from an economic standpoint.”\n\n\tShe says, “Netflix is a financially disciplined company. They will see the impact of this shift from the front row.” She added that she’s even hopeful that “some films that today go straight to the platform might, along with the Warner titles, benefit from theatrical exposure under this broader economic vision.”\n\n\tHours after news broke of the deal, James Cameron was on the stage of La Scene Musicale in Paris to present the European premiere of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and paid tribute to France’s unique cinema ecosystem. In a speech that felt particularly timely, Cameron said, “We need to honor the nation that has more cinephiles per capita than any other country in the world,” before adding, “The thing that I love about France is that in this country, it is a moral obligation to support the arts.” \n\n\tPatry, who may have been in the audience, will almost certainly deploy Cameron’s speech as fresh ammunition in his next Netflix showdown.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Multiplex Association of India has raised alarm over Netflix’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, warning that the deal could diminish theatrical content availability and threaten India’s cinema ecosystem.\n\n\tIn a statement, the trade body representing multiplex operators nationwide argued that consolidating a major studio under a streaming platform presents competitive and economic risks to India’s theatrical market.\n\n\n\t“The Indian theatrical market thrives on choice, scale, and cultural diversity,” said Kamal Gianchandani, president of the Multiplex Association of India. “Warner Bros. has historically been a key partner to Indian cinemas, contributing consistently to our release calendar with successful global and local titles.”\n\t\n\n\tThe organization emphasized that Indian cinemas serve as cultural centers and economic engines supporting millions of jobs across production, distribution, exhibition, food and beverage services, and related industries.\n\n\tMAI criticized Netflix‘s historical stance on theatrical distribution, noting the streamer’s limited commitment to cinema-first release strategies. The association warned the acquisition could result in reduced theatrical content and compressed or eliminated theatrical windows for major releases.\n\n\t“Netflix has consistently made it clear through its limited and highly restrictive approach to theatrical releases that it does not believe in the cinema-first model,” Gianchandani said. “If this acquisition proceeds, the risk is two-fold: a meaningful reduction in high-quality content for cinemas, and the potential for shortened or non-existent theatrical windows.”\n\t\n\n\tThe association stated such outcomes would impact exhibitor revenues, reduce consumer options, and weaken the broader film industry infrastructure in India. MAI said it plans to raise these concerns with regulatory authorities domestically and internationally.\n\n\tEstablished in 2002 under the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, MAI represents more than 11 cinema chains operating over 550 multiplexes with approximately 3,000 screens across India.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran documentary filmmaker Ondi Timoner and her wife, Morgan Doctor, were working on a film in Budapest when they got a phone call informing them their home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Altadena had burned to the ground in the Eaton Fire. It was Jan. 7, 2025.\n\n\tTimoner, known for docus like “DIG!,” “We Live in Public,” “Last Flight Home” and most recently “All God’s Children” had lived in the home for 14 years. The director lost all of her physical possessions, including her film equipment and hard drives containing footage from past films, as well as cash, jewelry, valuable paintings and her son’s artwork. But despite the traumatic loss, when Timoner returned to LA she decided to film her and Doctor’s return to their nonexistent dwelling. The director teamed with producer Maggie Contreras and cinematographer Elle Schneider, and her nephew, Eli Timoner.\n\t\n\n\tTogether, over a six month period, the small crew captured what the aftermath of the fires looked like for Timoner and her neighbors, many of whom had their generational wealth wiped out overnight and were now at risk of being displaced and losing their homes permanently. Timoner also filmed with Altadena community organizer Heavenly Hughes and the nonprofit organization My Tribe Rise as they attempted to restore the lives of those in need during the aftermath of the catastrophic fires.\n\n\n\tThe result of Timoner’s efforts is the 38-minute documentary “All The Walls Came Down,” which captures the resilience and solidarity of a community determined to rise again. The director uses her personal loss as a way into a larger story about a community rallying together in the wake of the fires. The doc also chronicles how the Black community of West Altadena is being pushed out despite still making mortgage payments on houses that are no longer standing.\n\t\n\n\t“I am so glad I did film when I returned to the ruins of my home, despite really feeling hopeless and overwhelmed,” says Timoner. “It gave me the material with which to transform the experience from an utter nightmare which we are still living through, to something that can protect and heal. We made the film fast and kept it a short film to try to help an urgent situation in my town.”\n\n\tIn September, “All The Walls Came Down” premiered at the Telluride Film Festival. On Sunday, the film will screen at the Sun Valley Film Festival, where Timoner will receive the Impact Award. (The short doc is eligible for an Oscar nomination, which Timoner has never received.)Since the doc’s debut, it has been used to raise financial and tangible resources, such as Airstream trailers for families who lost homes. Working as a team with My Tribe Rise, Timoner has held screenings of the doc for financiers and organizations that can help Altadena and its struggling residents.\n\n\t“All The Walls Came Down” has shown me the true power of filmmaking – giving me the opportunity to turn an unimaginable tragedy into a rallying cry and a shield to protect the town and its most vulnerable,” says Timoner. “It’s felt like practicing alchemy to tell my intimate story of grief and loss in order to get help for my neighbors to keep their land and rebuild.”\n\n\tCurrently Timoner and her team are working to get the film out to help build signatures on a petition to stop the foreclosures in Altadena.\n\n\t“We have reached over 1000 signatures and we are just getting started,” says Timoner. “We ask Governor Gavin Newsom and the California State Legislature to issue an immediate moratorium on mortgage payments, interest accrual, foreclosures, and evictions for all residents impacted by the Eaton Fire of January 2025 until claims against Southern California Edison and related insurance issues are resolved.”\n\n\tOn Jan. 7, the Los Angeles Times will release “All The Walls Came Down” on its documentary platform.\n\n\t“We want to continue to use the film as a way to help the community heal from such a traumatic event that spanned from the Palisades to Altadena,” says Timoner. “We also hope to raise bridge funding to aid Altadena families in need in their recovery.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGenerative AI is poised to reshape the supply of premium screen content, with VP of Chinese online media giant Tencent and CEO of Tencent Video Sun Zhonghuai forecasting that as much as a third of long-form film and animation could be “dominated by or deeply involving AI” within two years, despite lingering concerns around performance fidelity and visual consistency.\n\n\tSpeaking at a forum at the 7th Hainan Island International Film Festival (HIIFF) Sun predicted a dramatic shift in premium television and film content creation in the next few years.\n\t\n\n\t“From a time dimension, looking at the next one or two years, we have every reason to expect visible changes in the platform’s content supply structure,” Sun stated. “In core categories such as film, television, and animation, works dominated by or deeply involving AI could potentially reach a proportion of between 10 and 30%.”\n\n\n\tPointing to short form content, Sun concluded that the race has already been won by gen-AI products.\n\n\t“Short content is like fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), ruthlessly pursuing efficiency,” said Sun. “In this regard, the short dramas and short animations we know have already taken the lead, drastically lowering costs. We estimate that AI-native companies for short animations now account for nearly 30% of the market.”\n\n\tDespite the bullish forecast, several factors still remain obstacles for generative AI in long-form content, including the ability to maintain consistency and the inability to replicate human performances.\n\n\t“AI video technology still cannot resolve issues of visual consistency and controllability,” Sun explained. “With extended shot durations, the drifting of details in characters becomes very obvious.”\n\t\n\n\tSun also suggested that performances by human actors contained micro-expressions and micro-movements that could not be replicated by current generation AI, leaving gaps in emotional tension and subtlety.\n\n\tHe also noted that most mainstream AI-generated content is limited to 1080p HD resolution, which doesn’t match 4K, or DCI theatrical release standards.\n\n\tHowever, Sun emphasized that these hurdles are temporary and predicted that AI would allow filmmakers to revisit ambitious genres previously deemed too financially risky for studios to greenlight.\n\n\t“Genres that were ignored in the past due to market risks, such as grand Sci-Fi and grand ‘Age of Discovery’ narratives, will be revived with the cost reductions that AI offers,” said Sun.\n\n\tTo meet this future, Sun revealed that Tencent Video is aggressively integrating AI tools into its traditional workflows, stating that they were currently implementing AI in early stage concept design, pre-vis and rotoscoping. In LED virtual production, AI is being used to create the complex digital sets needed as background scenery.\n\n\tSun countered criticism that AI would lead to unemployment in the creative industries, stating that Tencent considered talent development a top priority at the company.\n\n\t“The talent model for future film production requires polymaths; in more vivid terms, we need art engineers or tech artists, and we have been working with top colleges and institutes to develop them,” said Sun.\n\n\t“We are actually very lucky to be able to experience a true Renaissance era in the film industry. The most exciting human experiences come when going through the process of uncertainty to certainty.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaurence Fishburne is looking to step back behind the camera and is currently developing a directing project, “The Rule of Nines,” with producer and casting director Bonnie Timmermann (“I Origins,” “Roofman”) and actor André Holland (“Moonlight”). John Connor wrote the script. \n\n\t“The fact that I’ve been making films since I was 11 or 12 means that I’m a filmmaker,” he tells Variety. “It makes me really prepared.” \n\t\n\n\tFishburne made his directorial debut with 2000’s “Once in the Life,” which he wrote and helmed. He has since turned down a number of directing offers, citing a lack of passion or connection with the material. Now, he says, he’s ready to embrace a more sustained run behind the camera. \n\n\n\t“This may be the moment where I move into the director space in a real, consistent kind of way,” he says. \n\n\tOn the acting front, Fishburne will return for the fifth and final season of “The Witcher” — which he says “will probably be streaming next year, probably around the same time, like Halloween.” Beyond that, he’d like to tap into the comedic sensibility he showcased on “Black-ish” and “Pee-wee’s Playhouse,” if only sporadically elsewhere. \n\n\t“From [my first film] ‘Cornbread, Earl and Me’ on, I’ve always shown up as the guy who will tell you the truth, even if you don’t want to hear it,” he says. “So I haven’t done a whole lot of comedy… but you have to be able to do both if you want to call yourself an actor.” \n\n\tAs if to prove the point, Fishburne played the cut-up at this year’s Marrakech Film Festival, unveiling a formidable arsenal of impressions. He trotted out pitch-perfect turns as Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Abel Ferrara, John Wayne and even Tweety Bird, both during an onstage conversation and later in an interview with Variety. \n\t\n\n\t“I was a big fan of [‘Looney Tunes’ voice actor] Mel Blanc,” he says. “He was really that guy — and I spent a lot of time in my youth doing voices and being funny, inspired by people like Blanc, Frank Gorshin and Robin Williams, who could create entire characters using nothing but their voice.”\n\n\t“The vocal instrument, for me, has always been an essential part of being an actor,” Fishburne adds. “I grew up in a really mixed neighborhood with people from everywhere, and I was always imitating the sounds of the people around me. It’s just my ear — I have to do it. I can’t not do it.” \n\n\t“I’m someone who loves language,” he says. “[Recently] someone mentioned my French, and I said, ‘No, my French is terrible — my accent is perfect, though.’ I just love the sounds we make as human beings.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSaudi Arabia is launching a sprawling new state-of-the-art film studio just outside the capital city of Riyadh where pre-production is underway on an ambitious historical epic titled “Unbroken Sword,” directed by Alik Sakharov, who has helmed multiple episodes of “The Sopranos” and “Game of Thrones.”\n\n\tThe new Saudi filmmaking facilities, called PlayMaker Studios, are part of the Qiddiya entertainment city on the slopes of the iconic Tuwaiq Mountains, 40 minutes southwest of Riyadh, that will comprise high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities, and a safari park in hopes of attracting millions of visitors.\n\t\n\n\tThe production hub spans more than 50 acres of backlots and comprises two purpose-built soundstages with high-spec audio systems, and “full production facilities designed to meet the needs of ambitious, global productions,” according to a statement.\n\n\n\tThe hub features production offices and “premium on-site amenities, offering a seamless, end-to-end environment for every stage of production.” It will include dedicated post-production and visual effects facilities as well as music studios. PlayMaker Studios will offers producers streamlined access to Saudi Arabia’s 40% production rebate.\n\n\tThe PlayMaker Studios complex “is set to serve as both a creative powerhouse and a cornerstone of Qiddiya City’s entertainment ecosystem,” the statement noted.\n\n\tPrincipal photography is set to begin in early 2026 on “Unbroken Sword,” which is the first film to be shot at PlayMaker Studios, where a crew of more than 200 people is already on the ground, according to the statement. The film is being sponsored by Saudi’s General Entertainment Authority and Riyadh Season, and produced by Sela.\n\t\n\n\tThe big-budget Saudi epic is reportedly set in 7th-century Arabia and follows a mythical warrior who leads an outnumbered Muslim army across uncharted desert terrain to do battle with the Roman and Persian empires.\n\n\t“Unbroken Sword” is being executive produced by British producer Richard Sharkey, whose credits include “House of the Dragon,” “Marco Polo,” “The Fifth Estate” and “The Lord of the Rings” franchises.\n\n\t“PlayMaker Studios is a cornerstone of Qiddiya City’s ambition and builds on Saudi Arabia’s growing success in the creative industries,” Abdullah Aldawood, managing director of Qiddiya Investment Company said in the statement. “It marks an important step in strengthening this momentum and realizing our vision to create a world-class destination where innovation, culture and entertainment come together, and where the global film industry can find a new home in the Kingdom,” he added.\n\n\tSharkey commented, “Bringing ‘Unbroken Sword’ to PlayMaker Studios feels like the start of something genuinely groundbreaking.” \n\n\tQiddiya is one of the so-called “giga projects” financed by Saudi’s Public Investment Fund in line with the Vision 2030 plan announced by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to wean the economy off oil and create jobs for young Saudis.\n\n\tThe announcement was made during Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea Film Festival, which runs until Dec. 13.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter a few marathon days of telephone and video calls, emails and text message chains, the $82.7 billion agreement for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and HBO Max was clinched Thursday night around 10 p.m. ET.\n\n\tBut there was no chance for high fives or a group huddle among the managers of the freshly betrothed media giants. In modern fashion, the sale negotiations were mostly conducted at arm’s length via phone and electronic communications, with Netflix and WBD executives and legal teams spread across New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and other locales.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the final hurdles to securing the initial agreement was WBD’s insistence that Netflix commit to a record-setting $5.8 billion breakup fee should the deal run into resistance, regulatory or otherwise. \n\n\n\tOpposition to the deal assembled, swiftly and fiercely, from unions, consumer watchdogs and politicos on both sides of the aisle. “This merger must be blocked,” the Writers Guild of America urged on Friday. \n\n\tIn the end, about six weeks after Paramount CEO David Ellison’s pushy overtures put the studio in play, the Warner Bros. Discovery board got what it wanted – a pedigreed, market-leading buyer with firm financial foundation and a clear strategic need to make the most of Warner Bros. and HBO.\n\n\tOn the surface, the Netflix deal would seem an echo of the AOL-Time Warner transaction completed in January 2001. A highflying beacon of what was then called “new media” buys a legacy entertainment company with brands that seem to be ripe for exploitation in new ways.\n\n\tThe AOL takeover of Time Warner, of course, was nothing less than disastrous. The grand thesis of the merger unraveled in barely a year’s time after the dot-com bust and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This time around, the Netflix acquisition signals the (near) conquest of Southern California’s most dynamic industry by one of the world-beating tech giants that sprang from Northern California.\n\t\n\n\tThe WBD board leaned toward the Netflix bid because the company has such a strong balance sheet. Its stock has been one of the most consistent and durable performers over a turbulent decade for media and entertainment. Unlike AOL in 2001, when its growth was powered by offering basic dial-up internet access, Netflix has a strong underlying business model that can’t easily be outmoded by new tech or undercut on price by rivals. TV shows and movies are, after all, very sticky – ask any “Bridgerton” or “Strangers Things” fan.\n\n\tNetflix’s long-horizon outlook stands in contrast to Paramount Skydance, which began its pursuit of WBD shortly after Skydance Media sealed its $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Communications. It’s a sign of the times that the parent company of Paramount Pictures and CBS – two entertainment institutions that have been around for more than 100 years – are a bigger risk than a much younger venture that has been in the original programming game for about a dozen years. \n\n\tParamount Skydance faces an uphill climb in turning around the fortunes of its studio and legacy cable networks and restoring strong free cash flow. The company is also carrying more debt on its balance sheet than Netflix, proportionate to its earnings power. All of these factors were a consideration for the WBD board. In the case of a black-swan event for the macro economy, how would Paramount fare? \n\n\tThe lack of certainty there helped sway WBD board members that Netflix was the better fit and safer option for shareholders than Paramount or even Comcast, which was the third contender for the studio in the whirlwind bidding process that began in earnest in early November. The process quickly crystallized into a test of wills between two Davids – Ellison and WBD CEO David Zaslav. There’s been endless industry chatter that Zaslav was angling for a deal that left him with a high executive perch in the resulting company. Ellison slammed the WBD leader in a legal letter sent to Zaslav on Thursday accusing him of having “abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process” in order to steer the deal to Netflix.\n\n\tWBD board members were already put off by Paramount’s unsolicited offer and the whispers around Hollywood and D.C. that only Ellison and his familial connections to the Trump White House would be able to secure regulatory approval for such a big merger.\n\t\n\n\tBut Donald Trump is famous for working his phone, and Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is definitely in his contacts. President Trump respects Netflix’s rags-to-riches growth as a modern American business success story. And while Trump often expresses hostility to Hollywood as a bastion of touchy-feely liberalism, the reality is that he has long been fascinated by the industry, especially after he became a TV star via NBC’s “The Apprentice.”\n\n\tSources close to the situation emphasize that even in Hollywood, ego takes a back seat to business rationale when the enterprise value tops $82 billion.\n\n\tNetflix and WBD leaders including Zaslav are preparing to make a strenuous case for the consumer benefits of the deal as well as the positive impact that the enlarged company will have on the creative community.\n\n\tZaslav, Sarandos and Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters are bracing for a long fight. The leaders are projecting a closing timeline of as much as 18 months given the scrutiny on the companies and the political crosscurrents. \n\n\tThere are points to be gained for elected officials on the left and right by railing against another big media merger. That could make for a long drawn-out battle in Washington with the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department. The FCC is not expected to play much if any role in this review because of the nature of assets involved – WBD does not own broadcast TV stations (a la Paramount) or cable systems (a la Comcast).\n\n\tSources said the Netflix and WBD teams are confident that on the antitrust merits it’s hard to prove the enlarged company would have anything close to monopoly power over the content marketplace –particularly at a time when Netflix, HBO and others have for-real competition for the hearts and minds of younger viewers from likes of YouTube and TikTok.\n\n\tIn their first presentations about the deal on Friday, Netflix and WBD emphasized how little overlap there is between the companies. Netflix has stated its intention to maintain HBO Max and Warner Bros. studio operations as standalone businesses under the Netflix tent. Anyone who has experienced a Hollywood merger in recent decades knows that no matter what is said in the moment, the long-term arc of any business leans toward streamlining, efficiencies and eliminating redundancies. Consolidation will eventually affect some on the list of accomplished senior executives who are spread among Netflix, Warner Bros. and HBO.\n\t\n\n\tFor the most senior executive at WBD, however, the future does seem to be coming into focus. Sarandos and Peters are firmly installed as Netflix co-CEOs. Zaslav has been telling friends and colleagues that he’s focused on helping to get the merger to the finish line and to deliver a healthy Warner Bros. and HBO Max to Sarandos when it’s time to hand over the keys.\n\n\tIf the deal goes through as it was outlined to investors today, Zaslav will eventually lose his CEO perch but he’ll gain many, many millions (as will a host of senior WB and HBO executives through stock options), as well as the satisfaction of having gone out on his own terms.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a wide-ranging conversation at the Singapore International Film Festival, acclaimed filmmaker Deepa Mehta reflected on her decades-long career, the controversies that have shadowed her most celebrated works, and her unwavering commitment to independent filmmaking.\n\n\tMehta was speaking with longtime collaborator Hussain Amarshi, head of Mongrel Media, which has distributed her films. She will receive a lifetime achievement honor from the festival, capping a year of retrospectives and accolades for the director known for her groundbreaking “Elements” trilogy.\n\t\n\n\t“For the first time these days, I’ve stopped being critical of all my work,” Mehta told the audience. “It’s not that I’m proud of it. I like it, which makes me feel good.”\n\n\n\tHer father, a film distributor in India, gave her advice that has guided her career: “There are two things in life. One is you’ll never know when you’ll die, and the other is you’ll never know how a film will be accepted.”\n\n\tAfter moving to Canada, Mehta’s 1991 feature debut “Sam & Me,” co-written with Ranjit Chowdhry, drew from her immigrant experience. The film’s success at Cannes opened doors, including a call from George Lucas, who hired her to direct an India-set episode of “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.”\n\n\tDespite Hollywood offers and working with Jessica Tandy on “Camilla,” Mehta chose independence. Martin Scorsese reinforced her decision at the Marrakesh Film Festival. “He said, ‘Don’t ever get tempted. Do your own stuff,'” she recalled.\n\n\tIn 1996, Mehta wrote and directed “Fire,” depicting a same-sex relationship between two women in an Indian household, which became the first Indian film to deal explicitly with lesbian relationships.\n\t\n\n\tShe had no idea the film would spark outrage. When it was released, theaters in Delhi were burned, and protests erupted across India with demonstrators insisting “there are no lesbians in India.” But a counter-protest moved her deeply. “As far as the eye could see, there were people, mostly women, carrying placards that said, ‘We are lesbians and we are Indians.’ And I thought, ‘How wonderful.'”\n\n\tFollowing “Fire” and “Earth” (1998), which became India’s Oscar submission, Mehta embarked on “Water” in 2000. The film about widows in 1930s India faced even more severe opposition.\n\n\tWhile location scouting in Varanasi for Lucas’s “Young Indiana Jones,” Mehta had encountered an elderly widow and followed her to a house full of widows — women of all ages with shaven heads wearing white sarees. “I’ve never seen a house of widows before, so that’s what inspired me to do water,” she said.\n\n\tOn the second day of shooting, with Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das already having shaved their heads for their roles, demonstrations erupted. Sets were thrown into the river and burned. Effigies of Mehta were set ablaze. Death threats followed. The police forced the production to shut down.\n\n\tThe experience fundamentally changed her relationship with her birthplace. On the Air France flight back to Toronto, “I put the seatbelt on and for the first time, I felt maybe I’m going home. I never thought of Canada as home till then.”\n\n\tFive years later, after her anger had dissipated, she remade “Water” in Sri Lanka. The film opened the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, became Canada’s Oscar submission, and received an Academy Award nomination for best foreign language film, as the international category was known then. \n\n\tMehta revealed that every script she’s written has been produced — a remarkable achievement in the film industry. She attributes much of her success to workshopping films extensively before shooting, a technique based on the ancient Indian Natya Shastra performance texts.\n\n\t“For two weeks or 10 days of workshopping really helps me, because when you see the various ways it can be enacted, you understand what works for you,” she explained.\n\n\tMehta’s next project is “Forgiveness,” based on Mark Sakamoto’s book about Japanese-Canadian citizens sent to internment camps during World War II while Sakamoto’s white Canadian grandfather became a prisoner of war in Japan. “It’s about, can we ever forgive what has happened to us, and why is it so difficult?” she said.\n\t\n\n\tReflecting on the current state of cinema, she expressed concern about political pressures in Hollywood and Bollywood. “The climate of films is really changing,” she observed. “We are compromised before we start.”\n\n\tBut she remains hopeful about independent filmmaking. “I think best is to make small independent films,” she advised young filmmakers. “Write your own story. Find the right way to tell the story within a budget that is feasible. Independence, independence, absolutely independence, especially when you’re starting out.”\n\n\tMehta cited influences including Satyajit Ray, Kurosawa Akira, and recently discovered Masaki Kobayashi’s “Harakiri” (1962) and Vinod Kapri’s Indian independent film “Pyre.”\n\n\tWhen asked about labels of controversy that have followed her work, Mehta pushed back. “I don’t think that way. Controversy is something that I’ve been labeled with, and I have to live with.”\n\n\tHer father’s wisdom continues to guide her. “You will never know how a filmmaker will be received,” she reflected. “To even think that way isn’t the way I perceive life or live it.”\n\n\tOn questions of national identity, Mehta cited M.G. Vassanji’s book “Nostalgia.” “I really do believe that if I belong anywhere, it’s to myself,” she said. “So that’s my home.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnnemarie Jacir‘s drama “Palestine 36,” which reconstructs the largely unknown Palestinian revolt against British colonial rule in 1936, is the very definition of a passion project for the director who has always explored Palestinian identity her films. But never on such a large canvas. \n\n\tHer particularly timely historical epic follows a young man named Yusuf who gets caught up in political upheaval as tensions rise in Jerusalem and in his village amid British crackdowns prompted by the arrival of Jewish immigrants escaping antisemitism in Europe. The multi-strand drama features a high-profile cast comprising Jeremy Irons as a colonial commissioner, Hiam Abbas (“Succession”), Liam Cunningham and Saleh Bakri (“The Teacher”).\n\t\n\n\tWhen the Israel-Hamas War broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, Jacir was just one week away from starting principal photography on “Palestine 36” in Bethlehem, where she was born. Production was put on hold and subsequently started in Jordan before returning for additional shooting in Palestine.\n\n\n\tThe film – which is Palestine’s official entry for the Oscars’ international feature film race – is having its Middle East premiere at Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea Film Festival in Jeddah after launching from Toronto and playing at other top events including the Marrakech Film Festival where it is the closer.\n\n\t“Palestine 36” will be released by Watermelon Pictures in the U.S. in early 2026 promoted with a series of conversations held by Mark Ruffalo, Diego Luna, Susan Sarandon, Riz Ahmed, Ava DuVernay, Mira Nair, Julie Delpy and Ramy Youssef.\n\t\n\n\tJacir – whose previous works comprise “When I Saw You,” “Salt of This Sea” and “Wajib” – speaks to Variety about her research for this film and her first impressions of playing it for a U.S. audience.\n\n\tI know the film is based on research and rooted in historical fact. But I’m wondering about the central character of Khuloud, the feisty female journalist. Is she based on a real person?\n\n\tKhaloud is a female, well-educated, upper-class journalist during this period, completely inspired by a number of real women who were working in Palestine, but also in Lebanon and Egypt. They were using male names for two reasons. One, because it was kind of looked down upon [for a woman] to be a journalist, and they wanted to be taken seriously. And the second reason is they were writing under a colonial government that was censoring the news and it was dangerous to be a journalist. Which, incidentally, is still the case today.\n\n\tKhuloud is married to Amir, the wealthy newspaper editor who belongs to the Muslim Association that we learn is in collusion with a Jewish agency called the Zionist Commission. How did that surface?\n\n\tWhen I started doing the research I came across this mention of a Zionist Commission for Arab Affairs and that they were placing articles in newspapers in Arabic to influence people. And I was like, wow! That’s so modern. That’s what people do today. I started digging at it more. The Palestinian national parties had what were called the Muslim Christian associations that were working towards independence. Then I found out that the Zionists founded a Muslim Association to break that solidarity. Divide and conquer has really been the way for hundreds of years that has worked all over the world.\n\n\tThe film shows factionalism within the Palestinians. Do you also see that as something that is relevant today?\n\n\tAbsolutely. We still see that kind of thing going on. What we have today [the Israeli -Palestinian conflict] is not a religious conflict. People want to turn into a religious conflict by saying: “Oh, Jews and Muslims have been fighting for thousands of years. But it’s not a religious conflict. And people play upon that. I find it really interesting because even now the Israelis are trying very hard to continue that history of divide and conquer. They started with the Druze community. The Druze community is part of us, they are part of our community. But they’ve been putting Druze in the army. Putting them on the borders. Letting them do the grunt work. It’s all about trying to separate a people.\n\t\n\n\tIn terms of your historical sources, I’ve read that one of them is the book “The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine” by Columbia University professor Rashid Khalid. Have you been in contact with him. Has he seen the film?\n\n\tThere were books by many other people as well, including one by Tom Segev [a columnist for Israeli newspaper “Ha’aretz”], another by [Israeli historian] Ilan Pappe. And others. Khalid has not seen the film yet. I am waiting for him to see it. But other historians that have seen it whose works are very influential to me. Charles Anderson, a historian who writes a lot about the period, has seen the film and wrote a  beautiful response to it. The same goes for [Oxford University historian] Avi Shlaim, who has seen the film. That’s one of the things that makes me nervous, you know. There’s the audience, and then there’s the academics and the historians. What are they gonna say? It’s like: I don’t care about the reviews, I care about these guys.\n\n\tA lot has been written about the fact that you were in prep when Oct. 7 events forced you to relocate from Palestine to Jordan. Simply put: what was it like to be shooting this film about the roots of the conflict just as it escalated to an unprecedented level?\n\n\tThere was something really insane about it, and emotionally very difficult. Because, you know, we were making this film about this violent period, this critical period. But the violence around us was so much worse than what we could have ever imagined. We always think we’ve lived through a dark moment of history, and then we find ourselves living an even darker one. \n\n\tThough the film is from the Palestinian perspective you interweave archive footage that shows real footage of Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Europe. Talk to me about that choice.\n\n\tThat was an important choice for me because we don’t have Jewish characters in the film, but I think its crucial to see the background of what was going on. I wanted to focus on the British [colonialists] and their complicity in the conflict. But also on the fact that for me Palestine is one of the most ethnically and religiously mixed places on earth. Armenians fled the Ottoman genocide and came to Palestine, and they are part of our community. Circassians came to Palestine. Bosnians came to Palestine. There’s a village in Palestine that founded by Bosnians. Jewish people fled Europe. They fled fascism and Nazism and came for safety. They were later used for a political project. But I wanted to show the people on those boats coming in because we were a country – not to say that we were perfect, or that we were angels – but we were a country that a lot of people have been coming in and out of for thousands and thousands of years. From the East, from the West. Some as conquerors, some as Crusaders. Some as religious pilgrims. There’s a Nigerian community that came as religious pilgrims. It’s who we are. And I wanted to nod to that fact that the fascism that was happening in Europe was not us. They came for safety.\n\t\n\n\tThe film just played for a week as a sneak peak in U.S. theaters prior to its more substantial rollout early next year. What are your thoughts about bringing it to American audiences in the current climate?\n\n\tI never thought that there would be a Palestinian distribution company in the U.S. Then when Watermelon Pictures approached us I thought: the world is really changing! The U.S. is the one place where I’ve always struggled to get distribution. So it’s interesting. I’ve been to the U.S. now a couple times for these  Oscar screenings or festival screenings. It’s really interesting because first of all, I’m looking out at the audience, and there’s a bunch of 18-year-olds. They are like old-school progressives, and they are all 18 year-olds. And second of all, I’m always waiting for some aggressive thing to happen, because that’s how it used to be. I had somebody spit at me once in a screening. You known Palestinian voices can trigger craziness in some people. And I’m having none of that happening. I haven’t lived in the U.S. in, like, 25 years. But I feel something is happening. The climate is really bad. But also something has happened for the better. I think people are open.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

Idaho's most infamous mass killer is incarcerated in long-term restrictive housing at Idaho Maximum Security Institution, so he has very little access to any activities, according to Sanda Kuzeta-Cerimagic, a spokeswoman for the Department of Correction.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Kuzeta-Cerimagic said Kohberger and his fellow inmates in the restrictive unit are shuffled around in shackles, making it harder for correction officers to move them about the prison for special Xmas activities.\n      \n\n          During the holidays, St. Vincent de Paul -- a charity organization -- runs a program called “Cookies for Corrections”, and they deliver donated boxes of cookies to every Idaho Department of Correction facility, including the Idaho Maximum Security Institution. Among the cookies, there are some famous brand names, such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, and Nutter Butter (perfect for Kohberger).\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n    \n          Of course, Kohberger made the inmate list to receive the cookies despite butchering 4 University of Idaho students with a knife and landing in prison for life.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Speaking of food ... the prison menu consists of \"Holiday Turkey Roast\" ... but since Kohberger is a strict vegan, he'll probably go for the \"Holiday Stuffed Pepper\" -- paired with vegan mashed potatoes and vegan pumpkin pie.\n      \n    \n          And that's about it for Kohberger's Christmas.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Bryan Kohberger\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                          \n                Christmas\n              \n                          \n                True Crime\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

He says she stayed in contact with him from months through calls, texts, FaceTime and invited him to visit her in Utah and California.\n      \n    \n          Marciano claims Demi even shared her location with him and says, \"That behavior confirms a continued relationship, not a person reacting to sexual assault.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          In the docs, he says Demi's false claims have resulted in \"lost professional opportunities, harassment by strangers, and lasting harm to Marciano's reputation.\"\n      \n    \n          Marciano is suing for defamation and going after Demi and the producer for damages ... and he wants a \"narrowly tailored injunction\" that prohibits them from \"repeating and republishing all of the statements that are adjudicated by this Court to be defamatory.\"\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Demi and Jeff ... so far no word back.\n      \n      ",

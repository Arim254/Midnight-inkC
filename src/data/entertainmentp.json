    "body": "\n\tThe tribe has spoken… and they’re voting Andrew Cuomo off the island.\n\n\tSeveral recent “Survivor” contestants — including Teeny Chirichillo (Season 47), Yam Yam Arocho (Season 44) and Katurah Topps (Season 45) — have returned to tribal council to advocate for Zohran Mamdani in a new campaign advertisement paid for by the New York City mayoral candidate.\n\n\tThe spot, which aired during Wednesday night’s episode of “Survivor,” is one of several in a seven-figure ad buy to reach different demographics of the voting public. Mamdani’s campaign ran a “Bachelor”-inspired ad during a recent episode of “The Golden Bachelor.”\n\t\n\n\t“Andrew, New Yorkers want a mayor who will make groceries and childcare affordable, not sell us out to their billionaire donors,” Chirichillo says in the ad while holding up a piece of the show’s signature voting parchment with Cuomo’s name on it, as if voting him out of the race.\n\n\n\tIn a spin on the confessionals shown during “Survivor” elimination ceremonies, Brandon Donlon (Season 45) pushes for “a mayor who will make buses fast and free,” while Arocho hopes to elect someone who will “not defund the MTA.”\n\n\tBefore Cuomo’s fictional torch is snuffed out, Natalie Anderson (Season 29) makes a final plea: “We’re with assemblyman Zohran Mamdani. He’ll stand up to Trump, freeze the rent and deliver universal childcare.”\n\n\tMamdani appears at the end of the spot to conclude: “We’re going to build a city where no one has to struggle to survive.”\n\n\tMamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist and state assemblyman whose progressive economic platform has galvanized younger voters, won the Democratic primary in a stunning upset. He and his rivals — former Gov. Cuomo, running as an independent, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee — are expected to spend millions of advertising dollars ahead of the mayoral election on Nov. 4. \n",

    "body": "\n\tA woman died in an “apparent suicide” on Tuesday outside Disney World‘s Contemporary Resort in Florida, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office.\n\n\t“We can confirm this was an apparent suicide,” a spokesperson for the Orange County Sheriff’s Office told Variety in an email.\n\n\tThe suicide’s proximity to the famous Disney World monorail sparked unconfirmed reports online about the cause of death. However, a spokesperson from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office told People that the victim was “NOT struck by the monorail,” and deemed any reports suggesting she was “erroneous information.”\n\t\n\n\tLocal outlet WKMG reported that local authorities received word around 6:40 p.m. local time about a body on North World Dive, which runs through Disney’s Contemporary Resort.\n\n\n\tA video by an onlooker posted online showed employees erecting a white pop-up tent on the terrace of the Contemporary Resort in the wake of the incident. Police cars can be seen congregating in the parking lot below.\n\n\tOriginally opened in October 1971 as the Tempo Bay Hotel, the Contemporary Resort is one of the two original residences built at the Disney World Complex. On the Disney World website, the hotel is described as an “ultra-modern” lodging featuring the “iconic A-frame Contemporary tower” and a “90-foot-tall mural by Disney Legend Mary Blair — responsible for the distinct look and feel of the ‘it’s a small world’ attraction.”\n\n\tThe suicide comes a week after a woman in her 60s experienced a health issue and died after riding Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion attraction in California. Anaheim Police confirmed that the woman was unresponsive after exiting the ride, and that Disneyland security administered CPR until first responders rushed her to the hospital. She was later pronounced dead.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMark Ruffalo revealed on the “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast that he saved Woody Harrelson from an epic bar fight when the two were in New Orleans filming 2013’s “Now You See Me,” Louis Leterrier’s heist thriller about a group of illusionists who carry out robberies. Ruffalo played an FBI agent trying to capture the group.\n\n\t“We were shooting ‘Now You See Me’ in New Orleans, completely on the streets. Totally wild,” Ruffalo said (via Entertainment Weekly). “Capturing stuff on a long lens, getting dragged into bars during the middle of a scene, like in the middle of Mardi Gras.”\n\t\n\n\tRuffalo and Danson stayed out after filming wrapped for the day and went to “a packed place” to grab a drink when things escalated.\n\n\n\t“A woman came up to [Woody] and she said, ‘Oh my God, I love you so much,'” Ruffalo said. “Woody put his hand on her arm and he said, ‘Oh, thank you. Thank you, darling.’ And this guy comes over and he pushes her outta the way, and he shoves Woody. Bad. Because Woody’s first response is not ‘shove someone back,’ but ‘immediately punch them in the face.’ Which is the right thing to do, by the way. It’s the absolute right thing to do. But then a whole melee broke out in this bar. I was in the middle of it and it was turning into a— it was getting to become a whole thing… And I grabbed [Woody].”\n\n\t“I grabbed [Woody] and I pulled him out,” Ruffalo continued. “Because I was like, ‘This could be fun, but it also just could go so disastrously wrong because you and I might be able to handle ourselves but the rest of the folks we were with… I don’t think so.”\n\t\n\n\tRuffalo and Harrelson starred in “Now You See Me” alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Mélanie Laurent, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco and Morgan Freeman. The movie was a box office hit with $351 million worldwide and spawned a franchise that led to 2016’s “Now You See Me 2” and the upcoming “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” in theaters Nov. 14.\n\n\tWatch Ruffalo’s interview on the “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDiane Keaton‘s family have made a statement revealing her cause of death. Her family thanked fans for their messages of support and told People magazine that the actress died of pneumonia on Saturday.\n\n\t“The Keaton family are very grateful for the extraordinary messages of love and support they have received these past few days on behalf of their beloved Diane, who passed away from pneumonia on October 11,” the statement said.\n\n\n\tThe family suggested that her fans could make donations in her memory to a local food bank or an animal shelter. “She loved her animals and she was steadfast in her support of the unhoused community, so any donations in her memory to a local food bank or an animal shelter would be a wonderful and much appreciated tribute to her,” the family told People.\n\t\n\n\tKeaton died in Los Angeles on Saturday. Paramedics had responded to her home and transported her to a nearby hospital.\n\n\tA friend said her health had “declined very suddenly” in the past few months, according to People, and that only her close family was aware, and chose “to keep things very private.” \n\n\tSince Saturday, tributes have poured in from her co-stars and friends for the Oscar-winning actress, who in addition to starring in dozens of notable films was known as a passionate architectural preservationist and animal lover. Starting on Friday, AMC Theatres will be rereleasing “Annie Hall” and “Something’s Gotta Give” for one week runs to commemorate her memory. Keaton won the best actress Oscar for Woody Allen’s “Annie Hall” and was nominated for best actress for “Reds,” “Something’s Gotta Give” and “Marvin’s Room.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 7 of “Gen V,” now streaming on Amazon’s Prime Video.\n\n\tIt turns out Marie (Jaz Sinclair) had a very good reason for originally thinking Dean Cipher (Hamish Linklater) had no powers: He doesn’t.\n\n\tToward the end of this week’s episode of “Gen V,” Marie, her sister Annabeth (Keeya King), Cate (Maddie Phillips) and Emma (Lizze Broadway) look on in horror as they discover the elderly burn victim man they correctly assumed was Thomas Godolkin (Ethan Slater) has been controlling Cipher this whole time. It wasn’t Cipher who had the power to control others, it was Thomas Godolkin. And from his hyperbaric chamber, Godolkin was controlling the man known as Cipher (who has no powers at all), and jumping in and out of others’ bodies as well, while he remained on life support. \n\t\n\n\tUntil, that is, Marie brought the century-old supe back to fighting form on this week’s “Gen V,” in the hopes thatThomas Godolkin would help them stop Cipher. But too bad, he is Cipher! Now, Marie and Annabeth have Godolkin’s pending massacre plans to deal with, on top of trying to mend their fragile sibling relationship: Annabeth confesses she knew Marie was going to kill their parents by accident before it happened, and it’s haunted her ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJaz Sinclair as Marie Moreau and Keeya King as Annabeth Moreau in “Gen V” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJasper Savage/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“She’s been completely removed from the supes, living with her Aunt Pam, and she thinks that supes are monsters. She doesn’t fully grasp her powers, nor does she really understand them,” King told Variety abiut playing Marie’s precog sister.\n\t\n\n\tAnd in her confusion over what happened to them and their parents, Annabeth’s pain and shame after their deaths turned into resentment toward Marie — she chose to blame her sister for something Annabeth knew was not Marie’s fault.\n\n\tThe twist in the sisters’ story raises the stakes for not only Marie and Annabeth, but also for Cate, Emma, Jordan (Derek Luh/London Thor), Sam (Asa Germann) and Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas) going into the “Gen V” Season 2 finale next week. It shifts the perspective from what the audience saw in the opening scene of Season 1 — the deaths of Marie and Annabeth’s parents — and revealed that Marie is not solely responsible for her parents’ deaths. Annabeth could have said something and stopped it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHamish Linklater as Dean Cipher in “Gen V” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJasper Savage/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’ve watched the show, and I’m like, ‘OK, Annabeth thinks that Marie killed her parents,'” King said. “And then when I sat down with our showrunner, Michelle, she actually explained to me the path that the writers had for Annabeth, which is that she actually had these visions and she’s been holding onto them for a very long time. \n\n\t“As an actor, it’s sort of weaving in little moments of pain and regret of not acting on those visions, and then also sort of blaming my sister as well,” she continued. “Because when you’re upset with yourself, sometimes it’s like, ‘Where do I place that hurt?’ So sometimes she does place it on Marie, her sister.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichael J. Fox reveals in his new memoir, “Future Boy,” that he wrote a letter to Eric Stoltz asking to finally meet 40 years after Fox replaced Stoltz as Marty McFly in the blockbuster “Back to the Future.” As the infamous story goes, Stoltz was already in production for six weeks on the Robert Zemeckis-directed blockbuster when the decision was made to boot him and recast the lead role with the director’s first choice, Fox, who had been blocked from the film due to his commitment to the NBC sitcom “Family Ties.”\n\t\n\n\t“Eric has maintained his silence on the subject for 40 years, so I was prepared for the likelihood that he’d prefer to keep it that way,” Fox writes in the memoir (via Entertainment Weekly), noting the two had never come face to face to discuss the casting swap. Fox wrote to him: “If your answer is ‘piss off and leave me alone’… That works, too.”\n\n\n\tStoltz responded with a “beautifully written reply” that “began, ‘Piss off and leave me alone!’ Thankfully, this was followed by ‘I jest…’ Eric was thoughtful about my outreach, and although he respectfully declined to participate in the book, he seemed open to the idea of getting together.”\n\n\tWhen Fox and Stoltz finally found themselves together in the same room, the actors “immediately fell into an easy dialogue about our careers, families, and yes, our own trips through the space-time continuum,” Fox writes. “[Stoltz entered] with a smile, and we quickly acknowledged that neither of us had an issue with the other. What transpired on ‘Back to the Future’ had not made us enemies or fated rivals; we were just two dedicated actors who had poured equal amounts of energy into the same role. The rest had nothing to do with us. As it turned out, we had much more in common than our spin as Marty.”\n\t\n\n\t“In the months since meeting, Eric and I have maintained a friendly correspondence – volleys back and forth between like-minded actors and dads, offering up recent movies we’ve loved, the latest adventures with our kids and an occasional detour into politics,” Fox adds. “His emails are reliably witty and always fun to read [and] a reminder that some of the best parts of our future can come from the past.”\n\n\tReplacing Stoltz as Marty McFly in “Back to the Future” changed the course of Fox’s career, as he made the jump from sitcom star to blockbuster actor. The movie grossed $381.1 million worldwide in 1985 to become the year’s highest-grossing movie and spawned a franchise that led to 1989’s “Back to the Future Part II” and 1990’s “Back to the Future Part III,” both of which Fox headlined.\n\n\tIn his memoir, Fox writes that “Family Ties” creator Gary David Goldberg “removed me from consideration” to play Marty McFly when Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg wanted to originally cast him. The film “had already shot for over a month” and the dailies with Stoltz front and center “were disappointing” to the creative team.\n\n\t“Eric was an immensely talented actor, but the creative team felt that he just wasn’t the right fit for Marty McFly,” Fox notes.\n\n\tFox’s memoir, “Future Boy,” is now available for purchase.\n",

In other words, he falsified reports for the family’s Gallatin, Mo., farm in order to receive subsidies and insurance payments they weren’t authorized to get. In a memo from Oct. 6, prosecutors asked U.S. District Court Judge Stephen R. Bough to sentence McBee to 41 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and more than $4 million in restitution.\n\n\tOn the show, the economics of McBee Farming Operations are always presented as precarious. Because of these legal problems, McBee appeared only twice in the show’s second season, after taking center stage in Season 1.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAccording to ratings provided by Bravo, Season 2 of “The McBee Dynasty” — which ran from June 30-Sept. 1 — averaged 1.3 million weekly viewers across platforms. Compared with Season 1, its ratings were up 82% on Peacock and 213% on DVR. The second half of the 10-episode season showed gains of +16% on Peacock and +8% on Bravo through seven-day viewership. In an interesting statistic, about one-third of the second season’s “McBee” audience, Bravo says, “co-viewed with someone else on both Bravo and Peacock, making it a Top 4 Original Series of 2025 on both platforms – fueled by female viewers watching with male viewers.”\n\n\n\tIn Steve McBee Sr.’s absence, the second season focused on Steven Jr. and his brothers Jesse McBee and Cole, as they tried to save the farm and engaged in their messy personal lives. The show’s official logline reads, “On the heels of a wedding and the arrival of two new babies, the McBee clan is growing — and so are the challenges of balancing love, legacy, and life on the ranch.”\n\n\t“The McBee Dynasty” is produced by Jeff Jenkins Productions, in association with 3BMG. Jenkins, Russell Jay-Staglik, Luke Neslage, Brandon Beck, Ross Weintraub and Reinout Oerlemans executive produce.   \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

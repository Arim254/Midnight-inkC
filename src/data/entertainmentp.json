    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” topped the Thanksgiving box office, earning $19.7 million on Thursday. The Disney animated sequel has earned an impressive $59.2 million domestically since opening on Tuesday night and is expected to collect $140 million to $150 million over the five-day holiday period.\n\n\tAnd audiences continue to fall under Elphaba and Glinda’s spell, with “Wicked: For Good” taking second place on Thursday with $12.6 million. The film has earned a mighty $207.2 million after less than a week in theaters.  “Wicked: For Good” should add more than $90 million to its haul over the five-day holiday to bring its domestic total to just under $270 million.\n\t\n\n\tThe two films are turbocharging a box office that was desperately in need of a reset. Ticket sales in October fell to their lowest levels in three decades as films like “The Smashing Machine,” “Tron: Ares” and “Kiss of the Spider Woman” flopped, and big-budget releases such as “One Battle After Another” failed to justify their high costs. \n\n\n\tEven though “Zootopia 2” is proving to be a commercial juggernaut, its grosses will fall short of the record set by another Disney film, 2024’s “Moana 2,” which earned $139 million over the traditional weekend and $225 million over the five days. Past Thanksgiving openings of note include Disney’s 2019 sequel “Frozen II” ($125 million over the five days) and 2013’s “Hunger Games: Catching Fire” ($109 million over the five days). \n\n\tThe second “Zootopia” is dominating the international box office, earning $74 million to push its global total to a sizable $133.2 million. It is projected to pull in an additional $135 million to $145 million from foreign markets over its first five days of release. The film is doing particularly well in China, where Shanghai Disneyland recently debuted a Zootopia Land. It has grossed more than $54 million in its first two days in theaters, becoming one of the few Hollywood films to resonate at the Chinese box office since COVID — the country has instead turned to local-language productions as tensions with the U.S. have risen. \n\t\n\n\tDirected by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, “Zootopia 2” follows a rabbit police officer (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist fox (Jason Bateman) as they reunite to pursue a mysterious new reptilian resident (Ke Huy Quan). \n\n\tAmong indie films, A24’s “Eternity,” a rom-com set in the afterlife that stars Elizabeth Olsen, Miles Teller, and Callum Turner, picked up $616,272 from 1,348 screens to bring its domestic haul to $2,1 million, while Focus Features’ “Hamnet,” a drama about the death of William Shakespeare’s son, picked up $160,000 from 160 locations to bring its gross to $480,000. “Hamnet” is considered to be an Oscar frontrunner, with critics lavishing praise on the work of director Chloe Zhao and stars Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Sonos Move speaker has long been a favorite among audiophiles for its clean, crisp sound, easy connectivity and sleek design. But at $449, the Move doesn’t come cheap, and Sonos almost never puts its products up for sale. What’s more: the Move is often backordered on the Sonos website, and availability on Amazon comes and goes.\n\n\tBut Sonos isn’t the only audio brand making great speakers these days. Bose has been a leader in the audio space for almost six decades, and its latest Bose SoundLink Revolve+ (Series II) Speaker delivers a decent Sonos dupe for more than $250 cheaper.\n\n\n\tRegularly $299+, a new Black Friday deal gets you the SoundLink Revolve+ for just $179 — a massive 40% discount and the cheapest price we’ve seen for this bestselling portable speaker.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBLACK FRIDAY DEAL\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBose SoundLink Revolve+ (Series II) Bluetooth Speaker\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe Bose SoundLink Speaker is a portable Bluetooth speaker that delivers big, full, 360-degree sound, thanks to its unique shape and an omnidirectional deflector that moves sound around you rather than directly at you.\n\n\tWhile the Sonos Move gets up to 11 hours on a single charge, the Bose SoundLink II gets a whopping 17 hours from its rechargeable lithium-ion battery.\n\n\tDesigned to be used indoors or outdoors, the Bose SoundLink Revolve is rated IP55 to be dust-proof and weatherproof. While you shouldn’t submerge it in the pool, it can hold up to splashes of water or a little rain without damage. The built-in handle lets you easily take it around from spot to spot — or party to party.\n\n\tPairing is super easy using via Bluetooth, and in our experience, our music from our phone paired to the speaker in seconds. Multi-connect mode lets you pair two devices at one time and easily switch between them to control your playlists. “SimpleSync” mode, meantime, lets you pair the speaker with other Bose speakers to create a true surround sound experience.\n\n\n\tRegularly $299+, get the new Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Series II Speaker for just $179 here. We like the silver colorway and aluminum finish of the model above, but you can get the Bose speaker in black as well.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALSO CONSIDER\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBose SoundLink Revolve+ (Series II) Bluetooth Speaker\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tAmazon says it’s sold hundreds of these units in the last month alone, with almost 85% of shoppers giving it a full, five-star review. As with all Amazon deals though, the sale could end at any time so add this to cart while the discount is still live. See full details here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tApple‘s iPad is synonymous with tablets, and now, you can get one for cheaper than ever, thanks to this new Apple deal on Amazon.\n\n\tAmazon is offering the 11th-generation iPad on sale for just $274 online as part of its Black Friday deals. The latest deal gets you a generous $75 discount off its regular price of $349 — a steeper discount than we saw for it on Prime Day. This represents the cheapest price we’re seeing for a new (I.e. not refurbished) iPad online and is also the lowest price we’ve seen for this iPad ever, and lower \n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLOWEST PRICE ONLINE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAll New Apple iPad (11-Generation)\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe tablet features the slim and sleek design that iPads are known for with an 11-inch screen. The screen itself boasts a sharp and vivid liquid retina display that makes it easy to stream your favorite movies or to use the tablet for drawing and sketching. Apple’s screen technology automatically adjusts the display to the brightness levels in the room, to make it easy to see your content, no matter the lighting or time of day.\n\n\tA 12MP ultra-wide camera gets you the same megapixels as the iPad Pro (on sale for $1,099 at Amazon.com), and is great for crystal clear selfies and video calls. The 12MP back camera is perfect for capturing photos, or for shooting videos, in stunning 4K quality. The iPad has 128GB of storage, though you can upgrade to 256GB or 512GB models as well.\n\n\tBattery life is solid, with Apple saying it lasts “all day.” In our experience, we’ve been able to get a decent 8-10 hours of runtime on a single charge — enough to last you through a work conference or flight to Europe. WiFi 6 and 5G connectivity make it easy to pair your device with any network, while Apple’s upgraded A16 chip keeps all your apps and content running smoothly and quickly on the iPad. The super slim design and light weight make it easy to take this portable tablet on the go.\n\n\n\tThis Amazon iPad deal gets you the 11th-generation iPad for just $274. This is not only one of the best Apple deals online, it’s also one of the best-reviewed iPads online, with a 4.8-star rating (out of five) from more than 10,000 reviewers online. Amazon says more than 10,000 verified shoppers have picked up this iPad in the last month alone. Choose from four colors online. See full sale details here.\n",

And now, it’s on. sale for an unbeatable $199 for Black Friday — a 43% discount and the lowest price we’ve seen.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBLACK FRIDAY DEAL\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShark FlexStyle\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tAt its core, the FlexStyle is a two-in-one high-speed dryer and multi-styler: the wand twists from drying mode to styling mode and works with multiple attachments, including auto-wrap curling barrels, an oval brush for volume, a paddle brush for smoothing, a concentrator nozzle and, in certain bundles, a diffuser for curls and coils. The temperature regulation technology is the major technical hook—it measures heat 1,000 times per second to avoid scorching, making it appealing to stylists and consumers who style frequently or have color-treated hair.\n\n\n\tThe FlexStyle’s most prominent industry endorsement comes from celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton, who joined Shark Beauty as a global ambassador. Appleton, known for high-profile clients like Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and Dua Lipa, has credited the device with giving everyday users access to “salon-quality styling for all hair types.” Other professional stylists in Shark’s Beauty Collective, including texture specialists and red-carpet pros, have echoed that sentiment, calling the FlexStyle a rare all-textures tool that works across fine, thick, curly and coily hair.\n\n\tThe device, which typically retails for $399, is now down to $199 on major retailer such as Sephora, Ulta Beauty and Amazon.

He caught Hollywood’s attention after “Milk & Serial,” a 62-minute horror feature he made for $800, garnered 2.1 million views.\n\t\n\n\tCoproduced by Barker and Tomlinson and directed and co-written by Chris Reinacher, “Fly Me to the Earth” leans into a “heightened comedic universe,” according to the filmmakers, and features an ensemble of comedy talent including Patrick Warburton (“Family Guy”), Alexis Knapp (“Pitch Perfect”), Efren Ramirez (“Napoleon Dynamite”), Ryan O’Flanagan (“American Vandal”), Chris Reinacher (“Superstore”) and Will Angus (“Friday Beers”).\n\n\n\tThe Silver Sail Entertainment production follows “a group of friends who believe the ultimate reboot for their lives lies far beyond the stratosphere,” according to the synopsis. “Determined to leave behind the ordinary, they scrape together everything they have for a one-way ticket to lunar living — only for their big cosmic dreams to collide hilariously with earthly complications.”\n\n\t“Buckle up,” actor-producer Tanner Beard (“Landman”) said in a statement, “Get ready to see Cooper, Curry and a ton of cameos from some talented and recognizable faces in this side-splitting story about friends saving up all their money to start a bigger, better, and exciting new life on the moon!”\n\t\n\n\tTomik Mansoori and Haley Johnson also produce. \n\n\t“Fly Me to the Earth” drops exclusively on the That’s a Bad Idea YouTube channel at 4 p.m. PT Friday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNamed for the late medieval Georgian monarchy that once stood proud on the same land, “The Kartli Kingdom” is a ruefully ironic nickname for less-than-royal lodgings: a derelict sanatorium in overgrown semi-rural grounds, overlooking the brighter lights of central Tbilisi in the distance. Once home to a state-of-the-art cardiology hospital that was shuttered in the early 1990s, its wards have since been occupied by hundreds of Georgians left homeless by the 1992 war in Abkhazia — now a devastated sovereign territory to which they cannot return. Over the last 30-odd years, what was intended to be a temporary shelter has become a long-term purgatory, and that eerily stretched stillness of time is poignantly captured in Tamar Kalandadze and Julien Pebrel‘s debut documentary.\n\t\n\n\tThe focus on families uprooted by the Abkhazian conflict makes “The Kartli Kingdom” a kind of documentary counterpart to Rusudan Glurjidze’s “House of Others,” a haunting semi-autobiographical drama that was a festival hit in 2016 — and with which Kalandadze and Pebrel’s film even shares a kind of gauzy, ghostly aesthetic. The joint director-cinematographers’ crepuscular, seemingly translucent images conjure an aptly liminal atmosphere for a study of lives lived in long-term limbo, though there’s neighborly humanity and humor amid the melancholy, as the Kingdom’s residents cultivate a strong sense of community in their crumbling surroundings. That balance of warmth and melancholy should carry “The Kartli Kingdom” far on the docfest circuit, following its premiere (and Best Director win) in IDFA.\n\t\n\n\tKalandadze and Pebrel maintain a silent, discreet presence in the apartments and corridors they’re filming, usually taking a fly-on-the-wall approach to scenes of everyday interaction, while their end of any direct interviews is kept out of the edit. Drifting between households, the film is marked by a sense of slowed time, and days merging into one another, almost imperceptibly building into lifetimes. One elderly resident remarks, in a tone of weary disbelief, that she’s been there, awaiting her next move, for 26 years: She recalls when the halls were still clean and carpeted, and even a crossover period when the space was occupied by refugees and heart patients alike. \n\n\tFor some, the wait is too long. Early on, we learn of one middle-aged resident who has jumped to his death from a balcony — “falling like a leaf with everyone watching,” in the words of one saddened but hardened neighbor. Others find comfort in family, companionship and domesticity, as we sit in on light-hearted conversations over coffee, and observe still-houseproud homemakers vacuuming their fading living rooms or preparing feasts in the kitchen. Home video footage of a boisterous wedding party defies the atmosphere of stasis and decay; a shot of several burly men awkwardly steering coffin down a tight stairwell plays back into it. Cats and dogs — some stray, some nurtured — slink around the place projecting their own air of ownership, all part of the Kingdom’s makeshift ecosystem.\n\n\tYet the community’s days there are numbered, and not because of any political progress or the emergence of a superior alternative. Negligence is rendering the old sanatorium unhabitable, bit by bit, as a widening foundational crack threatens to cleave the building in two. The authorities are slow to offer any aid or repair: The tone of proceedings may often be droll, but there’s a quiet fury in its portrayal of how these displaced people have been shunted out of sight and out of mind by a Georgian government not inclined to look back on the past.\n\n\tAnother collective move looms, then, likely to an even more temporary refuge than the one in which, improbably enough, multiple generations of children have been raised. One departing family, surveying the apartment they’ve just vacated, reflects on the things they’ll miss about it. “One day we’ll say, ‘If only I were still at Kartli,'” one says. The immediate rueful laughter that follows says everything: At once angry and elegiac, bitter and wistful, “The Kartli Kingdom” reflects on a sanctuary that became a prison for some, and the other way round for others.\n",

The source also said Taylor was confused why Blake later described her as her \"dragon,\" calling the characterization \"weird to say about a friend.\"\n      \n    \n          The source went on to say ... Justin was about to leave after the 2-hour meeting as Taylor walked in, and she was introduced to him for the first and only time. We're told all Taylor said to Justin was how excited she was to see the movie because he was her friend's boss.\n      \n    \n          The confrontation is now a key piece in the ongoing legal war surrounding \"It Ends With Us,\" where things between Lively and Baldoni have grown messier every week.\n      \n    \n          As you know, Blake is suing Justin for sexual harassment on set -- an allegation he strongly denies. The whole thing is headed to trial in March 2026.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

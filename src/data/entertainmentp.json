    "body": "\n\tThere are no better actors for making beautiful music together than Kate Hudson and Jeremy Allen White. Hudson stormed Hollywood at 20 as the hippie muse of Cameron Crowe’s “Almost Famous.” And this year, she delivers a career-best turn in “Song Sung Blue” as one-half of a Neil Diamond tribute band whose true story is as uplifting as it is heartbreaking. White, out of his chef ’s apron from “The Bear,” takes on the formidable task of portraying Bruce Springsteen at his most emotionally vulnerable and artistically free in “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” Here they talk tight denim, classic guitars and the rules of romantic comedy.  \n\t\n\tKate Hudson: Jeremy, I want to talk to you about wearing those Bruce Springsteen jeans.  Jeremy Allen White: Very snug. Hudson: Oh yeah. What did it feel like when you first put them on?  White: I felt like I had to stop eating. It was all really helpful – the boots, the jeans, the jackets. It was tight and really informed the physicality. It messed with my posture. Bruce also gave us clothing he wore as a young man, some of his actual pieces.  Hudson: Did you keep any of it?  White: No. I haven’t’ talked about this yet because it feels so precious, but he did give me his St. Christopher medal that he had for a very long time. And he gave me a guitar to learn to play, a 1955 Gibson J 200.  Hudson: That’s my favorite. I have the same guitar.  We both have music films this year, with some pretty iconic names.  White: Giants.  Hudson: I did not go deep into Neil Diamond’s catalogue until I did this movie. But Springsteen? White: Similar for me. I was really familiar with Bruce, like everybody, but I hadn’t heard “Nebraska.” Hudson: You didn’t? “Nebraska” was really personal one for me. \n\tWhite: That was the same for a lot of musicians I spoke to when I started prep. Many had that album in their top five.  Hudson: What did it feel like to take on Bruce’s most artistic album? White: From a technical standpoint I was in luck, because there were very few chords used on “Nebraska.” But also, in the sense that he’s so honest in all of his music. There’s so much specificity in his writing. The canvas of “Nebraska” is so rich with himself and his experience. It was like I had a map. Hudson: How involved was Bruce in this film?  White: Bruce gave the go-ahead for our director, Scott Cooper, to do this movie but was hands-off during the writing process. I got together with him first in London, at Wembley, I got invited to soundcheck. He brought me up on stage prior to everybody coming in. We spent a few weeks together and then he was on set all the time, which was not something that we knew going into it. Hudson: The pressure.  White: Yeah. I’ve gone back and forth about this a lot: I made all my [character] choices prior to showing up, and then I felt like I had to hang on tight once I got there. I find that I’m not super flexible when I’m on set, are you?  Hudson: On the day? I’m probably the opposite. I do a ton of work at the beginning, and I’ve learned that I have to let it all go and be available and flexible.  White: I should probably try that.  Hudson: I don’t know. You’re doing pretty good, Jeremy. Stick with what you’re doing. What you did in this movie was wonderful, as someone who has been writing songs my whole life. It made me emotional because the process of songwriting can be torturous. You internalized it all.  White: You’re so excellent in “Song Sung Blue.” You’re charismatic in everything you do, but there’s such a joy here. Even in the moments where it’s difficult to find, there’s always like some optimism within you. On the other end of the spectrum, I was so internal. My head is down and you’re this beaming light on set. Are you moving with that energy all the time? Hudson: I think in life, I choose to like tackle it with energy and optimism every day. I try to bring that to set. Maybe it has to do with how I grew up. I really like being in the circus. I’m not an actor that goes into a hole in my trailer. Even if I’m having a tough day, you become razor sharp in moments where you have to feel or channel something. White: Has your process changed a lot over time? Hudson: It changes for every job. When I was younger, I was incredibly spontaneous. I work well with people throwing shit at me. I also love comedy. That side of me likes to have fresh ideas all the time and not be too rehearsed. But as I started working with different actors I learned from and admire, you steal stuff. Do you do that?  White: I try to, yeah. \n\tHudson: I’ll never forget looking at Naomi Watts’ script [for “Le Divorce”]. I saw her notes and was like, “Well, I’m really underperforming.”  White: You should see Jeremy Strong’s script.  Hudson: You have to get that highlighter out. Figure out, “Who is this person to me?” But Naomi was so committed to her craft. I was like, “Let’s get wine and smoke cigarettes and party on location in Paris.” She’d sit at home and know her lines. White: But would you have done it differently? Or did you feel like that fed you in the way that you needed to finish? \n\tHudson: What I learned from Naomi is that it’s okay to take risks in your choices. I have a friend who worked with Cate Blanchett who had a similar experience.  White: I want to ask about your music, which is obviously a huge component of “Song Sung Blue,” but does music always play a part in a job for you? Hudson: Huge. Certain songs evoke certain emotions for me. I’m pretty good at accessing emotion, I’m not going to lie. I can cry all the time. But when I can’t get there, there are songs. Actually, “My Father’s House” from “Nebraska” is one of those songs.  White: That was my north star. If I was ever feeling lost or unstable, or I didn’t know what a certain scene was or where Bruce was at, that grounded me. When I recorded that song [for the film], it was the first time I felt really close to Bruce.  Hudson: Sometimes, I’ll get an earwig. If there’s a scene I’m doing that needs energy, I’ll ask for one and just have sound blasting.  White: That’s so nice.  Hudson: Try that one. Since you weren’t so knowledgeable about “Nebraska,” did you listen to the whole album through? On Spotify or ever on vinyl?  White: I listened to it on vinyl once. I was in Chicago. Scott told me to turn out the lights, lay down and let it go. This was before I even read the script. I’d met with Scott and spoke about working together, but he didn’t mention Springsteen at all. He told me to listen to the record before I got a script.  Hudson: What was the first song?  White: The title track is the first song, and it’s wonderful. I don’t want to sell any of the songs short. “Highway Patrolman,” the storytelling is so great. The last track stuck with me the longest. That’s “Reason to Believe.” I love singing that song the most. I see a real romance in that. Hudson: Did it make you want to write music?  White: No. Hudson: Come on.  White: No, not at all. If anything, it made me realize that the writing on that record is so good it was intimidating. I remember, in prep, writing his lyrics over and over again. Not for memorization, but for a shared experience [with the character].  Hudson: It’s so funny how life works. Just yesterday, I was with Cameron Crowe. He has this book out called “The Uncool,” and I went and did a Q&A with him. He was telling this story randomly, about David Bowie. He was interviewing Bowie once, and he kept talking about this artist, this young kid from Jersey who he though was going to be great. He loved his lyrics. How cool is it that we get to be connected to these amazing people in music and then portray certain things on screen?  White: Did you spend time with Claire Sardina?  Hudson: Not really. Our director Craig Brewer was precious about me not spending too much time with Claire. He wanted me to do my own thing and stick to the character as he wrote it.  White: It’s devastating. This is one of the movies where you go into your phone after and search, like, “Surely, this isn’t how this happened.” But at the core of it, it’s such a hopeful movie. You look at all this tragedy and then you are somehow inspired by the grit of these people.  Hudson: The power of escape and the joy of music. Our films are different but they’re stories about music saving people. In our film’s case, it was about a tip jar musician who didn’t get the opportunity to see stardom. They did it because they love it.  White: Because they had to do it. They’re not thinking about what they’re going to get back.  White: What about “Almost Famous”? That experience is not just a little connected to music.  Hudson:  I got the part when I was 19. It was a dream.  I had already started writing music at 18 years old, but to have someone like Cameron be this wellspring of musical information? It blew my mind, and it blew my life open. I have to ask, would you ever consider doing a rom-com?  White: I’d love to. I’ve never done one before but they seem so fun.  Hudson: They’re harder than you think. The rules are different. You want to make it for the people showing up to see it. They want something out of it, too. They want to feel, to laugh.  White: I worry about finding the right character, because I’d want it to be a classic rom-com. Not a flash in the pan, but “When Harry Met Sally.”  Hudson: One of the greats. It’s one of the hardest genres to get right. But it’s a game-changer for your life. You can’t imagine how many people you help feel good.\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t“Weekend Update” anchors Michael Che and Colin Jost brought their usual pop culture snark to “Saturday Night Live” on the Dec. 13 episode, and several topics have been of interest to Variety readers this week. He are some of the punchiest pop culture jokes.\n\t\n\t\tOn Trump’s recent Kennedy Center events:\t\n\n\t“Last week, President Trump hosted multiple events at the Kennedy Center, including an award ceremony for Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor and rock band KISS, as well as a musical performance by The Village People. Which raises the question: Is Donald Trump a gay man from 1978? Trump also said the proposed merger between Netflix and Warner Brothers Discovery could be a problem, adding, “bribe.” In response, Netflix is offering Trump one night with the ‘K-Pop Demon Hunters.'”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOn the Golden Globe nominations:\t\n\n\t“The Golden Globe nominations were announced, with the most nominations going to the movie ‘One Battle After Another,’ and the least nominations going to Michael Che’s ‘Hold Up, Medea Got a Daughter?'”\n\n\t\n\t\tFrom Jane Wickline’s song about the young “Stranger Things” cast, with interjections from Jost:\t\n\n\t“We’re programming monsters we will lose control of soon. They’re taking every job, and singularity is approaching. They may get smarter than us, will they be our doom? I think we all know the topic I am broaching. We don’t have much time to stop them, we must kill them while they’re still weak: The child actors from ‘Stranger Things.'”\n\n\tJost: “I really thought you were talking about AI.”\n\n\t“AI is just a distraction. The real threat here is Sadie Sink and her child co-stars on ‘Stranger Things.‘ ‘Stranger Things’ is ending. They’ll have so much free time. What if they grow self-aware? We need to keep them occupied. They can mobilize their followers, 60 million followers. We need to keep them occupied.”\n\t\n\n\tJost: “I just don’t understand what you think the danger is!”\n\n\t“The ‘Stranger Things’ kids use a cubic mile of water every minute. If there’s a hell, Gaten Matarazzo belongs in it. They’re crushing the environment and killing the economy. Finn Wolfhard’s the devil to me.The six of them are in a room right now, preparing to seize the next election. And for these reasons, I stand with Vecna.”\n\n\tJost: “Vecna! Jane, these kids are harmless. All they do is go on ‘Hot Ones.'”\n\n\t“Colin, things that start funny can get important. Joe Rogan used to make people eat bugs, and now he’s the President of the United States. Everyone’s focused on ‘Stranger Things,’ and they’re ignoring the stranger thing of the strangers on the internet, thinking those six strange kids are no danger, but they’re the devil. We’re estranged from the truth, but I have a plan. I’ll tie some cheese to a string, put a stick under a box big enough to catch six strange kids. I’ll be a hero. I will win an award. ‘You stopped the apocalypse,’ President Chatbot will beam at me. I have to scramble the brains of the six strange kids and make them join the cast of ‘All’s Fair.'”\n\n\tWatch part of this week’s Weekend Update below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tStar Dakota Johnson made a surprise appearance on “Saturday Night Live” this week, playing the mysterious “Madeline” during Lily Allen‘s performance of that track. The song was Allen’s second of the night. \n\n\tDuring the performance, Johnson was mostly hidden behind a screen through the song, as Allen sang about the mistress. But Johnson performed the spoken word portion of the song, which appears on Allen’s album “West End Girl.” In the track, Allen notes that she and her signficant other “had an arrangement: Be discreet and don’t be blatant. And there had to be payment. It had to be with strangers. But you’re not a stranger, Madeline.”\n\t\n\n\tLater in the song, “Madeline” explains her side of the story via texts to Allen: “I hate that you’re in so much pain right now. I really don’t wanna be the cause of any upset. He told me that you were aware this was going on and that he had your full consent. If he’s lying about that, then please let me know. Because I have my own feelings about dishonesty. Lies are not something that I wanna get caught up in. You can reach out to me any time, by the way. If you need any more details or you just need to vent or anything. Love and light, Madeline.”\n\n\n\tAfter reading those lines, Johnson came out from behind the curtain and walked up to Allen — and gave her a quick kiss.\n\n\n\t“Madeline” is one of the standout tracks from Allen’s new album “West End Girl,” and has led to much speculation over who the mysterious pseudonym is (or might be a composite of). At least one person has  told the press that she is “Madeline,” although Allen has said that it’s actually a composite of several women.\n\t\n\n\tFor her first “SNL” number, Allen performed “Sleepwalking” from “West End Girl,” in a bedroom set under a neon sign. Given the saucy lyrics, Allen did have to censor herself, omitting the lyric, “Why aren’t we fucking, baby?” (She did the same thing with “Madeline,” avoiding part of the line “I’m not convinced that he didn’t fuck you in our house.”)\n\n\n\tAllen appeared on “Saturday Night Live” to promote “West End Girl,” which has been met with wide acclaim for its brutal honesty and craftsmanship. The album addresses her split from “Stranger Things” star David Harbour, without ever mentioning him by name. (As characterized through scathing lyrics on songs such as “Pussy Palace,” “Sleepwalking” and “Madeline.”)\n\n\tIn his Variety review, Chris Willman called “West End Girl” a contender for album of the year. He wrote of “savoring every confessional line and wondering what the hell she was going to tell us in the next one to top it. It’s the pleasure of listening to a master storyteller who makes your jaw drop by seeming to have spilled all the tea almost at the outset, and then the tea just keeps on coming. Not since Boston in 1773, maybe, has anyone dumped it this massively, or this fulfillingly.”\n\n\t“West End Girl” repped Allen’s first album release since 2018. Allen has announced a tour next March to support the album, which marks Allen’s first time touring since 2019.\n\n\tThis is Allen’s second time on “Saturday Night Live,” following an appearance on the Feb. 3, 2007 episode hosted by Drew Barrymore. During that episode, Allen performed the tracks “Smile” and “LDN” from her debut album “Alright, Still.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney is experiencing the highs and lows the box office has to offer. On one hand, the studio’s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” returned to No. 1 in North America in its third weekend after sprinting past the $1 billion mark. On the other, the political dramedy “Ella McCay” cratered with $2.1 million in its domestic debut, suffering one of the worst opening in modern times for Disney.\n\n\tTo be fair, “Ella McCay” cost $35 million to produce, which is way less than Disney tends to spend on its theatrical releases. Most of the studio’s movies — including franchise fare from Marvel and Avatar, as well as family-friendly sensations like “Inside Out 2” and “Lilo & Stitch” — typically carry budgets above $200 million. Although “Ella McCay” isn’t in danger of turning a profit for Disney, the PG-13 misfire probably won’t cause heads to roll, either.\n\t\n\n\t“Ella McCay,” written and directed by “The Simpsons” co-creator and “As Good As It Gets” filmmaker James L. Brooks, landed behind already low projections of $4 million. It’s not exactly a mystery as to why ticket sales missed the mark. “Ella McCay” is the kind of mid-budget film that studios hardly make anymore because audiences don’t show up to see them. And this one — a comedic drama about a young politician (Emma Mackey) who unexpectedly becomes her state’s governor — was roundly rejected by critics (a 24% Rotten Tomatoes average) and moviegoers (a “B-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls). “Ella McCay” continues a miserable box office run for Brooks after 2004’s “Spanglish” ($55 million against an $80 million budget) and 2010’s “How Do You Know?” ($48 million against a $120 million budget). However the Oscar-winner could end his theatrical dry spell with Disney and 20th Century’s “The Simpsons Movie” in 2027.\n\t\n\n\t“James L. Brooks defined character storytelling in the ‘80s and ‘90s with a string of award-winning comedy dramas,” says analyst David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. “Today, you can find material like this on television and even on social media, where it benefits from authenticity.”\n\n\t“Zootopia 2,” after ceding the top spot to Universal and Blumhouse’s horror sequel “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,”  returned to first place with $26.3 million in its third weekend, a 39% decline from its prior outing. The family friendly adventure has grossed $259 million domestically and $1.13 billion globally to date to stand as just the second film this year to cross the coveted $1 billion mark.\n\n\t“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” slid to second place with $19.5 million, a brutal 70% drop from its scary-good $64 million debut. That’s rough, but not as bad as the original “Five Nights at Freddy’s” — which cratered by 76.2% in its second weekend while playing simultaneously on streaming. Still, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” cost just $36 million and registers as a win for Blumhouse, having already grossed $95 million and above $150 million globally. \n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” remained at No. 3 with $8.5 million in its fourth weekend of release, a 51% decline from its prior outing. So far, Universal’s big-budget musical has earned $312 million domestically and $450 million globally. “Wicked: For Good” appears to be running out of steam much faster than its predecessor, 2024’s “Wicked,” which powered to $474 million in North American and $758 million globally.\n\n\tA standout at the specialty box office includes Chloe Zhao’s “Hamnet” with $1.5 million from 749 venues. (That’s roughly $500,000 less than “Ella McCay” despite playing in a fraction of the amount of theaters.) So far “Hamnet, a well-reviewed tragedy starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal that follows the death of William Shakespeare’s son, has amassed $7 million to date.\n\n\tAfter this glum weekend, overall ticket sales sit at $8.1 billion, a mere 0.5% ahead of last year as well as 22.7% behind 2019, according to Comscore. Cinemas are about to get a major boost, though, from holiday offerings including James Cameron’s epic “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Paramount’s “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” and Lionsgate thriller “The Housemaid” on Dec. 19, as well as A24 Timothée Chalamet-led ping-pong adventure “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson, and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” with Jack Black and Paul Rudd on Christmas Day. Will these blockbuster-hopefuls manage to power the domestic box office past the $9 billion benchmark?\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring a Saturday-night town hall led by Bari Weiss, the recently named editor in chief of CBS News, most of Madison Avenue sought an off-ramp.\n\n\tThe program featured an in-depth interview with Erika Kirk, the CEO of the conservative advocacy organization Turning Point USA and the widow of Charlie Kirk, the group’s former leader. He was assassinated during one of the organization’s events at Utah Valley University, throwing a harsh spotlight on the political and cultural divides present in the U.S.\n\t\n\n\tThe event marked a new offering from CBS News. The organization does not typically host town halls or debates on trending issues or with newsmakers. And the choice of Weiss as moderator also raised eyebrows, because in most modern TV-news organizations, senior editorial executives remain off camera, rather than appearing in front of it.\n\n\n\tMore may be on the way. During the program, Weiss told viewers that “CBS is going to have many more conversations like this in the weeks and months ahead, so stay tuned. More town halls. More debates. More talking about the things that matter.” That would suggest CBS is planning to devote more hours to the programs. \n\n\tThe news special aired at 8 p.m. on Saturday, one of the least-watched hours in broadcast TV. And that may have contributed to a relative dearth of top advertisers appearing to support the show. During the hour, commercial breaks were largely filled with spots from direct-response advertisers, including the dietary supplement SuperBeets; the home-repair service HomeServe.com; and CarFax, a supplier of auto ownership data. Viewers of of the telecast on WCBS, CBS’ flagship station in New York, even saw a commercial for Chia Pet, the terra-cotta figure that sprouts plant life after a few weeks.\n\t\n\n\tDirect-response advertisers typically pay lower prices in exchange for allowing TV networks to put their commercials on air when convenience allows. A flurry of the ads appearing in one program usually offers a signal that the network could not line up more mainstream support for the content it chose to air.\n\n\tA more monied class of sponsors was evident during the first commercial break appearing in the 9 p.m. hour on CBS,  a rebroadcast of a 2024 episode of “48 Hours.” Marketers appearing included Amazon, Ferrero Group, and Procter & Gamble. One direct-response marketer, Operation Smile, a nonprofit medical service organization, also appeared.\n\n\tCBS News’ ability to line up sponsorship for the town hall may be critical, especially if the network plans to air more hours tied to the new format. And yet, if advertisers weren’t interested in the first program of this sort, will they want to associate with subsequent efforts?\n\n\tOther marketers who lined up for CBS News’ Erika Kirk town hall included companies whose products and services may have dovetailed with the viewers who tuned in to see the show. Among the town hall’s sponsors were the conservative Heritage Foundation; Hallow, a mobile app for Christian prayer; “David,” a new animated film from Angel Studios, which specializes in faith-based content; and the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews. A small handful of more mainstream advertisers, including Spotify and TikTok, was also present.\n\n\tCBS’ interest in such fare goes against the grain. TV news has become a hot potato of sorts on Madison Avenue in recent years, with marketers wary of putting their commercials in programming tied to reports on war, cultural divides, and strong-voiced monologues from partisan opinion hosts. One outlet, Fox Corp.’s Fox News, has bucked the trend in recent months, luring new advertisers to its shows as it builds a sizable live audience around its news and opinion shows.  \n\n\tAt issue, according to media buyers and TV-sales executives, At issue, is the continuing polarization of U.S. society, and the backlash advertisers can get when consumers perceive their desire to pitch products to news audiences as support for a conservative or liberal point of view. Marketers are also nervous about having their glitzy commercials placed adjacent to segments on war in Ukraine, a growing spate of mass shootings, climate change, and debates on cultural values.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Weeknd and Lyric Capital Group have closed a deal forming a business venture together wherein Lyric has invested in the artist’s music catalog from inception through 2025, reps for the artist confirm to Variety. The deal sees the Weeknd — real name: Abel Tesfaye — and his team maintaining creative control over the catalog and remaining shareholders and owners in the company.\n\n\tThe rep notes that the joint venture is not a conventional catalog sale: “From the beginning of the meeting, it was clear to all at Lyric that Abel would not sell his catalog. He wanted to be more innovative and creative in the way we established a partnership. To that end, through this venture, we constructed and launched a new business model with Abel and his iconic catalog whereby Abel and his team have the freedom to execute their creative vision with the entirety of his rights, both publishing and masters. This unique catalog deal sets a new standard for artist equity and control.”\n\t\n\n\tThe venture applies only toward the Weeknd’s music masters and publishing through 2025 and does not include any future releases. The Weeknd continues his partnership with XO/Republic/Universal Music Group; his publishing catalog has been and continues to be administered by Universal Music Publishing Group.\n\n\tThe rep added that because the deal is not a conventional catalog purchase it is impossible to calculate a royalty multiple. However, Variety sources and reports in Billboard and Bloomberg earlier this year stated that the assets were going for at least $1 billion based on about $55 million in net label and net publisher share, which implies an 18.2 times multiple. \n\t\n\n\tReps for the Weeknd and Lyric declined to confirm any numbers to Variety, but if accurate, it is one of the biggest deals involving a single artist’s catalog in history, let alone for a contemporary artist — the only larger publicly acknowledged single-artist deal was Sony Music’s acquisition last year of the Queen catalog, valued at $1.27 billion.     \n\n\tWith more than 120 million monthly listeners on Spotify alone, the Weeknd is one of the world’s most popular recording artists. His ongoing “After Hours ‘Til Dawn” tour recently passed the $1 billion mark, setting a record for a solo male artist. \n\n\t“There is no ABS or securitization deal here,” the rep continued. “Lyric created a first-of-its-kind structure with direct input from Abel and his team, which includes a first-of-its-kind ‘Royalty Backed Note’ — produced by Lyric, ft. Partners Group — that drastically enhances the artist-friendly theme that underpins this partnership.”\n\n\t“I couldn’t be more excited about what Lyric, Abel and team have created together,” said Ross Cameron, Lyric founding / co-managing partner. “From our first meeting, it was clear to me that we were sitting around the table with individuals that were going to change the way an artist thinks about his assets, music and legacy. The collaboration resulted in a first-of-its-kind partnership between an artist and Lyric, and we are beyond thrilled about this new venture.”\n\n\t“Lyric strives to create artist-friendly structures and we believe this partnership demonstrates that at the highest level with the top artist in the world. I want to thank Abel and his team for putting their trust in Lyric,” says Rich Garzia, Lyric co-managing partner.\n\n\tHalf of the Weeknd’s publishing rights were already owned by Chord Music Partners, backed by Universal Music Group and Dundee Partners.\n\n\tLyric Capital invests in music royalties and also owns Spirit Music Group, which controls catalogs from Tim McGraw, Jason Aldean, Ingrid Michaelson and others.\n\n\tVariety will have more on this news as it develops. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” opened this week’s episode with Donald Trump commenting on the battle to buy Warner Bros. Discovery — by asking why anyone would even want to buy the studio: “They’ve got one of the worst studio lot tours in LA,” he groused. “You go on that thing, and it’s just some kid pointing to a tree. ‘Oh, that’s the tree from “Pretty Little Liars.” Who gives a crap.”\n\n\t“Trump,” played as usual by James Austin Johnson, was answering press questions on Air Force One — much to the chagrin of press secretary Karoline Leavitt (Ashley Padilla).\n\t\n\n\t“It’s your favorite president hiding behind my curtain — Behind the curtain, something I enjoyed doing at Miss Teen USA in 1997,” Johnson’s Trump said. “You know, this is exciting. Tonight, I took both an Ambien and an Adderall, so we’re going to see which one wins.\n\n\n\t“How great is Karoline Leavitt,” he then said, turning to Padilla as the press secretary. “We love her. Oh, she’s got a beautiful face and those lips that don’t quit. It’s pretty amazing that I can just openly simp over my young blonde subordinate. It’s giving Michigan football coach. Can we get a close-up? People need to see this. Look at those lips. They go like a machine gun. She liked it because I’m very nice to women.”\n\n\tHe then turned to “CNN’s Kaitlan Collins”: “Yes, you have a question, you nasty, horrible witch.” (The real Collins, of course, was called “stupid and nasty” by Trump for asking about his plans for the White House ballroom.)\n\n\tAsked by a reporter whether he’d continue to carry out strikes on Venezuela in the Caribbean, Trump pointed to how he’s not just targeting drug boats anymore. “We’re targeting suspected drug planes as well. In fact, we have some declassified video from a strike I can show you now. We have that clip.”\n\t\n\n\tCut to a black and white video of Santa and his reindeer being bombed. “Is that Santa?” asked the shocked reporter. Answered Trump: “Not anymore!”\n\n\tAnd then Trump was asked about the latest batch of Jeffrey Epstein photos released by House Democrats. “Look, the fact is, these photos are fake news. A Democrat hoax,” he said. Responded the reporter: “Even the picture of a bowl of condoms with your face on them, and the text saying ‘I’m huge’?”\n\n\tSaid Trump: “They’re 100% legit. I love those files. I’m in the files! I took a lot of great pictures.”\n\n\tJosh O’Connor is the host of the Dec. 13 episode, with Lily Allen as the musical guest. This reps the first ever “SNL” hosting appearance for O’Connor, the Emmy-winning “The Crown” star who is promoting his appearance in the Netflix film “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.”\n\n\tAs for Allen, this reps her first musical appearance on “SNL” since Feb. 3, 2007, when she performed during an episode hosted by Drew Barrymore. This marks the first time both the “SNL” host and musical guest both hailed from the U.K. since Eric Idle and Kate Bush in 1978.\n\n\tThis reps the eighth episode of “SNL” this season. Previous hosts have included Bad Bunny (Oct. 4), Amy Poehler (Oct. 11), Sabrina Carpenter (Oct. 18), Miles Teller (Nov. 1), Nikki Glaser (Nov. 8), Glen Powell (Nov. 15) and Melissa McCarthy (Dec. 6). Coming up is Ariana Grande (Dec. 20).\n\n\tAnd previous musical guests this season have been Doja Cat (Oct. 4), Role Model (Oct. 11), Sabrina Carpenter (Oct. 18), Brandi Carlile (Nov. 1), sombr (Nov. 8), Olivia Dean (Nov. 15) and Dijon (Dec. 6). Coming up is Cher (Dec. 20).\n\n\tWatch the cold open below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHow we wish we were there … back in 1975, that is, and able to again listen to Pink Floyd‘s magnum opus “Wish You Were Here” as a fresh work for the very first time, as opposed to hearing it through 50 years of hindsight. [Insert “mind blown” hand gesture here.] But the hindsight’s not bad, either, especially if it means we’re alive and kicking a half-century later, and most especially when it can result in an experience as enhanced as the 50th anniversary boxed set commemorating the classic, with everything from previously unreleased demos and live tracks to Dolby Atmos mixes sweetening the deal.\n\t\n\n\tNick Mason can claim bragging rights as the only member of Pink Floyd to appear on every one of the band’s albums, from 1967’s “Piper at the Gates of Dawn” — when Syd Barrett was the ostensible band leader, before he soon exited and David Gilmour entered the picture — on through to the group’s protracted final act, after Roger Waters‘ departure, with Gilmour as sole frontman. So the drummer had a full measure of the shock when Barrett showed up at the studio during the “WYWH” sessions after years of being MIA with mental illness. Barrett was in no shape and probably had no desire to participate in those sessions, even as a cameo player, but in a way, he is a star of the album nonetheless, as the record came a little bit closer to having a throughline once parts of it started being written about him.\n\n\n\tMason spoke with Variety about his memories of Barrett showing up at those sessions, and of the album’s tortured beginnings as a “Dark Side of the Moon” follow-up that ended up being a little less experimental than first intended. (As in: they finally abandoned the idea of making it without using any musical instruments at all.) Read on for a Q&A exploring his thoughts about why he thinks the album ended up being such an eternal fan favorite in spite of (and/or because of) being an “antidote” to Floyd’s more conceptually tight outings.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Wish You Were Here’ boxed set cover\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSony Legacy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYou’re probably not always in a retrospective mood and looking back and being nostalgic, but does having this “Wish You Were Here” set out allow you a chance to feel proud of the anniversary, as a commemoration of something that obviously people have been very attached to for 50 years?\n\n\tIt’s perhaps a little bit surprising, how much people are enjoying going back 50 years. But when you reach my age, you spend a lot of time thinking about the past rather than planning much of a future. Oh, that sounds too grim!\n\n\tWhere the album sit in your thoughts among the whole catalog after all these years? There are a lot of people who feel this is their favorite Pink Floyd album.\n\n\tYes. It’s a curious one, really, because it’s not the biggest seller, but it seems to have lasted particularly well. And I think it’s almost an antidote to things like “Dark Side” and “The Wall,” which are very organized. This feels a lot more like a bit of a wander. And particularly if you’re listening to music, that works particularly well.\n\n\tDid you say “a wander”?\n\n\tThat’s right, a wander.\n\n\tI like that. In thinking about reasons why it might seem like the quintessential Pink Floyd album to some people, even though ultimately there are only four songs — at least if you count “Shine On You Crazy Diamond” as one song — it covers a large gamut of what people think of even from different eras of Pink Floyd. There are a couple of kind of angry songs of Roger’s (“Welcome to the Machine,” “Have a Cigar”), and then a couple of the songs are very sad or wistful. And then there are the long instrumental passages that people associate with the earlier Pink Floyd, more than the latter-day. So there’s a lot of trademark stuff packed in there, given how really compact the song list is.\n\n\tYeah, and I think also there’s perhaps a little bit more of a recognition for Rick [Wright, the group’s late keyboard player]. Because one’s always sort of hooked up with (thinking about) Roger and Dave arguing about things or whatever. But actually, there’s never quite enough credit to be shared around with successful projects. And I think sometimes Rick gets a bit sort of pushed out. Not pushed out — just not recognized, for what he contributed.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPink Floyd\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStorm Thorgerson / courtesy Sony\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s certainly a wonderful showcase for what he brought to the group. Since you mentioned that this was “a bit of a wander,” do you think that there was a conscious decision not to make this a concept album per se?\n\n\tYeah, I think there was a feeling that when you have a successful album, that the next one… can we do it again? I don’t think that would’ve been a good way forward. So I think there was very much a feeling of let’s not make something quite so structured. Because, yeah, there’s a lot of structure in “Dark Side.” And actually what’s nice about this record is just the amount of atmosphere around it… air around it.\n\n\tPeople have tried to apply a theme to it, whether there’s one there or not. And the word “absence” has popped up…\n\n\tMm-hmm.\n\n\t…in Roger  talking about it, and how he feels that was reflected in the different elements of cover art as well. But for those of us who, as young people, sat there and pondered every bit of this, it was like: Well, is there kind of a thematic connection unifying the album — a connection between the stuff having to do with the record industry and cynicism over that, and then the stuff about Syd Barrett representing an innocence that maybe stands in stark contrast to the music buisness stuff? Maybe it’s too much of a stretch of imagination to connect those two things, as a conceptual force on the album, but fans do make those stretches.\n\n\tI think Syd was much more a driving force than the sort of bit about the record company. I think that was a sort of one-off, if you like — whereas I think the whole element of Syd appearing in the studio and so on was far more of a catalyst to make this record.\n\n\tThere’s that chicken-or-the-egg question of whether Syd appearing in the studio influenced the album ending up being more about him, or whether that was already written to a large extent, and then writing about him kind of mysteriously manifested him showing up unexpectedly as a vistor in the studio.\n\n\tI think the arrival of Syd in the studio was a major part of what then transpired. I don’t think there was much of a theme to the record until the Syd visit, and that really gave a bit more clarity or a bit more direction, particularly with Roger’s lyrics. But not only that, I think also the way the various elements on the record worked out were very much part of songs that could have been about moving on from a relationship to being about Syd.\n\t\n\n\tI’m wondering what recollections you have of Syd’s studio visit,. At the time, as long as it had been and as shocking as it apparently was, you’re probably still not thinking, “Oh, this is the last time I’ll ever see this person.”\n\n\tThere are a couple of things from my point of view, one of which was that when Syd actually arrived, I was putting a drum track down in the studio, and it was when I went back into the control room that I saw, for me, a stranger standing there. I didn’t recognize him at all. It actually took David to say, “You know, that’s Syd,” and that was fairly shocking, really —  unsettling, I think, is the word. The others, I think, had seen more of him in the last few years, but I hadn’t seen him for probably five years.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSyd Barrett visits the recording studio during Pink Floyd’s ‘Wish You Were Here’ sessions, photographed by Nick Mason\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNick Mason\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe packaging includes a kind of portrait photo that we’re now seeing that you took of Syd during that visit in the studio.\n\n\tYeah, that’s right. But there are some other pictures of Syd that were taken, I think, by Dave’s guitar tech, Phil. Because I always assumed he only came down one day, but I think that’s because I wasn’t there on the second day. And so it was this rather strange thing of everyone having a slightly different version of what he’d said or what he was doing. But I don’t think there were any sort of words of wisdom from him. It was a very, very disjointed visit. I have no idea how he knew we were in there. There was no forewarning.\n\n\tIt’s clear that there could be no sort of a happy ending to that relationship with Syd, given the seriousness of his issues. But is there some gratitude, at least, that there was able to be some closure just by having material that was about him before you moved on any further?\n\n\tPossibly. I think we dealt with or looked after Syd very poorly, but we really didn’t know any better. I mean, when Sid left the band in ‘68, we were still thinking that if we took a day off, that maybe he’d recover. I mean, the naivete… Now, people are far, far wiser, but it’s extraordinary to look back and realize how little we knew or were able to do for him.\n\n\tAs a bonus for the new boxed set, “Shine on You Crazy Diamond” has been reconfigured into a single, continuous track, rather than being broken up to open and close the album. Everyone knows that initially, it was not conceived to be in two parts. Do you think it was purely sort of LP side issues that caused the splitting of that, or…\n\t\n\n\tThe trouble is, as with a few things, I simply don’t remember. I don’t remember how we’d got to that point. But I think there probably was a sort of reference to “Dark Side” and trying to make things work in a different way and have a different feel to the whole record. And it was quite a battle… not a battle, but it was something to keep reminding ourselves about, because there was always that little bit of pressure to sort of look at “Dark Side” and see if we could do it again, and I think we were determined not to find ourselves caught up in that.\n\n\n\n\n\tDo you care about the Dolby Atmos and any of those sorts of things that are part of the new set?\n\n\tOh, yes. I actually really love that thing of taking something and polishing it up. But I’m constantly amazed at how good recording (technology) was 50 years ago at Abbey Road. It’s great when the things have sort of been tidied up a little more and a little bit more definition brought to the sound. But it’s a long time ago to have records played that still sound fresh. And credit to the technical side of it all, particularly to the people who recorded it originally.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Mason of Pink Floyd\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTracey Kraft\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJust to talk about your drumming on the album a little bit… I’ve seen interviews where David talks about, on “Shine On,” you switching between a 12/8 shuffle to a swing beat and back again, which impressed him enough to bring up many decades later… One would imagine some thought or discussion went into something like that. Or did it just come naturally just based on the material?\n\n\tAbsolutely. I’ve never really been very good at learning things properly. It’s one of those things where you just sort of… I think it’s actually a sort of Ringo thing. You just get to feeling what works. And one of the nicest things is that I think most of the time, we rarely had to tell each other what to do. Most of the time, whatever we did worked really well for the record. That was true of sort of most of Pink Floyd’s recordings, certainly up to “The Wall,” where maybe there was a bit more production with those. But in the earlier things it was much more a case of: Just play it.\n\n\tSo there were no moments of everyone in the studio going, “What if we go out of 12/8 into something more straightforward for a few bars?”\n\t\n\n\tIf anyone had said something like that, I’d have collapsed, I think.\n\n\tWere there points in time at which your retrospective opinion about the album changed? In past interviews you’ve suggested that maybe it took you a while to warm up to the album again and have a more positive take on it, because you had it stuck in your mind how difficult it was to just get it started.\n\n\tYes. I think that had a bearing on it, compared to really the ease of “Dark Side,” where it all began to click together quite early on. You have to remember that we tried this other project called “The Household Objects,” which had wasted a couple of months. I have no idea how long it was, actually. It felt like about a year, but it probably was a month of what amounted to messing about with this “Household Objects” idea of making music not using instruments. It was about using sort of stroked glasses, or, I think, as an alternative to a bass drum was the idea of an ax hacking into a wooden log or a tree stump. It took away quite a lot of enthusiasm, that project, that then had to be rekindled, really, for “Wish You Were Here.”\n\n\tSo, no regrets on your part that the band never went any further with “Household Objects”?\n\n\tNone at all. I think the one good thing was the relief of leaving it. In the last few months, a number of people have actually put together an album as a sort of tribute to “Household Objects.” But of course, it’s much easier to do that sort of thing now because all the electronics can more or less make any sound into a musical instrument.\n\n\tThere are so many formats this newly reissued material is in…\n\n\tThe fashions change, in what people want to listen to… I mean, the most remarkable thing is the CD, which was transforming the music industry and the whole business of how we listen to things. And that’s now been pushed to one side. Everyone’s gone back to vinyl, because it’s that slightly softer quality… it’s gentler on the ear. But the CD is still remarkable in terms of sound quality.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Wish You Were Here’ boxed set contents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSony Legacy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDo you have a favorite format yourself at this point? If you were going to buy the set, would you prefer the vinyl or the Blu-ray or the CD or listen to the Atmos?\n\n\tI think I’d go for the vinyl. I still like the sort of Japanese tea ceremony of putting the disc on the turntable.\n\t\n\n\tDo you remember much about the packaging decisions? I can remember buying the album the day it came out and being conflicted about ruining the opaque sleeve it came in by tearing it open, but of course you had to. But the real treasures from Hipgnosis were within.\n\n\tYeah, with Hipgnosis, it was their finest hour, because they managed to more or less get away with doing about six different album sleeves, and making them all work. It’s a fantastic selection of things. Storm was wonderfully argumentative about it. The finest thing at Storm’s memorial was when someone saiid, “He’s a man who wouldn’t take yes for an answer,” which was such a good summary of of him. The record company, I think, lived in fear of Storm, because he did all these wonderful sleeves and then said, “And we’ll shrinkwrap it in black vinyl.” Finally, he allowed them to put some small sticker on the outside of the shrink-wrap. But, yeah, it was remarkable. I think the record companies were suffering as well because the Grateful Dead had released a record and the boardroom asked what the title of the album was, to be told that it was “Skull Fuck.” I think after that, everyone sort of retreated to a dark room.\n\n\tThe “Wish You Were Here” artwork is the apotheosis of Hipgnosis using photography that has surrealism taking place in broad daylight. That combination of something that’s very bizarre, but that is actually taking place in a real life setting, seemed reflective of Pink Floyd somehow in a way.\n\n\tI think it probably is, as well for me, the best album cover of any of the work that Hipgnosis did for us, and as you say, you can unpack it and look at it again and again. I like the diver with no ripples, still [with a diver holding his breath doing a handstand in Lake Mead]. We didn’t have Photoshop then, so everything was done for real, including, of course, the burning man. I know that they got to the point where it was suggested they do another take and he just said, “No. That’s it.”\n\n\tYou’ve said that one of your regrets is that the band didn’t do a proper tour behind “Dark Side” and for your mind went too quickly into trying to do “Wish You Were Here.”\n\n\tWell, it would’ve been nice to have had a record of it. The “Pink Floyd at Pompeii” film is terrific because it absolutely shows what we were doing then, and it would’ve been great to have had a definitive version of “Dark Side” (live) to do the same thing a year or two years later. It would just have been easier for us to have spent a bit more time touring with “Dark Side” and a bit less time than on “Household Objects” or anything else.\n\t\n\n\tMoving toward the present, we were so glad to see the “Saucerful of Secrets” tour that you did a few years back, touring the early, pre-“Dark Side” material with a great group of musicians. Are there any plans to do more with that in the future?\n\n\tNot at the moment. I mean, I’d love to do some more. But there is a point at which you don’t really feel like doing all the traveling so much. And I loved doing it. It was sort of a little bit of having the childhood I never had, in terms of actually doing it in a tour bus… You know, we (Pink Floyd) rather quickly went from the back of a transit van to the charter jet. I missed out on a whole bunch of stuff, which this was a good way of catching up with quite quickly.\n\n\tSo you don’t know if there’ll be more, but it was satisfying to have done it, for a few years?\n\n\tYeah, absolutely. I really loved it. And if there’s an appetite to people who’d like to see it, yeah, I think we’d fire it up and go out again.\n\n\tSurely there are more 50th anniversary commemorations to come after this, whether official or just celebrated by fans. Of course, “Animals” already got a remix and a reissue just a few years ago. But do you think there’ll be a similar sort of boxed-set project around that when the 50th comes around in a couple years?\n\n\tI’m not sure. I don’t know how much there is to get from “Animals.” We’ll probably just have to wait for “The Wall.”\n\n\tTo ask about the catalog sale… Obviously it means something financially, but does it mean anything personally to you to sort of have divested yourself of that? We talked with David earlier this year, and he said what a relief it was for him to not have to worry about band meetings anymore, which had been a source of tension for him. I always got the feeling that you got along pretty well with both Roger and David. So maybe you did not approach band meetings — such as they are, anymore — with the same sense of trepidation that maybe they did.\n\n\tOh, so far I think it was absolutely the right move to sell the catalog. I think there were too many arguments that were not in any way constructive. And in fact, so far, it has worked really well. The reissues of “Wish You Were Here” and “Dark Side” both worked really well. And you know, we’re getting to the age where we really are thinking: Well, so what happens long-term to the catalog? And I think the record company’s probably the right place to leave things for future generations to be able to access them.\n\t\n\n\tThe songs have not been exploited very much over the years for movies or certainly advertising or anything like that. Do you think that’s OK at this point, if new owners wants to make more use of those?\n\n\tI’m not sure how much of our catalog is really well-suited to advertising. I think it’ll probably still continue to pop up in movies. But I think if you’re looking at advertising, you’re probably going to go and get numbers from Queen to do that.\n\n\tAs far as your relations with Roger and David, you said in an interview earlier in the year you had caught up with Roger in Barbados because you were both there. And you’ve never seemed like you would be the especially argumentative type. So it is safe to say you’re still on friendly terms with everyone?\n\n\tYeah, yeah, yeah. Well, there’s only three of us left now, so… Yeah, I’m still really fond of both of them, actually.\n\n\tYou had a long gap before the “Saucerful of Secrets” touring where you weren’t out playing a lot or anything, and you enjoyed getting back into it, but are you enjoying your life without being out doing music at the moment? The tour bus was maybe a one-and-done experience for you. Are you enjoying a quiet life these days?\n\n\tYeah, basically, just getting older, but there’s still quite a lot of things I still like doing, and I’ve still got a collection of cars that I run, and I’m planning to continue doing that.\n\n\tWe did want to ask about the cars…\n\n\tYeah. I think I’m getting to the point where probably my children are gonna do more of the driving and I’m gonna do less.\n\n\tHave you had your fill of partaking in whatever you’re partaking in with this boxed set?\n\n\tWell, it might be a case of going to listen to some of the Atmos elements. I’m still interested in what it sounds like and what one can add to these pretty elderly recordings.\n\n\tThank you for this — a lot of fans will be pleased to hear from the horse’s mouth about something that’s meant so much to us.\n\n\tThe horse is having a bit of a memory problem, I think, these days, but able to dredge up some bits and pieces.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNicki Minaj went after California Governor Gavin Newsom in a series of X posts on Friday, targeting a quote from the presidential hopeful in which he supports trans youth.\n\n\tDuring a recent appearance on The Ezra Klein Show, Newsom said, “I want to see trans kids… There’s no governor that’s done more pro-trans legislation than I have. No one has been a stronger advocate for the LGBT community.” The quote has recently circulated online, with some using it to disparage Newsom’s image as a potential presidential candidate.\n\t\n\n\tMinaj wrote on X Friday, “Imagine being the guy running on wanting to see trans kids. Haha. Not even a trans ADULT would run on that. Normal adults wake up & think they want to see HEALTHY, SAFE, HAPPY kids. Not Gav. The Gav Nots. GavOUT. Send in the next guy, I’m bored.”\n\n\n\tShe added minutes later, “Gavin is the cute boy who got everything handed to him b/c of how cute & sexy & hot & smoking he was. Oohhh look @‘m. Sitting there in that suit with the sneakers on. He thinks he’s Tom Cruise only difference is, his next mission IS impossible. He should get another leading role.” The 12-time Grammy nominee has nonstop berated Newsom on X throughout Friday and Saturday, usually accompanying her posts with a picture of the Chucky doll from “Child’s Play.”\n\n\tWhile not outright confirmed, many consider Newsom the frontrunner to become the Democratic presidential nominee come 2028. He recently told CBS Sunday Morning that he has “no idea” if he will run for president or not.\n\n\t“The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary,” he said. “Who the hell knows? I’m looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. That’s the question for the American people.”\n\t\n\n\tMinaj clearly doesn’t like his chances. In yet another post on X early Friday, she wrote, “Get on the nearest jet ski & let that beautiful hair blow in the wind. It will make you happier than this race that you will not win. Enjoy life. Peace.”\n",

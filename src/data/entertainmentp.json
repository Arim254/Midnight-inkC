    "body": "\n\tScopely will launch a collaboration between its mobile game “Monopoly Go!” and the Warner Bros. Discovery-owned Harry Potter film franchise on Dec. 10, bringing characters, collectables, mini-games and more from the Wizarding World to an original and enchanting Monopoly adventure.\n\n\tPer the description for the in-game Harry Potter event: “When Mr. Monopoly goes through the portal to platform nine-and-three-quarters, he is transported to the Wizarding World, where the board becomes a landscape of familiar Harry Potter settings such as Gringotts Wizarding Bank, the Forbidden Forest and, of course, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\t\n\n\t“Along the way, he will encounter familiar faces, including Harry Potter himself as well as Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Rubeus Hagrid. The cast of characters expands with a new sticker album, featuring 23 sets of characters and creatures from the franchise. Each set tells a story and some include surprise easter eggs from the books and films.”\n\n\n\tAdditional features for the limited-time in-game update include racing mini-games aboard Quidditch broomsticks and Gringotts carts, hidden collectable artifacts like the Sorcerer’s Stone and unlockable themed tokens, emojis, dice and shields so players can proudly display their Hogwarts houses. Seasonal maps like the Hogwarts Castle, Diagon Alley and a holiday-themed Hogsmeade Village will also be available.\n\n\t“In bringing the world of Harry Potter into ‘Monopoly Go!,’ our incredible team at Scopely set out to create something truly magical for our players,” Scopely’s president of games Victor Diaz-Roig said. “We wanted fans to feel the excitement of stepping into Hogwarts and wandering Diagon Alley, all while enjoying the playful twists and social fun that make ‘Monopoly Go!’ so special. Every detail was crafted to deliver a new kind of adventure in a way that feels unmistakably Harry Potter and undeniably ‘Monopoly Go!’”\n\t\n\n\tThe collaboration comes as Warner Bros. Discovery is ramping up promotion for its new “Harry Potter” series on HBO. The upcoming show is a retelling of the seven books by J.K. Rowling, which Warner Bros. initially adapted into eight films between 2001 and 2011. The new HBO series stars Dominic McLaughlin as the titular Boy Who Lived alongside a thorough ensemble cast of new and veteran actors. It is currently filming its first season in the U.K. and is expected to release in 2027.\n\n\tThe Harry Potter-themed edition of “Monopoly Go!” will be available Dec. 10 through Feb 4. as a free download on iOS and Android.\n\n\tWatch the trailer for the new update below.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe second round of offers for all or part of Warner Bros. Discovery are in from Paramount Skydance, Netflix and Comcast. And the new, higher offer ",
    "body": "\n\tThe second round of offers for all or part of Warner Bros. Discovery are in from Paramount Skydance, Netflix and Comcast. And the new, higher offer for all of WBD from David Ellison’s Paramount is backed in part by the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, sources tell Variety.\n\n\tThe dollar amounts of the higher bids submitted Dec. 1 from Paramount Skydance (which wants to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery) or from Netflix and Comcast (which want only the Warner Bros. studios and streaming business, and not WBD’s linear TV assets) could not be learned. Paramount’s latest all-cash offer is still mostly backed by the Ellison family (that is, Oracle co-founder and billionaire Larry Ellison) and includes financing from RedBird Capital, Apollo Global Management and others. \n\t\n\n\tIn addition, the latest Paramount Skydance offer for all of WBD includes funding from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Variety confirmed. Bloomberg News previously reported that Paramount’s latest offer included the involvement of unspecified “Middle East funds.”\n\n\n\tSources familiar with the situation said the level of involvement of the three Arab wealth funds with Paramount’s latest offer does not meet the threshold to require approval by CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is the U.S. government’s interagency body that reviews foreign investments in U.S. businesses potential national security risks.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Netflix’s higher second-round bid for Warner Bros., comprising HBO Max and the WB studios operations, was mostly cash, according to reports from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. Comcast also entered a bid for Warner Bros., per the Journal. Netflix has told WBD that if its bid is successful, the streamer would honor Warner Bros.’s deals to distribute films in theaters — despite Netflix’s historical opposition to theatrical releases — and to continue producing TV and movies for non-Netflix partners.\n\t\n\n\tReps for Paramount Skydance and Netflix declined to comment. Warner Bros. Discovery and Comcast reps did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\tVariety last month reported that Paramount Skydance was assembling a bid for WBD with the backing of the three Middle Eastern wealth funds. But the Paramount nonbinding bid of $24/share for all of Warner Bros. Discovery that Paramount Skydance submitted Nov. 20 did not involve the three Arab wealth funds, sources clarified.\n\n\tDavid Ellison had been scheduled to appear at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Dec. 3. However, with the bidding process for Warner Bros. Discovery in play, Ellison is now not expected to appear, although that could change, according to a source familiar with the situation.\n\n\tWhat’s next? The Warner Bros. Discovery board committee formally vetting the M&A offers will now decide whether to go forward with one of the bidders and engage in a period of exclusive negotiations with that party, or whether to solicit additional proposals. WBD has been aiming to complete the process by the end of 2025. \n\n\tThe M&A review kicked off in earnest last month, when Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it had received in-bound acquisition interest from multiple parties. The company said it will consider proposals in which the Warner Bros. business (HBO Max and studios) is sold separately from Discovery Global, the TV-centric company, which aligns with Warner Bros. Discovery’s already-underway plan to split into two companies by April 2026.\n\n\tParamount Skydance chairman and CEO David Ellison previously submitted three bids for WBD but the Warner Bros. Discovery board rejected his previous highest offer of $23.50/share, comprising 80% cash and 20% stock. In his previous bids, Ellison had proposed offering WBD chief David Zaslav a co-chairman and co-CEO role in a merged Paramount Skydance-WBD; it’s not known if that’s still on the table in Paramount’s latest offer.\n\n\tIt’s possible the board of Warner Bros. Discovery will decide to reject the M&A offers and stick to the company’s previous plan of splitting itself into two pieces: Warner Bros., led by Zaslav as CEO; and Discovery Global, headed by current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNicholas Hoult and Daisy Edgar-Jones are teaming up with “The Great” and “Poor Things” scribe Tony McNamara for a new Disney+ comedy series titled “Mosquito.”\n\n\tDescribed as a “sardonic look at a young couple’s relationship,” the British stars play Kate and Ed, a “recently married couple whose secrets begin to reveal as daily life chips away at the personas they present… all started by an intrusive mosquito,” according to the show’s synopsis. Filming is set to begin next year.\n\t\n\n\tA Hulu original series from the U.K., “Mosquito” marks a reunion for Hoult and McNamara’s after the success of “The Great,” which ran for three seasons on the streamer. “I’m thrilled and excited to work with and team up two of the best actors around,” McNamara said in a statement. “I can’t wait to go make absurd comedy with them.”\n\n\n\tEric Schrier, president of Disney Television Studios and global original television strategy at The Walt Disney Company, and Angela Jain, head of content at Disney+ EMEA, added: “Tony is one of the most talented writers working in film and television today, with a legacy of incredible success at Disney. He has an unmatched ability to bring fascinating and complex stories to life weaving sharply written, intricate dialogue with signature dark humor and complexity. Partnering with him on ‘Mosquito’ is an incredible step forward for our local original content and reinforces our ambitions in the U.K.”\n\n\t“Mosquito” is produced by 20th Television, Piggy Ate Roast Beef Productions and Hustle & Punch and is executive produced by McNamara, Hoult, Edgar-Jones, Marian Macgowan, Tracy Underwood and Daniel Pipski. The series was commissioned for Disney+ by Lee Mason, executive director of scripted at The Walt Disney Company EMEA. The show will stream on Disney+ and Hulu globally.\n\t\n\n\tDeadline Hollywood was first to report the news.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe end is near for “Stranger Things.” Netflix has confirmed the theater locations that will screen the series finale. \n\n\tPer the streamer, the finale of the global hit series will screen in over 500 theaters across the U.S. and Canada starting Dec. 31 at 5 p.m. PT and run through Jan. 1, 2026. Netflix has also officially confirmed the finale’s runtime at 2 hours and 5 minutes. \n\n\tThe full list of participating theater locations can be found at www.st5finale.com, which also contains instructions on how to RSVP. Tickets will not be sold for the screenings, but rather exhibitors will sell concession vouchers that will guarantee fans a seat at a screening. Thus, the theater owners will keep the revenue from the screenings. Netflix’s owned-theaters are not selling tickets or concession vouchers, but fans can sign up via the RSVP list. \n\t\n\n\tThe news that the series finale would screen in theaters was first announced in October, after the Duffer brothers had expressed their desire to see that happen in a cover story interview with Variety. Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria had originally said that was not going to happen, but changed course after fans expressed a very strong desire to see the finale on the big screen. \n\n\n\tWhile Netflix has put select movies into theaters over the years, this will be the first time they are doing so without recouping any box office returns. \n\n\tThe first four episodes of “Stranger Things” Season 5 is now available. The next three episodes will drop on Dec. 25, with the finale dropping on Netflix and in theaters on Dec. 31.  \n\t\n\n\t“Stranger Things” is one of the most popular Netflix shows of all time. As the streamer previously announced, all four previous seasons re-entered the Top 10 list prior to the launch of Season 5, marking the first time a series had four previous seasons on the list at the same time. \n",

Together with manager Jorge Juarez, Sommer intends to grow León’s business and presence in territories beyond his current base.\n\n\tA five-time Grammy award and Latin Grammy award winner, León is a touring powerhouse. He is the first Latin artist ever to play Coachella and Stagecoach in the same year. He is also the first Latin artist to play the Sphere, with a run of seven appearances set for next year.\n\t\n\n\tJuarez added, “Carín has tremendous potential to expand into other global territories. We are looking to WME to lead the way in all areas of their expertise.” \n\n\n\tLeón took home a Latin Grammy award at this month’s ceremony in Las Vegas for “Palabra De To’s (Seca)” which was named best contemporary Mexican music album. “Palabra De To’s (Seca)” is also up for a 2026 Grammy Award for best música mexicana album.\n\n\t“Carín is a generational artist,” said Sommer. “In his incredible career, he has consistently broken barriers and transcended genres. We are determined to bring the full weight of WME to bear to expand Carín’s fanbase around the world and we are honored to work with both Carín and Jorge.”\n\n\tOriginally from Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, León embarked on his musical journey at the age of 15.

    "body": "\n\tSabrina Carpenter slammed Donald Trump‘s White House for using her hit song “Juno” in a video montage depicting ICE raids. The Grammy responded to the video on X with the following takedown: “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”\n\n\tThe White House has made a habit out of using pop songs from anti-Trump singers in videos praising Trump or celebrating ICE on social media. The latest video takes the most viral lyric from Carpenter’s “Juno” (when the singer asks about sex positions: “Have you ever tried this one?”) and layers it over people being handcuffed, tackled and more by ICE agents. \n\t\n\n\tPrior to The White House co-opting Carpenter’s music for its ICE agenda, it did the same with her friend and collaborator Taylor Swift. A video that dropped in November used Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia” in a montage celebrating Trump despite the U.S. president’s frequent social media posts bashing Swift. The pop star did not comment on the video.\n\n\n\tKenny Loggins made headlines in October for bashing The White House’s use of his hit song “Danger Zone” in a video that depicted Trump flying over No Kings protestors and dropping poop all over them.\n\n\t“This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone.’ Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately,” Loggins said in a statement shared with Variety at the time. “I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together.”\n\t\n\n\tBritish pop singer Jess Glynne was more blunt over the summer when The White House used the “Hold My Hand” Jet2holidays viral meme to promote ICE raids. She posted on social media: “This post honestly makes me sick. My music is about love, unity, and spreading positivity — never about division or hate.”\n\n\tCheck out Carpenter’s post below.\n\nthis video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.— Sabrina Carpenter (@SabrinaAnnLynn) December 2, 2025\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe itinerant Spanish Screenings on Tour will make a splash Dec. 4 returning to Buenos Aires’ Ventana Sur, Latin America’s most important mart-meet. \n\n\tProving in the past a significant promotion platform for Spanish movies, Spanish Screenings on Tour, the 4th edition, organised by the Málaga Film Festival, is also a succinct exposition in its panel subjects of many of the drivers these days of international business: New talent, theatrical success, sales, co-production and IP.\n\t\n\n\tThe morning of Dec. 4 is kicked off by the winners of the Malaga Festival’s Hack Malaga which features next gen content creators presenting innovative visions, using the latest audiovisual technologies.\n\n\n\tThis is followed by presentations of clips from 2026 lineups from Spain’s most prominent movie sales companies: Latido Films, Filmax, Film Factory, Bendita Film Sales, Sideral, Begin Again Films and Cinema Republic.\n\n\tFocusing on creating films which not only attracts soft-money finance but also returns, including from box office, an early afternoon session will see producer María Luisa Gutiérrez of Bowfinger Intl. Pictures, one of the most successful production companies in Spain founded by Gutiérrez and wildly popular actor-producer-director Santiago Segura, will discuss the “Bowfinger Method” with Variety International Features Editor John Hopewell. \n\n\tBowfinger has catalog of 40-plus titles, including its“Torrente” and “Father There is Only One” hit franchises, but also other titles not powered by Segura as a talent, such as 2024 breakout ETA infiltrator thriller “Undercover,” directed by Arantxa Echevarría, which has scored an extraordinary €9.6 million ($11.2 million), making it the second-highest Spanish release of 2024. “Undercover” is also hailed as the biggest hit ever directed by a Spanish woman.     \n\t\n\n\tGutiérrez and Agustín Bossi at Buenos Aires’ Pampa Films, behind “Chinese Takeaway” (2011) and in TV, “Monzón” and “The Boss,” both with Disney, will then drill down on case studies of Argentina-Spain co-production hits, which include the highest-grossing local movies in both Argentina – “Homo sapiens!” – and Mexico: “Mesa de Regalos,” both involving Pampa The producers will also discuss what co-production brings to the table. \n\n\tTwo workshops held concurrently aim to delve into the issues of IP protection, one led by director-writer-lawyer Francisco Menéndez (“Stealing Las Vegas”), and the other on strategic IP development, moderated by producer Sydney Borjas (“Red Queen”). Each workshop will dissect five case studies, Menéndez focusing on IP protection and Borjas on IP development.\n\n\tSpanish Screenings on Tour is backed by the Malaga Film Festival and the Spanish government’s Institute of Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts as well as ICEX Spain Trade and Investment and the European Union’s NextGenerationEU.  \n\n\tThe Spanish Screenings will climax with the announcement of projects at the Malaga Festival’s 2026 Málaga Fund & Co-Production Event (MAFF). Focusing on titles from Latin America, Spain and Portugal, MAFF, now gearing up for its 9th edition, has proved one of the centerpiece industry events at Málaga. Handling the presentation are Camilo Vázquez, deputy director general for international promotion and international Relations at Spain’s ICAA, Ventana Sur Executive Director Ralph Haiek and Málaga Festival Director Juan Antonio Vigar.\n\n\tCo-organized by Cannes Marché du Film – Cannes Film Festival, Argentina’s INCAA film-TV agency and its Uruguayan counterpart, ACAU, Ventana Sur runs Dec.1-5.  It was held in Montevideo, Uruguay last year as part of a plan to alternate venues between the two cities.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVariety has announced the final eight honorees for its ninth annual Hitmakers celebration. Spanning a wide range of musical genres and experience, all recipients are being recognized for their breakthrough success over the past year. In no particular order, they are:  Megan Moroney — Storyteller of the Year Rosé — Global Hitmaker of the Year Addison Rae, Elvira Anderfjärd, Luka Kloser — The Future Is Female Award BigXThaPlug — Hip-Hop Disruptor of the Year Role Model — Triple Threat of the Year Fuerza Regida — Humanitarians of the YearBig Loud: Seth England, Joey Moi, Craig Wiseman — Platinum Decade Award Elliot Grainge — Executive of the Year  The above honorees will join previously announced Hitmaker of the Year Sabrina Carpenter, and previously announced honorees Tate McRae, Buddy Guy, Alex Warren, the Marías; EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI (the singing voices of HUNTR/X); Sounwave, Mustard and Jack Antonoff; Republic Records and Riot Games. Presenters at the event include 2024 Hitmakers honoree Laufey, “Sinners” co-star Miles Caton, comedian Jake Shane, multiplatinum producer-songwriters Jimmy Jam and Benny Blanco, and more.   “We’re honored to highlight some of the artists and executives who have made the biggest impact over the past year,” said Variety’s executive music editor Jem Aswad.  “Megan Moroney for her storytelling on her stellar album “Am I Okay?”; Rosé for her smash album and single with Bruno Mars, “APT.”; BigXThaPlug for his groundbreaking hip-hop/country fusion; and Role Model for his achievements in music and film — they are among the major breakthrough artists of 2025. So is Addison Rae, who is being recognized, along with collaborators Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser, with The Future Is Female Award for breaking the glass ceiling by writing, producing and performing her Grammy-nominated debut album entirely themselves.  “We are also honored to recognize Los Angeles quartet Fuerza Regida not only for their music but for their humanitarian efforts, which include immigration reform, L.A. wildfire relief, scholarships, Latino community service and more.  “Finally, we tip our collective Stetson to Big Loud for their decade of blockbuster success with Morgan Wallen, Ernest, Hardy and many others; and Atlantic Music Group CEO Elliot Grainge for the company’s success in his remarkable first year in the job — which includes fellow Hitmakers 2025 honorees Marías, Rosé, and Alex Warren.”  The honorees will also be recognized in the accompanying website and magazine looking back on the year in music and acknowledging the writers, producers, publishers, managers and executives who helped make — and break — the 25 most-consumed songs of the year, as measured by Billboard and Luminate Charts.   Hitmakers culminates with an invitation-only brunch held on Saturday, December 6, in Los Angeles.  This year’s event sponsors include Premier Partner TikTok, who will celebrate the communities and trends that helped make the year’s top 25 songs achieve their hit status with a custom video installation. Additionally, TikTok is the presenting partner of two pre-Hitmakers episodes of Variety’s “Behind the Song” series featuring Madison Beer’s “bittersweet” and Sombr’s “Back to Friends” as well as Sabrina Carpenter’s inaugural episode of the new video series “Variety’s Tour Diaries” (out Dec. 3).  Riot Games is a Premier Partner of the event, and Global Head of Music Maria Egan will accept the Hitmakers Interactive Music in Media Award. Premier Partner Cash App will sponsor a photo booth for guests to take home a snapshot from the event. Eternal Water will be the Official Water Partner and L-Acoustics will be the Official Audio Technology Partner. Dos Equis is the Official Beer Partner of the event. Johnnie Walker Black Label will be an Official Partner, providing signature cocktails including the Go Go Highball. Amazon Music, Atlantic Records, Avex Music, Columbia Records, The Recording Industry Association of America, Sony Music Nashville, Sony Music Publishing, SoundExchange, Spotify, Universal Music Group, Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner Music Group are all supporting partners.",

    "body": "\n\tJack Alldridge has been cast in the lead role of Hulu‘s “Foster Dade” pilot, Variety has learned. \n\n\tAlldridge will appear alongside previously announced cast members Chloe East, Matt Bomer and Cameron Mann in the pilot, which is based on the Nash Jenkins novel “Foster Dade Explores the Cosmos.” It was originally picked up to pilot at Hulu in August. \n\n\tThe logline for the project describes it as “a sophisticated mystery set at an East Coast boarding school that explores privilege, scandal, sexuality, and masculinity amid the rise of social media, millennial anxiety and pharmaceuticals.” \n\t\n\n\tThe character of Foster Dade is described as “a lonely, anxious, ferocious reader who self-medicates and blogs at his psychologist’s insistence. Possessed of a depth of soul he doesn’t yet know what to do with, he aches to be liked, to fall in love, to be known in a way his fractured home life never allowed. He has no idea that his hunger for reinvention will place him at the center of the greatest scandal the school has ever seen and that his name will be whispered by Kennedy students for decades to come.”\n\n\tAlldridge is a recent graduate of the Guildford School of Acting. He most recently appeared in the Netflix series “Death by Lightning” and appeared in the John Lewis Christmas commercial 2025. Up next, he will be seen in Season 15 of the popular drama “Call the Midwife” and in the BritBox/ITV1 series “The Lady.” Both shows will release in 2026. \n\n\tHe is repped by Hatch, Anonymous Content and CAA. \n\n\t“Foster Dade” is being written and executive produced by Greg Berlanti and Bash Doran. Sarah Schechter and Leigh London Redman of Berlanti Productions also executive produce along with Donald De Line of De Line Pictures, Robbie Rogers, and Jenkins. Daniel Minahan will direct the pilot. Warner Bros. Television, where Berlanti is under an overall deal, is the studio.\n\t\n\n\t”We knew the titular character of Foster Dade would be the heart and soul of this show,” said Berlanti, Schechter, and Doran in a joint statement. “We needed an actor that could embody the full range of emotion and toe the line between hero and anti-hero. After a worldwide search and seeing thousands of talented young actors we were lucky enough to find Jack Alldridge. Fresh out of drama school, Jack is an extraordinary talent. He has a bright future ahead and we are lucky to be a part of it.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe home of “The Walking Dead” and the TV adaptations of Anne Rice’s Immortal Universe is about to become the U.S. destination for viewing TNA Wrestling.\n\n\tAMC Networks and TNA Wrestling announced Tuesday they have set a multi-year agreement to bring TNA’s flagship weekly television show, “Thursday Night iMPACT!,” to AMC.\n\n\tBeginning Jan. 15 with a live show taped at the Curtis Culwell Center in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, AMC will feature “Thursday Night iMPACT!” as a two-hour block every Thursday from 9-11 p.m. ET. The program will also be available on AMC Networks’ streamer AMC+.\n\t\n\n\tTickets for the Jan. 15 show will go on sale Dec. 11 at 10 a.m. ET at tnawrestling.com. The ticket pre-sale will begin Dec. 9 at 10 a.m. ET.\n\n\n\tLater in January, TNA Wrestling will host shows in Albuquerque, New Mexico (in a nod to AMC’s “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul”) on Jan. 22-23, 2026. Tickets for both Albuquerque shows, which will air on AMC, at Tingley Coliseum will also go on sale on Dec. 11.\n\n\t“TNA’s impressive growth and success is driven by the stories, characters and non-stop action fans love,” AMC Networks chief content officer and president of AMC Studios Dan McDermott said. “We put fans at the center of everything we do, and TNA has built its brand and its programming around that same dedication and focus. What a great opportunity to come together and make Thursday Night iMPACT! a dynamic and entertaining weekly event on AMC and AMC+ starting next month.”\n\n\tTNA Wrestling president Carlos Silva added: “We are super excited to bring the in-ring excitement, energy and drama of TNA Wrestling to AMC. TNA Wrestling heads into 2026 the hottest it has ever been – with intense rivalries and a fan base that loves the TNA stars. We cannot wait to expand the TNA audience with our new partner, AMC Networks, which has such a long and storied history of serving passionate and engaged fans across so many shows and franchises, through this new media rights deal.”\n\t\n\n\tFounded in 2002, TNA Wrestling is a subsidiary of Anthem Sports & Entertainment. TNA Wrestling has been the pro wrestling home for such industry legends as Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Sting, AJ Styles, Kurt Angle, Mick Foley, Kevin Nash and Mickie James, among others. The 2025-26 TNA roster features Jeff & Matt Hardy, Nic & Ryan Nemeth, TNA World Champion Frankie Kazarian, Mike Santana, Steve Maclin, Eddie Edwards, Brian Myers, Santino Marella, Mustafa Ali, Moose, Elijah, Eric Young, Tessa Blanchard, Ash By Elegance, and others.\n\n\tWatch the promo for TNA Wrestling’s “Thursday Night Impact” ahead of its move to AMC in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

This comes just months after he beat stage 3 non-Hodgkin Lymphoma -- a cancer of the blood.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          He told host Craig Melvin the 2 illnesses have nothing to do with each other.\n      \n\n          Check out the video ... Dave details a routine PET scan in October that revealed the new condition. \"I said to the doctors, ‘Well, did this happen because of the lymphoma?’ And they said, ‘Totally unrelated.’\"\n      \n    \n          Thankfully, Dave said the prognosis is good ... \"It has a 90-plus curability rate. But the thing that has really saved my life is that early detection -- saved my life, not just the first time, but the second time as well. So I hope you’re getting your check-ups.\"\n      \n    \n          Dave has also dealt with cancer from the perspective of a concerned family member.

    "body": "\n\tMarkice Moore will lead the cast of “High Rollers,” a high-stakes thriller.\n\n\tAzur-De, Jadah Blue, Jason Mitchell and Michael Rubenstone join Moore rounding out the supporting cast. Salvatore Sclafani will direct from a screenplay co-written by Manny Halley and Manny Halley Jr., who also produce. \n\n\tThe picture is from  Manny Halley Productions, a division of Imani Media Group. The film follows Antoine (Moore), who idolizes his father, a charismatic gambler. When his father is murdered and Antoine discovers he was merely a small-time hustler, Antoine becomes desperate to prove the legend was real. He borrows dangerous money and heads to Las Vegas, where an improbable winning streak brings money, attention and validation. But as his bankroll grows, so do the stakes.\n\t\n\n\t“High Rollers is a gripping story of ambition, obsession and the pursuit of fortune,” Halley said in a statement. “Antoine’s journey through loss, betrayal and deception draws audiences into a suspenseful, unpredictable world full of twists.”\n\n\n\tMoore broke out in “ATL” before starring in Netflix’s “Point Blank.” His television credits include “Snowfall,” “BMF,” “The Walking Dead” and BET Plus’ “Legacy.” He also produces through his company Both Sides of the Camera, with credits including “Spaghetti” and “Get Close 1 & 2.”\n\n\tMitchell is known for “Straight Outta Compton,” the Oscar-nominated “Mudbound” and Showtime’s “The Chi.” Azur-De appeared in BET Plus’ “Imani” and Fox’s “Call Me Kat,” while Blue rose to prominence on BET Plus’ “Angel.”\n\n\tImani Media Group recently produced “Aftershock: The Nicole P. Bell Story” nationwide in November 2025.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOlympic skier Lindsey Vonn‘s highly anticipated comeback may be over before it begins.\n\n\tThe 41-year-old ski legend crashed during her final World Cup downhill race Friday in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, just one week before the Feb. 6 start of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. Vonn lost control landing a jump and became entangled in safety nets, receiving medical attention for five minutes before gingerly skiing to the finish line, visibly favoring her left knee.\n\t\n\n\tThe race was canceled following Vonn’s accident due to poor visibility. She was airlifted by helicopter to receive further medical evaluation, leaving her Olympic participation uncertain.\n\n\n\t“I know she hurt her knee, I talked to her,” International Ski and Snowboard Federation CEO Urs Lehmann told ESPN. “I don’t know if it’s really heavy and [if] she won’t miss the Olympics.”\n\n\tVonn’s return from retirement has been one of the marquee storylines for the U.S. Olympic team heading into the Games. She joins fellow American Mikaela Shiffrin as the headliners for the U.S. alpine skiing squad. Vonn’s potential absence could also significantly impact Olympic coverage by network broadcasters who had featured her comeback narrative prominently in promotional coverage.\n\n\tThe skiing legend initially retired in 2019 after persistent knee injuries but announced her return in 2024, undergoing a partial knee replacement to extend her career. She ranks second all-time in World Cup victories with 84 wins, trailing only fellow American Shiffrin’s record 108.\n\n\t“This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics…but if there’s one thing I know how to do, it’s a combeback,” she wrote on Instagram.\n\t\n\n\n\tVonn won Olympic gold in downhill and bronze in super-G at the 2010 Vancouver Games, adding another bronze at Pyeongchang 2018. She also captured four overall World Cup titles and eight world championship medals during her decorated career.\n\n\tThe 2026 Milan Cortina Games run through Feb. 22.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpotify returned for Grammy Week last night at Los Angeles’ Lot at Formosa to celebrate the eight nominees for best new artist, featuring performances from Olivia Dean, Leon Thomas, Katseye, Addison Rae, Sombr, Lola Young, Alex Warren and the Marías.\n\n\tThe streamer’s annual party, which was called off last year due to the Los Angeles fires, is a hot-ticket event each Grammy year, welcoming roughly 1,500 industry attendees for a night of music and mingling. This year was no exception, drawing Diplo, John Summit, Zara Larsson, Teddy Swims, Yungblud, Ravyn Lenae, Noah Kahan, Willow Smith, Benson Boone and many more.\n\t\n\n\tBut the true focus of the evening was the performances, where this year’s class took turns giving three-to-four song sets on a rotating stage. Thomas kick-started the night with “Yes It Is” and his nominated song “Mutt,” shredding on an electric guitar, before Young gave one of the most impassioned and show-stopping performances of the night. During her 15-minute set, she explained that it was her first performance since September, when she collapsed on stage at All Things Go Festival and subsequently canceled all subsequent events. “I’m feeling better,” she told the crowd, giving powerful renditions of “Sad Sob Story! :)” and “D£aler.” (Those hoping for her breakout hit “Messy” had to readjust expectations, as she left it out.)\n\n\n\tElsewhere, the Marías ran through dreamy tunes including “No One Noticed” and “Back to Me,” while Katseye kicked up the volume with “Gnarly.” Alex Warren sang to the back of the room for “Ordinary” and Sombr embraced his inner rock star with “Back to Friends,” passing the mic to his “12 to 12” music video star Rae for a performance that included “Diet Pepsi” and “High Fashion.”\n\t\n\n\tBut Dean, who is widely forecasted to be a frontrunner for best new artist, stole the show with her closing performance of “Man I Need” and “So Easy (To Fall in Love).” It was a cap on a night that gave an extended taste of what to expect at this Sunday’s event, when all eight artists will join back together to perform a medley during the telecast.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHBO has renewed its late-night comedy series “It’s Florida, Man” for a third season, the network announced Friday.\n\n\tThe show, produced by Rough House Pictures — the team behind “Eastbound & Down” and “The Righteous Gemstones” — transforms Florida news stories into comedic sketches featuring rotating casts of actors and comedians. Real Floridians share their firsthand accounts of viral incidents, which are then recreated with irreverent humor.\n\t\n\n\t“Season three is just more proof that Florida remains undefeated,” said Nina Rosenstein, executive vice president of HBO Programming, Late Night & Specials. “There’s no shortage of wild-but-true stories and an incredible cast of actors game enough to bring them to life.”\n\n\n\tExecutive producer Danny McBride praised the state’s endless material. “Every time we think the stories can’t get any wilder, Florida proves us wrong,” he said.\n\n\tThe series’ second season featured guest stars including Adam DeVine, Tiffany Haddish, Haley Joel Osment, Bert Kreischer, Johnny Knoxville, Taika Waititi and Rita Ora, among others.\n\n\tCreated and executive produced by Mark Herwick for Range Studios and Jeff Tomsic, who also directs, the show offers what producers call “a love letter to the beaches, backwaters and basements of a misunderstood yet magical state.”\n\n\tThe first two seasons are currently streaming on HBO Max. \n",

    "description": "\n\tWagner Moura shares his disappointment that, despite his film “The Secret Agent” receiving four Oscar nominations, including his historic best actor",
    "body": "\n\tWagner Moura shares his disappointment that, despite his film “The Secret Agent” receiving four Oscar nominations, including his historic best actor nomination, his writer-director Kleber Mendonça Filho is not an official Academy Award nominee.\n\n\tWhile Neon’s “The Secret Agent” landed four Oscar noms, including best international feature, its writer-director, Kleber Mendonça Filho, is not technically an Oscar nominee under current Academy rules, which award the category to the submitting country rather than the individual filmmakers (even though their names are engraved on the Oscar statuette). It’s a long-standing rule that is in desperate need of updating, and Moura agrees.\n\t\n\n\t“I think his screenplay is brilliant,” Moura says during the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast. “The script for ‘The Secret Agent’ is one of the best things that I have read. Kleber is the reason why this movie is successful.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Secret Agent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of NEON\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMoura’s admiration for Mendonça Filho dates back more than a decade. “When I saw his first feature film, ‘Neighboring Sounds,’ I was like, I have to work with this dude,” he says. “It’s deeply grounded in the Brazilian tradition of political films, but it’s so unique.”\n\n\tThat lineage connects directly to Moura’s cinematic DNA, which is also shaped as much by Italian cinema as by Brazilian movements like Cinema Novo. “I love Italian neorealism,” he shares. “Films like ‘Rome, Open City’ or ‘Rocco and His Brothers.’ The way they shot working-class people, often with nonprofessional actors, had a big influence on how Brazilians make films.”\n\t\n\n\tThose influences carry forward into Moura’s next chapter behind the camera. He is preparing to direct and star in an adaptation of Stewart O’Nan’s novel “Last Night at the Lobster,” a contained drama set entirely inside a chain restaurant during the week before Christmas, as employees face layoffs. The cast includes Sofía Carson, Brian Tyree Henry and Elizabeth Moss, and will be produced by Peter Saraf, known for supporting actor-directors such as Philip Seymour Hoffman (“Jack Goes Boating”).\n\n\tA lifelong football enthusiast, Moura reflected on soccer’s deep connection to Brazilian identity and politics. He roots for Vitória, an underdog team from his hometown of Salvador. “It’s crazy how it can ruin my day when my team doesn’t win,” he admits. “The feeling of being in the stadium, rooting for your team, and when we win and when we score, the connection that we have with other people that you don’t know — it’s just fantastic.”\n\n\tHowever, Brazil’s national team has become politically fraught. “The far right appropriated them. They’re wearing the Brazilian Jersey in all their manifestations. And I’m like, I’m never going to wear that thing again,” Moura says, though he acknowledges the World Cup still unites the country.\n\n\tThat emotional connection extends to his children, particularly as he thinks about legacy. Fatherhood has sharpened his sense of values more than any accolade. “I would love it if they could see me as someone who kept myself truthful to the things that I think are right, even if that was bad for me or for my career.”\n\n\tFor his three sons, Moura hopes to model values. “I want my kids to think of me as someone who kept myself truthful to the things that I think are right, even if that would be bad for me or for my career,” he says. \n\n\tHe wants them to see him as “someone who did what I love” and encourages them to pursue their own passions with similar dedication.\n\n\tDespite the whirlwind of awards season, Moura maintains perspective. “I’ve been doing this since I was 15, so I know what’s real and what’s not. This is an amazing moment of my life as an actor, and I’m very grateful and happy. But this is not real life.”\n\n\tThe 98th Academy Awards ceremony takes place on March 2, where Moura will compete against Timothée Chalamet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ethan Hawke and Michael B. Jordan.\n\t\n\n\tAlso on this episode, “The Secret Agent” star Wagner Moura. The roundtable discuss the BAFTA nominations and the new Television Academy category, Outstanding Variety Series.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\t“Melania” is a documentary that never comes to life. It’s a “portrait” of the First Lady of the United States, but it’s so orchestrated and airbrushed and stage-managed that it barely rises to the level of a shameless infomercial. Is it cheesy? At moments, but mostly it’s inert. It feels like it’s been stitched together out of the most innocuous outtakes from a reality show. There’s no drama to it. It should have been called “Day of the Living Tradwife.”\n\t\n\n\tThe movie was shot, by director Brett Ratner and a trio of prestige cinematographers, over the course of the 20 days leading up to (and including) the 2025 Presidential Inauguration of Donald Trump. And to the extent that it allows Melania Trump a whisper of personality or agency, it’s as a designer. She helps to tweak the design of her own outfits. She has chosen the color of the inaugural invitation envelopes (a lovely shade of scarlet). She offers design tips about the plates and flowers and glassware. And, during the first Trump presidency, she helped to redesign sections of the White House.\n\n\tAll of this plays out, in “Melania,” as if she’s planning her wedding. The movie opens to the strains of the Rolling Stones’ “Gimme Shelter,” which makes it sound like the film is going to strike an attitude of defense against those who have been mean to Melania. But no, “Melania” is so studiously celebratory, like a piece of state-sanctioned propaganda out of 1960s Communist China, that it never even wades into those controversial waters.\n\n\n\tThe movie plunks us down at Mar-a-Lago, where Melania struts out the door and into the back of an SUV, which will take her to the red-and-white blue private plane painted with the word TRUMP that’s waiting for her at the airport. Wherever she lands, she’s in a mobile bubble, jetting from the palace of Palm Beach to Trump Tower in New York, where she meets for a fashion fitting in what looks like a dining room of the Titanic designed by Liberace, then to St. Patrick’s Cathedral right down the block (where she attends an anniversary mass for her mother) and on to the renovated 19th-century charm of Blair House in Washington, D.C., then back to Trump Tower and back to the Capital.  \n\t\n\n\tMelania came out of Slovenia as a teenage fashion model, but she was always less Brooke Shields than Nico, and now, at 55, in her Terminator sunglasses and thick mascara eyelashes and omnipresent four-inch pumps (she wears them in every scene, even when she’s just relaxing on the couch), she still has that frozen-for-the-camera hauteur, as well as the thick accent that blankets everything she says, giving it all the same emotional neutrality. “Can we do the lapel a little bit beeger?” she asks her designer, Hervé Pierre, and he, like everyone else in the room, reacts with a grin of jovial agreement, as if Marie Antoinette had just asked for a piece of cake. The movie is stitched together by Melania narrating her life in voice-over, most of it along the lines of “This is my last flight as a private citizen, before stepping back into my public life” or “The people I like have to share my vee-sion.”\n\n\tOn the surface, the movie seems purged of politics, even though Donald Trump is in it plenty, mostly during the inauguration scenes that take up the second half. He walks from event to event holding hands with Melania, who knows just how to comport herself — as America’s First Arm Candy. She and her husband have been together long enough now that they have matching scowls, and matching frozen robot grins.\n\n\tYet the politics is there, a touch ominously, in the very absence of politics, in how studiously upbeat and controlled the movie is. Made for an outrageously high budget ($40 million, plus $35 million spent on marketing), with a director who’d effectively been canceled over accusations of sexual abuse and was in no position to do anything but what he was told (that is, to be directed), the film, in its junk-streaming prefab-day-in-the-life reality-show way, mirrors the control of the Trump administration. Its very existence is a pure expression of that control. By the time “Melania” arrives at the Inaugural festivities, the film has given itself over to a series of rituals (the candlelight dinner, the Inaugural itself, the luncheon, the Starlight Ball), which feels weirdly fitting since the filmmaking itself is so ritualized. It never lets the air of experience in. And that should tell you something. “Melania,” like the Trump regime, is a designed-from-the-top-down reality show that’s devoted to shutting reality out.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAbout midway through the documentary “Melania,” a piece of imagemaking whose interest comes only occasionally and accidentally, the film seems to acknowledge the oddity of its own making. First Lady-to-be Melania Trump, in the days before her husband’s 2025 inauguration, has inked a deal to appear in the very film the audience is watching; her aides are fielding inquiries from a journalist about the potential ethical issues this deal raises. One of the two soon-to-be East Wing workers laughs; the inquiry is destined to go unanswered.\n\t\n\n\tPerhaps it just goes without saying. Whatever benefit the Trump administration is to gain from the message of “Melania,” such as it is, playing out on cineplex scenes nationwide seems minuscule compared to the material gain: Amazon paid a reported $40 million fee to Melania’s production company, and has invested some $35 million more in promoting the film. Before the logo for Muse Films, Melania’s company, the film opens with the banner for Amazon MGM Studios, whose “Art for Art’s Sake” slogan has rarely seemed more ironic.\n\n\n\tThat’s because the film itself exists as a striking rebuttal to the idea that it exists for reasons beyond the transactional. (Now that Amazon has made a payment to the First Family, perhaps whatever regulatory concerns they are to have in future might be eased.) “Melania” is a fascinating document: An attempt to look behind the image of a person who resolutely refuses introspection, a vérité confessional undertaken by someone constitutionally averse to the act of confession. It plays like a film by Pablo Larraín, that great documenter of female celebrity behind “Jackie” and “Spencer,” minus the moment when our great diva has an emotional catharsis, or expresses an emotion. And it is many things — but it’s not $75 million worth of movie. \n\t\n\n\tThe film’s box-office prospects seem abysmal; it’s tracking very low, and, anecdotally, it became apparent that all of the 20 or so people in my screening room were, to a one, journalists reporting on the movie. Why would civilians care? After all, for much of its 108-minute running time, “Melania” is primarily a film about a woman walking into and out of rooms. This is true from the very first: The movie opens with a lengthy sequence, scored to the Rolling Stones’ “Gimme Shelter,” in which Melania enters a car to leave Mar-a-Lago, puts on sunglasses, exits that car, boards a plane, removes her sunglasses and sits down, her head hitting the headrest just as the “Rape! Murder!” chorus of the song kicks in. (The scoring of this movie, including two plays of Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean,” is gaudily expensive throughout, a funny reminder that pop music is one of our current president’s great interests.)\n\n\tMelania, here, is spending her last weeks as a private citizen while planning the inauguration, and we are shown that prep at a level of detail that shifts from painstaking to painful. (Not once but twice are we shown lengthy fitting sequences, as she instructing a tailor on the manner in which her inaugural looks need to be altered.) She speaks in voiceover throughout the planning process, delivering paragraphs with incantatory rhythms that can have the effect of concealing that they contain no substance at all. “My education in architecture gives me a serious design approach,” she tells us. Later: “For me, it’s important that timeless elegance shines through in every element.” \n\n\tOne senses little feeling behind the words, not least because they seem at times to directly contravene what’s actually happening in the world, from relatively trivial to high-stakes. She proudly informs viewers that, in her husband’s first term, she “restored the Rose Garden”; it’s since been paved over. Later, reflecting on the outpouring of support she felt on Inauguration Day, she tells us that “In the end, no matter where we come from, we are bound by the same humanity.” A director not beholden to the Trump administration — unlike Brett Ratner, whom Melania tapped to make this film, and who had previously been cast out of the industry following multiple allegations of sexual assault — might find the interesting friction between these words and the ongoing refusal to acknowledge the humanity of immigrants and those who advocate for them. Instead, the words just lie there. \n\t\n\n\tWithout her script, Melania is stiff on her feet. When her interior designer delivers an impromptu declaration of her pride at having come to the country as a child from Laos and risen to working for the White House, Melania gazes into the middle distance, momentarily snagging her eye on the camera. We cut ahead to a later point in the conversation, in which Melania obliquely acknowledges her own status as an immigrant by asking the designer to place the Presidential seal on Slovenian crystal.\n\n\tPerhaps all Melania does lies in shades of meaning, but the shades are so indistinct as to fade into nothingness. On a Zoom with French First Lady Brigitte Macron to discuss the Be Best initiative, Melania declares, “Mental health, anxiety, is just growing around the world because of cyberbullying.” What Be Best actually has done or will do lies beyond the frame.\n\n\tThe film seems aggressively uninterested in exploring the terrain of its subject’s mind — almost as if it exists as an object to justify its star’s talent fee, not as a film. We learn aggressively little about Melania — that her favorite song is indeed “Billie Jean,” to which she sings along, lands like a shock, just because she’s otherwise avoided saying anything at all. She alludes to grief over the loss of her mother, but is not shown demonstrating anything beyond stoicism: When she lights a candle in church in remembrance of her, she’s shot from behind. And when Donald Trump tells the camera, “This one had a hard time” with the loss, he seems to gesture toward a figure offscreen. Melania isn’t shown at all. (Trump is a persistent presence throughout the film, especially as it moves toward his inauguration, but the two speak on a surface level. When he brags to her, in a phone call, about the magnitude of his electoral victory, she replies, “That’s a good one. Congrats.”)\n\n\tPerhaps there’s something refreshingly oppositional to the president’s rhetorical style in the First Lady’s disappearance; by contrast to the say-everything head of state’s desire for stardom, Melania’s not even a character in her own movie. But “Melania” leaves a bitter aftertaste when one considers just how healthily remunerated Melania was to give the nation nothing at all. Put the film on the pile with Trump University and Trump Steaks and the law-firm and university shakedowns and all the other money-spinning endeavors as evidence of this family’s eagerness to make a buck — and call it one more thing, too: In its shamelessness, it’s proof that this enigmatic woman is, finally, her husband’s perfect match.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMacaulay Culkin wrote a moving message to his “Home Alone” co-star Catherine O’Hara following her death at age 71 on Friday.\n\n\t“Mama. I thought we had time,” he said in an Instagram caption. “I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you but I had so much more to say. I love you. I’ll see you later.”\n\n\tO’Hara starred in “Home Alone” and “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” as Kate McCallister, mother of Culkin’s Kevin McCallister — the role that kicked off his career as a child actor. In December 2023, the two had an emotional reunion when Culkin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and O’Hara gave a speech at the ceremony. \n\t\n\n\t“Macaulay — this beautiful, dear little 10-year-old boy — was called a superstar, a moneymaker, one of the hottest leading young men in Hollywood by the world over. How does anyone survive that?” O’Hara said in her speech. “Well, I believe you’d have to possess a certain quality, a gift that dear [writer-producer] John Hughes obviously recognized in you, Macaulay: your sense of humor. It’s a sign of intelligence in a child, and a key to surviving life at any age. And from what I see, you have brought this sweet, yet twisted, yet totally relatable sense of humor to everything that you have chosen to do since ‘Home Alone.'”\n\n\t“Thank you for including me — your fake mom who left you home alone not once, but twice — to share in this happy occasion,” she concluded. “I’m so proud of you.” Culkin wiped away tears as the two embraced.\n\n\tSee Culkin’s post below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOrlando Bloom is joining Ethan Hawke in “The Last of the Tribe,” a jungle thriller based on a novel by award-winning investigative journalist Monte Reel.\n\n\tThe film, which is directed by Claudio Borrelli (“Vultures”), features previously announced Brazilian actress and environmental activist Zaya Guarani. Mark Bailey, an Emmy-nominee who wrote “Downfall” and “The Volcano: Rescue From Whakaari,” penned the screenplay.\n\n\n\tThe film is set in the Amazon rainforest and follows William Phelan (Hawke), a washed-out Chicago cop turned corporate gun-for-hire, who is sent to investigate a death. During his mission he encounters the last surviving member of an Indigenous tribe. Protagonist Pictures is launching sales ahead of EFM. \n\t\n\n\t“I’m drawn to films that slam the raw, the rugged and the cruel head-on into the beautiful and the divine,” said Borrelli. “In this story, the rainforest is both the villain and the savior — that natural and forever conflict is the essence of what I want to capture in The Last of the Tribe.”\n\n\tBloom starred in “The Lord of the Rings” and “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchises. He recently appeared in the boxing drama “The Cut” and the action-thriller “Red Right Hand” opposite Andie MacDowell. He also appeared in the Amazon Prime action-comedy “Deep Cover” co-starring Bryce Dallas Howard and Nick Mohammed. Bloom will next be seen in Werner Herzog’s “Bucking Fastard.”\n\n\tHawke was just nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in “ Blue Moon,” and headlined the critically acclaimed FX series ”The Lowdown,” which was picked up for a second season. He also recently starred in “The Weight,” a thriller that earned strong reviews out of Sundance. \n\t\n\n\tGuarani is an Indigenous Brazilian activist, model, actress, and speaker from the Guarani Mbya ethnicities, born and raised in the Amazon rainforest. She has also appeared in Darren Aronofsky’s sci-fi documentary, “Postcards From Earth.”\n\n\tCinematographer Adolpho Veloso, whose work on “Train Dreams” recently earned an Academy Award nomination, along with ASC and BAFTA nominations and a Critics Choice Award, will serve as director of photography.  The film is produced by Academy Award winner Edward Saxon (“Silence of the Lambs”), alongside Steve Schwartz and Paula Mae Schwartz for Chockstone Pictures (“All the Old Knives”), Mark Bailey, and Ethan and Ryan Hawke (“The Weight”). Fernando Meirelles (The Two Popes, City of God) serves as executive producer, with his São Paulo-based O2 Filmes producing in Brazil.\n\n\t“’The Last of the Tribe’ is an intense, propulsive thriller with real moral weight at its core,” said Dave Bishop, CEO Protagonist Pictures, in a statement. “Set deep in the Brazilian Amazon, the project pairs elevated genre storytelling with urgent contemporary themes. Claudio has crafted a bold vision, and with Ethan Hawke, Orlando Bloom and Zaya Guarani leading the cast, we’re excited to introduce this standout project to buyers at EFM.”\n\n\t“’The Last of the Tribe’ is a tense, gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller, a real old-school heart pounding ride. And yet, it is also about something that could not be more timely – the destruction of the rainforest and the people who call it home. Our fantastic cast, spearheaded by the extraordinary Ethan Hawke, and now joined by Bloom, are all so smart, and passionate, and talented and committed to the telling of this story. We are thrilled,” added the producers in a joint statement.\n\n\tHawke is repped by CAA and MGMT Entertainment; Bloom is repped by WME, Untitled, and Felker Toczek Suddleson McGinnis Ryan; Guarani is repped by Carl Navarro of Spotlight Media.\n",

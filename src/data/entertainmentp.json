    "body": "\n\tHost Miles Teller portrayed both Jonathan and Drew Scott — the Property Brothers from the show of the same name — as the twins showed up at the White House to help Donald Trump remodel the structure on “Saturday Night Live.”\n\n\tAmericans have been aghast at watching Trump demolish the East Wing to build a ballroom, and the skit managed to work in ICE, the movie theater demolition, Melania’s decorating style and Trump’s thirst for a third term. \n\t\n\n\t“This week, we’re taking on our biggest challenge yet — building the new White House ballroom,” announced Teller. “Donald and Melania moved into this house nine years ago. They were evicted for four years, but they moved back in. Donald has a strong eye for interior design.”\n\n\n\t“I put these gold urns everywhere,” said James Austin Johnson as Trump. \n\n\t“Like a hundred in every room. That makes me happy. It’s very important to be happy these days. Really dark stuff happening in the world. Some of it is me. And here’s a crown I just got from my trip to Asia. Nothing says democracy like a crown, right?,” Johnson’s Trump said. \n\n\tTeller then takes a tour of the White House with the Trumps, commenting on Melania’s taste. “She’s got a style all her own. I love these Halloween decorations you put up.”\n\n\t“Those are for Christmas,” deadpanned Melania, played by Chloe Fineman.\n\n\t“The Trumps have already made a few subtle changes to the house,” Teller explained.\n\n\t“Donald put a painting of himself as a soldier from ‘Halo,'” Melania pointed out.\n\n\tMelania explained that the remodeling is taking place because the house is “only 55,000 square feet” and they need a ballroom, because “Donald, he loves to dance.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m a terrific dancer. Terrific dancer. Just ask your eyes. Right?,” said Trump.\n\n\tThe Property Brothers said they asked Donald what his budget was and he said, “Between $350 million and infinity.”\n\n\tTrump then told the brothers he wants to construct a ring for MMA fights and proposes hosting “bum fights.” \n\n\t“Official ones but also casual fights in the backyard, you know what I’m talking about? Two mentally ill guys just whaling on each other. Do bum fights again. Remember bum fights? We love bum fights!,” Trump exclaimed.\n\n\t“It will be ready just in time for my third term. We want this to be our forever home. Because we’re not leaving. We’re going to be doing something called coup,” Trump added. \n\n\tAs they end their White House tour, Teller said, “I guess the only thing left is the payment for the construction.”\n\n\t“Aren’t you guys from Canada?” Trump asked before yelling “ICE!” as agents stormed the room. “There goes ICE. We like them. Spooky, very spooky. It’s a very spooky secret police thing.”\n\n\t“‘The Property Brothers.’ Only on HGTV and Truth Social,” the announcer concluded.\n\n\tWatch the full segment below:\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBowen Yang appeared as former U.S. Congressman George Santos during “Weekend Update” on “Saturday Night Live,” where he spoke with co-host Colin Jost about what he’s been up to following his prison release. \n\n\tDuring the segment, Jost referenced the upcoming New York City marathon happening before reluctantly introducing Santos as “the world’s number one marathoner.” \n\n\t“Can you believe I just finished the marathon?” Yang’s Santos said, to which Jost replied, “The marathon is tomorrow.” \n\t\n\n\t“Yeah, well, it’s a record. I already won!” Yang’s Santos said. \n\n\n\tIn October, President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of Santos, who had been sentenced to over seven years for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Since his release, the disgraced ex-politician has embarked on a media comeback tour. \n\n\t“I’m going on all these shows to tell the truth about what it’s like in prison,” Yang said as Santos. \n\n\t“Well, wasn’t your prison only, like, minimum security?” Jost asked. \n\n\t“That’s right, I was in jail with other white-collar criminals — even though I’m Black,” Yang’s Santos said. \n\n\t“You’re not Black,” Jost told him. \n\n\t“Are you accusing me of lying about my race, like Rachel Dolezal, that horrible woman who lied about being Black? Remember her?” Yang’s Santos asked. “‘Cause that was me.” \n\n\tLater during their conversation, Yang’s Santos said that he’s rich now because he “just took a trip to the Louvre.” He then unzipped his top to reveal a large necklace. \n\n\t“Did you steal that?” Jost asked. \n\n\t“Stole it back, you mean,” Yang’s Santos replied. “Because it belonged to my ancestors — the Zales.” \n\t\n\n\tElsewhere during the “Weekend Update” segment, co-host Michael Che mentioned that King Charles had stripped his brother, Prince Andrew, of his royal title due to his connections to convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\t“Prince Andrew has been stripped of his royal title of ‘Prince’ due to his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, and Andrew says he can only become a prince again if he gets a kiss from a young princess,” Che joked.\n\n\tThe latest “Weekend Update” also poked fun at Trump’s White House bathroom model, Texas suing Tylenol over an alleged link to autism, and Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, announcing that she is nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\tResponding to Takaichi’s nomination, Che quipped, “I can’t believe I get to say this, but thank God nobody listens to women.”\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Los Angeles Dodgers have won the World Series, notching back-to-back championships after a fierce battle against the Toronto Blue Jays that came down to a Game 7 that went 11 innings on Saturday night in Toronto.\n\n\tThe Dodgers beat the Blue Jays 5-4 at Toronto’s Rogers Centre, making them the first Major League Baseball team to win back-to-back championships since the New York Yankees won three in a row from 1998-2000. The Blue Jays had been angling for their first World Series victory since 1993, when they also logged consecutive win as the reigning champs from 1992. \n\t\n\n\tFox Sports anchor Alex Rodriguez, a former Yankee star, said flatly, “This is the greatest World Series game I’ve ever witnessed,” during Fox’s post-game show.\n\n\n\tThe network couldn’t have scripted a game that led to a bigger finish. Toronto led 4-3 going into the ninth inning. Toronto fans were on their feet, preparing to exult in the team’s first Series win in 32 years. At the top of the ninth, Dodgers shortstop Miguel Rojas powered in the tying home run. At the top of the 11th, catcher Will Smith delivered the decisive winning run. \n\n\tThe victory came after a hard fought seesaw of a Fall Classic that proved the Dodgers and Blue Jays were evenly matched in the fight for Commissioner’s Trophy. The games have been a big showcase for Dodgers stars such as Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts and they have delivered big crowds for Fox, although not as big as last year’s series between the Dodgers and New York Yankees. But it was pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto who won the Series’ MVP trophy for his incredible arm and the steely resolve he showed in the tension-packed final minutes.\n\t\n\n\tThe Blue Jays prevailed in Game 1 at home with an 11-4 decisive win. The Dodgers came back to win Game 2 in Toronto (5-1) and Game 3 (6-5) at home. Game 3 turned out to be an epic 18-inning battle. Then the Blue Jays then rallied to win Game 4 (6-2) and Game 5 (6-1) in Los Angeles. The Dodgers then topped the Blue Jays in Game 6 (3-1).\n\n\tThrough the first five games, the World Series has averaged 12.5 million viewers for Fox linear network, Fox Sports streaming and Fox Deportes. Game 5, held on on Halloween night, rose to 14.6 million viewers, with a peak audience of 16 million in the final 15 minutes. \n\n\tLast year’s contest between the Dodgers and Yankees, however, had more heft in the nation’s largest TV market even though that series only went five games. Through Game 5 in 2024, the average viewership was 15.8 million. This year’s five-game average is the second-highest since 2018, per Fox Sports.\n\n\tThe draw of a Game 7 — aka “the two best words in sports” — was also a lure for Hollywood marketers with titles that need to reach looking to reach broad audiences. Universal’s “Wicked: For Good” ran high profile teaser spots during the game, as did Disney’s “Zootopia 2” and Netflix’s “Stranger Things 5.”\n\n\tThe 2025 World Series delivered a number of standout moments for Dodgers superstars. Ohtani pitched the first two and a half innings of Game 7 and also delivered big home runs in the clutch in earlier games. Freeman ended the wild 18-inning game with a walk-off home run that only made him more beloved to Dodger fans. Betts provided the winning runs in Game 6. And outfielder Kiké Hernández had an impressive, game-saving double play in Game 6.\n\n\tBefore the Yankees’ late 1990s run, the Blue Jays were the last team to log consecutive wins in 1992 and 1993.\n\n\tThe Dodgers plan to hold a victory parade in Los Angeles on Monday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tToronto’s Clever Creature Inc. will bring the action-horror feature “For the Good of the Herd” to the American Film Market, with Haley Bishop of AMC Shudder’s “Host” attached to star.\n\n\tMark Pritchard wrote and will direct the film, which is set to begin principal photography in the U.K. in November. Clever Creature managing partner Michaelangelo Masangkay is joining as producer alongside Michael Galvan and Sebastien Bazile of Screen Anthology. Galvan is producing in association with U.K. producer Tim Willrich of Limbo Pictures.\n\t\n\n\tThe project blends survivalist horror with psychological thriller elements, examining how far people will go to survive when society collapses. Bishop plays Zoe, a protagonist haunted by her past who must tap into darker instincts to make it through.\n\n\n\t“This story examines the impact of malign belief structures, the sheer will it takes to deny them, and the lengths a human can go to in serving a conceit of truth,” Pritchard said. “Ultimately for me, humans are the most terrifying monsters. The blurring of lines around belief seems to surface our barbaric gears. Our characters dance around these lines, an uneasy interrogation which provokes personal questions about the nature of predatory forces, what you might do with power, and whether you could be trusted.”\n\n\t“For The Good Of The Herd really stood out to me as a bold and exhilarating take on horror,” Bishop added. “What drew me to my character, Zoe, was her desperate attempt to shed the guilt of her past, yet ultimately realizing she has to harness those darker impulses in order to survive. And selfishly, getting to be the badass final girl, covered in blood and kicking ass, is a dream role. It’s a story laced with as much paranoia as it is with bone-crunching gore, which I think audiences will love.”\n\t\n\n\t“This project represents the kind of bold, genre-driven filmmaking that Clever Creature is passionate about championing — one that pushes boundaries both creatively and commercially,” Masangkay said. “Mark Pritchard’s vision taps into a primal fear while offering a powerful social undercurrent — and with Haley Bishop leading the cast, we couldn’t be more excited to bring it to audiences worldwide.”\n\n\tMichael Tomczyk, Kevin Sand, Giselle Gastell, Bianca Consuji and Donovan Rodriques serve as executive producers.\n\n\tClever Creature has been building its slate of international genre projects spanning horror, action and elevated cinema. The company, which recently unveiled remakes of Roger Corman’s cult classics, develops and represents content bridging creative talent across Canada, Asia and Europe.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the Tokyo International Film Festival’s TIFFCOM market, the launch of the Blue Book of China Film 2025 – jointly edited by Peking University’s Chen Xuguang and Zhejiang University’s Fan Zhizhong – framed Chinese cinema at a crossroads between crisis and renewal.\n\n\tAccording to the report, annual box office revenue in 2024 fell 22.6% year-on-year to RMB42.5 billion ($5.75 billion), with admissions down 28.6% despite 91,000 active screens. Audiences have fragmented across short-form video, gaming and streaming, while the average viewer age continues to rise. Yet mid- to low-budget realist dramas, family-themed films and comedies have helped sustain theatrical momentum.\n\t\n\n\tThe 2025 edition identifies several dominant trends. Female-directed and family-ethics dramas have reshaped mainstream storytelling through films such as “YOLO,” “Something Wonderful” and “Like a Rolling Stone.” Comedy accounted for 36% of box-office revenue in 2024, driven by titles like “Successor” and “Johnny Keep Walking.” Documentaries such as “Caught by the Tides,” “The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru” and “Ms. Hu’s Garden” signaled a revival of cultural and social nonfiction. AI-driven production and film-game convergence have emerged as new growth engines, exemplified by “Black Myth: Wukong” and “Ne Zha 2,” which blend cinematic storytelling with interactive structures.\n\n\n\tThe Blue Book concludes that while record-breaking grosses like “Ne Zha 2” demonstrate commercial potential, the future depends on diversified financing, balanced scale and greater integration of AI and animation into industrialized production. Chen closed by asking whether China can maintain its box-office peaks, globalize its myths, and ultimately build its own large-scale creative ecosystem – its own Disney.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the post-presentation Q&A, Chen addressed the industry’s financial volatility, noting that rising budgets have sharply increased risk and spoke about the imbalance between investment and returns. He urged studios to move toward sustainable “serial operation,” diversifying revenue through licensing, merchandising and cultural-tourism tie-ins, while supporting a stable ecosystem of medium- and low-budget films.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaZona Pictures, the distribution label of Gonzalo Salazar-Simpson’s Madrid-based LaZona group, has acquired Spanish rights to lavish Polish biopic “Chopin, Chopin!” (“Chopin, a Sonata in Paris”), handled for international sales by Paris’ Playtime.\n\n\tMichał Kwieciński’s $17.5 million budget biopic of Frédéric Chopin, produced by Poland’s Akson Studio (“Katyń,” “Warsaw 44”), stars Eryk Kulm (“Filip”) as the prodigious pianist-composer, with Lambert Wilson (“The Matrix Resurrections”) as King Louis-Philippe.\n\t\n\n\tThe 19th-century-set drama tracks Chopin’s arrival in Paris at the age of 21 and his rapid ascent as the city’s romantic idol, before illness refocuses his obsession on composition. \n\n\n\tThe film boasts high-end craft talent including cinematographer Michał Sobociński (“The New Look”), production designer Katarzyna Sobańska (“Cold War”) and writer Bartosz Janiszewski (“Wataha”). \n\n\tShot largely in France with roughly 80% of the dialogue in French, the feature squarely targets upscale audiences and classical-music aficionados while courting broader crossover play via its sweeping, baroque aesthetic.\n\n\tHaving produced since 2003 Spanish top hits such as Enrique Urbizu’s thriller “No Rest for the Wicked” and Emilio Martínez Lázaro’s comedy “Spanish Affair,” the highest-grossing Spanish film ever in Spain, in 2023 LaZona broadened its horizons launching a new film distribution operation, LaZona Pictures, led from 2024 by former Latido Films executive Óscar Alonso.\n\n\t“For us ‘Chopin, Chopin!’ is the first true European ‘super-production’ on the slate — a statement of intent to keep growing, step by step, but also to take bolder swings at films with wider audience potential,”  Alonso said at Valladolid’s Seminci, where LaZona’s co-production “Subsuelo,” by Fernando Franco, world premiered as part of the festival’s main competition.\n\t\n\n\tPositioning “Chopin, Chopin” as a “rock-star portrait of the Romantic era,” Alonso advances that the Spanish release, scheduled for next year’s first quarter, will activate partnerships with opera houses, conservatories and music schools to extend reach beyond core arthouse circuits.\n\n\tLaZona Pictures has been ramping up since last year with a curated line of arthouse and crossover titles. With “Chopin Chopin,” the company has begun early conversations with platforms and broadcasters to complement a planned theatrical rollout. \n\n\t“Chopin, Chopin” has already scored top-tier festival exposure and is lining up further key berths, underscoring its positioning as a prestige event title. \n\n\t“It’s the kind of ambitious European cinema that doesn’t come along every year,” he said. “We’re confident it can resonate with classical-music lovers and a much wider audience drawn to grand, emotionally charged storytelling.”\n\n\tClosing Film at Seville European Film Festival\n\n\tThe film will screen out of competition as the closing night gala title at the upcoming edition of the Seville European Film Festival, which runs Nov. 7-15.\n\n\tOne of LaZona’s biggest hits to date as an indie distributor has been “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” a Venice Silver Lion and San Sebastian Audience Award winner.\n\n\tCo-distributed in Spain with Caramel Films, Tunisian Kaouther Ben Hania’s film, one of the year’s most celebrated international titles, also screened at Valladolid as part of the Constellations sidebar.\n",

I got us through COVID and then yada yada yada, honk honk, squeeze squeeze,” Teller’s Cuomo said, miming a squeezing motion with his hands in reference to Cuomo’s sexual harassment allegations. “Anyway, I’m back. I am born and bred New Yorker. I love it here. I know this city like the back of a woman’s back.” \n\t\n\n\tThe segment also featured Ramy Youssef and Shane Gillis as Cuomo’s fellow mayoral candidates, Zohran Mamdani and Curtis Sliwa, respectively. During the cold open, Teller’s Cuomo and Gillis’ Sliwa repeatedly butchered Mamdani’s name, including calling him “Zoltar Rob Zombie” at one point.\n\n\n\tKenan Thompson, portraying the debate moderator, asked the candidates, “You’re all running to be mayor of New York City. So my question is, why would you want the worst job in the world?” \n\n\t“As we all know, as soon as you are elected mayor, everyone in the city immediately hates you. And in that way, I’m already one step ahead of the game,” Teller’s Cuomo replied.\n\n\tThe cold open parodied several moments from the NYC mayoral debate, including Sliwa’s random anecdotes — such as his story about being shot multiple times in a yellow cab.\n\n\tWhen asked what their message was to undecided voters, Youssef’s Mamdani looked directly into the camera as hearts floated around him and said, “My message is this: Hey, girl, I know you got a little white guilt for gentrifying that Spanish neighborhood. Why don’t you vote for me? You’ll feel a little less bad about that chicken-and-rice shop getting turned into a Sweetgreen. Why don’t you hit me up at the ballot box, girl?” \n\t\n\n\t“Mr. Mamdani, you were warned that this is not the forum for your TikTok-ery,” Thompson replied. \n\n\tAt the end of the segment, Thompson asked the candidates, “What do you think is the biggest problem you have to confront as mayor?”\n\n\tJames Austin Johnson then appeared as President Donald Trump, yelling, “It’s me!” \n\n\tJohnson’s Trump later said, “I may not live in New York anymore. But I’m always watching — lurking in the shadows. Much like the late, great Phantom of the Opera. Terrible what happened to him in terms of opera and with regard to being burned by chandelier. Perhaps I’ll add New York mayor to my list of duties.” \n\n\tWatch the full segment below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” star Michael Che is speaking out against the suspension of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which began on Saturday as a result of the now month-long government shutdown.\n\n\t“This SNAP freeze is really fucked up,” Che wrote in an Instagram post Saturday. “And I keep seeing a lotta racist videos celebrating (mostly black) families not being able to buy groceries. There’s this weird idea that since some people have taken advantage of welfare benefits in the hood, NOBODY should receive help, at all? This country is built on greedy motherfuckers taking shortcuts and gaming the system to their benefit, but for some reason, when poor people find a way to turn a nickel into a dime, they’re judged more severely, especially Blacks.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “I [know] the hustle is to hate each other here so we can fight in the comments and up our engagements, but let’s draw the line at feeding the poor. I grew up on free cheese and powdered milk and waiting for your friends to leave the store so they won’t see me pay with stamps. That shit ain’t as glamorous as it sounds. I promise.”\n\n\n\tThe government shut down on Oct. 1 after Republicans and Democrats failed to pass a funding bill for government services as the previous federal budget expired. In the Senate, Republicans are short 60 votes to pass the proposed bill, which gives Democrats a chance to fight back on key issues.\n\n\tThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, sent out a memo on Oct. 26 stating that benefits would be halted on Nov. 1. However, two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island both ruled on Friday that the Trump administration, by law, is required to use contingency funds to pay out for at least a portion of SNAP benefits. The Trump administration has until Monday to respond to the ruling.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Blue Book of China TV Series 2025, launched at the Tokyo International Film Festival’s TIFFCOM market by Peking University’s Chen Xuguang and Zhejiang University’s Fan Zhizhong, outlines an industry undergoing structural reinvention and creative renewal.\n\n\tDespite global economic uncertainty and fierce competition from short-video and gaming platforms, drama registrations rose in 2024, signaling that investor confidence in long-form television remains resilient. The report identifies a quality-driven transformation as the sector’s defining direction, anchored by stronger storytelling, diversified IP, and improved production standards.\n\t\n\n\tIP adaptation continues to dominate, accounting for about 60% of new scripted series. Literary and online fiction have become vital sources of material, driving character-focused, high-craft dramas such as “The Tale of Rose,” “War of Faith” and “The Misplaced.” Warm realism remains a key creative force, reflected in “She and Her Girls,” “Romance in the Alley” and “A Common Person’s Song,” which blend social commentary with emotional optimism.\n\n\n\tCostume dramas are adapting faster pacing and modular storytelling inspired by online short-form content. The Blue Book reports that China’s mini-series market grew from RMB36.86 billion ($5.1 billion) in 2021 to RMB373.9 billion ($51.5 billion) in 2023 and could surpass RMB1 trillion ($137 billion) by 2027. This growth has pushed traditional producers to experiment with condensed narrative structures while retaining cinematic depth.\n\n\tConcluding, Fan highlighted Wong Kar-wai’s “Blossoms Shanghai” as emblematic of the medium’s artistic resurgence and industrial maturity. “Quality is king,” he said, summing up the Blue Book’s message that Chinese television’s future depends on fusing disciplined storytelling with the agility demanded by a rapidly evolving screen economy.\n\t\n\n\tIn the Q&A session, Fan described the microdrama sector as “production without barriers,” a creative democratization and an economic shock that forces established studios to rethink audience engagement and monetization models.\n",

    "body": "This year’s LACMA Art+Film gala on Saturday night proved once again that it is one of Los Angeles’ starriest events of the year.\nElle Fanning, Kaia Gerber and mom Cindy Crawford, Lorde, Angela Bassett, Cynthia Erivo, Samara Weaving, Benito Skinner, Tessa Thompson, Emma Roberts and Paris Hilton were among the evening’s best dressed.\nThe 2025 fundraiser honored “Sinners” filmmaker Ryan Coogler and visual artist Mary Corse. The evening concluded with a performance by Doja Cat.\nCoogler, presented with his honor by Bassett, delivered an emotional speech about his friendship with the late social justice activist Michael Latt, who was shot and killed during a home break-in in 2023. Latt was the son of founding director of the Sundance Institute’s Feature Film Program Michelle Satter and producer David Latt. “Michael was changing the world,” Coogler said.\nCoogler also recalled becoming a screenwriter when he was in college. “I never thought of myself as an artist. I was a football player before anything and I kinda got recommended to write screenplays on a whim when I was an undergraduate at USC on a football scholarship,” he said.\nThe “Sinners” filmmaker said he initially felt like he was at his “weakest” and “lowest” when he arrived in Los Angeles because he missed his community back in his hometown of Oakland, Calif. But now, he said, “This place became a second home for me. I made memories here. I made friends here.”\nLACMA Art+Film, presented in partnership with Gucci and co-chaired by “One Battle After Another” star Leonardo DiCaprio and Eva Chow, support the art institution’s initiative to make film more central to the museum’s curatorial programming, while also funding its broader mission. This includes exhibitions, acquisitions and educational programming, in addition to screenings that explore the intersection of art and film.\nCheck out all the photos from the red carpet

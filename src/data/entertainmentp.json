    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tNov 14, 2025 8:03am PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros.\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“The Conjuring: Last Rites” is coming home. The ninth and supposed final film in New Line Cinema’s “Conjuring” horror franchise will arrive November 21 on HBO Max.\n\n\tDirected by Michael Chaves, “The Conjuring: Last Rites” is loosely based on the real-life Smurl Haunting case. It follows franchise protagonists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) as they investigate a paranormal case with terrifying ties to their first-ever ghostly encounter. Alongside Wilson and Farmiga, the film also stars Mia Tomlinson and Ben Hardy.\n\t\n\n\tThe franchise began 12 years ago with the release of James Wan’s “The Conjuring” in 2013. “Last Rites” is the third direct sequel to the original film, and the franchise also features three “Annabelle” spinoffs and two “The Nun” spinoffs, filling out a uniquely expansive horror universe. Wan directed “The Conjuring” and “The Conjuring 2” and has produced all of the franchise’s sequels and spinoffs alongside Peter Safran. Chaves’ directorial debut “The Curse of La Llorona” (2019) is also a tie-in to the universe.\n\n\n\tAll of the “Conjuring” films have been distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery’s New Line Cinema, where they are developed with Wan and Safran’s respective production companies, Atomic Monster and The Safran Company.\n\n\t“The Conjuring: Last Rites” opened on Sept. 5 to $83 million at the domestic box office, a record for the franchise. The movie ended its box office run with $492 million worldwide. Though “Last Rites” was marketed as the franchise’s finale, its success suggests that audiences have not yet seen the last of this spooky series. HBO Max is also developing a prequel TV series, after “Last Rites” showed younger versions of the Warrens in a flashback.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tVariety is unveiling video of a deeply personal conversation between executive producer Martin Scorsese and director Neeraj Ghaywan following a New York screening of “Homebound,” India’s submission for the Academy Awards’ international feature category.\n\n\tThe intimate discussion, which took place after Scorsese hosted the screening, revealed the legendary filmmaker’s three-year involvement with the project, which began during his work on “Killers of the Flower Moon.” The pair spoke extensively about their shared passion for cinema and their connection through French cinema icon Melita Toscan Du Plantier, whom Ghaywan calls his “Cinema Fairy Godmother.” Toscan Du Plantier produced Ghaywan’s previous film “Masaan” and co-produced “Homebound.”\n\t\n\n\tThe screening drew notable supporters including filmmaker Mira Nair, television personality Padma Lakshmi, and actor Kal Penn, besides “Homebound” cast members Ishaan Khatter and Vishal Jethwa. \n\n\n\tDuring the conversation, Ghaywan revealed the production team used the code word “elder brother” to refer to Scorsese throughout development, keeping his involvement confidential from script to final edit. “Sitting across from you is the peak of that journey and the most meaningful moment of my cinematic journey, the highest peak of my cinematic career,” Ghaywan told Scorsese. “This right here, sitting across from you is the biggest reward for me.”\n\n\tScorsese, who provided script notes while immersed in his three-and-a-half-hour epic, expressed his satisfaction with the finished film. “I’ve been living with it for about three years,” he said. “I love the audiences in America to see this picture because I know that it’s based on a real story.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film draws from a New York Times essay by Basharat Peer about Mohammad Saiyub and Amrit Kumar. Ghaywan explained his approach to the material focused on universal themes of migration and dignity rather than delivering what Scorsese characterized as “a ponderous kind of lecture.”\n\n\t“I used this as a springboard to talk about something that affected me, that is universal in thought, that why do migrants leave their homes?” Ghaywan said, noting that 500 to 600 million people are internal migrants in India, many from marginalized communities seeking dignity through government employment.\n\n\tInspired by true events, “Homebound” follows two friends — one Dalit and the other Muslim — navigating their country as migrant laborers during the pandemic, testing their friendship while pursuing dignity and belonging.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\tWatch the conversation here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Labyrinth” is headed back to the big screen. David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly’s enduring fantasy musical, featuring an army of puppets by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop, will return to theaters with a 40th anniversary re-release from Fathom Entertainment.\n\n\tThe “Labyrinth” 4K remaster will play theaters in North America from Jan. 8 to Jan. 11. The reissue includes a special featurette with footage from the “Labyrinth Experience & Masked Ball,” a cosplay event in the U.K. that was held in October.\n\t\n\n\t“The magical combination of Jim Henson, George Lucas, David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly and hundreds of extraordinary creatures and puppets from Jim Henson’s Creature Shop made ‘Labyrinth’ a landmark fantasy classic, one that is beloved by Fathom Entertainment audiences over the years,” said Ray Nutt, chief executive officer at Fathom Entertainment, in a statement. “We are honored to bring this 1986 epic back to theaters from Sony Pictures for its 40th anniversary in this special presentation and provide a brilliant night at the movies for audiences of all ages.”\n\n\n\tReleased in June 1986, “Labyrinth” saw puppeteer Jim Henson and designer Brian Froud crafting their follow-up to the 1982 adventure film “The Dark Crystal,” working in a similarly fantastical, more mature tone. The film starred Connelly as a young teenager tasked with rescuing her baby brother from Jareth, a big-haired, show-stopping Goblin King played by Bowie. It was Henson’s final directed feature. Though it was seen as a box office disappointment at the time, grossing $34 million globally against a $25 million production budget, “Labyrinth” has enjoyed a vibrant second life as a favorite among Henson and Bowie acolytes.\n\t\n\n\tTickets are now on sale for the “Labyrinth” 40th anniversary release via participating venues. \n",

    "body": "\n\tKen Burns’ latest work takes us back to a moment of great dissension and division, a moment in which Americans raged against the monarch leading them and in which any outcome seemed possible. By sheer happenstance, it’s eerily resonant. \n\n\tCo-directed by Sarah Botstein and David P. Schmidt, “The American Revolution,” premiering Nov. 16 on PBS, is a six-part, 12-hour excavation of the war that led to the creation of the United States. In the form Burns has made famous in documentaries from “The Civil War” to “The Central Park Five” to “Jazz,” the series takes an expansive, prismatic view of its subject, exploring the motivations and decisions of early Americans including George Washington and rank-and-file soldiers. \n\t\n\n\tThe production of “The American Revolution” unfolded over 10 years, during which time Burns, who continues to put out about a film a year, was working on other projects too. This effort, though, had special challenges, because of the lack of visual documentation of the period (there aren’t photos of Revolutionary battlefields to which the filmmakers can apply “the Ken Burns effect”) and the breadth of the subject matter. \n\n\n\tCovering the war — and integrating the testimony of academic experts — is a process of endless discovery. “We study it for so long, and then we get to work with all of these people who do this as their job every day,” says Schmidt. “I grew up in Colonial Williamsburg, and I don’t know this stuff.”\n\n\tAt 72, Burns, who’s been on an extensive press tour, is already looking ahead — he mentions a Lyndon Johnson project in the works. What draws his films together, and the tradition into which “The American Revolution” fits, is a curiosity about the national character and an inherent optimism. “I’ve worked with Ken for almost 30 years,” says Botstein, “and he is a great enthusiast. He’s excited about American history, about the human experiment and about bringing history to life.”\n\t\n\n\tThat’s not to say Burns thinks history provides a one-to-one template for the present moment: He rejects the idea that his new film might be seen as a comment on the Trump era. But in its clear-eyed, bighearted insistence that progress happens thanks to complex, flawed individuals, it may nonetheless be the project many watching at home need. Burns spoke to Variety via Zoom from his New Hampshire home in October.\n\t\n\t\tI’m excited to speak with you specifically about this film — it’s pretty special.\t\n\n\tThis has been a really complex labor of love for almost 10 years, lacking some of the hallmarks — photography and newsreels — that would help make it complete. Perhaps the reason that the Revolution is so drenched in mythology and bloodless gallantness is that there are no photographs.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Washington Rallying the Americans at the Battle of Princeton,” by William T. Ranney, 1848\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrinceton University Art Museum\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIn “The Civil War,” for instance, you had photographic imagery to make the situations feel real. Here, you’re dealing with maps and paintings and that’s it, as far as primary visual sources go. Did you feel as if your hands were tied?\t\n\n\tNot tied — it was a wonderful challenge to have. It’s just a recalibration. Sometimes, you’ve got no first-person voices, because you’re dealing with lots of living witnesses. Here, you’ve got hundreds of first-person voices, no living witnesses and many scholars.\n\n\tWe filmed reenactors for years and years and collected a critical mass of dozens of hours of impressionistic footage. We have lots of maps; some of them we extrude and make dimensional. All of that is a way of making what I hope is beautiful in lots of senses of the word. It’s also ghastly, horribly terrifying.\n\t\n\t\tEarly in the series, the historian Maya Jasanoff remarks that the fact that we know in retrospect that the events transpiring in the 1770s would become the American Revolution make it feel very unreal and detached. Your work makes it feel human-scale.\t\n\n\tWe’re looking at “Washington Crossing the Delaware,” right? Nobody stands up in a boat in the middle of a storm at night in an ice-filled river. When [she says] “unreal and detached,” we show that image, and we never show that image again.\n\n\tIt’s a revolution, yes, it’s a civil war — but it’s also a world war. It isn’t just about great men in Philadelphia thinking great thoughts. There’s this diverse group of people engaged in it, and we’re not picking any sides. We’re umpires calling balls and strikes. Nobody’s wrong. Everybody in this country will have the chance to identify with this in some form. I have never varied what I’ve said, whether I’m talking to Joe Rogan or schoolkids in Charleston, Detroit or Chicago: We’re umpires calling balls and strikes.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYour political views are no secret — you’re a Democrat and opposed to Donald Trump. To attempt to remove your own sensibility, does that take discipline?\t\n\n\tLook, I’m a citizen — I have the right to free speech. And there are lots of filmmakers who very honorably make films about their political points of view. That’s totally fine too. We have a First Amendment still. But I’ve chosen the self-discipline of this, and I thrill to that. I thrill to the fact that we had David Koch as one of the underwriters of the “Vietnam” film, as well as a liberal bundler for Obama. I have conservative underwriters and left-wing ones, and they trust me.\n\t\n\t\tYour press tour has included stops on Joe Rogan’s and Theo Von’s podcasts.\t\n\n\tOnes and zeros exist in computers, but binaries don’t exist in nature. We’ve got a lot of divisions, but they may be a mile wide and only an inch thick. People were trying to give me briefing books about how to talk to Joe Rogan. I said, “No, I’m just going to talk to him and tell him how excited I am about this show.” He was curious — and Theo Von even more so! At one point, [Von] goes, “Liberty’s like a pilot light!” It was so great to have somebody coming to this understanding.\n\n\tI don’t necessarily agree with them politically — some things I do. But I live in a tiny town in New Hampshire — it’s like going to a ball game. Nobody asked to see where you’re registered when you go in, right? Everybody’s singing the anthem. In my town, I walk every day, three miles or so. I wave at everybody. I don’t care what their bumper sticker says; I don’t care what their bumper sticker doesn’t say. I just go, “Hi, neighbor!”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe “American Revolution” crew with reenactors from the 3rd New Jersey Regiment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEdgardo Gonzalez\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI don’t think I’m the only person who, when thinking about the Revolutionary War, thinks first about the Founding Fathers, great men inventing our country in Philadelphia. This documentary complicates that story immensely — why was it important to you to expand the story beyond the familiar mythos?\t\n\n\tSomething your magazine has written about is the phenomenon of “Yellowstone.” What is “Yellowstone”? Apparently, it’s beloved by conservatives, right? It’s the big conservative series that everybody loves. It’s about a patriarch who is a great, honorable leader who also murders people. He’s got a very strong daughter; she has one brother who is married to a Native American and another brother who is Benedict Arnold. And at the heart of it is greed — American greed for land. How is this different from “The American Revolution”?\n\t\n\n\tI could have made the same argument about “Succession.” This is our origin story. We live in a media world in which everything is red state or blue state, right or wrong. Nobody’s life proceeds that way. That’s why Kevin Costner is such an amazing character as John Dutton, because he’s flawed, and everyone is flawed.\n\t\n\t\tAs we speak, “No Kings” rallies just happened in every state in the country. Has bringing together viewers of all political allegiances gotten harder?\t\n\n\tNo, but what’s become harder is the discipline to just tune that out. This project began when Barack Obama had 13 months to go in his presidency. Stuff rhymed then that doesn’t rhyme now; stuff rhymes, then doesn’t rhyme, then rhymes again. There’s a wife of a German general [in the documentary] who travels to catch up with her husband at Saratoga, and who’s worried that Americans eat cats. If our film came out last fall [when then-vice presidential nominee JD Vance spread an unfounded rumor that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating cats], people would go, Ken, you did this.\n\n\tWe have to just put all of that away. It’s not that you’re not mindful of all of this noise going on, but you can’t play to it. If you do, you limit the possibility of the art and the possibility of the story. Because it means that you’re trading on a momentary set of political exigencies which always change.\n\t\n\t\tThis particular project represents 10 years of work, give or take. But you weren’t single-mindedly focused on it, because you release a new project more or less annually. How do you keep up that pace?\t\n\n\tWe’d be really good generals. Maybe not me, but Sarah Botstein — put her in charge of anything. I’ve been working on the “Revolution” with a team that, at times, was finishing up “The Vietnam War,” working on “The U.S. and the Holocaust” and working on a project that has yet to come out, on LBJ and the Great Society.\n\n\tI wear lots of hats: I do writing, I produce, I direct, I raise all the money. But the best job is to be in the editing room and be the audience’s representative — I can go, Wait. We’re still not connecting this. We’ve assumed everybody knows this, and they don’t necessarily.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCinematographer Buddy Squires shoots on location.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMike Doyle\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of raising the money: I know the life of a documentarian is only getting harder. You’re in the happy position of having partnered with PBS on all of your films.\t\n\n\tI couldn’t have made any of my films anywhere else but PBS. Take “Vietnam.” It cost 30 million bucks. Took 10 and a half years to make, and I spent 10 of those years with my cup out, trying to raise money. I could have gone to a streaming service or premium cable and gotten everything I wanted — they just wouldn’t have given me 10 and a half years to do it. What I wanted was the independence. I didn’t need suits giving notes; I needed the money to do it.\n\t\n\n\tThe underwriting model of PBS is more like a grant from the National Science Foundation to a college that is researching this rare blood disease — they’re not going to say, Have the cure next Thursday. Do what you can to advance the science. And so we hit our marks: We’re pretty much on budget, or if we expand, I raise the money. We’ve always hit our marks.\n\t\n\t\tI imagine you’re concerned about the defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and its possible effects on PBS.\t\n\n\tI lost $4 million for a future project on LBJ — and we’d been in discussions for $10 million more, which, I’m pretty sure, in normal times I would have received. So maybe the loss is four, maybe the loss is 14, but I’ll figure it out. But what about somebody who’s coming up? What about the rural stations that depend on CPB money for so much? They’re going to become news deserts, those areas. Maybe that’s the intention. But nobody’s going to be covering the school board or the city council meeting.\n\t\n\t\tI’ve interviewed PBS CEO Paula Kerger in the past and find her a very formidable character, in the best way. What do you think of her leadership?\t\n\n\tI’ve known every president of PBS back to Larry Grossman [who led PBS from 1976 to 1984]. She is by far the best chief executive. She is from inside. She gets us. She is tireless. I always think I’ve had a long month and traveled a lot, and then I check in with Paula — oh my God.\n\t\n\t\tI’m curious where your ideas come from. Why, for instance, did the American Revolution present itself to you at the moment it did?\t\n\n\tIt’s sort of like the ping-pong balls in the lottery, you know? There’s 30 ideas, but when one drops down to your heart, you do it. The “Buffalo” film that came out a couple of years ago — we’ve been talking about it for more than 30 years, and I’m so glad we waited, because we could benefit from not only new scholarship but Native American scholarship. Native Americans entering into the academic community are making their mark, and we could center a Native American narrative in a really organic way.\n\n\tThere was this moment when we were in the editing room finishing “Vietnam” where I saw that map of la Drang Valley in the central highlands, and I went, “Wow, that could be the British moving west in Long Island toward Brooklyn.” And I said, “Maybe we can do that.”\n\t\n\n\tThere are no focus groups. I love the question: Why did it take you so long to do the Revolution? I don’t know why — it’s just because we don’t have a set thing. We’re not going in chronological order. We’re not operating from a checklist.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777,” by John Trumbull, ca. 1789-1831\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlamy Stock Photo\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI often wish that I could go back to college at the age I am now and truly appreciate it. Given that you’re not a subject-matter expert on most of the topics your films cover when you begin production, you’re kind of living my dream — existing as a perpetual student.\t\n\n\tThat’s exactly what I do: I’m the perpetual student. I’ve gone into two projects, “Baseball” and “Vietnam” with the sense of Finally. I’ve got a subject that I know something about. I played baseball for as long as I can remember, and I follow it to this day. It’s the greatest sport that’s ever been invented. And I protested the war and had a high draft number — otherwise, I would have tried to get conscientious-objector status. But every day of those productions was a daily humiliation of what I didn’t know. And that’s just so great.\n\t\n\t\tAs a student of history, do you think this country can emerge from how divided we are at this moment?\t\n\n\tYes, we can get better, yes. Or if not better, something else will happen — something different. We are in existentially difficult times; you’re right to bring it up.\n\n\tHistory gives you a little bit of optimism. When somebody is in crisis, they go to a pastor or a professional, and that person will almost invariably ask, “Where’d you come from? Who are your parents? What was your childhood like?” And you begin to reassemble and put back together your fragile, fractured narrative of yourself by studying your own origin story. People and countries are the same: They’re living, breathing organisms.\n\n\tI’m not a historian. I happen to work in history. But I’m a storyteller, and I’m interested in the story of us. This story is a way to help remind the people that there’s no them. This is the only thing I’ve learned: There’s only us. There’s no them. Despots and authoritarians need to make a “them” to have a straw man whom you are against. If you need to make an enemy of “them,” you’ve lost the spirit of us.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBillie Eilish recently took to her Instagram story to slam Elon Musk for hoarding his wealth as the Telsa founder and X owner approaches trillionaire status. If Musk does break that threshold, he will become the world’s first trillionaire. Grammy winner Eilish called Musk a “fucking pathetic pussy bitch coward” for not giving his money away toward humanitarian relief efforts.\n\n\tThe singer preceded her statement by sharing a photo carousel by the My Voice, My Choice activist group that broke down the many ways Musk could use chunks of his money to help the world. Examples include spending $40 billion a year to end world hunger by 2030 and paying around $2 billion a year to bring down the endangered species status of 10,433 animals, among other ways.\n\t\n\n\tEilish previously made headlines earlier this month while giving an acceptance speech at the Wall Street Journal Innovator Awards. She used her brief moment at the podium to call out billionaires and urge them to give their money away. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg was in attendance at the ceremony.\n\n\n\t“We’re in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than kind of ever, especially in our country,” Eilish told the room. “Love you all, but there’s a few people in here that have a lot more money than me. If you’re a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? No hate, but yeah, give your money away, shorties.” \n\n\tEilish recently picked up Grammy nominations for record and song of the year thanks to “Wildflower.” If the 23-year-old takes home one of the prizes next year she will add to her collection of nine Grammys. More importantly, a Grammy win would give her the chance to call out Musk and other billionaires on national television.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Running Man” and “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” are heading toward a box office face-off as both movies are predicted to open with $20 million to $25 million this weekend.\n\n\tParamount’s dystopian thriller “The Running Man” has made $1.9 million in previews, while Lionsgate’s magic heist movie “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” edged it out $2.1 million.\n\n\tBoth movies are on track to beat last week’s box office champion, Disney’s “Predator: Badlands,” which is estimated to make $18 million to $20 million in its second weekend. That marks a typical 50% decline from last week’s franchise-best opening of $40 million.\n\t\n\n\tGlen Powell stars in “The Running Man,” which is directed by Edgar Wright and based on Stephen King’s sci-fi novel. It follows a reality show where people must evade capture from the authorities for 30 days in order to win $1 billion. The cast also includes Josh Brolin, Colman Domingo, Michael Cera, Lee Pace, William H. Macy, Katy O’Brien, Martin Herlihy, Emilia Jones and more. It was co-financed by Domain Entertainment co-financed and has budget of $110 million, so it’ll need to stick around through Thanksgiving to run to a profit.\n\n\n\t“Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” is the third entry is Lionsgate’s heist series starring Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan and Isla Fisher. The criminals, who are all professional magicians and thieves, reunite for another heist and bring along some newcomers to the franchise like Rosamund Pike, Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa and Ariana Greenblatt. The third film is directed by Ruben Fleischer and carries a budget of roughly $90 million. \n",

    "description": "\n\tThis year’s International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), taking place in the Dutch city between Nov. 13-23, will open with a short docu",
    "body": "\n\tThis year’s International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), taking place in the Dutch city between Nov. 13-23, will open with a short documentary selection as a way of “showcasing the creativity and artistic range of short documentary film.”\n\n\tThe opening shorts selection comprises “As I Lay Dying” by Mohammadreza Farzad and Pegah Ahangarani; “Intersecting Memory” by Shayma’ Awawdeh; and “Happiness” by Firat Yücel. Artistic director Isabel Arrate Fernandez, heading to her first edition in the position after Orwa Nyrabia left the role earlier in the year, said in a statement that the programming team believes “the selection of films set the tone for a festival that explores major issues of the present, that makes room for new voices, fresh forms, and unexpected perspectives.”\n\t\n\n\tAll three short films, despite varying greatly in approach, touch upon issues of sociopolitical unrest, an overwhelming outpour of distressing news on mass and social media and the particular kind of grief that follows war and displacement. \n\n\n\t“As I Lay Dying” examines video footage from the 2009 Green Movement protests in Tehran. Speaking with Variety, the duo says they began watching the footage in 2020, almost a decade after the events, when they finally felt there was “enough distance” to look back at them. “While watching, we came across some footage in which the person holding the camera, terrified for life, suddenly began to run,” recalls Farzad. “We were witnessing something utterly pure — images that could never be captured in professional narrative cinema, and that would seem nearly impossible even within documentary filmmaking involving a professional crew.”\n\t\n\n\tOn why to release the film now, five years after the duo first made it, the two say that they knew that “history is always repeating itself.” “We didn’t imagine that only a few months after finishing our film, we would once again see, both in Iran and soon after across the world, a new surge of political and social unrest,” Ahangarani adds. “Still, we believe that mobile phone footage captured by ordinary people will continue, for years to come, to reveal deep and enduring truths. Making such films today is, perhaps, one of the few ways to build alternative narratives and to map the pains and struggles of being human.”\n\n\tThe duo felt “exhausted, bruised, beaten and worn out” after watching the footage and “reliving the collective depression that spread after those days.” \n\n\tThe sentiment is familiar to Yücel, whose “Happiness” chronicles the sleepless nights of a group of activists as they follow the news from Palestine and the Middle East from Amsterdam. “The film evolved in direct response to the ongoing realities of genocide, displacement, and capitalist extraction across Palestine, Congo and Sudan,” says the director. “The film was born quite literally out of sleepless nights, not only of one person but of many people who share this experience.”\n\n\tOn the format for “Happiness,” told entirely through screen captures with voice-over narration, producer Aylin Kuryel says it allowed the film to “rearrange and reframe” what is already happening in a digital space. “This opens up an artistic and political potential: to think with the images we constantly encounter rather than merely looking at them. The person at the computer is not simply a passive observer of images of violence; they are already part of a collective desire to act.”\n\n\t“Exhaustion is not only a psychological state, it’s political,” adds the producer. “It comes from being constantly addressed by power, constantly witnessing injustice, and being asked to keep functioning as if nothing is happening, and of course, from the different forms of oppression exerted on political mobilizations. But exhaustion also contains a possibility: the recognition that no one can act alone. This is what we wanted to address.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Intersecting Memory,” courtesy of IDFA\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn “Intersecting Memory,” Awawdeh directly addresses her mother as she recalls her childhood in Palestine against the backdrop of the Second Intifada. More than two decades later, she opens a box of old videotapes to search for memories of that time. The project began as Awawdeh converted the tapes into digital copies, recognizing streets and faces of the people on screen. “But something else captured me,” she says. “Childhood memories that began to resurface with viewing.”\n\t\n\n\t“I started searching the footage for children, and their scenes were numerous and very moving,” she adds. “That’s when I realized I had a responsibility to tell something about my city. I wanted to present our narrative as Palestinians, in our voices and our images, as we live it from within the place we belong to and carry inside us.”\n\n\tLike Farzad and Ahangarani, Awawdeh felt history repeating itself as she worked on the project. “I started watching this material at the same time as the outbreak of the genocide in Gaza, and it was very difficult. When I began working with Mahmoud Ahmad, the film editor, who is from Gaza and lives in Belgium, he literally said to me: ‘Nothing is different.’”\n\n\tAsked about the importance of having a major festival like IDFA open with a selection of shorts, Awawdeh says the form is characterized “by an intensity of feeling and idea.” “Choosing three films connected to our current political reality is a necessary step to affirm that we are part of the global struggle against oppression and colonialism.”\n\n\t“[It] is a radical act,” echoes the team behind “As I Lay Dying.” “Not every story needs to be told at length; some find their meaning precisely in brevity. From our perspective, this decision is one that takes the side of art, because art is never about the length of a narrative. We are genuinely grateful that IDFA, setting aside conventional festival and managerial considerations, has chosen to stand with art and with the power of human stories. We thank them not only on our own behalf but also on behalf of many short documentary filmmakers.”\n\n\tYücel also thanks the festival for their political stance, saying the team is happy their film is “being screened in a year when IDFA signed the cultural boycott against Israeli institutions with ties to militarization. Events like this are not just spaces for cultural dialogue; they should be platforms where people actively challenge both institutions and their own mindsets, pushing for political and structural change.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSara Bareilles and Brandi Carlile have blended their voices on a few occasions in impromptu or concert settings, but not for an official recording until now. The occasion that finally brought them together was  “Come See Me in the Good Light,” an Apple documentary coming out this weekend about the poet Andrea Gibson dealing with terminal illness. Both singer-songwriters signed on as executive producers while the film was being made, and then Bareilles embarked on a theme that would adapt Gibson’s poetry into song, bringing in Carlile as a fellow lead vocalist and co-writer on the track she’d started. Their song, “Salt Then Sour Then Sweet,” is also debuting on streaming services today.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe subject matter sounds heavy, but the theme song turns to be… to borrow a phrase… actually romantic — romantic about love, and about life itself, against some obvious odds. It takes its cues in that regard from the lightness that comes through in the doc’s portrayal of Gibson’s relationship with fellow poet Megan Falley, a strong throughline in the film.\n\n\n\tBareilles tells Variety how the song came to be. “You know, I’m in a really beautiful, privileged position to have resources to help get art made that I love and believe in. Whether it’s investing a little bit of money in an off-Broadway show or this, I’ve been doing more of that, because I think supporting art is really important for the health of humanity — just to make it sound too grandiose. But the yes for me was that I feel like Andrea and Meg’s story is so worth being told, and then I saw a little bit of the film. The idea came up to work with this unfinished poetry that Andrea had been collecting, because they wanted to put an original poem at the end of the film. \n\t\n\n\t“And then it was like, well, you got me, you’ve got Brandi Carlile — maybe there’s a world where there’s a collaboration waiting to be uncovered. And it really happened super quickly as soon as I saw the first cut of the film. It’s not the final shot in the film anymore, but it used to have these wind chimes at the very end, and I just started writing a song in the key of those wind chimes, and was looking over these pages of beautiful couplets [of Gibson’s]… There was a love poem and so I started putting things together. I sent it to Brandi, she gave me some feedback and we went back and forth. And then it was really just a matter of a few days and the whole thing was done.”\n\n\tOf working with Carlile, Bareilles says, “She’s the easiest. She’s so great. And with Brandi, the power of her forward momentum is really helpful. I sent her a kind of a first draft and she’s like, ‘Yes.’ She’s a yes, and I love that about her. She’s like, ‘Yeah, and this… Oh, what if you do this, or you repeat this and then you try this again? I feel like this needs…’ I’m a big admirer of hers, as an artist and then also getting to know her, the few times that we’ve done things together — I just really have a lot of admiration and respect for her. And we’re both big fans of this project, and I think anytime you can build a collaboration based on the support of this other sort of third entity… It felt like we were coming together for the greater good of this film, so that was a nice North Star.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandi Carlile and Sara Bareilles attend the 37th Annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Microsoft Theater on November 5, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for The Rock and Ro\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBareilles came to know Gibson and get involved in the project after having been a fan of their poetry and, coincidentally, in Colorado at the same time Gibson was doing one final live performance there, captured in the film.\n\n\t“The whole evolution of my involvement with this film has felt very just kismet and miraculous,” Bareilles says. “The reason I’m involved is because I happen to have been in Colorado when Andrea was performing there, those final shows, and ran into Glennon (Doyle) and Abby (Wambach) there, and we shared our love for Andrea’s work, while we were all in very tender places personally. \n\t\n\n\t“I got introduced to Andrea’s work on Instagram — you know, the blessing and the curse that Instagram is. It was all of those videos that they would share, and I was just so moved by their generosity and courage to share something so intimate, and with so much lightness. I think that’s one of Andrea’s superpowers is this ability to hold the dark matter with so much light, and real love — like, a devotional love of life. There’s a lot of really incredible wisdom in their perspective. And I know it was a hard one for them as well — you know, they were on a dark journey for a long time — so when I think about the context of these times that we’re in, it feels like a real beacon of hope to have somebody be able to garner good things from hard places.\n\n\t“Watching someone like Andrea be on the mortal precipice and hold it with such grace… They’re a beautiful teacher. That’s just how I view them. And so like with anything with your meditation teachers, or if you’re a person of faith, your deacons or your priests or whomever, the shamans of our world that help us translate our pain into grace, really, that’s how I hold them in my mind.”\n\n\tIn the actual crafting of the song, “structurally, it actually was pretty intuitive,” she says. “I mean, I think Andrea as a poet is pretty musical. And so I was looking for things where there was an internal rhyme or whatever, and then of course I added some interstitial things to kind of help stitch the song together a little bit. But it was pretty intuitive. It was not a heavy lift to kind of change form.” \n\n\tWhen the film premiered at Sundance, and the song was unveiled for the first time, “It was really tender.  I don’t know if we maybe had sent it before. But the first time they heard it live, I was singing it at the welcome gala at Sundance. And they weren’t feeling great, and the travel had been hard, but they came. I won’t forget that feeling of getting to perform the song for them. It feels a little bit like a magic trick to watch somebody make something you made into something else. I’ve had that experience watching someone choreograph a dance to a song of mine of just being like, ‘Oh, I didn’t know that was in there,’ you know? So it’s  a really beautiful feeling to share that transformation, and they were just very loving and excited about the collaboration.\n\t\n\n\t“Andrea knew that this film was gonna hold a lot of heavy material, but it’s so funny. You watch this film and Andrea is hysterical, hysterically funny, as is Meg. So you’re laughing a lot, and it’s just a joyful, life-affirming film that happens to be about cancer. It’s just the both of it all, that it’s something that can be joyful and devastating at the same time, that I just think is so human and so real. And Andrea didn’t want to leave people with some kind of broken-hearted, achy song. They wanted a love song for Meg, and so that’s what we wrote.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAndrea Gibson and Megan Falley attend the “Come See Me In The Good Light” premiere during the 2025 Sundance Film Festival at Library Center Theatre on January 25, 2025 in Park City, Utah.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOne of Bareilles’ favorite lines in the song — one that came from Gibson — is “Grief is a shortcut to the truth.” “I love that. It’s so real. … I’ve been going through a lot of loss these last few years. You know, I had a couple of friends pass away, and it was my first experience as an adult with just sort of devastating grief.  I have a new record coming out early next year, and the whole record pretty much is about grief. It’s all I’ve been feeling since the pandemic, pretty much. But it’s so truthful; it’s so tenderizing. It cracks you open in this way that I think is really important and helpful, ultimately, if you can sort of endure what’s hard about it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA prominent Republican U.S. representative has weighed in on the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery — warning Trump administration officials that Netflix‘s potential acquisition of WBD’s HBO Max and its entertainment studios “raises antitrust concerns that could result in a harm to consumers.”\n\n\tRep. Darrell Issa (R-California) sent the letter, dated Nov. 13, to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson and Gail Slater, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division. Variety has reviewed a copy of the letter.\n\t\n\n\tLast month, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it had received in-bound acquisition interest from “multiple parties” and has commenced a process to review such offers. David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is known to have submitted bids for WBD in its entirety, while Netflix and Comcast have been putting together bids for the company’s streaming and studio operations. Warner Bros. Discovery has set a Nov. 20 deadline for “nonbinding first-round bids” and the media company is aiming to have the process wrapped up by year-end, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\n\tIssa’s letter says, “I am writing regarding recent and continuing reports that Netflix is seeking to acquire Warner Brothers (Bros.) Discovery’s studio and streaming properties. As you are aware, Netflix is already the dominant streaming platform in the United States and permitting it to absorb a major competitor raises antitrust concerns that could result in a harm to consumers.”\n\n\tThe letter continues, “With more than 300 million global subscribers and a vast content library, Netflix currently wields unequaled market power. Adding both HBO Max’s subscribers and Warner Bros.’ premier content rights would further enhance this position, reportedly pushing the combined entity above a 30 percent share of the streaming market: a threshold traditionally viewed as presumptively problematic under antitrust law.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix stopped sharing subscriber figures at the beginning of 2025, as its sub growth has begun to slow down and the company wants investors to focus more on financial and user-engagement metrics. In its most recent announcements, the company describes itself as “one of the world’s leading entertainment services with over 300 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.”\n\n\tIssa also writes, “Of further concern is that this consolidation would also diminish incentives to produce new content and major theatrical releases — evidenced by Netflix’s own statements dismissing movie theatres as ‘outdated’ — which could undermine opportunities for the full range of industry professionals both in front of and behind the camera.”\n\n\tIssa was referencing a remark by Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos at an industry conference earlier this year, in which the exec called theaters “an outdated concept.” \n\n\tAt the Time100 Summit in April, Sarandos said, “Folks grew up thinking, ‘I want to make movies on a gigantic screen and have strangers watch them [and to have them] play in the theater for two months and people cry and sold-out shows … It’s an outdated concept.” He also called the communal moviegoing experience “an outmoded idea,” noting, “If you’re fortunate to live enough in Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.”\n\n\tIssa’s letter to the Trump administration officials concludes, “I appreciate the Administration’s determined efforts to promote competitive markets and establish a record of regulatory common sense. I urge you continue to protect a critical American industry, enhance consumer choice, and safeguard vital American jobs.”\n\n\tVariety has reached out to Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery for comment.\n",

However, our sources say there was nothing \"deep\" about it, as Scooter's lawyers were never even involved in the brief discussion.\n      \n    \n          Based purely on the numbers, though, it's not too difficult to see why someone in Braun's position might be interested in acquiring OF -- it reportedly made $6.6 billion in revenue in 2024.\n      \n    \n          In May, Reuters reported Blairas was in talks with the Forest Road Company investor group to make a sale.\n      \n    \n          As you know, Braun rose to power in the music world after he discovered Justin Bieber on YouTube in 2007. He managed his career for more than 15 years ... plus other big celebs like Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Scooter's gone on to strike several blockbuster showbiz deals ... none more famous than his 2019 purchase -- and subsequent sale -- of Taylor Swift's master recordings of her first 6 albums. Of course, that lead to a very public feud between them.\n      \n    \n          Taylor's since re-recorded most of those albums, and has since bought back her OG masters.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Scooter Braun\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                OnlyFans\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

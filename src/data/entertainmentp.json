    "body": "\n\tThe sci-fi sequel “Predator: Badlands” is opening atop the theatrical food chain, while a bunch of adult-skewing wide releases like Jennifer Lawrence’s “Die My Love,” Sydney Sweeney’s “Christy” and Russell Crowe and Rami Malek’s “Nuremberg” are debuting further down the charts. \n\n\tThe “Predator” entry got to the chopper with $15.6 million across Friday and preview screenings in 3,725 locations. That puts it on the path to land well ahead of its pre-weekend projections, which had forecast an opening from $25 million to $30 million. As a comp, “Alien: Romulus” — another Disney revival of a sci-fi property that it acquired in the 20th Century Fox merger of 2019 — earned $42 million in its August 2024 debut.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking of “Alien,” “Predator: Badlands” even has an outside shot at the biggest theatrical bow ever for the “Predator” franchise if it overachieves Saturday. The record is held by the 2004 crossover “Alien vs. Predator” ($38 million). But it’s worth nothing that the “Predator” series has been out of theaters in recent years. The last two entries — the 2022 prequel “Prey” and this year’s animated anthology “Predator: Killer of Killers” — debuted directly on Hulu and Disney+. Director Dan Trachtenberg, who helmed both of those features, returned for the PG-13-rated “Badlands,” which stars newcomer Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi as a young Predator outcast and Elle Fanning as his legless android companion.\n\n\n\tDisney spent $105 million on producing “Predator: Badlands,” plus more on marketing expenses. It’s a considerable budget, but far less than the $180 million that the studio put towards its recent sci-fi flop “Tron: Ares.” “Badlands” will outperform the $33 million opening weekend of “Ares,” plus it has better reviews to boost word-of-mouth in the weeks ahead. Audiences liked it too, as moviegoer survey firm Cinema Score polled an “A-” grade from early crowds.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the weekend’s other new wide releases, Amazon MGM Studios’ “Sarah’s Oil” is faring the best, heading to a fourth place bow after earning $1.7 million across Friday and previews in 2,410 locations. Projections are at $4.4 million for the weekend. The early-1900s-set drama, about one of the first Black women to become a millionaire, comes from Wonder Project and Kingdom Story. Not many critics have reviewed it, though Cinema Score turned in the highest marks possible with an “A+” grade.\n\n\tSony Pictures Classics has the historical courtroom drama “Nuremberg” in 1,802 locations after premiering it at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. It’s in the race for fifth. Grosses hit about $1.4 million across Friday and previews. Reviews lean positive for the James Vanderbilt-directed period piece, though it’s hardly a critical darling. SPC acquired rights from producers Walden Media and Bluestone Entertainment in June.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Mubi has Lynne Ramsay’s “Die My Love,” starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, in 1,983 locations. It’s the widest release ever for the indie-focused banner, which bowed “The Substance” in 1,949 theaters last year for a $3.2 million debut. That horror movie legged out to $17 million domestic and $77 million worldwide, becoming a significant awards season force along the way.\n\n\tHere’s hoping Mubi has a similar longterm vision for “Die My Love,” after earning roughly $1 million across Friday and previews. The company acquired the starry drama for $24 million in what was the most high-profile deal out of this year’s Cannes Film Festival. General audiences didn’t go for the arthouse title, with Cinema Score turning in a terrible “D+” grade.\n\n\tOpening outside the top 10, Black Bear is making its maiden voyage as a distributor with its release of “Christy,” starring Sydney Sweeney as boxer Christy Martin. Playing in 2,011 locations, the drama had a very quiet start, with roughly $670,000 across Friday and previews. Black Bear has looked to position “Christy” as a best actress Oscar contender, kicking off with a premiere at Toronto. Much like “Nuremberg,” reviews are respectable but hardly superlative. Audiences like the movie at a “B+” grade from Cinema Score.\n\n\tSecond place looks to go to Paramount’s drama “Regretting You,” earning another $2.2 million on Friday and projecting a $7.3 million third weekend for a slim 7% drop. The Colleen Hoover adaptation has shown good holds since its opening and looks to hit a $38 million total domestic gross through Sunday.\n\t\n\n\tIn third, Universal’s “Black Phone 2” earned $1.5 million on Friday and is projecting $5.2 million for its fourth outing, down just 38% from its prior frame. The Blumhouse sequel looks to hit a total domestic gross of $70 million through Sunday, pacing a touch behind its 2022 predecessor ($72 million through four weekends).\n\n\tFocus Features’ kidnap thriller “Bugonia” looks to round out the top five, earning $1.1 million on Friday and projecting $3.7 million for its second weekend of wide release (down 26%). The Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone reunion should hit a $12.5 million domestic total through Sunday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for Guillermo del Toro‘s “Frankenstein,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tGuillermo del Toro has often said that Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel “Frankenstein” is like his Bible. Now, he’s brought his vision to life with the release of his own film adaptation on Netflix, starring Oscar Isaac as mad genius Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the Creature.\n\n\n\tOf course, Shelley’s story is one of the most adapted tales of all time, spurring classic monster flicks like James Whale’s 1931 movie — in which the Creature was portrayed as it’s perhaps best known, a green-hued monster with a flat head and bolts in its neck — as well as more faithful retellings of the original text like Kenneth Branagh’s 1994 take “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.” \n\t\n\n\tThough del Toro made it clear that his “Frankenstein” may not be the most accurate adaptation — the character of Elizabeth (played by Mia Goth) is essentially reinvented, Victor has been given a new backstory and characters like Victor’s friend Henry Clerval and servant Justine Moritz are eliminated — he instead set out to capture the novel’s heart. \n\n\t“The usual discourse of Frankenstein has to do with science gone awry,” del Toro told Variety in a cover story in August. “But for me, it’s about the human spirit. It’s not a cautionary tale: It’s about forgiveness, understanding and the importance of listening to each other.”\n\n\tSo, just how well does del Toro’s version stack up against Mary Shelley’s original novel? We asked Julie Carlson, an English professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and an expert on the British Romantic period and the Wollstonecraft-Godwin-Shelley family, for her thoughts.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your initial reaction to the film — did you enjoy it?\t\n\n\tI did. I always like when serious artists take serious work seriously. I did feel, certainly in comparison to other renditions, there was real love for the book and for Mary Shelley’s brilliance. It was more faithful to the framed narrative, to the ways that Victor and the Creature get to tell their own story. And also, I thought it did a good job of capturing the language in the book. The Creature, at times, is very lyrical — not as lyrical as in the book, but still it’s clear there’s all kinds of philosophical pronouncements going on. \n\t\n\t\tDel Toro’s film adds to Victor’s backstory by making his father a physician who abused him (and possibly let his mother die in childbirth so he could experiment on her). How does this shift affect the story’s themes?\t\n\n\tIt’s less about hubris, although of course that’s there, and more about shame. The way the father slaps [Victor] around when he can’t learn his lessons, and then he strikes the Creature when the Creature doesn’t learn as quickly as he wants him to — I think that’s interesting. It seemed to me there was a little less Faustian stuff about knowledge and power, and more about knowledge and shame and not living up to the name Victor or his father’s reputation. And that’s what he says [to his father]: You failed, because the mother dies, and I’m going to beat you [in cheating death]. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein in “Frankenstein.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKen Woroner/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne of the characters del Toro takes the most liberties with is Elizabeth. Instead of being engaged to Victor like in the book, she is betrothed to his younger brother William, who is grown up instead of a young child. What do you make of this?\t\n\n\tThe Elizabeth stuff is very different. Of course, in these days, I think it would have to go in that direction. She’s quite passive in the book; she doesn’t have much to do. Here, she’s very independent, she’s a scientist herself, an entomologist. It seemed to me that this was one of those moments where [del Toro] is really in the book, because there is a kind of throwaway line where Victor describes Elizabeth as “playful as an insect.” And so, it was very interesting that that’s her passion in the film. In general, people whitewash that line and say it means she was flitting around [like an insect]. But that’s another thing about the book that the film touches on, where Shelley gets much more at the ways in which [Victor] is lying to himself as well as to everybody else. And Elizabeth in the film points that out a couple times, especially when he comes to wish her and William well at the marriage and she says basically, “No you don’t.” So she, in the film, articulates Victor’s kind of delusional qualities in the sense of the need to present himself a certain way.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere’s also been much discussion about Elizabeth’s relationship with the Creature in del Toro’s film. In the book, they never meet until he murders her on her wedding night to Victor out of revenge. In the movie, they interact several times, she’s the only one to show him empathy and eventually dies protecting him. Did you find the connection between them to be romantic and do you think that diminishes Shelley’s message at all?\t\n\n\tI think she identifies with him. One of the first things she says to him is, “Are you hurt?” Yes, there’s a real connection, but it’s not so eroticized for me. She does say, when she’s dying, “Love is brief; I am glad I found it with you.” So maybe, yeah, it skirts those edges. But I think a couple of times she says, “I’m odd,” because she’s an entomologist and no one understands her. So I think there is a sympathy between the Creature and Elizabeth that is about being a subordinated figure. It’s hard to take it as seriously in the film, just because she’s an aristocrat, but I think that’s more the connection. For Mary Shelley, it’s such a patriarchal world in the book. All the women — the mother, Elizabeth and Justine — are basically just sacrificed to patriarchy. And I like that del Toro doesn’t try to make it quite so heavy-handed like that. But I think that’s part of what their connection is.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJacob Elordi as the Creature and Mia Goth as Elizabeth in “Frankenstein.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAs you mentioned, a large theme in the book is the persistent violence against women and unfair treatment of oppressed people. Did you feel this was still communicated in the film?\t\n\n\tI think the film downplays what was so strong in Shelley’s “Frankenstein”: the social critique. [The film] is a structural critique. It’s more about war, militarism, capitalism — which is fine, I mean that is something we need to be worried about. But in the book and in other films, the sympathy for the Creature is about how nobody can stand him because of how he looks. It’s about how people read you. And the film doesn’t do that, certainly not at the beginning. In the book, Victor runs away as soon as the Creature opens his eyes because he’s so horrified. [In the movie], he parents for a while and only leaves when he gets frustrated. So in a certain way, that would not be true to the book, but [it is] in the way that Shelley is really thinking about maternity, paternity and what one owes to one’s progeny, whether it’s a book or a baby. But the way that “Frankenstein” often is read is about the socially oppressed. I’d say [the film is] less overtly about women’s oppression, enslavement — that’s less of its concern, although it’s there.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDel Toro’s film features one of the most human-like Creatures yet, and we don’t see him go on quite the killing rampage as in the book, which stirs up more sympathy. What are your thoughts on this difference?\t\n\n\tI do really like that he humanizes the Creature and does a lot more with face-to-face communication. It’s almost like [French philosopher Emmanuel] Levinas in that way: when you behold the face of the other, you can’t murder them. But it skirts over some of the questions of responsibility that I think Mary Shelley already, even at 19, is wondering about. People keep trying to shoot him [in the film], but it’s not like we are to fear him. And we are to fear him. It’s not because he’s ugly — but for Shelley, if you turn something loose in the world, that is fearful.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJacob Elordi as the Creature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne of the parts of the book that isn’t usually put to screen is the Creature’s time with the De Lacey family and the blind old man. What did you think of this inclusion?\t\n\n\tI think that’s one of the most faithful to the book. I am very interested in the notion of friendship in my work, and it really played that up. That was very interesting to me — that he emphasized that so much and as a way outside of, say, heterosexual or even homoerotic transfers. The film is not very sexual in any way, so you don’t really feel that’s a big preoccupation, but friendship was a big thing at least in that scene.\n\t\n\t\tCompared to other film adaptations of “Frankenstein,” how does del Toro’s measure up overall?\t\n\n\tIt’s closer to the multi-layered nature of Shelley’s text. It really does divide the film like the book and frames it in the same way. And it’s really not a horror film, it’s a gothic film. I think some of the other film versions also are interested in the big questions, but they seem to treat them serially or mainly about one thing or another, whereas this one does try to get at various components of what the book is after — but not always successfully. I think many of the film versions aren’t trying to be faithful to Mary Shelley. I would certainly say it’s more like the book, and it’s trying to honor not just the book, but Mary Shelley and that whole group [Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, etc.].\n\t\n\n\tThis conversation has been edited and condensed. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAlexandre O. Philippe has made films about Lynch, Hitchcock or William Friedkin. But there’s one that got away. At least for now.  \n\n\t“Nicolas Roeg. He holds more mysteries to me than any other director,” he says. Roeg, who passed away in 2018, is best known for “Don’t Look Now” and “Walkabout.”\n\n\t“I feel like I haven’t spent the time with his films that I need to spend, and I keep wanting to go back and understand how he worked. There’s one film in particular that dabbles in a really strange kind of cinematic magic and that’s ‘Eureka’ with Gene Hackman.” \n\t\n\n\tSet to receive the Indie Star Award at Tauron American Film Festival, Philippe has become known for analyzing cinema history in his detailed docs. Recently, he’s been also delivering intimate portraits of William Shatner or Kim Novak in “Kim Novak’s Vertigo,” the latter of which premiered in Venice. \n\n\n\t“There’s definitely been a shift towards the personal. I’m very interested in craft, but the emotion of cinema is really what I’m most passionate about,” he agrees.\n\n\t“For me, it really started with William Friedkin, just having that personal connection with him and spending so much time together. We were able to dig deep.” Philippe talked about the late director in “Leap of Faith: William Friedkin on The Exorcist.” \n\n\tHis secret to getting close?\n\n\t“The best way to answer this is that I’m not looking for gossip,” he says. \n\n\t“I don’t have an agenda other than making sure I give them the time and the space to show themselves as they are. They all have a reputation for being extremely guarded. Everyone was terrified of Friedkin. And Shatner? [Songwriter] Ben Folds said he eats directors for breakfast. Kim Novak is a complete recluse.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd yet he was allowed to “go up into her attic, pick up boxes and spend the night going through them.” \n\n\t“It’s crazy that we had that level of comfort. We still do.” \n\n\tHe adds: “With Kim, for example, I wasn’t interested in her relationship with Sammy Davis Jr. – Colman Domingo is already making a film about that with Sydney Sweeney. I’m more interested in what makes them tick. What gets under their skin? In ‘You Can Call Me Bill’ there’s a whole chapter dedicated to loneliness, which is Shatner’s deepest fear. You’ve never seen him like that.” \n\n\tPhilippe is slowly preparing to make his own fiction films, too. \n\n\t“It’ll either be a western or a horror, but it’s hard to make a unique horror with something to say. I’m a big fan of ‘Weapons’ and was super impressed by ‘Longlegs.’ I’d love to make a horror film that gets under the audience’s skin in an unexpected way,” he admits.\n\n\tIn the meantime, he’ll continue proving to people “there’s no one right way to look at a film.” \n\n\t“When I was touring with ‘78/52,’ I said I could make nothing but movies about that [‘Psycho’] shower scene for the rest of my life, and I would still have a full and fascinating life as a filmmaker,” he laughs. Initially, “Memory: The Origins of Alien” was supposed to be about the infamous chestburster scene. \n\n\t“I thought: ‘Why don’t I apply the same model I applied to ‘78/52’ and talk about that instead of the shower scene? They’re both completely shocking and changed the course of cinema. But it just didn’t work.”\n\n\tPhilippe recalls: “They operate in very, very different ways. The shower scene was the scene people wanted to see back then. It said: ‘The1950s are over. Welcome to the 1960s.’ The chestburster scene was not the scene people wanted to see. They wanted friendly aliens and E.T. It was 40 years ahead of its time.”\n\n\tHe started reading about Ridley Scott showing H.R. Giger Francis Bacon’s triptychs. “You realize these three figures in his triptychs are the Furies of Greek mythology. I started geeking out, thinking about the mythological roots of the Xenomorph.”\n\n\tA film about distant future turned into a film about distant past, he says. “The lesson I learned from that was that, well, you should never be lazy. My job as a filmmaker is to pay attention to what the film actually wants to be.”\n\t\n\n\tAlthough he delves deeply into the movies he loves, he never intends to reveal all their secrets.  \n\n\t“It’s not about: ‘Let me explain what David Lynch or Kim Novak are all about.’ With Kim, the feedback I’ve been getting is that she seems even more mysterious now. That’s the best compliment I could ever get.”\n\n\tHe adds: “People have always asked me if David Lynch watched ‘Lynch/Oz.’ He certainly never told me that. Back in March we had a screening in the wake of his death and, of course, someone asked about it again. A week later, I got a message from critic Matt Fagerholm. He said: ‘An old dear friend of David’s asked me to tell you he watched it and loved it’.”\n\n\t“It moved me tremendously. He understood my intent was not to ‘solve’ David Lynch – that would be preposterous – but to deepen the mystery.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFlorian Zeller, a world-acclaimed playwright who made his directorial debut with the Oscar-winning film “The Father” starring Anthony Hopkins, has joined the Académie Française, a prestigious French literary society founded in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu. \n\n\tCreated during the prolific reign of Louis XIV, the Académie Française has played a significant role in shaping French culture, preserving and updating the country’s language, grammar and usage over time. \n\t\n\n\tThe 40 members of the Académie Française, called “immortals,” are famous writers, philosophers and scientists, such as Victor Hugo, Corneille, Edmond Rostand, Jean Cocteau and Eugene Ionesco. At the age of 46, Zeller is the second youngest member ever elected by the society, following Rostand, the author of “Cyrano de Bergerac,” who was 33 when he joined in 1901.\n\n\n\tZeller is currently in pre-production with his third feature, “Bunker,” which will mark his anticipated follow-up to the emotionally gripping “The Son” with Hugh Jackman.  A psychological thriller, “Bunker” will start filming in Spain next month with Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem, alongside Stephen Graham (“Adolescence”). The film revolves around an architect who accepts a morally ambiguous project — building a survivalist bunker for a tech billionaire — and his wife, who begins to question their marriage after 17 years together.\n\n\t“The Father” and “The Son” are part of a trilogy of plays by Zeller that have traveled around the world. He’s written a dozen more plays. The Paris native author and filmmaker also runs Blue Morning Pictures, a production company that’s part of Mediawan, with Federica Sainte-Rose. Zeller’s upcoming production credits include “Alone Together,” Ben Sharrock‘s (“Limbo”) next film starring Callum Turner (“Masters of the Air”) and Adria Arjona (“Splitsville”). \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe voice cast for animated movie “Unknownia” – directed by “Cryptozoo’s” Dash Shaw – will feature Tim Roth, Barbara Sukowa, Angeliki Papoulia, Larry Fessenden, Robbie Crandall and Sabrina Sickler.\n\n\tIn the film, little Rory needs to save her father who’s disappeared on a treasure quest during an unfortunate encounter with a dragon. Luckily, a weasel or mysterious beings called The Shapes are there to help. \n\n\n\t“Tim was my hero. ‘Reservoir Dogs’ was the reason I went to film school. I really tried not to geek out on Tim Roth in the recording studio,” said Kyle Martin, who produces alongside Jane Samborski and Emily Wolver for Electric Chinoland and Mubi. \n\t\n\n\t“When Tim came in and started doing the weasel, we were like: ‘Oh my God, this is so not what we thought we wanted. And boy, were we wrong.’ That’s exactly how this weasel should sound like. At that point we’d been working on this for years, and yet it completely changed the meaning of the scenes. Tim is just that kind of a performer.” \n\n\tThe whole cast brought their own ideas, he stated, underlining Shaw wanted to stay away from “broad, cartoony voices.” \n\n\t“He really likes an interesting voice, one that has texture to it or an accent. Angeliki, Tim, Barbara – they all check that box. As performers, they have very varied backgrounds and they bring something to the characters that certainly adds depth. It breathes life into them.”\n\n\tMartin added: “When you watch this, and the same thing happened with ‘Cryptozoo,’ you’re really feeling these characters, you know? That was the goal.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd yet “Unknownia,” presented at Tauron American Film Festival’s industry event U.S. in Progress, is “very different” from festival hit “Cryptozoo.” Also visually. \n\n\t“Cryptozoo’ was R-rated. There was nudity. This is not that. It’s a PG movie and a fantasy adventure,” said Martin. Awarded at Sundance, “Cryptozoo” focused on people trying their best to protect endangered mythical creatures. \n\n\t“We want ‘Unknownia’ to be more of a family movie for kids. Dash and Jane [Samborski] made it with their daughter Castle in mind. They wanted this to be something that they could share with her and it was factored into the look as well.”\n\n\tThe director agreed: “When you’re 10 or 11 years old, you see an unusual animated movie for the first time. Maybe it’s your first non-Disney film – something like ‘The Secret of Nimh’ or ‘Spirited Away’ – and it’s like the 10-year-old’s version of discovering the French New Wave,” Dash Shaw wrote to Variety.  \n\n\t“It’s like: ‘Oh wow, a movie can be like this? Nobody told me.’ ‘Unknownia’ is that movie we made for our daughter.”\n\n\tAccording to Martin, “Unknownia” was born out of a “legacy of Miyazaki films and independent alternative animation.” \n\n\t“Also narratively, because many of his films [made for Studio Ghibli] have a young female protagonist that’s on this coming-of-age journey. The dream would be to be thought of in that same category,” he said.\n\n\t“International audiences are more familiar with that. In the U.S., it just doesn’t exist. There’s big studio stuff coming from Pixar or DreamWorks and nothing else except foreign films that get brought in. There’s really no independent English-language animation, so in a way, it’s in its own lane.”\n\n\tDuring her journey, Rory will come to a realization that those she used to unquestionably admire are ultimately just human as well.\n\n\t“It’s about wealth and greed, but it really is about that experience of learning that the people you look up to as a young child, your parents, your elders, have their own problems and their own flaws. They might not be the best role models,” said Martin.\n\n\t“For me, personally, it’s a sad realization, although it’s something everybody goes through and relates to. It might be a little melancholic, but the movie is hopeful.”\n",

Judge Juhas reached the right decision. Ms. Richards has shown remarkable courage, not only in surviving abuse, but in maintaining her dignity amid an ongoing campaign of false and malicious statements by her ex-husband to the media. Her strength, grace, and resolve have been unwavering. Today’s ruling rightly holds Mr. Phypers accountable for his actions.”\n      \n    \n          As we reported ... Denise filed for a restraining order after Aaron filed for divorce, accusing him of domestic violence during their 6-year marriage.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          The restraining order also calls for Aaron to return a laptop Denise claims he stole from her ... and he's barred from sharing pictures of her. The order also says Aaron must delete any videos of Denise's surgeries from all his electronic devices and iCloud account.\n      \n    \n          Denise testified in court that Aaron's abuse resulted in at least 3 concussions and made her fear for her life.\n      \n    \n          Aaron denied the allegations from the jump, but in the end, the judge sided with Denise.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Denise Richards\n              \n                          \n                Aaron Phypers\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

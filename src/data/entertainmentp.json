    "body": "\n\tPaul Dano is set to star in A24‘s drama “The Chaperones.”\n\n\tHe’s joining the already-announced cast of Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson, two young actors who recently shared the screen in Lionsgate’s dystopian thriller “The Long Walk.”\n\n\tIndia Donaldson is directing “The Chaperones,” marking her sophomore feature after her 2024 drama “Good One.” This film is set days after Christmas and follows three slacker friends who are hired to transport a troubled teen across the country. Sebastian Black is writing the screenplay in his feature debut.\n\t\n\n\tRobert Pattinson’s production company Icki Eneo Arlo and Brad Pitt’s production company Plan B will serve as producers on the film. “The Chaperones” marks multiple reunions for Dano, who previously starred in “12 Years a Slave” and “Okja” for Plan B and played the Riddler opposite Pattinson in “The Batman.” Adam Wyatt Tate, a producer on “How to Blow Up a Pipeline” and “Atropia,” will executive produce.\n\n\n\tDano, an Emmy nominee for “Escape at Dannemora” and “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” is known for big-screen projects such as indie darling “Little Miss Sunshine,” Paul Thomas Anderson’s “There Will Be Blood,” Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans” and the Game Stop meme-stock drama “Dumb Money.”\n\n\tEarlier this year, Dano starred in the Venice Film Festival drama “The Wizard of the Kremlin,” in which he portrayed a fictional reality TV producer who unexpectedly becomes the spin doctor of a young Vladimir Putin. Dano is represented by WME, Anonymous Content and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher.\n\n\tA24’s upcoming film slate includes the afterlife romantic-comedy “Eternity,” Timothee Chalamet and Josh Safdie’s table-tennis drama “Marty Supreme” and queer rom-com “Pillion” starring Alexander Skarsgard. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDaniel Day-Lewis recently told the U.K.’s Big Issue that Brian Cox is one of the reasons he’s been dragged into an unwanted debate around Method acting. Cox has spoken out against Method acting in various interviews over the last few years, frequently citing his “Succession” co-star Jeremy Strong as an example of why the acting style is “fucking annoying.” Cox once speculated that Day-Lewis had to break from acting at 55 years old due to the burn out of being a Method actor, saying Day-Lewis “couldn’t go on doing that every day.”\n\t\n\n\t“Listen, I worked with Brian Cox once and got somehow drawn into this handbags-at-dawn conflict inadvertently,” Day-Lewis now told Big Issue (via The Telegraph). “Brian is a very fine actor who’s done extraordinary work. As a result, he’s been given a soapbox… which he shows no sign of climbing down from. Any time he wants to talk about it, I’m easy to find.”\n\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, Cox even floated a connection between Jeremy Strong’s Method acting and Daniel Day-Lewis since “Jeremy was Day-Lewis’ assistant. So he’s learned all that stuff from Dan.” But Day-Lewis does not agree.\n\n\t“If I thought during our work together I’d interfered with his working process, I’d be appalled,” Day-Lewis told Big Issue. “But I don’t think it was like that. So I don’t know where the fuck that came from. Jeremy Strong is a very fine actor, I don’t know how he goes about things, but I don’t feel responsible in any way for that.”\n\n\t“I just don’t like it being misrepresented to the extent it has been,” Day-Lewis continued about Method acting. “I can’t think of a single commentator who’s gobbed off about the Method that has any understanding of how it works and the intention behind it. They focus on, ‘Oh, he lived in a jail cell for six months.’  Those are the least important details. In all the performing arts, people find their methods as a means to an end.”\n\t\n\n\tDay-Lewis stressed that Method acting is simply about “freeing yourself so you present your colleagues with a living, breathing human being they can interact with,” adding: “It’s very simple. So it pisses me off this whole ‘Oh, he went full Method’ thing. What the fuck, you know? Because it’s invariably attached to the idea of some kind of lunacy. I choose to stay and splash around, rather than jump in and out or play practical jokes with whoopee cushions between takes or whatever people think is how you should behave as an actor.”\n\n\tStrong appeared on the cover of GQ magazine in February 2023 and directly addressed Cox’s comments about his Method acting. Strong said he hadn’t spoken directly with Cox or any of his other “Succession” co-stars about all the headlines his Method acting creates.\n\n\t“Everyone’s entitled to have their feelings,” Strong said. “I also think Brian Cox, for example, he’s earned the right to say whatever the fuck he wants. There was no need to address that or do damage control… I feel a lot of love for my siblings and my father on the show. And it is like a family in the sense that — and I’m sure they would say this, too — you don’t always like the people that you love. I do always respect them.”\n\n\tThrough all of the complaints about his Method acting, Strong told GQ never once considered changing his approach.\n\n\t“Am I going to adjust or compromise the way that I’ve worked my whole life and what I believe in? There wasn’t a flicker of doubt about that,” Strong said. “I’m still going to do whatever it takes to serve whatever it is. Which is not to say that that is the same thing as riding roughshod over other people. It has to do with autonomous concentration. It’s a very solitary thing. I think there’s very low impact on others except for what they might want to project onto it and how that might make them feel.”\n\n\tAs for Day-Lewis, the three-time Oscar winner has been making the press rounds in support of his new movie “Anemone.” The film marks Day-Lewis’ return to acting after an extended hiatus following 2017’s “Phantom Thread.” He’s defended Method acting in various interviews on the press tour.\n\n\t “All the recent commentary in the last few years about Method acting is invariably from people who have little or no understanding of what it actually involves,” Day-Lewis said at the London Film Festival last month. “It’s almost as if it’s some specious science that we’re involved in, or a cult. But it’s just a way of freeing yourself so that the spontaneity, when you are working with your colleagues in front of the camera, that you are free to respond in any way that you’ll move to in that moment.”\n\t\n\n\tHead over to Big Issue’s website to read more from Day-Lewis.\n",

    "description": "\n\tA spinoff of CBS’ long-running series, “The Neighborhood,” Paramount’s “Crutch” is a hilarious sitcom about family, community and the ups and downs ",
    "body": "\n\tA spinoff of CBS’ long-running series, “The Neighborhood,” Paramount’s “Crutch” is a hilarious sitcom about family, community and the ups and downs of life. Created by Owen Smith, the show follows Francois “Crutch” Crutchfield (Tracy Morgan), the Harlem-dwelling cousin of Calvin, (Cedric the Entertainer), the central character on “The Neighborhood.” Crutch is a widower and business owner who is just starting to enjoy his empty nest when his adult children and grandchildren move back into his brownstone. Stuffed full of laugh-out-loud moments, a robust and talented cast and some iconic guest stars, the show is fun, refreshing and well thought-out. \n\t\n\n\t“Crutch” begins in Harlem with a celebration. Jake (Jermaine Fowler), Crutch’s son, has just graduated from Columbia Law School, and his father couldn’t be more thrilled. In celebration, Jake’s older sister, Jamilah (Adrianna Mitchell), and her kids, Lisa (Braxton Paul) and Mase (Finn Maloney), travel to New York for the festivities. Additionally, Calvin and Tina (Tichina Arnold) fly in to indulge in the party.\n\n\n\tThrilled to have his family in town for a visit, nothing can dampen Crutch’s spirit, not even his sister-in-law, Toni (Kecia Lewis), with whom he has an antagonistic but loving relationship. However, things take a turn after Crutch learns that Jamilah isn’t in town solely for the soiree. She reluctantly reveals she has separated from her gambling-addict husband and needs a place for her and the children to stay for the summer. Things get even stickier when Jake reveals he’s resigned from his role at a prestigious law firm to work in legal aid, which means he will no longer be able to afford his wildly expensive Manhattan apartment. \n\t\n\n\tAcross the eight-episode first season, the Crutchfields navigate living under one roof while trying to maintain their own autonomy. Crutch tries to be a support system for his kids despite simultaneously tiptoeing on their boundaries. His antics, which include hysterical subway-riding tutorials and his earnest but confounding interventions, come from a good place. Meanwhile, Jake and Jamilah try to orient themselves in this new and unexpected phase back in their childhood home. Minnesota-raised Mase and Lisa are eager to indulge in the fast-paced New York City and be spoiled by their grandfather. Finally, Toni, the voice of reason, continually uses her spare key and good sense to keep everyone sane. \n\n\tA multi-camera comedy filmed before a studio audience, “Crutch” has all the makings of a classic sitcom. The situations are absurd, but the series takes it a step further, using explicit, colorful language because on CBS’ streamer, network rules and regulations do not restrict the dialogue. Episode 3, “Emotional Crutch,” is both amusing and sincere. Feeling increasingly disconnected from Jake, Crutch invites his son to host a game night at his flooring store. However, Crutch does not anticipate millennial men being so emotionally expressive. After seeing Calvin easily connect with the younger men via FaceTime, Crutch realizes that, for him and Jake to form and maintain a stronger father-son bond, he must learn to communicate differently. \n\n\tIn addition to the episodic narrative, the show works well thanks to its standout cast. Ms. Pearl (a thrilling Luenell) is Crutch’s brash and nosy neighbor, always perched on her fire escape, eavesdropping and adding her two cents to the Crutchfields’ lives. Moreover, Flaco (Adrian Martinez), Crutch’s best friend and employee, appears in more of the comedy’s slapstick sequences while riffing on Morgan’s signature style. Guest spots from Arsenio Hall, Deon Cole and Vanessa A. Williams also add depth and specificity to this sitcom. \n\n\tOverall, “Crutch” is engaging and easy to watch. Morgan easily steps into the role of a stubborn but well-meaning patriarch who wants the best for his family. Weaving in real-world insights, generational divides, money woes and an ever-changing community, the series is charming, well-developed, and could undoubtedly have a long life both on streaming and on the network. (Which would require some light censoring, of course.) \n\t\n\n\tAll eight episodes of “Crutch” are now streaming on Paramount+.\n",

    "description": "\n\tWhat’s it like to face the daunting task of playing the three most famous characters and friends from the “Harry Potter” Wizarding World?\n\n\tVariety ",
    "body": "\n\tWhat’s it like to face the daunting task of playing the three most famous characters and friends from the “Harry Potter” Wizarding World?\n\n\tVariety recently spoke with young British actors Frankie Treadaway (14), Max Lester (13) and Arabella Stanton (11), who provide the voices of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively, in the first three “Harry Potter” audiobooks from Audible. The upshot: All three — who are already accomplished actors with notable credits — were very excited indeed about the opportunity to portray the kid wizards.\n\t\n\n\tTreadaway, asked what his reaction was when he found out he landed the role of Harry Potter in the first three books, said it was one of “just pure amazement, to be honest. With such a famous character, associating you with him is just mind-blowing.”\n\n\n\tStanton said for her, it was “a pinch-me moment. It’s like, ‘Have I actually got this?’ It was just so amazing when I found out.” (Stanton subsequently landed the part of Hermione in the forthcoming HBO series.) And Lester confessed that his first thought was, “I don’t believe this is real… And still now, I can’t believe that I’m a part of this, and I’m in this amazing role with an amazing cast.”\n\n\tAre they actual friends the way that Harry, Hermione and Ron are in the “Harry Potter” books? “Well, yeah, of course we are!” said Treadaway. “I think we’ve formed a bond over this period of time when we were doing this.”\n\n\tThe first audiobook in the series, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, Nov. 4, exclusively on Audible, with each of the remaining six releasing monthly worldwide. (A second group of actors — Jaxon Knopf, Rhys Mulligan and Nina Barker-Francis — will voice Harry, Ron and Hermione, respectively, for books 4-7.) The cast of 200-plus actors for the Audible “Harry Potter” books includes Hugh Laurie as Dumbledore and Matthew Macfadyen as Voldemort.\n\t\n\n\tFor Treadaway, Stanton and Lester, the amount of time they spent in the recording studio for Audible’s “Harry Potter: The Full Cast Audio Editions” was relatively short — about a week or so to cover all three books. Most of the time, they were not together: They recorded their lines separately with other actors speaking the other parts, but the trio did come together for some of the group scenes.\n\n\tTo prepare for the parts, the three said they watched (or rewatched) the Warner Bros. movies starring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. Stanton said she read the original books to understand Hermione’s state of mind at different parts in the story. “I think Hermione can be portrayed in many different ways,” said Stanton. “She’s quite a well-to-do girl — and she is very smart and is very keen to learn.”\n\n\tFor Lester, one challenge was adopting Ron Weasley’s rural English accent. That entailed “getting your vowels longer and making your L’s longer and your R’s longer,” he said. “It was all new to me and it was weird, but I definitely got used to it. And I don’t know, sometimes in conversations now, I kind of slip them in there because it sounds right.”\n\n\tLester’s favorite part of the project was recording the scenes in which Ron was eating: Producers prepared and served the actors real food during the sessions. “It was so real!” he said. “It was even better if you did more takes.”\n\n\tThe producers of the “Harry Potter” audiobooks also provide props for the actors to, like the characters’ magic wands and Hogwarts robes. “If you had your wand, if you were doing a spell, you could practice doing that movement,” Stanton said. “And I really think all the tiny little things that they gave us really helped me personally to bring Hermione to life.”\n\n\tTreadaway, as he was recording, was cognizant of Radcliffe’s line deliveries from the movies. “I definitely did bear in mind what other previous things of Harry Potter were, just so people still have that familiarity with the character,” he said. But he also added “my spin on it.”\n\n\tThrough the experience, Stanton gained an appreciation of the different skills required for voice acting vs. acting for stage or screen. With the former, “you have to focus more on your voice and really portray your character through your voice with more emotion,” she said. “It’s quite hard because you have to sort of not over-enunciate, but really have nice and good diction whilst you’re speaking so that the mic picks up everything you’re saying.”\n\t\n\n\tTheir families, of course, have known about their casting in the Audible “Harry Potter” series for months. But the actors weren’t allowed to tell their friends or anyone else about the gigs until they were announced in early August. “When I did finally get round to telling my friends… they were properly impressed,” said Lester. “But when I [couldn’t] tell them, it was quite tough because I really wanted to say what I was doing!”\n\n\tTreadaway’s West End stage credits include performances in “Mary Poppins,” “Elf,” “Mrs. Doubtfire” and “Matilda the Musical,” while his TV credits include LJP Ltd.’s “My Lady Jane.” Lester’s acting career has included roles in “Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice” (Warner Bros.) and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” (Marvel), as well as stage roles in “Les Misérables” and “Leopoldstadt” in the West End and animation roles on Nickelodeon’s “Best Birthday Ever” and “Barbapapa.” Stanton played the title role in “Matilda the Musical” in the West End at the age of 9, before joining the original cast of “Starlight Express” (London) in the part of Control shortly after she turned 10.\n\n\tMeanwhile, none of the three have met J.K. Rowling, whose Pottermore Publishing is co-producing “Harry Potter: The Full Cast Audio Editions” with Audible. But they would welcome the chance.\n\n\t“I love her writing. I love the books,” said Stanton. “Hopefully we get to meet her in the future.”\n\n\tPictured above, l. to r.: Max Lester, Frankie Treadaway, Arabella Stanton\n",

    "body": "\n\tIssa Rae (“Insecure,” “Barbie”), Dan Stevens (“Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire,” “Zero Day”), Zach Cherry (“Severance”) and Kate Berlant (“Maddie’s Secret,” “Would It Kill You to Laugh”) have joined Lauren Miller Rogen’s contemporary comedy drama “Babies,” starring Anna Kendrick (“Woman of the Hour,” “Pitch Perfect” franchise, “Up in the Air”) and Seth Rogen (“The Studio,” “This Is the End,” “Pineapple Express”).\n\t\n\n\t“Babies” has just started shooting on location in Los Angeles with the support of the California Film Commission’s Film and Television Tax Credit.\n\n\n\tThe film centers on Annie (Kendrick) and her husband Aaron (Rogen), who are struggling with the decision of whether or not to bring a child into the world, and become instant co-parents when their newly-divorced friend moves into their home with her 4-year-old. “It is an ensemble comedy drama about the journey to parenthood… or not,” according to a statement.\n\n\tProducers include Lylas Pictures’ Lauren Miller Rogen and Jen W. Ray, AGC’s Stuart Ford, and Monarch’s Steve Barnett, with AGC’s Miguel A. Palos, Jr. and Zach Garrett, Monarch’s Alan Powell and Vicky Patel and Lylas’ Sophie Høegh serving as executive producers. AGC and CAA Media Finance are co-repping worldwide rights.\n\n\tRae created and starred in the hit HBO series “Insecure,” which garnered multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations, as well as a Peabody Award.\n\n\tRae has also appeared in “American Fiction,” “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” and “Barbie.”\n\t\n\n\tStevens first gained international attention as Matthew Crawley in Julian Fellowes’ “Downton Abbey” and later starred in Noah Hawley’s “Legion,” “Gaslit” (Hulu), and “Zero Day,” opposite Robert De Niro.\n\n\tRecent film credits include “Tilman Singer’s Cuckoo,” “Abigail” (Universal), “Eurovision” (Netflix), and “I’m Your Man.” Stevens recently wrapped “Godzilla x Kong: Supernova,” slated for a 2027 release.\n\n\tCherry is an Emmy-nominated actor and series regular on the acclaimed Apple TV+ drama “Severance.” He co-hosted three seasons of “The Great American Baking Show” on Roku and starred in Fox’s animated comedy “Duncanville” and Amazon Prime’s “Fallout.” His television credits include “Succession” (HBO), “Living With Yourself” (Netflix), “You” (Netflix), and “I Feel Bad” (NBC).\n\n\tOn film, Cherry appears in Nicole Holofcener’s “You Hurt My Feelings” alongside Julia Louis-Dreyfus, as well as “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming” and Steven Soderbergh’s “Unsane.”\n\n\tBerlant is an Emmy-nominated comedian, actress and writer. Her hit one-woman show “KATE” sold out in New York and L.A., and her special “Cinnamon in the Wind” garnered stellar reviews (both directed by Bo Burnham). She co-created and starred in A24/Peacock’s “Would It Kill You to Laugh?” with John Early. Other TV credits include “A League of Their Own,” “Nobody Wants This,” “All’s Fair” and a notable cameo in “The Bear.” Film credits include “Don’t Worry Darling,” “Dream Scenario,” “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “Sorry to Bother You” and upcoming “Maddie’s Secret” and “The Moment.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAMC Entertainment, which runs the world’s largest cinema chain, is elevating a number of senior executives across legal, marketing, corporate communications and business development departments.\n\n\tEdwin Gladbach has been named senior VP, general counsel and secretary after serving as interim general counsel and secretary since February. Gladbach, who joined AMC in 2009, will oversee all legal, regulatory and governance matters for AMC, providing counsel to the Board and senior leadership. He will report to the company’s chairman and CEO Adam Aron and sit on AMC’s executive committee. \n\t\n\n\tKelly Schemenauer was upped to VP, associate general counsel and assistant secretary and will keep reporting to Gladbach. A 20-year veteran of the company, Schemenauer will take an expanded leadership role in developing and implementing AMC’s legal and compliance strategies.\n\n\n\tCarrie Trotter will lead AMC’s marketing department as senior VP of marketing. Trotter, who has been with AMC for 15 years, will be responsible for the department’s role in delivering campaigns and brand experiences that bring patrons to the chain’s various locations. She will join the AMC senior leadership team and will report to Dan Ellis, chief operations, development and marketing officer.\n\n\tRyan Noonan is elevated to senior VP of public relations and will continue to report to Aron. Noonan joined AMC in 2010 and leads all of the company’s external media strategies and press interactions.\n\n\tEllen Copaken will assume a newly created role, senior VP of business development, and will be tasked with securing “potentially lucrative business opportunities” for AMC. She will also keep reporting to Aron and sit on AMC’s executive committee.\n\t\n\n\t“These leadership changes reflect our strong confidence in the deep bench of talent within AMC,” Aron said in a statement. “Eddie, Kelly, Carrie, Ryan and Ellen each have demonstrated exceptional dedication, expertise and strategic vision. As we remain steadfast with our mission to elevate every aspect of AMC, these senior leaders will help accelerate our progress and strengthen our position as the global leader in theatrical exhibition.”\n\n\tThese promotions come as AMC Theatres and the rest of the movie theater business have hustled to stay afloat amid the residual effects of the pandemic and Hollywood strikes. Though attendance has been stagnant since summer, business is expected to pick up in earnest with holiday releases including “Zootopia 2,” “Wicked: For Good” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Then 2026 is projected to rebound with “Avengers: Doomsday,” “Toy Story 5,” “Spider Man: Brand New Day” and the next “Super Mario” movie.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAri Emanuel, through his MARI events and experiences roll-up company, has snapped up two other businesses previously owned by Endeavor, which he formerly headed as CEO.\n\n\tMARI announced the acquisition of IMG’s Arts & Entertainment and Action Sports events portfolios. Those include events including London’s annual Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, which sees more than 3 million visitors each holiday season, and the global Taste Festivals culinary series, headlined by the Taste of London. The IMG Action Sports portfolio includes such properties as the U.S. Open of Surfing in Southern California and the Nike Melbourne Marathon.\n\t\n\n\tEmanuel, founder of and principal investor in MARI, remains chairman of WME Group (which went private earlier this year in a deal with Silver Lake) and is the CEO of TKO Group, the parent company of WWE and UFC (which is majority owned by WME Group’s parent).\n\n\n\tMARI, which Emanuel launched last month, previously acquired art-fair and media company Frieze from Endeavor. MARI also bought IMG’s portfolio of international tennis events, which includes the Miami and Madrid Open tennis tournaments. The company also is majority owner of Barrett-Jackson, a U.S. collector car auction company, and two weeks ago announced a deal to buy TodayTix Group, which operates an online platform selling tickets to Broadway shows and other live events.\n\n\tEmanuel said in a statement, “From London’s iconic Hyde Park Winter Wonderland to Taste Festivals worldwide, MARI’s growing presence across Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia furthers our ambition to build a global portfolio of cultural, lifestyle and sporting events that connect millions of people through live experiences.”\n\t\n\n\tAkin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP acted as legal adviser and Goldman Sachs & Co. and LionTree Advisors LLC acted as financial advisers to MARI in connection with the transaction.\n\n\tPictured above:  London’s Hyde Park Winter Wonderland\n",

    "body": "\n\tStephen Colbert has spoken on theories claiming “The Late Show’s” cancellation may have been politically motivated, saying that it’s “a reasonable thing to think” but ultimately refusing to “engage in that speculation.”\n\n\tIn a new cover story with GQ, Colbert was asked about his CBS show’s sudden axing in July, shortly after he criticized parent company Paramount‘s $16 million “60 Minutes” settlement with President Donald Trump on air. Besides the “60 Minutes” lawsuit, Paramount was also waiting on FCC approval at the time for its merger with Skydance. In a statement at the time, the company said it was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night” and was “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” \n\t\n\n\tBut others have begged to differ, with GQ writer Zach Baron mentioning to Colbert that Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff both suggested that the decision could have been politically motivated. Warren even wrote in a column for Variety: “Was it a coincidence that CBS canceled Colbert just three days after he spoke out? Are we sure that this wasn’t part of a wink-wink deal between the president and a giant corporation that needed something from his administration?” Trump celebrated the news on Truth Social, writing: “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\n\n\tIn response, Colbert told GQ that that was not his read of the situation, though he gets how others might reach that conclusion.\n\n\t“That’s not my reaction to it. My reaction as a professional in show business is to go: That is the network’s decision,” Colbert told GQ. “I can understand why people would have that reaction because CBS or the parent corporation — I’m not going to say who made that decision, because I don’t know; no one’s ever going to tell us — decided to cut a check for $16 million to the president of the United States over a lawsuit that their own lawyers, Paramount’s own lawyers, said is completely without merit. And it is self-evident that that is damaging to the reputation of the network, the corporation, and the news division. So it is unclear to me why anyone would do that other than to curry favor with a single individual.”\n\t\n\n\tColbert added: “If people have theories that associate me with that, it’s a reasonable thing to think, because CBS or the corporation clearly did it once. But my side of the street is clean and I have no interest in picking up a broom or adding to refuse on the other side of the street. Not my problem. So people can have their theories. I have my feelings about not doing the show anymore, but you’d have to show me why that’s a fruitful relationship for me to have with my network for the next nine months, for me to engage in that speculation.”\n\n\tThe late-night host, whose show is now ending in May 2026, went on to say that he’s had a “great relationship with CBS.” \n\n\t“It’s one of the reasons why this was so surprising and so shocking that there was no preamble to this,” Colbert said. “We do budgets and everything like that. We’ve done cuts and stuff like that. So that’s why it was surprising to me, as I said, but I meant what I said [on air] the next night after I found out, because I couldn’t sit on it. They’ve been great partners. They really have. They’ve been very supportive.”\n\n\tRepresentatives for CBS and the White House did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\n\tRead Colbert’s full profile in GQ here. \n",

He would rather see the country fail than have Trump and the Republicans do well.\"\n      \n    \n          Of course, the federal government shutdown -- now in its 34th day -- was the topic of discussion, and Trump blamed the Senate Minority Leader for what is inching toward becoming the longest shutdown in U.S. history ... the current record is 35 days, occurring during Trump's first term. DT promised he would not end this one while \"being extorted\" by Democrats.\n      \n\n          When O'Donnell asked, \"What happens on November 15 when the troops don't get a paycheck?\" Trump just barreled on, alleging, \"Schumer is a basket case and he has nothing to lose.\"\n      \n    \n          So when will this all-important game of chicken end?

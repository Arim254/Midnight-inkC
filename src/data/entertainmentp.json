    "body": "\n\n\tYou may know Isabel Klee by her social media handle, @simonsits: Across TikTok and Instagram, she has nearly 2 million followers. Or you may have heard of her famous (former!) foster dog, Tiki, whose journey went viral last spring as he went from what Klee described as “an extremely fearful, shut-down” candidate for behavioral euthanasia to a loving little guy who was eventually adopted by an adoring family. Muddy Paws Rescue, the New York-based group Klee works with, released “Be Brave Like Tiki” T-shirts in May that sold out immediately, raising more than $100,000 for the organization. In a dark world, the effort put in by Klee — plus her fiancé, Jacob, and her dog, Simon — to heal Tiki with patience and love felt like a balm.\n\n\tKlee already had a big following, but his moving story brought her a new kind of attention: Klee and Tiki appeared on NBC News, and when the popular social media account WeRateDogs selected Tiki to be its No. 3 dog of the year in 2025, founder/Dogfather Matt Nelson described Klee as “a legend in the foster space.” Klee had already been profiled by “Today” in August 2024, and that fall, Kristin Davis adopted her foster Chewy, after DMing Klee as soon she began posting about him. Davis is just one of Klee’s celebrity followers — her fans also include Rachel Zegler, Kylie Kelce and Alyssa Milano, among others.\n\n\tOn Sunday, Klee will be featured during Animal Planet’s annual Puppy Bowl, both in a pre-taped “Pup Close and Personal” segment, and on the field alongside with her now-adopted senior foster dog Moonie. Klee documented the experience herself as well, posting about their day and showing Moonie as he mugs for the cameras. The Puppy Bowl appearance comes just ahead another professional milestone for Klee: At 32, she has become a full-time content creator, and her memoir “Dogs, Boys, and Other Things I’ve Cried About” will be released by HarperCollins on April 28.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Animal Planet/Warner Bros. Discovery\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHaving grown up “obsessed with dogs,” Klee’s first job after college was working for a dog photographer. (That’s also how she learned how to edit video.) Back then, Klee couldn’t afford to get a dog of her own, so she began fostering, since rescue organizations pay for food and vet care. The fifth dog she fostered was Simon, whom she fell in love with and adopted (a “foster fail,” to use the term of art). She gave up fostering until she, Jacob and Simon moved into an apartment in Brooklyn that had a backyard, which was when she told Jacob, “I think I want to start fostering again.” With Jacob’s help, and with Simon modeling brotherly love, Klee brings her audience along to see each of her fosters’ stories, beginning with her going to pick them up and ending on their adoption day — with their sometimes extreme ups and downs recounted throughout. Since Simon has idiopathic epilepsy, Klee specializes in taking in medical foster dogs, as well as dogs who otherwise would be hard to adopt.\n\n\tThirty-three foster dogs later, Klee talked to Variety over Zoom about her Puppy Bowl experience, life as a successful content creator, her crusade to educate people on why it’s kill shelters that need your donations — and what happened after she posted about being horrified by ICE.\n\t\n\t\tI feel like I’ve been in your living room so many times.\t\n\n\tYep, just got a little dog next to me.Raven! I’ve followed you since King, I think?\n\n\n\tOh, my God, I love King so much. \n\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your Puppy Bowl appearance like?\t\n\n\tFor the very first time, they are doing a senior segment as their halftime show, and they asked if I wanted my senior foster dog to be a part of it. And I said, “Of course — that’s the cutest thing ever.” We spent the whole day shooting, and he actually goes on the field and plays, which was very cute. \n\t\n\n\tA few days later, a camera crew came to my apartment and we did a sit-down interview, because I think they do three to four featured stories throughout the Puppy Bowl — pre-taped interviews with people in the pet space. They interviewed me about my fostering journey, and about Moonie and about why I love senior dogs.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Animal Planet/Warner Bros. Discovery\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThey sent me a picture of Moonie with a referee.\t\n\n\tYes, yes! Moonie is one of the only foster dogs that I’ve ever had that I’ve considered adopting, because he’s just such a great dog, and we really formed this very special bond. So much so that when they put him on the field, he tried to escape to get back to me. He’s this tiny little chihuahua: He, like, jumped the fence to run back to me. So the ref had to go run after him, pick him up and put him back onto the field, which I was very flattered by. He was a little troublemaker on the field.\n\t\n\n\tLast spring, Tiki obviously blew up and became an international superstar, as he should be. But what was the first foster when you thought, “Wow, this is becoming really big”?\n\n\tI had a foster named Lucchese. When I picked him up, I said, “He looks like Steve Buscemi.” That’s what he looks like to me. He just had this face. He’s so cute, but he’s so funny looking. And he was really my first — I mean, compared to Tiki, not viral — but he was the first one where I was like, “Oh, people are obsessed with this dog.” Every video I posted of him just blew up. I think he was the first one where I was like, “Oh, people really are invested emotionally into these dogs.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Isabel Klee\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow did being a creator become your full-time job?\t\n\n\tAbout three years ago, I was let go from that job with the photographer. I had had such an unconventional job for so long, it was so hard for me to imagine having a 9 to 5, so I literally emailed every dog brand that I had worked with and asked if they needed anybody to create social media content for them. And a lot of them said yes. For a long time, my largest freelance job was with Adopt a Pet, which was a dream come true, because I got to go to shelters and highlight adoptable dogs and make little videos about them to help them get adopted. And I did that while simultaneously building my own platform for about two years.\n\n\tIn the midst of that, I got my book deal, and I was doing all three for a bit, for probably six months, and it just got to a point where I was like, “I can’t do this anymore!” I had to write an entire book, so I made the decision to step away from my freelance jobs and just focus on my own projects. And that was probably a little over a year ago.\n\t\n\t\tI know Kristin Davis adopted Chewy, and I see Rachel Zegler commenting on your posts all the time. What other encounters have you had with celebrities who follow you?\t\n\n\tI’ve had a few crazy moments that have been very pinch me. Kylie Kelce has commented on some of my things, and follows me and has been so kind. Abby Wambach was a huge one. She was a huge Tiki fan, and really reached out, and we would message back and forth. Alyssa Milano comments on a ton of my stuff. Rosie O’Donnell. Sarah Paulson — that’s a new one. All these people are just the kindest, the most supportive. They love rescue animals. It’s been pretty surreal.\n\t\n\t\tI’ve learned so much from your account, like when you had Biggs, who was a poorly bred Frenchie. How and when do you decide to speak educationally?\t\n\n\tMy approach in creating content is always to serve a purpose, and to also open a conversation that is mostly free of judgment. I just posted something the other day being very publicly, anti- this administration and anti-ICE, but….\n\t\n\t\tWe’ll get to it!\t\n\n\tAs far as animals, I try to go into conversations with as little judgment as possible, because I don’t think judgment gets us anywhere. A lack of education is why we’re in this animal welfare crisis to begin with. People don’t know any better. People don’t know about puppy mills. People don’t know that their French Bulldog with a shortened snout and what they call a rope over their nose is not ethical and is really inhumane, actually.\n\n\tI need facts; I need people who are experts; I need articles; I need science-backed information, and that is what I like to put out into the world. And I think it is much more impactful for people to see information in that form than to feel like somebody is attacking them for a choice that they made. And if they did buy a poorly bred French Bulldog, maybe they could reconsider doing it again in the future, or advising their friends not to do it. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Isabel Klee\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI have two rescue dogs, and one of them is a Pomchi, and he was clearly bred and bought and then was neglected and mistreated. It’s such an epidemic.\t\n\n\tYeah, people who want a dog fast will go to a breeder who will get them a dog fast. But then they’re not prepared for the repercussions of said dogs. It’s bad. I mean, it’s a systematic issue. There needs to be crackdowns on breeders. It’s way too easy to be a breeder. There’s no criminal offense to it — I could talk about it all day. It’s awful.\n\t\n\t\tYou also really educated me on kill shelters versus no-kill shelters. Can explain the background of that terminology? \t\n\n\tThis is something I’m very passionate about. In the rescue space, I think it’s changing, and people are starting to understand it better. But for a long time, people would look down on what they call “kill shelters” and only support no-kill shelters. In reality, this is completely backwards and not productive and actually really damaging to animals that are in shelters. Because what they are deeming as “kill shelters” are actually open intake municipal shelters.\n\n\tTake the Animal Care Centers in New York City, for example. The ACC is New York City’s shelter. So any dog that comes in from a criminal case, from the streets, found as a stray — no matter what the situation is, the ACC has to take that animal. They love telling the story about the 700-pound tiger that they had to rescue from Harlem. At one point I went there, and they had 200 chickens in their backyard. They have to take any animal that shows up at their doorstep. So then there’s the question of, OK, say, one month they get 2,000 animals, which happens, and they only have room for 500 animals. Where do those other animals go? They do a great job of partnering with rescues — like Muddy Paws Rescue, who I foster with — to pull dogs into rescue, to pull dogs into foster homes. But they can only do so much, right? They only have X amount of shelters, they only have X amount of foster homes.\n\n\tPeople think that they’re just killing dogs left and right. It’s not as common as people think. But some dogs do end up having to be euthanized. A no-kill shelter is a closed intake shelter that can go into ACC and say, “I want this dog, this dog and this dog,” and they can stay for as long as it takes for them to get adopted, because they don’t have to take in any more dogs. They have seven kennels, and they can fill seven kennels, and when one dog gets adopted, they get a new one.\n\n\tSo it’s all backwards. It’s all marketing. And in reality, the kill shelters are the ones that actually need the most help. It drives me crazy when people are like, “Well, I don’t want to support the ACC, because it’s a kill shelter.” I’m like, “They’re killing the dogs because you’re not supporting them!” It’s a very backwards way of thinking.\n\t\n\n\tWith the ICE nightmare in Minneapolis, you came out — as many creators have — against what the Trump administration is doing there, tying it to animal rights and saying that to turn away is “irresponsible and incredibly privileged.” You then interviewed a federal immigration expert. What went into that?\n\n\tIt’s never been a secret how I feel about the current administration. I would repost a lot of things, I’d reshare a lot of things — I always want there to be facts to back it up. I want real, concrete information to be shared. I have a large platform at this point, and I feel like it’s my responsibility to actually educate people. I am not an expert on immigration law. I know how I feel about it, but this woman who’s amazing reached out to me, and said, “Hi, I am a federal immigration lawyer. I’m more than happy to lend my voice.” And I thought it was the perfect way to get that information across, because it is so intrinsically linked, animal welfare and human welfare. I really wanted it to be direct and concise. So that was my goal with that.\n\n\tI am planning more on Minneapolis and ICE. But I that was my first real video about that specifically. And I thought it went as well as it could have.\n\t\n\t\tDid you lose followers?\t\n\n\tI definitely did. But I think I also gained a lot. So there was not a significant loss.\n\n\tI follow this one woman who’s a farmer and a creator, and she said that the followers she lost made her feel so much safer on her own social media. Because she said, I can’t believe all of these people who I consider to be reprehensible were following me. Get out of here!\n\t\n\n\tYeah! And if somebody is open to having their mind changed or having a conversation, that is best-case scenario for me. Again, I’m not trying to completely alienate people, because on the flip side, I have had a lot of people be like, “I found your page and you’ve completely changed my mind about fostering. You’ve completely changed my mind about kill shelters. You’ve completely changed my mind about X, Y and Z.” So I’m like, maybe I can change somebody’s mind about this? I’m not trying to get on here and be like, “You’re all a bunch of idiots.”\n\n\tBut if somebody sees my opinion and says, “I’m unfollowing you,” that’s fine by me. I can’t do anything about that.\n\t\n\t\tYour book is coming out at the end of April. How are you gearing up for that? \t\n\n\tYes, my book comes out April 28 — we have just locked in a tour. I think it’s, like, seven cities. Like I said, I was just a college student studying who loved books and loved writing, and never in a million years thought that this could be my life, and the fact that I get to write and tell stories, and specifically tell stories about dogs, is my dream come true. These events where I’m doing readings where I’m meeting people — I’ve never really done that before. Sometimes I’ll see people on the street who will come up to me, but I think it’ll just be a very special experience to share that with everybody.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re getting married soon. Will any of your past fosters be at the wedding?\t\n\n\tI posted the other day that a bunch of my fosters were on our save the dates. Our dog Simon will, of course, be there. And we’re getting married at a sleepaway camp, and it’s dog friendly, so everybody can bring their dogs for the whole weekend, and swim in the lake and all that stuff. But I don’t know if my foster dogs will physically be there.\n\t\n\t\tWell, maybe they’ll send you video messages. \t\n\n\tOh, that would be so great!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThey should! You’ve posted about Simon’s health challenges recently. How’s he doing?\t\n\n\tHe’s doing good! He’s adjusting to his new meds. His liver values have gone down, which is great, but now we’re just trying to adjust his meds so that his liver is in control and his seizures are in control, and we haven’t quite struck the balance yet. I mean, he has a ton of energy. He just has a seizure every two weeks or so, which is obviously not fun. But at this point, unfortunately, we’re used to it. But in general, he’s doing great.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tConsider this a changing of the guard — or odds — in Vegas. \n\n\tFor the first time since 2001, an NFL team priced at +5000 or higher before the season started will take home the Super Bowl trophy, as the Seattle Seahawks play the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX tonight. \n\n\tThe Seahawks (-225) are currently predicted to win Super Bowl 60, per the latest BetMGM stats. The Patriots are +190 as they look to win the seventh Super Bowl title in team history.\n\n\n\tNo preseason favorite made the Super Bowl this year, as the Buffalo Bills lost to the Denver Broncos in overtime in the Divisional Playoffs. The Baltimore Ravens lost the AFC North title in the final game of the season due to a missed field goal, while Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014, after having appeared in the last three Super Bowl championships.\n\n\tSeattle had closed at +6000 and New England closed at +10000 before the season started. The teams are relatively evenly matched for tonight’s game though oddsmakers give the edge to the Seahawks, who will be looking for their second Super Bowl title (they won their first Vince Lombardi Trophy in 2014). BetMGM also pegs Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold (+115) as the favorite to win Super Bowl MVP. Patriots quarterback Drake Maye (+230) trails behind for the MVP award.\n\n\tOf course, a number of celebrities are getting in on the betting action. Drake posted a photo on Instagram showing a betting slip for $1 million bet on the Patriots to win. There are also prop bets on who will appear with Bad Bunny during his Halftime Show performance.\n\n\n\n\tNo team with preseason odds worse than 40-1 has won the Super Bowl since 2001, when — coincidentally? — the Patriots defeated the then-St. Louis Rams at Super Bowl XXXVI. Pats fans will no doubt be hoping that the odds are once again in their favor tonight.\n\n\tSee the latest odds and place your bets online at BetMGM.

    "body": "\n\tWell, that’s a wrap. As I look back on my two-decade tenure at Variety, I’m incredibly proud of the 2,000-plus reviews that the publication (and you, my readers) have entrusted me with. It’s the greatest privilege any film critic could ask for. And yet, I can’t shake the responsibility of what I refer to as my “guilt list”: all the films I’ve seen, but didn’t have the time to review. Most critics don’t have this problem. They have clear-cut assignments, which they fulfill in time for a film’s release. At an industry paper like Variety, however, we endeavor to cover as many films as humanly possible, from Hollywood blockbusters to relatively obscure art films and indies. And because that mission matters to me, I don’t forget the ones that slip through the cracks.\n\t\n\n\tMaybe it was something I saw at a festival, but couldn’t get around to, like György Pálfi’s dialogue-free “Hen” (which ranks right up there with Cannes sensation “Eo,” but never got the same critical attention) or Jack Begert’s smart, self-questioning Sundance orphan “Little Death,” which radically pivots from jaded industry cynicism to something more life-affirming midway through. Or else a movie looking for distribution that just might have found a home if I’d only had time to review it, such as Ari and Ethan Gold’s resonant, one-shot “Brother Verses Brother,” a Linklater-esque walk-and-talk gem that shadows the pair around San Francisco. I bear the responsibility of not covering these and so many odd outliers, from fringe offerings like “Abruptio,” a serial killer thriller made entirely with puppets, to Andy Warhol’s “San Diego Surf” (thought lost until 2012), in which Taylor Mead takes an enthusiastic interest in SoCal water sports.\n\t\n\n\tI reckon I have time to scratch just one of these oversights off my guilt list before leaving, and so I find myself circling back to an earnest little movie called “Marianne,” whose squeaky-wheel director, Michael Rozek, has been pestering me on X for more than a year. Rozek, who felt compelled to make his first feature late in life, describes the project as a “revolutionary one-woman film,” starring my all-time favorite actress, Isabelle Huppert. So after several frustrated attempts, I finally made time to watch it (since Rozek claims a release is coming later this year).\n\n\tLooking elegant as ever, Huppert appears with script in hand, half-reading, half-reciting a long, self-important monologue, written by Rozek. It’s not so much a performance as a run-through, shot in several long takes in which the camera zooms, wobbles and repositions itself while she speaks. Alas, English is not Huppert’s native language, and though gravitas comes easy, the red-headed actress makes strange pauses and even stranger gestures, which can be disconcerting. Huppert reacts to the text as it leaves her mouth, when we ought to believe that these words are hers (or “Marianne’s”) to begin with. \n\n\tHow Rozek convinced the courageous French star to do this, I can only imagine, but accepting such an assignment is the kind of fearless act we’ve come to appreciate from Huppert, who’s played a demented disciplinarian in “The Piano Teacher” and a woman excited by assault in “Elle” — risky roles few would even consider, much less embrace. A few years back, I managed to catch Huppert onstage. She was performing “Mary Said What She Said,” an avant-garde one-woman show directed by Robert Wilson, which she has toured around the world. I can only assume Rozek must have seen this as well, since it was around the time he made “Marianne” (three years ago now), and yet, he opted not to emulate it.\n\n\tIn that piece, Huppert “played” Mary Queen of Scots (in the sense that she “plays” a character named Marianne in “Marianne,” making no attempt to embody or otherwise become a different person). The French star moved energetically back and forth, up and down the stage — it was a positively calisthenic performance — as she delivered her lines in double time. I’m no expert on Brecht, but this seems like a classic example of the “alienation effect,” whereby audiences are intended to be made aware of the theatrical artificiality of the experience.\n\t\n\n\tRozek mischievously seeks something similar. Huppert spends most of “Marianne” seated on an expensive blue couch with his script in her hands, holding what’s meant to feel like a one-way conversation with the audience — more of a lecture, really, as “Marianne” represents Rozek’s manifesto about what is “real” in a medium where every creative choice is constructed. Plots aren’t real. Stories aren’t real. Lord knows reality TV isn’t real.\n\n\t“Wake up!” Huppert screams at one point, looking directly into the camera. “Be real!”\n\n\tWho is Rozek chiding exactly? And who exactly does this indignant idealist suspect is “suppressing” his film? (That’s the word he keeps using on X to describe a dynamic in which buyers aren’t swarming to release Rozek’s tedious disquisition on all that’s wrong with the film industry today.) There’s no such conspiracy. The truth is, nobody cares. He might as well carve it up into 30-second clips and share it on TikTok. Responding as someone who found “Marianne” too pedantic to watch through to the end until now — but who identifies with many of Rozek’s frustrations — I would argue that cinema can achieve much nobler goals than “realism.” \n\n\tConsider this: A photograph captures whatever appears directly in front of the camera, but it’s still composed, excluding whatever exists beyond the frame. It’s far more difficult to create something expressionistic — that is, an entirely stylized alternate reality — that audiences still find engaging, relatable and emotionally true. Picture Jean Cocteau’s “Beauty and the Beast,” the best of Tim Burton’s films or anything brought to life from scratch by brilliant animation artists. That should be the goal: achieving some kind of communion between the audience and whoever they’re watching on-screen. That’s what Rozek (in his “revolutionary” way) imagines he’s offering with “Marianne.” But it’s also what the most bottom-line-minded studio execs most want when attempting to make a hit popcorn movie.\n\n\tAbout midway through, Huppert-as-Marianne says, “Some will say, ‘This is not a film. This is a play.’” Why is Rozek being so defensive? Audiences aren’t as dumb as the film implies — certainly not the ones who’d seek out and watch something as nontraditional as “Marianne.” Neither are distributors and other would-be backers, any of whom can see that such a project, while not without merit, stands no chance of financial success (budgeted at an estimated $350,000, it will be lucky to break even). “Marianne” is a film, just not a very good one — it’s nowhere near as effective as Julian Rosefeldt’s “Manifesto,” in which we sit riveted as a shape-shifting Cate Blanchett recites a range of world-changing treatises, from Karl Marx to Dogma 95. The validity of his argument aside, Rozek may as well be screaming into the void.\n\t\n\n\tI don’t recall Martin Luther complaining, after nailing his 95 theses to the Castle Church door, that a bidding war didn’t immediately break out among publishers to reprint his grievances. “Marianne” means well, but comes from a place of profound naivete. It’s meant to get audiences thinking about what they watch — the “content” they consume — by raising awareness of what film can be. But it hasn’t figured out the carrot that will entice them to hear its message. If even a die-hard Huppert admirer like me has trouble getting through it, why would a casual cinephile bother?\n\n\t“They think that you need to escape,” Huppert says, “to forget … your pain.” The royal “they” in this case are “the suits” who call the shots and hold the purse strings. Rozek believes that he’s on to something new when he suggests that if the film industry would only “help you get to the bottom of your pain, instead of numb it,” they’d have people lining up to pay. Sounds great, but movies don’t work that way, and “Marianne” isn’t well written enough — not performed with sufficient conviction — to prove otherwise.\n\n\tSure, it can be demoralizing for intelligent adults to investigate what’s available at their local megaplex and see only prequels, sequels, spinoffs and superhero movies. But tens of thousands of films are made each year, and quite a few of them break the rules, defy conventional narrative expectations and smack us deep in our souls. To repeat Bergman (as paraphrased in the film), the greatest filmmakers capture life in a reflection. Film is a looking glass — a role it plays quite literally here when the scene changes and Huppert reads the “love chapter” from I Corinthians into the mirror.\n\n\tIn its most profound moments, “Marianne” alludes to mortality, to “real life.” But it doesn’t dare suggest what others have (here I’m thinking of Kubrick at the end of “Eyes Wide Shut”), that movies may illuminate life, but they can’t replace it. Now, I say this as someone who’s spent nearly as many hours in the dark vicariously sharing the lives of others — imaginary people, no less — as I have engaging with real people: In order to succeed as a revolutionary act, “Marianne” must achieve the kind of cathartic epiphany Rozek refers to, but ultimately fails to deliver. It needs to serve up an insight that hasn’t already occurred to us, rather than a Holden Caufield-callow attack on phoniness. Alternately, at any point, Huppert could interrupt herself, stare the audience straight in the face and advise them to turn off, walk out and experience the world.\n\t\n\n\tThat, my dear Marianne, is what it means to get real.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience,” a concert documentary about the popular K-pop boy band, was No. 1 at the global box office with $19.1 million.\n\n\tThe film, released by Universal in international markets and Bleecker Street in the U.S. and Canada, has earned $13.2 million overseas and $5.6 million domestically in its opening weekend. In terms of the foreign release, Universal reports these ticket sales are tracking ahead of other Kpop concert docs, including 2023’s “BTS Yet to Come to the Cinema” (which racked up $29 million in total). The film has outgrossed 2019’s “Bring the Soul: The Movie” and 2020’s “Break the Silence: The Movie,” which ended their runs with $12.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively.\n\t\n\n\t“Stray Kids” captures the music group’s world tour and sold-out performance at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium. “The dominATE Experience” had a strong showing in Imax, which represented 20.5% of the global box office with $3.9 million. Those ticket sales mark the company’s largest opening weekend for a Korean-language film.\n\n\n\t“A slow overall weekend for the industry can present a land of opportunity for a film like ‘Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience,'” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian. “The K-pop phenomenon is not to be underestimated. There is a huge appetite for these large-scale concert films for fans to enjoy in the communal environment of the movie theater.”\n\n\t“Stray Kids” was able to top the worldwide box office because major Hollywood studios opted against releasing anything new around the Super Bowl, which is the biggest TV event of the year in the States. It was mostly holdover titles fueling the marketplace, contributing to depressed overall ticket sales across the globe.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s animated juggernaut “Zootopia 2” ranked in second place on global charts with $16.8 million — including $12.8 million internationally and $4 million domestically. It’s a staggering amount for a film in its 11th weekend of release. “Zootopia 2” has generated $1.8 billion worldwide, standing as the ninth-highest grossing movie in history. \n\n\t“Zootopia 2” landed ahead of a much newer Disney release, Sam Raimi’s survival thriller “Send Help,” which added $16.3 million globally in its second weekend in theaters. That includes $6.3 million overseas and $10 million in North America. So far, the well-reviewed R-rated film has grossed $17.9 million internationally and $53.7 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. \n\n\tNot far behind on worldwide charts was a third Disney title, James Cameron’s blockbuster “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” with $15.7 million globally. International territories accounted for $12.2 million of those sales, while the domestic market brought in $3.5 million. Cameron’s third otherworldly-set adventure has climbed to $1.43 billion to date, a massive tally that’s nonetheless a lot less than its predecessors, 2009’s “Avatar” ($2.9 billion) and 2022’s “The Way of Water” (2.33 billion).\n\n\tIn other box office milestones, “Marty Supreme” has overtaken “Everything Everywhere All at Once” to become A24’s highest-grossing film of all time; “The Housemaid” has cleared the $350 million mark, while “Hamnet” has powered to $70 million.\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” has amassed $147 million worldwide to date, outgrossing “Everything Everywhere All at Once” ($142 million) and Alex Garland’s dystopian thriller “Civil War” ($127 million worldwide) in terms of A24 releases. And the global tally will keep rising because “Marty Supreme” has yet to open in several big international territories, according to A24. The studio spent $70 million to produce the R-rated sports dramedy (the most the indie studio has ever spent on a film). It has been an Oscar contender with nine nominations, including best picture and lead actor for Timothee Chalamet. \n\n\tLionsgate’s sexy psychological thriller “The Housemaid” has generated a mighty $354.7 million, a major milestone for the mid-budget movie. The film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has become an unexpected breakout at the international box office, which has accounted for $231 million in ticket sales. “The Housemaid,” which catered to mostly female crowds, cost just $35 million to produce and will be wildly profitable for the studio.\n\t\n\n\tChloe Zhao’s “Hamnet” has earned $48.7 million overseas and $21.8 million domestically, pushing grosses to $70.5 million globally. It’s a notable amount at a trying time for arthouse releases; Focus Features is behind the $34 million-budgeted film. The Shakespearean drama has also been in the awards race with eight Oscar nominations, including best director and actress for Jessie Buckley.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGhostface is back, and as usual, he’s out for blood. Paramount Pictures has released a new trailer for “Scream 7.”\n\n\t“Scream 7” was first announced in August 2023. The film centers on Neve Campbell‘s Sidney Prescott and a new Ghostface killer, who is hellbent on upending Sidney’s life with her daughter. Campbell sat out for “Scream 6” due to a pay issue, but is now back after helping revive the franchise with “Scream 5.”\n\n\n\tCourteney Cox and David Arquette will return as their characters from the previous “Scream” movies. Matthew Lillard and Scott Foley will also reprise their deceased characters from past films.\n\t\n\n\tMason Gooding and Jasmin Savoy Brown are set to return to the cast, joined by newcomers Isabel May, Celeste O’Connor, Asa Germann, McKenna Grace, Sam Rechner, Michelle Randolph, Jimmy Tatro, Anna Camp, Joel McHale, Mark Consuelos and Ethan Embry.\n\n\tThe first four installments of the “Scream” franchise — “Scream” (1996), “Scream 2” (1997), “Scream 3” (2000) and “Scream 4” (2011) were directed by the late Wes Craven, who died in 2015. Kevin Williamson, who created the series and wrote the first two films and the fourth, will write and direct the seventh film. “Scream 7” is produced by William Sherak, James Vanderbilt and Paul Neinstein.\n\n\t“Scream 7” faced major setbacks with production delays from the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, creative overhauls and cast members not returning for the latest film. Melissa Barrera, who starred in the previous two films as Sam Carpenter, was removed from the cast due to her comments on social media about the ongoing conflict in Israel. Jenna Ortega, who co-starred with Barrera as her onscreen sister Tara Carpenter, exited the film shortly after, due to a scheduling conflict with shooting Netflix’s “Wednesday.”\n\t\n\n\t“Scream 7” will release in theaters on Feb. 27.\n\n\tCheck out the trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJapanese Prime Minister Takaichi Sanae‘s wager on a snap election paid off spectacularly Sunday, with her Liberal Democratic Party securing an unprecedented single-handed two-thirds majority in the 465-seat lower house – a feat the party has never previously achieved, according to public broadcaster NHK.\n\n\tThe conservative leader, 64, who took office as Japan‘s first female prime minister in October 2025, dissolved parliament after merely three months in power and staked her political future on the outcome, vowing to step down if her coalition lost its majority. The gambit succeeded beyond expectations, with her party clearing the 310-seat supermajority mark that enables overriding the upper chamber.\n\t\n\n\tNHK exit polling indicated the LDP would capture between 274 and 326 seats, while combined projections for the party and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, ranged from 302 to 366 seats. Voters turned out despite sub-zero temperatures and significant snowfall across multiple regions. The ultranationalist Sanseito party, running on an explicit “Japanese first” agenda, appeared poised to increase its representation from two seats to as many as 14.\n\n\n\tThe outcome represents a dramatic reversal for the LDP, which faced severe headwinds from financial improprieties and sustained losses in both 2024 and 2025 parliamentary contests that stripped the party of its governing majority. Takaichi’s predecessor, Ishiba Shigeru, resigned under mounting internal pressure in September 2025 following approximately one year in office.\n\n\tThe primary opposition formation, the Centrist Reform Alliance, faced substantial losses, with projections indicating the party would retain only one-quarter of its current 167 seats. Party co-secretary general Nakano Hiromasa acknowledged to NHK that the results demanded “humble and serious” reflection.\n\t\n\n\tTakaichi’s diplomatic approach has generated significant international attention. In January, she and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung participated in a joint drumming performance set to K-pop music. Her rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn comparisons to the relationship Trump maintained with her political mentor, the late Prime Minister Abe Shinzo.\n\n\t“The Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, has already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise Leader, and one that truly loves her Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, announcing he would welcome Takaichi to the White House on March 19. \n\n\tBeijing relations have deteriorated significantly during Takaichi’s brief tenure. In November, she informed parliament that Japanese military forces could respond to a Chinese assault on Taiwan – a formulation that exceeded the strategic ambiguity typically maintained by Tokyo. China’s government retaliated through flight cancellations, seafood import restrictions, and intensified naval and air patrols in waters adjacent to Japanese territory.\n\n\tTaiwan President Lai Ching-te joined early international congratulations. “May your victory bring a more prosperous and secure future for Japan and its partners in the region,” Lai wrote on X.\n\n\tTakaichi has cultivated a distinctive public persona that extends beyond conventional political positioning. Known for riding motorcycles and playing heavy metal drums, she has attracted voters seeking a departure from Japan’s entrenched male political establishment, even as she maintains conservative stances on social questions including her opposition to recognizing same-sex unions and permitting female imperial succession. Her campaign slogan “work, work, work, work and work” resonated widely enough to earn recognition as the year’s defining catchphrase. \n\n\tSpeaking with NHK, Takaichi said: “I think the current Cabinet is a good team. It’s still only just over three months since it was launched, but the members have been working really hard and are producing results. So I don’t think I will change it. Most parties are in favor of reducing the consumption tax, such as reducing the tax on food items to zero, or to 5 percent, or reducing the tax on all items to 5 percent. The LDP has also campaigned for a consumption tax cut. I strongly want to call for the establishment of a supra-party forum to speed up discussion on this, as it is a big issue.”\n\t\n\n\tFor Japan’s entertainment industry, the political stability comes at an opportune moment. The nation secured Country of Honor designation for the 2026 Cannes Film Market, where officials plan to showcase Japanese animation, genre cinema and co-production opportunities.\n\n\tThe victory comes as Japan experiences a cultural resurgence, with the nation’s box office hitting a record $1.79 billion in 2025 – up 32% from 2024, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan. The surge was driven overwhelmingly by local productions, led by anime blockbuster “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Infinity Castle – Part 1,” which dominated with $255 million, and Oscar-nominated Kabuki drama “Kokuho,” which earned $127 million to become the highest-grossing live-action Japanese film locally.\n\n\tJapan’s broader anime industry has reached a valuation of approximately $25 billion globally, cementing the nation’s position as a dominant force in animated entertainment worldwide and contributing significantly to its cultural export economy.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots officially go head to head at Santa Clara’s Levi’s Stadium this Sunday, Feb. 8 for Super Bowl LX. The Big Game, which kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET, will broadcast on NBC and stream live on Peacock.\n\n\tCable-cutters can also tune into the NFL championship through a variety of Live TV streamers with access to NBC, such as DirecTV, Hulu + Live TV and Sling TV (in select markets).\n\n\n\tDirecTV carries a live feed of NBC and currently offers a five-day free trial that you can use to watch the Super Bowl game online without cable for free. Hulu + Live TV, meantime, offers a three-day free trial for new uses here.\n\t\n\n\tSunday’s matchup brings together two franchises on sharply different but equally compelling arcs: the New England Patriots, who engineered a swift return to the league’s biggest stage after several rebuilding seasons, and the Seattle Seahawks, who reemerged as NFC powerhouses following a revamped coaching staff and a defense-first identity. For New England, the game represents a chance to reclaim championship relevance in the post-Brady era; for Seattle, it’s a shot at redemption more than a decade after their last Super Bowl meeting. \n\n\tOf course, Bad Bunny is another reason that even non-sports fans will be tuning in on Sunday night. The Puerto Rican superstar, who just took home the award for album of the year at the Grammys, will take the stage at Levi’s Stadium for this year’s Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show. Amid continued MAGA backlash over his appointment as this year’s headliner — and threats from the Trump administration that ICE will be present at the game — NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has stood by the decision, saying that Bad Bunny is “one of the great artists in the world.” Following his impassioned speech against ICE at the Grammys, it’s very likely that Bad Bunny will use the Super Bowl stage as another opportunity to make a political statement.\n\t\n\n\tThe Seahawks are the betting favorites to win the Super Bowl tonight with Seattle as 4.5-point favorites according to the latest odds from BetMGM. See the latest odds and wagers here.\n\n\tStream Super Bowl LX live online free with DirecTV here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tFootball festivities and frigid temperatures across the East Coast and Midwest kept moviegoers on the couch and contributed to a glacial Super Bowl weekend at the box office.\n\n\tWithout any new releases from the major studios, Sam Raimi’s survival thriller “Send Help” remained in first place with $10 million from 3,475 North American venues, a 47% drop from its $19.1 million debut. Meanwhile “Melania,” a documentary about the first lady of the United States, plunged to the No. 9 spot with $2.37 million from 2,003 theaters, representing a steep 67% decline in ticket sales.\n\t\n\n\tThe Super Bowl, the biggest TV event of the year, almost always brings the box office to a halt. This year’s revenues topped out with roughly $60 million, according to Comscore. That’s not the worst Super Bowl haul of all time — that record belongs to 2024’s dismal $38.9 million showing, led by “Argylle” and “Lisa Frankenstein” — but turnout is far behind the pre-pandemic era. Back then, the weekend that coincides with the big game could at least be counted on to bring in $75 million to $85 million across all titles. \n\n\n\t“Send Help” has grossed $35.8 million domestically and $17.9 million overseas, bringing its global total to $53.7 million. Horror films are infamous for major second weekend declines, but the Rachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brien-led movie is benefiting from great word-of-mouth. However, the R-rated release cost $40 million to produce, so Disney is counting on the film to stick around on the big screen through the winter.\n\n\t“Melania” has earned $13.35 million domestically after two weekends of release, a notable tally for a documentary that isn’t about nature or music. However, “Melania” cost more than just about any documentary in history. Amazon MGM spent a staggering sum of money, acquiring the film and an accompanying straight-to-streaming docu-series for $40 million and then shelling out $35 million on the theatrical marketing spend. Those are unprecedented costs considering documentaries aren’t traditionally a driver of big box office dollars. (Amazon MGM’s lavish spend has prompted others in the industry to speculate whether the doc is the studio’s attempt to cozy up to the current administration.) Since theater owners keep about half of ticket sales, it’ll be difficult to justify the cost of “Melania.” In an unusual move, though, Amazon MGM released a statement to address the second weekend results.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Melania’s’ strong theatrical performance is a critical first moment that validates our holistic distribution strategy, building awareness, engagement, and provides momentum ahead of the film’s eventual debut on Prime Video,” said Amazon MGM’s head of domestic theatrical distribution, Kevin Wilson. “Together, theatrical and streaming represent two distinct value creating moments that amplify the film’s overall impact. Audience response is already validating this approach, with exit data showing strong intent to rewatch on Prime Video and meaningful interest in the forthcoming docuseries.”\n\n\tAmazon MGM, a deep-pocketed company that’s newer to exhibition compared to rivals like Disney and Universal, has said the company views the theatrical window as an “important first step in […] a long-tail lifecycle.”\n\n\t“That interest is further amplified by the theatrical marketing halo we consistently see drive increased awareness and viewership once films launch on Prime Video, reinforcing long-term value across the movie’s entire lifecycle,” Wilson concluded.\n\n\t“Iron Lung,” a very indie effort from the YouTube creator known as Markiplier, slid to third place with $6.2 million from 2,930 theaters. Although those ticket sales mark a steep 66% decline from its debut, “Iron Lung” reportedly cost $3 million and has exceeded all expectations with $31.2 million to date, so it’s a massive commercial success for Markiplier (whose real name is Mark Fischback). He self-financed and distributed “Iron Lung” in addition to writing, directing and starring in the film. The gory, R-rated adventure is based on a post-apocalyptic 2022 video game about a fugitive who has to scavenge natural resources in an ocean of blood after a rapture. \n\n\tWith traditional studios sitting out Super Bowl weekend, several releases from independent distributors– such as the Angel Studios rom-com “Solo Mio” and K-pop concert documentary “Stray Kids: The Dominate Experience” — managed to crack the top five. \n\n\t“With minimal competition in the marketplace, independent and alternative films have an opportunity to stand out,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian. “These films may find a more receptive audience given the reduced presence of new major studio releases.”\n\t\n\n\tSecond place went to “Solo Mio” with $7.2 million from 3,052 venues, on par with expectations. The PG film, which landed an “A-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls and 81% Rotten Tomatoes average, stars Kevin James as a man who goes on his honeymoon alone after getting left at the altar.\n\n\t“This is smart counter-programming against the weekend’s big sports events. It’s the right actor and story, made for very little money, from the right distributor,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “Angel Studios knows how to reach this audience.”\n\n\tIn fourth place, “Stray Kids: The Dominate Experience” opened to a solid $5.5 million from 1,724 theaters. Bleecker Street is releasing the film, which captures the music group’s world tour and sold-out performance at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium. Universal is rolling out “Stray Kids” internationally, where the film has earned a mighty $13.2 million from 61 markets for an impressive global tally of $19.1 million.\n\n\tDirector Luc Besson’s “Dracula” remake, starring Caleb Landry Jones and Christoph Waltz, rounded out the top five with $4.5 million from 2,050 theaters. Those ticket sales mark the largest opening weekend to date for newer distributor Vertical, besting the recent debut of January’s “We Bury the Dead” with $2.5 million.\n\n\t“Vertical is thrilled to have landed in the top 5 this weekend for the first time with ‘Dracula,'” said president of theatrical distribution Steve Bunnell. “It is an astounding and romantic cinematic thrill ride arriving just in time for Valentine’s Day.”\n\n\tA final newcomer, Lionsgate’s “The Strangers: Chapter 3” crash-landed at No. 7 with $3.5 million from 2,565 locations. That’s far below the two prior installments in the rebooted R-rated slasher series, including 2024’s “Chapter 1” ($12 million) and 2025’s “Chapter 3” ($5.8 million). However, the studio spent $20 million on all three films, and the first two have generated a combined $70 million globally. So, despite the sharp diminishing returns, the franchise will be profitable for Lionsgate.\n\n\tThe box office should finally heat up over the next weekend with the release of five new films — including Emerald Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights” adaptation with Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the Steph Curry-produced “GOAT” and the starry heist thriller “Crime 101” led by Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Barry Keoghan. Otherwise, it’s been a dreary start to the year for movie theater owners, who are hoping that 2026 will finally, at long last, mark the great box office rebound.\n",

The impact left her on the snow in visible pain before medical personnel rushed in.\n      \n\n          With concerns over her injuries on the mountain, rescuers airlifted Vonn off the slope by helicopter. She was rushed first to a local clinic and later transferred to a larger hospital in Treviso for surgery and care.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The crash marked a heartbreaking culmination to Vonn's emotional comeback. Just days earlier, she had confirmed she would compete in Milan-Cortina despite suffering a completely ruptured ACL in her left knee during a World Cup downhill race and skiing with a rebuilt right knee that included a titanium implant.\n      \n    \n          Vonn's attempt to make history as one of the oldest Olympic downhill competitors came with massive fan support in the Italian Alps. Moments after the crash, the crowd and fellow skiers alike watched in stunned silence as she was tended to on the snow.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Lindsey Vonn\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Olympics\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

If any significant developments occur in the case, a press conference will be called.— Pima County Sheriff's Department (@PimaSheriff) February 8, 2026\n              @PimaSheriff\n          \n  \n    \n          According to police, they don't plan on giving any press briefings unless significant developments occur in the case.\n      \n\n          This seems to run contrary to President Donald Trump's statements Friday when he told reporters that detectives had reached some major developments ... and that the identity of the person behind the 84-year-old's vanishment may be identified sooner rather than later.\n      \n    \n          Just last night, Savannah Guthrie and her siblings, Annie and Camron, shared another Instagram video, agreeing to pay the ransom demands to bring their mother home.\n      \n    \n        Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n      \n    \n          As you know ... Nancy was reported MIA last Sunday after failing to show up for church. Her daughter, Annie, and her husband, Tommaso Cioni, were the last ones to see her, just the night before.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Savannah Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Annie Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Tommaso Cioni\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie Case\n              \n                          \n                True Crime\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

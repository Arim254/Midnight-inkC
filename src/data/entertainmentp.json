    "body": "\n\tSZA and Los Angeles-based Italian restaurant Jon and Vinny‘s have teamed up to provide 1,400 free meals for people struggling without SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. SZA’s own NOT Charity is behind the partnership. \n\n\t“Yall know how much I love Jon and Vinny’s,” SZA wrote on a collaborative Instagram post with Jon and Vinny’s. “But it ain’t no fun if the Homies can’t have none!!”\n\n\n\t“Last week [SZA] reached out to us with an idea and now, with her help, it’s a reality,” wrote the restaurant. “Over the next 7 days we are partnering with her NOT Charity to provide 1400 free meals (100 dinners for 2 per day) for Los Angeles community members who receive SNAP.”\n\t\n\n\tEach meal will be available as takeout at the restaurant’s Slauson location from 3 to 5 p.m. starting Nov. 11 and ending Nov. 17. “Thank you SZA for inspiring all of us to be there for our neighbors,” wrote Jon and Vinny’s.\n\n\tThe future of SNAP benefits for approximately 5.5 million Californians remains uncertain amid the government shutdown, leaving many without resources. \n\n\t+ Luminate, a data partner, and TME Chart, a music chart under Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME), have announced a new global data partnership. The agreement allows the integration of streaming and sales consumption metrics from TME platforms, including QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music, and JOOX, into Luminate’s industry-leading music data platform CONNECT. \n\n\tThe new partnership provides international visibility into China’s music market and the data will be reflected in CONNECT’s global streaming and sales in the coming weeks.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking on the announcement, Luminate CEO Rob Jonas shared, “This partnership marks a pivotal moment for the global music industry, underscoring Luminate’s unwavering commitment to providing the most accurate and comprehensive measurement of music activity worldwide. As the industry’s most trusted source of streaming and sales data, our customers and partners expect as much information as possible to make the best business decisions, and we know how valuable it is for a market as large and influential as China to be represented in those insights.”\n\n\tTC Pan, Group Vice President of TME and President of the Content Cooperation Department, said, “This collaboration with Luminate represents a data-driven effort to establish a unified global content ecosystem. China is one of the most dynamic music markets in the world, and through this partnership, all content on TME’s platforms — whether domestic or international — will participate in, and even help shape, global music trends. Moving forward, TME will continue to strengthen its content ecosystem, enabling more quality content to be discovered worldwide, realizing long-term value through a journey from ‘data connectivity’ to ‘ecosystem synergy.’”\n\n\t+ Sony Music Publishing today announced the appointment of Michael Young as chief information officer. Based in Nashville, Young will report to Sony Music Publishing’s Chief Financial Officer Tom Kelly.\n\n\tAs CIO, Young will lead the company’s technology strategy and its ongoing transformation initiatives to advance growth, scalability and efficiency on behalf of SMP songwriters and catalogs worldwide. He will also work closely across departments to optimize workflows, expand data-driven insights, and refine and implement best practices across software development, security, compliance and data governance.\n\n\tYoung said, “I am extremely excited to join Sony Music Publishing. As a career technologist and a lifelong amateur musician, it’s thrilling to be a part of SMP’s mission-driven culture. I look forward to working with the team to advance support for SMP songwriters throughout their creative journeys.”\n\n\tKelly said, “Michael is an experienced leader who understands how to innovate.

    "body": "\n\tDavid Ellison downplayed Paramount‘s need to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery during a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Monday after the company unveiled earnings that reflect the uphill climb that it faces in revitalizing its film and TV assets.\n\n\t“It’s important to know that there’s no must-have for us. We really look at this as buy-versus-build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go,” Ellison told Wall Street analysts when pressed about Paramount’s pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery. “We believe we can achieve our streaming goals, and that we can drive enterprise efficiency, and create value and long-term free cash flow generation all through the building.”\n\t\n\n\tEllison also vowed to be “disciplined” in his approach to pursuing additional assets.” It’s understood that Paramount in recent weeks has fielded two offers to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its linear cable networks.\n\n\n\t“As it relates to M&A, everything for us is going to tie back into, Does it accelerate those three core principles for us,” Ellison said. “We’re fortunate that we have the balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic when we think that M&A will accelerate our goals, but we’re also long-term disciplined owner operators. We’ll always approach things through the lens of, How do we maximize value for shareholders? And from an M&A standpoint, it’s always going to be, How do we accelerate and improve our North Star principles?”\n\n\tEllison hammered his key points about investment, innovation and the clean-up that is still under way at Paramount for the new regime. The fine print of Paramount’s earnings report discloses plans for a restructuring charge to be taken in Q4 of $500 million.\n\t\n\n\tEllison has emphasized the importance of upgrading Paramount’s technological infrastructure and capabilities from the moment he sealed the sale agreement with former owner Shari Redstone in July 2024. On Monday’s call, he cast the need in more urgent terms amid an arms race race with Silicon Valley firms. That’s a world he knows well as the son of software billionaire Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle.\n\n\t“Our goal is to accelerate innovation by making technology the core competency of our company. Competitors from Silicon Valley have quickly expanded into media and broader forms of entertainment, and if we want to remain competitive long term, we must strengthen our technology to do what it takes to position ourselves as the industry’s most technologically capable media company,” Ellison vowed. “Again, I want to stress that technology, at Paramount is not and never will be a replacement for human creativity. Rather, it serves as a powerful multiplier, enhancing performance, elevating the consumer experience and equipping our creative teams with the tools that will enable them to tell even better stories more efficiently and effectively.”\n\n\tAmong other highlights of the call:\n\n\t** Jeff Shell, president of Paramount, reaffirmed that the company does not plan to offload its linear cable channels, at least for the near term. “We’re not going to spin off cable assets. This company has a history of spinning assets, and it hasn’t gone very well for us and we think for others,” Shell said. “So one of the big rationales is that when companies are standalone, they can focus on driving the value of the brands that they have in a more specific way. We are going to do that, but we’re going to do that within our company so our shareholders get the value of that. We think we have some pretty good brands on the cable side,” he said, citing Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.\n\n\t** As expected, Paramount has divested itself from TV assets in Latin America, Argentina’s broadcast channel Telefe and Chile’s Chilevision. Shell was blunt about the reason why: “We have enough to do and invest in without investing in things that are not core to what’s going to get us to global streaming scale.”\n\n\t** Ellison and Shell also were effusive about the importance of the company’s new $7.7 billion rights pact with UFC is to the future of Paramount+ and CBS. Shell told analysts that the UFC’s year-round schedule will be a boon particularly for CBS, which has its big sports investments clustered around the fall and winter NFL schedule and spring NCAA tournament.\n\t\n\n\t“If you are going to design a sport for us, UFC is perfect in so many ways,” Shell said. “We had a real desert of sports that ended with the Masters [golf tournament in April] and, you know, started again in the NFL. And we saw lots of churn over the summer as people turned off [Paramount+] and then turned it back on for NFL. And this is a year-round sport, which is very unusual for major sports.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHow does “Wednesday” top its Season 2 guest appearance of Lady Gaga?\n\n\tWith Danny DeVito, says Catherine Zeta-Jones, who stars as Morticia on the Netflix series.\n\n\tZeta-Jones’ husband, Michael Douglas, and DeVito have been friends for decades.\n\n\t“I don’t know how Danny DeVito hasn’t been cast already,” Zeta-Jones told me Sunday at the “Wednesday” FYC event at the Netflix Tudum Theater in Hollywood. “I was with him for our birthday in September [she and Douglas share the same birthdate, Sept. 25] and I was like, ‘Why isn’t Danny DeVito in “Wednesday?”’\n\t\n\n\tShe also said, “Imagine Danny DeVito as Cousin It? That’d be so cool.”\n\n\tNow, it’s just a matter of the “Chicago” Oscar-winner suggesting the role to DeVito: “He’s gonna kill me for that. He’s like, ‘Yeah, they’re going to cast me and put hair all over my face. Thanks for suggesting that, Catherine.’”\n\n\n\tZeta-Jones also offered up her reaction when she heard Lady Gaga was set to film her appearance. “It was top secret. I don’t tell Michael. I don’t tell my kids,” she said. “I’m a good girl, right? I don’t tell anybody. I had to deal with the fact that when it did get released, my family looked at me and were like, ‘I can’t believe you, that we’re the last people to know about Gaga.’”\n\n\tShe said she was like a “17-year-old groupie” when she saw Gaga. “I truly believe that she is a generational talent. I am so happy that I got to meet [her] and I’d love to work with her more on something else,” Zeta-Jones said.\n\t\n\n\tCast and crew will reunite next year to film Season 3. Zeta-Jones hasn’t seen any scripts yet, but hopes to find out more about Morticia’s dynamic with her mother, played by Joanna Lumley, and how it affects her relationship with Wednesday. “I hope that Wednesday snaps out of it next season,” Zeta-Jones said. “It’s like enough already. She can’t demonize her mother anymore.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSarah Hoover’s bestselling memoir “The Motherload: Episodes From the Brink of Motherhood” is in development as a drama series at 20th Television, sources tell Variety.\n\n\tStuart Zicherman is attached as the showrunner, and Hoover will co-write the pilot with Sas Goldberg (“Only Murders in the Building,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”).\n\n\t“The Motherload” series will follow Jennifer, a millennial art dealer who finds motherhood to be nothing what she expected. “Instead of joy, it is turning out to be months of rage, brain fog, self medication, and a scorched earth policy towards her husband,” per the logline. “A total surrender of sex, career and identity results, and Jennifer realizes she’ll never be able to find her way to fulfillment in parenthood without the hardest of looks at herself, her relationship to her own mother, to men, and to the condition of being a woman who despises bullshit mommy narratives.”\n\t\n\n\tHoover’s source material is a childrearing memoir that explores the horrors of motherhood. The book flips the euphoric narrative of giving birth on its head and “dares to ask what happens when ‘what to expect when you’re expecting’ turns out to be months of rage, anguish, brain fog, and a total surrender of sex, career, and identity,” according to the publisher’s description.\n\n\n\tHoover is an author and cultural critic who moved from Indiana to New York to study art history. She worked in a gallery and married the artist Tom Sachs, “but when Hoover got pregnant, everything in her life began to unravel,” per the synopsis. “She felt like an imposter in her own body. She grew distant from her friends and husband. Anxiety, fear, guilt, and shame threatened to swallow her.” Her memoir is a rejection of the idea that mothers are pure and perfect, and an unflinchingly honest examination of postpartum depression.\n\t\n\n\tZicherman is also an executive producer on “The Motherload” alongside The Gotham Group’s Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and Jeremy Bell and Sas Goldberg. Both the Gotham Group and Goldberg have first-look deals with 20th.\n\n\tHoover is represented by WME, Linden Entertainment, Align PR and Jackoway Austen. Zicherman is represented by UTA and Mosaic. Goldberg is represented by WME, Rise Management and Ziffren Brittenham. The Gotham Group is represented by WME.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFlorence Pugh appeared on the latest episode of “The Louis Theroux Podcast” and spoke openly about her experience with intimacy coordinators on film sets. Intimacy coordinators have become an industry standard, although the job has proven divisive in Hollywood. Pugh described the profession as one that makes sure sex scenes are filmed with the utmost safety for the actors involved, adding, “It’s not to get in the way. It’s not to confuse, it’s not to make things more complicated or make things more awkward. I’ve had good ones and bad ones.”\n\t\n\n\tGwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lawrence both made headlines recently for saying they didn’t feel the need to use the intimacy coordinators hired on their sets because they trusted their co-stars to be professional.\n\n\n\t“We did not have [an intimacy coordinator], or maybe we did but we didn’t really [use it]… I felt really safe with Rob [Pattinson]. He is not pervy,” Lawrence said about the making of “Die My Love.”\n\n\tPaltrow said on that the set of “Marty Supreme” she told the intimacy coordinator to “step a little back” when she was filming intimate scenes with Timothée Chalamet, adding: “I don’t know how it is for kids who are starting out, but… if someone is like, ‘Okay, and then he’s going to put his hand here,’  I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.”\n\n\tPugh noted that she filmed many sex scenes without an intimacy coordinator in the past. While she’s always been “quite confident” and “quite happy in my skin,” the Oscar nominee remembered times when someone on set used “completely inappropriate” to direct a sex scene and there wasn’t an intimacy coordinator present to protect her.\n\t\n\n\t“But my view is changing about it as well, because I’m now having fantastic experiences with intimacy coordinators,” Pugh said about filming sex scenes. “However, that being said, I’ve also had a shit example where someone just made it so weird and so awkward and really wasn’t helpful and kind of was just like wanting to be a part of the set in a way that wasn’t helpful, and I think it’s a job that’s still figuring itself out.”\n\n\t“I will say that I’ve been able to understand better meaning now through working with great ones in sex scenes,” Pugh said about “finding the story of what it is, what kind of sex is it, how do you touch each other, how long have you been having sex for.”\n\n\t“Everybody’s just kind of working away to chip away at the scene. And I think when I worked with a fantastic coordinator, I was like, ‘Oh, this is what I’ve been missing, understanding the dance of intimacy as opposed to just shooting a sex scene,'” Pugh said. “There are good ones and bad ones, and it’s through the good ones that I have learned how effective it can really be.”\n\n\tPugh credited intimacy coordinators with giving female actors more agency on set. She said, “It’s a bit stickier” being a woman during filming because “you can’t really be a problem because people will say that you’re a nightmare.”\n\n\t“I remember I was doing a crying scene and there were just all of these specific beats that I needed to get, and specifically on specific lines,” Pugh remembered. “And we did it maybe six times, and each time you have to start with no tears and then gear up. So you have to stay in it. And we got it and the director wanted to go again. And when I’m in that state, I’m a bit mushy, so I’m like, ‘Okay, we’ll do it again.'”\n\n\tPugh said that as a woman, she would never speak up on set and tell the director that no more takes were needed of such an emotionally exhausting scene. It took her male co-star to do that on her behalf.\n\n\t“My co-star went out to the director and said: ‘Don’t do that, man. Don’t put her through that. She’s got it. We got it. You’ve got the close-up, you’ve got the wide, don’t do that,'” Pugh remembered. “And I realized when I was in the tent, I was like, ‘Oh, I wouldn’t have been able to have said that because that wouldn’t have been received well.'”\n\t\n\n\t“The Louis Theroux Podcast” is available on Spotify now.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDC Studios and HBO Max are developing a fictional true crime series set in the DC Universe. \n\n\tTitled “DC Crime,” the show would be presented as a true crime docuseries that would be hosted by Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo). The first season would focus on Gorilla Grodd, a DC villain best known for his battles with The Flash. \n\n\tTony Yacenda and Dan Perrault would serve as writers, executive producers, and showrunners on the series. James Gunn and Peter Safran of DC Studios would also executive produce, with DC Studios’ Galen Vaisman overseeing production. Warner Bros. Television is the studio. \n\t\n\n\tHBO Max and DC Studios declined to comment. \n\n\n\tYacenda and Perrault are no strangers to the world of mockumentary series. The duo famously created the critically-acclaimed Netflix show “American Vandal,” which spoofed the true crime genre. The show aired for two seasons at the streamer and won a Peabody Award for its first season in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best writing for a comedy series. They then went on to create the Paramount+ mockumentary series “Players,” which was set in the world of eSports. They previously spoofed the sports world on projects like a parody of ESPN’s “30 for 30” series about the events of “Rocky IV” and “Angels in the Outfield” for CollegeHumor. \n\n\tYacenda has also worked on shows like “Chad Powers” at Hulu and “Dave” at FX, while Perrault recently appeared onscreen in the Shondaland-Netflix series “The Residence.” \n\n\tPerrault is repped by UTA, Brillstein, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. Yacenda is repped by CAA, 3 Arts, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. \n\t\n\n\tGrodd is a member of a highly-intelligent society of gorillas that gained psychic powers and other abilities after coming into contact with an alien spaceship. The character first appeared in the pages of DC Comics in 1959. He has been featured across a number of DC animated series and films, while the character made multiple appearances in The CW’s “Arrow-verse” shows, most notably in “The Flash.” \n\n\tGunn and Safran are in the process of building out an interconnected film and TV universe for DC. On the TV side, HBO will air the drama series “Lanterns” starring Kyle Chandler and Aaron Pierre as Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and John Stewart. No premiere date has been set at this time, but it is expected to premiere in early 2026. Variety also reported that a “V for Vendetta” TV series is currently in the works. \n",

    "body": "\n\tKelly Clarkson revealed during a recent show as part of her Studio Sessions residency in Las Vegas that her ex-manager suggested she get plastic surgery for her breasts when she was starting out in the music industry after her “American Idol” victory (via E! News).\n\n\t“I had some dick manager one time tell me to get a boob job,” Kelly said. “I was like, ‘Why don’t you get a dick job?’ Like, what? I’m fine with my itty-bitty titties! Get out of here.” \n\t\n\n\t“Who says that shit?” Clarkson asked the audience. “People say that shit. They say it all the time to people in the industry. They say the craziest shit. I’m like, ‘This is not normal. You’ve normalized crazy’… Everybody’s out here looking like they’re in The Capitol in ‘The Hunger Games.'”\n\n\tThe pop singer and daytime talk show host stressed that her outlook on plastic surgery in the entertainment industry is simple: “Do you. Don’t make me do you. I like my itty-bitty titties. They’ve served me well.”\n\n\tClarkson recently returned to her Las Vegas residency after postponing shows starting in August due to her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock’s death from cancer.\n\n\t“Unfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,” Clarkson wrote at the time of the announcement. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children’s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”\n\t\n\n\tBlackstock’s death was reported the day after Clarkson’s postponement was announced. The former couple shares two kids together. Clarkson filed for divorce from Blackstock in June 2020 after seven years of marriage.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is planning to spend more on content — and at the same time, it’s going to charge more for streaming.\n\n\tThe company, in reporting its Q3 2025 results, said that its “ongoing investments in Paramount+ are enhancing the value we deliver to consumers. To support this continued investment, we plan to implement price increases in the U.S. early in the first quarter of 2026.” \n\n\n\tParamount+ will raise pricing in the U.S. starting Jan. 15, 2026. The Paramount+ Essential (ad-supported) plan will increase by $1 to $8.99 per month, and the Paramount+ Premium (ad-free) plan will rise by $1 to $13.99 per month. Annual plans will also increase, with the Essential plan moving to $89.99 per year and the Premium plan to $139.99 per year.\n\t\n\n\tThe company noted that it also recently announced upcoming price increases in Canada and Australia. “These changes will fuel continued reinvestment in the user experience and deliver an even stronger slate of programming for our customers in the year ahead and beyond,” Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, said in the Q3 letter to shareholders. Among recent pacts, Paramount signed a seven-year, $7.7 billion deal with UFC that makes Paramount+ the exclusive rightsholder for the MMA promoter’s events.\n\n\tThe company said that even after the January 2026 price hikes, Paramount+ will remain one of the most competitively priced streaming services in the U.S. The streamer features popular original series such as “Landman” and “Tulsa King”; franchises like “South Park” and “Star Trek”; films including “Mission: Impossible” and “The Naked Gun”; CBS hit shows like “Tracker” and “Survivor”; and exclusive coverage of sports including Sunday afternoon NFL games and UEFA Champions League.\n\t\n\n\tThe looming price increases follow the closing of Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global in August. The last time prices went up for Paramount+ came in August 2024, when the price of Paramount+ Premium increased by $1, to $12.99 per month, and the Paramount+ Essential plan climbed by $2, to $7.99 per month. This past summer, the company changed the name of the higher-priced tier from Paramount+ With Showtime to Paramount+ Premium. \n\n\tIn 2026, Paramount expects to make incremental programming investments of more than $1.5 billion, which includes its direct-to-consumer investments in the UFC, Paramount+ originals and third-party catalog licensing as well as the ramp-up in its film slate to 15 movies annually, per Ellison’s letter.\n\n\tParamount+ ended September 2025 with 79.1 million subscribers, up from 77.7 million three months earlier. \n\n\tFor the third quarter of 2025, revenue in Paramount’s direct-to-consumer business increased by 17% year-over-year, to $2.17 billion, driven by a 24% increase in Paramount+ revenue, to $1.04 billion. The DTC segment’s adjusted earnings were $105 million (12% margin) and $235 million (18% margin) in the pre-close and post-close periods, respectively. “Our results reflect continued revenue growth and efficiency for Paramount+ in addition to a content expense benefit from reductions in content assets resulting from the change in accounting basis resulting from the merger,” Paramount Skydance said.\n\n\tStarting in Q4 2025, the company said, it will count only paid Paramount+ subscribers in its reported figures instead of including those on free trials, as it does currently. At the end of Q3, free trial subscribers totaled 1.2 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFresh lettering has gone up on the marquee at Antone’s nightclub in Austin: “Forever.” That may err on the side of slightly wishful thinking, but the club at least has a better head start on eternal life than most. The nationally celebrated mecca for blues and other roots music has signed a 50-year lease deal with its landlord  to cap off a 50th anniversary celebration that has lasted throughout 2025.\n\n\tFew, if any, comparable nightspots that don’t own their own real estate have inked a deal that would guarantee them a home for decades going forward. But few are considered as indispensable to their communities as Antone’s is, and this one is benefitting from a landlord that not only understands the club’s history but wants visitors and tourists not to visit Austin at night only to find that there is no live music at the center of the self-proclaimed Live Music Capitol of the World. The deal is actually for 30 years, with two 10-year-extensions after that, but Antone’s is expecting to be putting a 100th birthday party on the marquee in 2075.\n\t\n\n\tIn other news announced Monday, Antone’s is also planning to build a museum on its second level that will be open for tourists during the day as well as clubgoers at night, which will double as a VIP room. The museum is expected to open in 2017.\n\n\n\tWill Bridges, the co-owner of Antone’s, and Zach Ernst, director of booking and creative, took over the venerable club and its attendant operations about a dozen years ago, with a move into the current downtown location a decadea ago. They talked with Variety about the venue’s past, its present — which just included an Antone’s-themed episode of “Austin City Limits” that aired on PBS Saturday  — and its apparently wide-open future.\n\t\n\n\t“The first 50 years was just such a heroic effort — all these twists and turns, with a fighting, scrappy, never-say-die attitude to get to 50,” says Bridges. “And of course it’s gonna take a lot of work to get through the next 50. But to have the vision and the runway to be able to presumably duplicate that, it’s empowering, for sure. And it certainly is going to be exciting to announce because, as much as we’ve been milking the 50th anniversary for everything it’s worth, I don’t think people were expecting us to jujitsu that into: Just when you thought we were done, we’re gonna do it for another 50.\n\n\t“Antone’s has moved a lot around in its first 50 year,” he adds. “We’re actually in the sixth location. And so it’s part of our DNA to persevere, and if Antone’s gets displaced, it goes and finds another home, and that in itself is unique. So in a way, this is kind of departing from that m.o. But longevity, of course. is the real goal.”\n\n\tPrior to this late-breaking development, the centerpiece of the 50th anniversary of Cliff Antone establishing a blues club in Austin was an elaborate boxed set on New West Records titled “Antone’s: 50 Years of the Blues” — a five-disc, 41-track collection with 18 new recordings as well as classic and previously unreleased material, produced by Ernst. Putting that together spurred the idea of forming an all-star blues revue in the tradition of the old Antone’s house band and doing a few select dates around the country, including an L.A. Troubadour show, a party/jam at the Village Recorder in West L.A., an AmericanaFest gig at Jack White’s Blue Room in Nashville, and a Lincoln Center outdoor show at Damrosch Park in New York … not to mention the “Austin City Limits” that just aired.\n\n\t“While it may have seemed like we were just inventing new things to come up with to do to celebrate the 50th,” says Ernst, “the boxed set was really the nucleus of all of it, and all those other projects were just ways to kind of tour it around. We have had a lot of fun traveling and taking Antone’s on the road for the first time in about 35 years.” Although Antone’s has not been strictly a blues club since at least the ’90s, this was a way to double up on that core mission. “The older class was saying this is the closest thing they’d experienced since the old house band, and a lot of the younger players were saying that this brought a sense of musical family that they had yearned for their entire careers. Those who were exposed to the old Antone’s culture always felt connected to it, but they never had that opportunity to find their flock or be with their tribe, and this was it. So it’s kind of turned into a thing that has a life of its own, and we’re excited to see where that continues to go” with more all-star revue concerts in the near future. \n\t\n\n\tGetting back to the 50-year lease, Bridges explains how it came about.\n\n\t“Eleven years ago, when Zach’s and my team took on the club, we signed a 10-year lease with two five-year options,” the co-owner says. “So we wouldn’t have been thinking quite that long-term yet, as far as necessarily needing to ask for a big extension, because we still had another 10 years left. But those first 10 years went by pretty quick, so we were at least cognizant of: OK, what happens in 10 years? Austin is getting increasingly more difficult, and if we do have to find a new home, the odds of that are getting slimmer. But there was this grant program that we first started getting involved with three years ago, when Austin created an economic development corporation sidecar entity that has been rebranded as Rally Austin. I’ve learned a lot about that being a model for growing municipalities, of kind of a trust to try to take control or ownership of venues or cultural assets spaces that harbor arts and music culture in different cities. I remember learning about one in San Francisco 10 or 15 years ago. It always sounded a little pie in the sky for Austin. But the idea is, if you can have some entity step in and be kind of a intermediary, it can help make sure these spaces don’t just go to the chopping block of commercial real estate.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAntone’s\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCamryn Hutchens / @behindcamm\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut Rally Austin had a prerequisite for bringing spaces into the program, which is that they are either able to buy their property or have a long-term lease. “So that was the catalyst for us going to our landlord very early in that process, about three years ago, saying, ‘Hey, we wouldn’t normally be coming to you right now talking about this. But if you’re open to exploring a long-term lease that could unlock some funds for us…’ Our landlord said, ‘I’m open to it.’ And slowly but surely as the thing evolved, he got on board and really helped.”\n\n\tBridges says the landlord’s business “has a lot of key properties downtown. And so when we first went to him 12 years ago (about taking over Antone’s), we were very transparent about, ‘Hey, we’re a music venue. We’re not gonna be able to compete just on normal economics. We’re not gonna be the highest bidder for this space. But we bring a different type of value to downtown.’ Especially 11, 12 years ago, there was a lot of talk about music venues escaping downtown because of increasing rents and property tax and just property values overall. And Austin’s a young city — we’re always kind of reading ahead in the story to see how this plays out in markets that are further along than we are in their life cycle. But one of the doomsday things I remember everyone talking about is,  if you lose your cultural class, if you lose your arts and music in downtown, you’ll become a donut city.\n\t\n\n\t“We thought it was really important to make a point to go back into downtown,” Bridges continues. “And so part of our original pitch was in kind of the headwinds of all that questioning of the arts and music leaving downtown — escaping to greener pasture, so to speak — we made that commitment to him, saying, ‘We’re gonna do the opposite. We’re gonna plant the Antone’s flag back downtown as close to the original cross streets of the original 6th and Brazos location as possible, and reverse that trend and bring that cultural value back to downtown.'”\n\n\tSince they moved into Antone’s sixth location, it has been just shy of a decade — a nice round number that Bridges seems to have kind of let slip, until you query him about it. “It’ll be 10 years on New Year’s Eve, which we hadn’t even thought about. You know, maybe we should throw a 10-year anniversary party in the ‘new’ building! But … we’ve kind of eclipsed that” with all this other news, he laughs.\n\n\tThe museum was something they had hoped to put together off-site, until the eureka idea of doing it adjacent and slightly smaller than first imagined came up.\n\n\t“We have so much memorabilia that’s been gifted to us over the years, and so much generosity within our immediate network of folks that we knew would be happy to lend stuff,” Bridges says. “So we were toying around with that idea for a long time, but we couldn’t figure out where to put it. Finally, one of our board members inspired us to just put it upstairs, which we thought would’ve been too small of a space. But we took some tours and went to Memphis, for example, and saw Stax, which is amazing, but also saw Sun Studios, which showed me that you can pack a lot of amazing history into a small package and sometimes it’s almost more impactful in that way. — along with also being in a space where the music actually happened.\n\n\t“It’s gonna be installed there in the upstairs space, and there’ll be a lot of synergies having it open during the day, attracting more activity to the building in the daytime hours, but then also be open at night. So it won’t be a traditional museum; it will be on top of a music venue. There’ll still be a bar in there. \n\n\t“People already come by Antone’s, especially tourists of course, during the day, because there’s not a whole lot of music things you can do during the day in Austin. One of the lightbulb moments for me with having the museum on top of the club is: I remember coming in one day, and we have a record shop downstairs called Big Henry’s. I caught our record shop attendee giving a little impromptu tour of the club, and one of the tourists was taking a picture of the beer guy pulling beer in. And I thought, ‘We can do better than this! We can give him a little something better than the beer guy.’ \n\t\n\n\t“So people are yearning for daytime experiences and we hope to be a destination for schools and youth groups and people that want to take their kids to be exposed to music. But then at nighttime, on any given day, we have 200-400 people coming through the club who are there for the music. So, in Texas, we have the saying “shooting fish in a barrel.” We think it’s gonna be really easy to entice those folks to go upstairs for a small donation to the Clifford Antone Foundation. We also excited about it being kind of a special club for our Clifford Antone Foundation members during shows, because we’ve always had a camera system where you can still hear and see the show downstairs. So it can even be maybe analogous to a VIP experience like the Founder’s Room at House of Blues.”\n\n\tAntone’s is reemphasizing the blues with the 50th anniversary boxed set and shows, but on a day-to-day level, the club programs plenty of different genres. Ernst explains that evolution.\n\n\t“After doing this (booking) for a couple years, I realized that I could get the big cast of fans who love to come to Jimmy Vaughn shows or Maceo Parker shows or Billy Gibbons shows and maybe get them out once a month, but you can’t expect those people to come all the time,” he says. “So I have always been spacing those throughout the calendar just for our own enjoyment. But Antone’s also means a lot to the city of Austin as just a 400-cap room that touring bands can play for the first time, sort of like the Troubadour or Bowery Ballroom. We had a Billy Strings show, and a Lizzo show, and Jack Harlow, all these bands that have gone on to be arena acts, who play the club their first time through. So I’m always cherry-picking things and wanting to have a diversity of lineups and genres and older crowds and younger crowds. \n\n\t“So that hasn’t changed, but this year, really going out on a limb with this blues revue thing that we created, is just from knowing that people outside of Austin care about this stuff, and knowing that there’s an audience for it and not giving up on it just because a lot of the heroes have passed away. You know, they said ‘the blues is dead’ in 1975. Here we are 50 years later, and people might still say that stuff. We’re just having fun, reconnecting with all these old friends and making sure that we can continue to host them at our stage and think creatively about how to encapsulate that feeling and share it with the world.”\n\t\n\n\tContinues Ernst: “Yeah, Antone’s is a blues club, while presenting the genres that we’re passionate about underneath kind of the blues umbrella — R&B, zydeco, soul, gospel, all these genres that Clifford loved… Antone’s was like a lifeboat in Austin’s music history when other clubs would get closed or scenes would be displaced, because Antone’s would kind of absorb them, at least temporarily. That’s when Antone’s started to transcend beyond just being a home for the blues, and the blues just became almost like a term of endearment for soulful, authentic music here in Austin. It’s like jazz is to New Orleans. It is kind of our root genre, our mother tongue. So the mission is twofold: It’s focusing on those (root) genres, presenting that music, developing those artists. But it’s equally just sort of doing the same for Austin’s music ecosystem at large.”\n\n\tFor anyone who wants to get involved in the mission of Antone’s going forward, there is the Antone’s Forever Fund, administered through the Clifford Antone Foundation. “This is our battle cry, our mantra, our campaign for the next 50 years,” says Bridges. “You know, we were in this scrappy survival mode for the first 50. So we’re using this achievement and this milestone as a paradigm shift to go from surviving to thriving. And Antone’s Forever is what we call what’s gonna be this initiative to make sure that Antone’s thrives for another 50 years in Austin.

The incident, which TMZ caught on tape, occurred at 2:30 AM PT on November 9, 2015. Paris' boyfriend, Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos, crashed the heiress' Bentley into a parked truck, then sped away ... with Paris, Kimberly Stewart (Rod Stewart's daughter) and Talan Torriero, star of MTV's 'Laguna Beach' all inside.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Moments later, TMZ cameras found the group outside the vehicle talking with police. TMZ did not see any evidence of a field sobriety test being conducted before the group left. A police official says when the officers spotted the Bentley, the occupants were outside of the car, therefore they did not know who was driving.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Paris Hilton\n              \n                          \n                Car Crashes\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\t“Miraculous,” the girl-power blockbuster franchise set in Paris and turning 10 this year, is getting ready for its next theatrical animated adventure with a topnotch creative team.\n\n\tProducer John Cohen (“Despicable Me,” “The Angry Birds Movie”) and writer Matt Roller (“Rick And Morty,” “Community”) have been brought on board by Miraculous Corp, the joint venture formed just over a year ago between Mediawan and Zag, the outfit founded by “Miraculous’ writer, director and producer Jeremy Zag. \n\t\n\n\tNow in development, the next bigscreen project will mark the next installment in the franchise whose first feature, “Miraculous Ladybug & Cat Noir,” was a global hit in 2023. While it streamed on Netflix in a number of territories such as the U.S., Canada and Latin America, the film thrived at the box office across most of Europe where it opened theatrically, grossing over $40 million. Featuring eight original songs, the musical film also broke ground as the first female-powered superhero movie set in Paris. \n\n\n\tCohen and Roller will be working on the new movie alongside Jeremy Zag, who had directed the first “Miraculous” film and will also serve as a producer. The announcement was made by Andy Yeatman, CEO of Miraculous Corp USA and global operations. \n\n\tMatt Roller, John Cohen\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tInspired by the style and storytelling of Japanese anime, “Miraculous: Ladybug & Cat Noir” follows  Marinette and Adrien, two Parisian teenagers entrusted with magical powers to protect the city from supervillains. \n\n\tThe film will expand on the hit series created by Thomas Astruc and designed by Nathanaël Bronn, which has been airing on TF1 in France since 2015, as well as over 120 additional territories worldwide. The franchise has a massive global digital ecosystem, garnering over 48 billion views on YouTube, with more than 43 million subscribers across 31 localized channels. On TikTok, the brand boasts more than 1 billion views and it’s built a community of more than 56 million followers across all platforms. \n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been a huge fan of ‘Miraculous’ for years. Few franchises in the world have captured hearts the way Miraculous has, with its mix of character-driven storytelling, fantastic comedy, breathtaking action, and empowering themes,” said Cohen, who is currently in production on Paramount Pictures’ “The Angry Birds Movie 3″ starring Jason Sudeikis and set for a December 2026 release. “This is a series that has become a true cultural icon, uniting fans from Paris to São Paulo to Seoul. The chance to help craft Ladybug and Cat Noir’s global theatrical feature film—building on their incredible legacy—was irresistible,” added Cohen, whose production credits also include “Despicable Me” and “The Garfield Movie.” \n\n\tRoller, meanwhile, said, “What excites me about Miraculous is how it balances epic superhero spectacle with deeply relatable characters and stories about real emotions—love, trust, jealousy, hope.” “That combination makes it a dream playground for a storyteller. I can’t wait to take these heroes and their world into a fresh, exciting chapter that will surprise audiences while staying true to everything they love about Miraculous,” continued Roller, who is a creator, showrunner and executive producer on the Netflix animated comedy “Haunted Hotel” which premiered in September. His many television credits include “Community,” “Speechless,” “Rick and Morty.” He is currently writing an original comedy for Sony.\n\n\tZag and Mediawan’s chairman and co-founder Pierre-Antoine Capton, who hosted a bash at the Eiffel Tower for Miraculous’ 10-year anniversary on the eve of Mipcom, said they looked forward to “see (their) ambition come to life on the big screen with a feature film” with Cohen and Roller joining Miraculous Corp for the project.  \n\n\tSpeaking at the festive Paris event surrounded by his family, as well as creative and business partners, Zag said “‘Miraculous’ is a journey that started 15 years ago and the beginning it was very hard to make it happen.” It was indeed a brand new IP with a female superhero way before it was hype. Zag was also committed to weaving themes of resilience, courage and identity, alongside the action adventure and  comedy. As such, “Miraculous” has been hailed as a benchmark in values-driven entertainment for youth audiences. Zag, who shared the stage with Capton, Yeatman, Astruc, Bronn and Aton Soumache, among others, also praised Mediawan for being “an incredible partner who gave (Miraculous) a new energy for pushing the brand even further around the world.”\n\t\n\n\tBeyond television and film, “Miraculous” has indeed been extended into toys, books, fashion, games and live events\n\n\t“A great idea alone is never enough,” Capton said, adding that “Miraculous” was a “symbol of French creativity.” “You need brilliant writers, inspired artists, passionate producers, loyal partners and, above all, an audience that believes in it. So thank you to the talent, the studio, the broadcaster, the platforms and the licensees, the marketing teams, the sales teams and, above all, thank you to the women, those who grew up with Ladybug, those who still carry her in their hearts,” said Capton. “Because ultimately, that’s the miracle of Ladybug is that it’s making the world’s heart beat in unison with a cartoon born in Paris.” \n\n\tThe executive pointed out “the next 10 years will be even more ambitious. New stories, new worlds, new emotions, new films and always the same energy, the same high standards and the same passion.”\n\n\tYeatman, said “John (Cohen)’s extraordinary record of delivering global animated hits and Matt’s rare gift for blending heart, humor, and imagination will ensure our film not only thrills audiences but also deepens their connection to these beloved heroes.”\n\n\tCohen is represented by Fred Toczek at Felker Toczek Suddleson McGinnis Ryan. Roller is represented by Pete Stein at CAA with management by Eryn Brown and Marc Mounier at Entertainment 360.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift is back cheering for the Kansas City Chiefs, seen at her first NFL game of the season after announcing her engagement to the team’s veteran tight end Travis Kelce in August.\n\n\tSwift was photographed enjoying the Oct. 12 home game from a private suite. The Chiefs are facing the Detroit Lions.\n\n\tThe game comes two years after Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship in October 2023. Swift announced their engagement in August in a social media post, writing “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”\n\t\n\n\tThe proposal happened in the minutes after Swift recorded an appearance on the New Heights podcast, which Kelce hosts with his brother and now-retired NFL star Jason Kelce. The fandom-juiced episode drew a massive audience, with 13 million YouTube views in just the first 24 hours.\n\n\tOn her episode, Swift teased details of her then-upcoming album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” saying that the new music was inspired by her globe-trotting experience on her record-breaking Eras Tour: “This album is about what was going on behind the scenes of my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant. It just comes from the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, and so that effervescence has come through on this record. And like you said, bangers.”\n\n\tSwift’s popularity as the NFL’s most publicized fan has also led league commissioner Roger Goodell to openly invite the singer-songwriter to play the Super Bowl halftime show: “We would always love to have Taylor play. She is a special, special talent and obviously, she would be welcome at any time.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen the Raspberries came out of the gate as a thirsty band from Cleveland in the early 1970s, they were scrappy underdogs — notwithstanding the smooth polish of some of their records, their perfect shag haircuts and (at first) matching suits. Now, 50 years after their breakup, the Raspberries still count as scrappy underdogs, at least in the eyes of the cultists who keep the band’s legend alive. The Eric Carmen-fronted band is being celebrated with “Play On: A Raspberries Tribute” a two-CD salute that sports covers of 37 of their songs, i.e., nearly their entire 1970s catalog. \n\t\n\n\tThose who already revere the Raspberries as high priests of the religion of power pop will be in heaven, and the group could pick up some late converts along the way, or at least a better understanding of how hard the band actually rocked in-between churning some of the most indelible pop hooks of the era. There will be no harm and no foul if those who only know the Raspberries from “Go All the Way” — their biggest hit, which reached No. 5 on the Hot 100 in 1972 — should happen to explore the rest of their material through these covers, then go back all the way to the still fresh-sounding originals.\n\n\n\tThe set includes tracks from Rick Springfield, the Lemon Twigs, Foreigner’s Lou Gramm, Vicki and Debbie Peterson of the Bangles, Marshall Crenshaw, the Runaways’ Cherie Currie, Darian Sahanaja of Brian Wilson’s band, John Waite and many others. It’s  co-produced by the man who is perhaps the world’s biggest Raspberries enthusiast, Ken Sharp, who recently published an 820-page expansion of his vital source book, “Overnight Sensation The Story of Raspberries,” on top of working on this musical salute for three years with partner Fernando Perdomo.\n\t\n\n\tEven among his fellow aficionados of so-called power pop, Sharp is not sure that the Raspberries are always put at the top of the heap, as they should be. \n\n\t“I really think that Raspberries in many ways are underrated,” Sharp says. “You know, people that love power pop may have other choices, but for me it’s Raspberries followed pretty closely by Badfinger. I get that with Big Star, it was darker and it was edgier and it was kind of like that secret society many, many years later. And I absolutely adore their music, but I think that Raspberries are the quintessential power pop band. Big Star has received more than enough accolades. Step aside, guys, and let some of that rain on the Raspberries, because they’re incredibly deserving.”\n\n\tHe adds, “Everything about the Raspberries hits hits my sweet spot, whether it’s the Beatles or the Beach Boys or the Who or the Left Bank or the Small Faces and so many other bands that are probably part of Eric, Wally (Bryson), Dave (Smalley), and Jim (Bonfanti)’s —and later, Scott (McCarl) and Michael (McBride)’s — influences. It was just the most picture-perfect amalgamation of everything I love about music in one band.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRaspberries tribute album Play On cover\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKen Sharp\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCarmen — who was one of several singer-songwriters in the different iterations of the band, albeit by far the most prominent — died in March 2024. He lent his imprimatur to what Sharp was working on for quite some time prior to his death, offering notes of approval on different tracks as the producer sent them over. His sole musical contribution to the album was sending over a new recording of his “one-two-three-four!” count-in to the rocker “Tonight,” since Lou Gramm forgot to include that part when he cut the tune, and Sharp thought it would make for a fun cameo. But his presence looms large, as does that of some of the other members who participated even more directly.\n\n\t“While the project started out, I was letting the band members know and I was keeping in touch, especially with Eric, because I would have questions at times about ‘What was this part?’ Because when you listen to those records, they’re pretty dense and there’s a lot going on,” Sharp says, “and it’s kind of a lo-fi, AM radio, compressed sound. I mean, there’s a sax part on the bridge of ‘I Wanna Be With You’ [a No. 16 hit in 1972] that is kind of buried, and I reached out to Eric and said, ‘What exactly is being played, so we can get the sax player to do that?’ He would help with that. Wally (Bryson) or Dave (Smalley, the other two original frontmen), they were writing on guitar, but Eric wrote most of his on piano, so transposing into guitar was kind of tricky. You can play them kind of the dum-dum way, but if you want to play it the right way, if it was an Eric song, I had that incredible good fortune to be able to reach out to him about it.”\n\t\n\n\tOriginal drummer Jim Bonfanti actually played on several tracks on the tribute. “Jim was really excited about the record,” Sharp says. ” And with people like Vicki and Debbie Peterson from the Bangles or Lou Graham or John Waite, those artists wanted us to have a track to provide. I thought, what would be better than to have the original drummer kick ass on these tracks? And that was Jim. And then Jim hadn’t played on the Raspberries’ final album, ‘Starting Over’ [at which point he had left the group]. But Raspberries did ‘I Don’t Know What I Want’ from that album in their set when they reunited for reunion shows in the 2000s, and it was just incendiary with Jim. So he got a real kick out of playing drums on a song here that he never played on the studio version.”\n\n\tSharp does the math and points out that 36 of the Raspberries’ 40 released tracks are covered here — “there were only a few that we weren’t able to cast” — and the number goes up to 37 with the inclusion of “Please Let Me Come Back Home,” ‘Please Let Me Come Back Home,” one of the demos the band did prior to their first album that caught the attention of their producer-to-be, Jimmy Ienner.\n\n\tSharp runs down some of the more boldface-name contributions. “What was most important to me was to cast it as best as possible and not rush through it,” he says. “Rick Springfield was a holy grail, and I reached out to Rick first when we decided to start working on the project; he was the one that was my holy grail to do ‘Go All the Way.’ Had this song been included on ‘Working Class Dog’ as the followup to ‘Jessie’s Girl,’ I believe he would’ve had a No. 1 hit with it.”\n\n\n\n\n\tOf a younger act with hard-rocking old souls that is widely appreciated cross-generationally, he says: “Of course, the Lemon Twigs nail the assignment. What was funny is, initially I reached out to them early in the process and they weren’t really hip to the Raspberries; they were kind of hip to Big Star and things like that. And I think it paid off for my project to be in the works for a few years, because they finally caught up to Raspberries and they were asking, ‘How can we get a copy of your book?’ And they reached out and said, ‘Hey, we’re in a quandary. We don’t know what to do. We love “Let’s Pretend” and we love “Play On.”’ I’m like, ‘Problem solved — do them both. So Brian sang ‘Let’s Pretend’ and Michael sang ‘Play On.’”\n\t\n\n\tThe Raspberries took about 30 years to reunite after their initial breakup, and coincidentally, so did one of the acts that got back together to contribute a track here. “The Hudson Brothers keep saying they’re gonna reunite and do some shows, and I was reaching out to Mark (Hudson) for many months to say, ‘Hey, let’s do a track.’ Near the end of the project, Mark got in touch with me and agreed to participate with his brothers, and they do ‘All Through the Night,’ in a really incredible, high-energy version that kind of sounds like Slade. It’s their first track in over 30 years.”\n\n\tOn the fresh-faced side, the collection includes the young singer Tori Holub, who stole a lot of hearts as the least-known singer on the recent Burt Bacharach tribute tour, partly because she can sound like a dead ringer for Karen Carpenter, though that’s not all she can pull off. “I heard in my mind Karen Carpenter singing the beautiful melody of ‘Starting Over,'” Sharp explains. “With Eric, a lot of times I would send the recording to him if an artist did one of his songs, just to get his opinion. And the last message I have from Eric is him responding to the version of ‘Starting Over’ by Tori. He really loved the version, loved her voice, and kindly complimented me about the music, saying, ‘It doesn’t sound like Raspberries, nor should it.’ So I think he liked that it was a little bit out of the box. Tori’s version is just absolutely stunning.”\n\n\t(There was a rare lyric change in that one. “I know that Tori was uncomfortable singing the word fuck in the first line of ‘Starting Over’ —  ‘Used to be so fucking optimistic.’ I think the reason Eric put that in there was just to put across the desperation he was feeling, since that song was such a deeply personal song to him. Tori said, ‘Hey, is it okay if I change that up, and I said, ‘That’s fine.'” Lou Gramm also leaves out the “Won’t you let me sleep with you, baby” part of “Tonight”; Sharp says that one wasn’t discussed. If he omitted it because it sounds too salacious in 2025, the producer agrees that could count as slightly ironic for the fellow who sang “Hot Blooded.” \n\n\tBut Currie had no problem with the prospect of a threesome coming up in “Hands on You.” “They were horn dogs!” Sharp says, of the Raspberries’ very, very randy side. “That one I was a little worried about placing with anyone because of some of, you know, shall we say the risque lyrics, but, you know, it was the ’70s.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOf the musical side of “Hands on You” representing a departure, Sharp says, “Listen to the original from ‘Starting Over, which is this real jaunty, ‘Beach Boys Party’ acoustic guitar thing with lots of laughing and falling and saying funny things. We tried to give it a glam-rock sheen and create these really cool bridges; the original had these incredible, beautiful, melancholy chord constructions that deserved a more produced and thought-out version.” As unfaithful arrangements go, though, Sharp says “‘I Can Hardly Believe You’re Mine’ (sung by John Powhida) was reshaped as Eno meets the Stylistics meets Prince. I would say that’s the greatest departure, absolutely.” \n\n\tIf there is anyone Sharp has championed as much as the Raspberries, it’s Todd Rundgren and his associated projects, “and it was a thrill to get half of my beloved Utopia on this record, with Kasim Sulton, and I thought ‘With You in My Life’ would be a really cool one for Willie to sing since he kind of has that vaudeville-esque type of voice.” (For anyone interested in Rundgren connections, Sharp says he picked the relatively unknown Adelaide Estep to sing the Raspberries’ classic “I Saw the Light” on this album because he came across her on YouTube singing… Todd Rundgren’s completely unrelated hit also called “I Saw the Light.”)\n\n\tThere are plenty of other contributors to the set Sharp is eager to point out, including, on the newcomers’ side, Olivia Rubini, who was on “The Voice” this year, and also some veterans he was thrilled to get, like Meat Loaf veteran Karla DeVito, who nails the album’s most epic track, “I Can Remember,” which Sharp considers to be Carmen’s poppy version of prog-rock. There’s a similar expansiveness to “On the Beach,” recorded by Darian Sahanaja, whose former band the Wondermints — trivia question and answer here — were once managed by no less than Eric Carmen.\n\n\tSharp wanted to make sure that all the members who sang lead and contributed songs were being saluted as well as the guy who went on to the more famous solo career. “As much as Eric is the center point in terms of being the writer that had the hits, I really think that this record also spotlights the collective, incredible songwriting, talent and diversity with Wally. And with Dave coming from a much more country-rock place, he could have been a member of the Eagles if they needed to replace Randy Meisner earlier. Then you had Scott McCarl (who joined before the final album, “Overnight Sensation”), who was the John to Eric’s Paul. So it’s a collective celebration of all their talents.”\n\t\n\n\tSharp can’t say enough about all six members of the Raspberries, but he thinks the band’s drumming was been especially underrated. “Obviously you had two incredible drummers. Jim to me was a bit more of a controlled Keith Moon. And then Michael McBride was just a monster on the drums and probably more of an out-of-control heavy hitter. There was a Rhino collection called ‘Let There be Drums’ that Max Weinberg curated, and one of the songs that he picked as being an incredible drum performance was ‘Overnight Sensation.’ I remember calling and telling Michael, who was very humble, but I could tell was very pleased to get that call-out.”\n\n\tThe Raspberries love extended across the E Street Band. Although he was not able to procure a track from the Boss for the album, “Springsteen was a huge fan of the band and would talk about how they were a huge influence on him when he was working on ‘The River.’ He would listen to the ‘Raspberries Greatest’ cassette in his car — you know, uh, he was listening to Woody Guthrie and the Raspberries! And Springsteen wrote the liner notes for (their reunion live album), and that doesn’t happen much.”\n\n\tThere’s an interesting intersection of influence and lineage represented in history and on the album for KISS fans. “Paul Stanley saw them at Carnegie Hall in ’73. The song that would always open KISS shows back in the day is a song called ‘Deuce,'” says Sharp, who has co-written two authorized KISS books, “and the beginning of that song, Paul told me, was him trying to do something that was similar to the intro to ‘go all the way.’Go All the Way.’ And then actually the Raspberries Mach II lineup opened for KISS in 1974.” Now, “Paul’s son, Evan Stanley, is on the Raspberries tribute, and I’m sure his dad turned him onto the band, He does ‘Last Dance,’ by Wally, in an ironically very plaintive, very lonesome, very intimate way, which to me recalls Big Star.” \n\n\tAnother rock scion is on the album: Robin Taylor Zander, son of Cheap Trick’s singer and now a member of the band, sings “Don’t Wanna Say Goodbye.” “He is the splitting image of his dad as a vocalist, with a bit of a higher voice. But he did that song solo, played all the instruments, and delivered an absolutely beautiful, very Lennon-esque track.”\n\n\tNot least of all, Sharp himself is on the album as one of the contributing artists, which he said was more through circumstances of candidates coming and going than wanting to hog the ‘berries catalog for himself. Nailing down the quintessential 1970s swagger of Carmen’s “I’m a Rocker” was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it.\n\t\n\n\tSharp acknowledges that Raspberries (or is it “the Raspberries”? No one ever seems sure, and even Sharp uses the terms interchangeably) have not been completely swept under the carpet. “The ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ soundtrack had ‘Go All the Way’ on it, and it’s actually the only platinum record the band was ever awarded,” though earlier they got a gold record for the original hit. Anyway, all’s well that rests in power (pop).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Ken Sharp\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Play On: A Raspberries Tribute” can be ordered here.

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery rejected a takeover offer of “around” $20 per share from David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance in recent weeks as “too low,” Bloomberg News reported Saturday, citing anonymous sources.\n\n\tWBD shares closed at $17.10/share Friday, up more than 36% since news broke Sept. 11 of Ellison’s interest in bidding for the rival just weeks after closing Skydance’s deal to acquire Paramount Global. Warner Bros. Discovery, parent of HBO/HBO Max, Warner Bros. Entertainment, CNN, TNT, TBS and more, has a market cap of $42.3 billion. The Bloomberg story did not indicate whether Paramount’s bid included the assumption of WBD’s total debt (which as of June 30 was $35.6 billion).\n\t\n\n\tParamount Skydance has been in talks with Apollo Global Management, the asset management firm that had previously bid for Paramount Global, about joining its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, Bloomberg reported. Larry Ellison, the billionaire Oracle founder who is David’s father, fronted most of the money for Skydance’s $8 billion deal for Paramount Global.\n\n\n\tReps for Paramount, WBD and Apollo did not respond to requests for comment Sunday.\n\n\tEllison, speaking last week at L.A.’s Bloomberg Screentime conference, did not confirm that Paramount Skydance has bid for WBD. But he went on to explain why he thinks Paramount needs to bolt on more content-producing engines to achieve sustainable growth in today’s streaming-centric world and cited WBD chief David Zaslav’s comments that the industry needs more consolidation.\n\n\t“I do think there’s a lot of [M&A] options out there that in terms of what actually might be actionable in the near future,” Ellison said at the conference. “You actually need more content to yield more engagement. And so we would actually want to be in the business, through whatever lens we’re looking at” to produce “more movies, more television series” to get more scale and engagement. Ellison declined to name potential takeout targets.\n\t\n\n\tParamount Skydance’s bid for Warner Bros. Discovery would be for WBD in its entirety, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The M&A overture comes ahead of WBD’s plans to split into two separate companies next spring (Warner Bros., comprising studios and streaming, and Discovery Global, including TV networks and Discovery+).\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Inbetweeners,” the hit British teen comedy series that gave the world a foul-mouthed library of hilariously puerile quotes not to mention two hugely successful spin-off movies, looks set to make a comeback. \n\n\tBanijay UK and Fudge Park Productions, the company founded in 2015 by show creators Iain Morris and Damon Beesley, have struck an agreement which they say “paves the way for the return of the hit comedy title.” In what guise “The Inbetweeners” will return and on what platform is as yet unknown, although Morris and Beesley suggested it would revolve around the original characters. \n\t\n\n\t“Incredibly exciting to be plotting more adventures for our four favourite friends (ooh friends),” they said in a statement. \n\n\n\tOriginally broadcast on E4 in the U.K. between 2008 and 2019, “The Inbetweeners” follows the misadventures of suburban teenager Will MacKenzie and his friends Simon Cooper, Neil Sutherland and Jay Cartwright at the fictional Rudge Park Comprehensive as they navigated school life, friendship, male bonding, lad culture and failed sexual encounters. It was originally conceived as a more realistic counterpoint to fellow hit Brit teen show “Skins,” showcasing an adolescence that is awkward and — as Morris suggested at the time — mostly “crap.”\n\n\tOver three series “The Inbetweeners” set new ratings records for the channel and won multiple awards. Two hit movies followed, released in 2011 and 2014 respectively. The first set a record for the biggest opening weekend for a U.K. comedy at the time of its release with the sequel also breaking box office records.\n\t\n\n\tMade by Bwark Productions, the original company founded by Morris and Beesley, which later sold to Zodiak Media (acquired by Banijay in 2016), the new deal unlocks what is described as “the rights and the potential to bring ‘The Inbetweeners’ back for new audiences across a range of platforms including film, tv and stage.”\n\n\t“We are thrilled to announce this exciting partnership with Banijay who share our vision and ambition for one of the most iconic comedies in British history,” said Jonathan Blyth, managing director of Fudge Park. “This is a wonderful moment for fans, there are exciting conversations afoot and more news to follow.”\n\n\tPatrick Holland, CEO Banijay UK added: “I have worked with Damon and Iain on a number of Fudge Park projects over the years and was delighted to pick up the conversation about the future of ‘The Inbetweeners’ with them. They have an infectious creative vision for the brand which will resonate with audience old and new so I can’t wait to get going.”\n\n\tBanijay Rights are distributors of “The Inbetweeners.”\n\n\tSince ending the series, Morris and Beesley have worked on numerous projects, both together and apart, and teamed on “The Festival” comedy film and later the BBC series ‘The First Team.” Beesley also created the series “White Gold,” starring many of “The Inbetweeners” cast, while Morris co-wrote sports comedy “Next Goal Wins” alongside Taika Waititi, was among the creators of Apple series “Time Bandits” and recently directed Netflix feature “My Oxford Year.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCANNES, France — “The future began 100 years ago,” proclaimed a three-minute clip shown at a Globo Showcase Cocktail on Sunday evening at Mipcom, chronicling the Brazilian communications giant’s evolution from newspaper, launched in 1925, to radio and Rede Globo TV network.\n\n\tThe welter of Globo international partnerships and deals confirmed on stage on Sunday at Cannes Carlton Hotel by Angela Colla, Globo Head of International Business and Co-productions, did much to suggest that for Globo the future is beginning again. \n\t\n\n\tA country the size of a continent, Brazil’s battle this century has been to reach out to the rest of the world and Globo’s challenge to consolidate the broadening of its portfolio from telenovelas –  while ensuring that they continue to travel – to other forms of entertainment and business models, joining the global mainstream. \n\n\n\tOne way to achieve that is format deals. “This year was key in marking our consolidation in the format sales business,” Colla said in Cannes. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Others\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Paulo Belote\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn one unannounced pact, Globoplay has pacted with Anonymous Content for a U.S. version of “The Others,” Colla announced. Created by Lucas Paraizo (“Under Pressure”) and charting the current build of intolerance, he has told Variety, “The Others” is set in a gated community in Rio’s suburbs where a scuffle between two teens escalates into a bloody confrontation between their parents. The format has already sold to Germany (ndF) and Greece (produced by Primavisione, broadcast by Alpha).\n\n\tIn further deals unveiled by Colla, partnering with Turkey’s Ay Yapim, Globo has seen revenge saga “Leyla,” the Turkish adaptation of telenovela phenomenon “Brazil Avenue,” go global, selling to date to more than 20 countries. \n\t\n\n\tGlobo has sold the format for “All the Flowers,” about a visually impaired perfumer’s battle for freedom and love, to Greece’s  Primavisione and Alpha. It has also clinched a format deal with Portugal’s SIC broadcast network on “Pages of Life,” a 2006 modern classic telenovela from Manoel Carlos. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the Flowers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Globo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGlobo’s Ron Leshem, Fox, BBC Studios Co-Productions\n\n\tAnother way to join the global conversation: international co-production with key “A” List creatives and companies. Announced just before the Showcase, via his prodco label Crossing Oceans, Ron Leshem, creator of the original “Euphoria,” will be joining forces with Koby Gal Raday and Ilda Santiago’s Janeiro Studios and Globoplay, the leading Brazilian streaming platform, to produce “Paranoia.” \n\n\tTo be co-developed by Leshem and Claudia Jouvin, who broke out this summer as head writer of Globoplay smash hit “Perfect Days,” “Paranoia” was described to Variety by its producers as “‘Black Swan’ and ‘Whiplash’ mixed with the feel-good vibes and payoffs of the ‘Queen’s Gambit’ and the generation-defining impact of ‘Euphoria.’”\n\n\tUnveiled on Saturday, Globo and Fox Entertainment Studios – the world’s leading producer of Christmas movies – announced they were partnering to develop and produce an original English-language Christmas movie set and filmed in Brazil. Aiming to ensure cultural authenticity, Globo will provide creative guidance to accurately reflect Brazilian culture and traditions, including the country’s unique celebration of Christmas, which takes place during Brazil’s summer.\n\n\tLate last week, BBC Studios and Brazilian Globo signed a landmark first co-production deal for a doc series that will “transport audiences to the heart” of Brazil’s sprawling Amazon rainforest.” The series, whose details are still being kept under wraps, will be produced by BBC Studios Specialist Factual Productions and Globo, with a story that innately comes from Brazil,” Janet Brown, president of Global Content Sales at BBC Studios, told Variety.\n\n\tAlex Medeiros, Globoplay Director of Drama, Documentaries and Films drilled down at the Showcase on other co-production arrangements: with Telemundo Studios, a first title to be announced shortly; with Beta Film, announced last year at Mipcom; with Fremantle on the series “Crime Inc,” and with Gaumont USA on “Deluxe,” about the rise and fall of Brazil’s high-fashion icon Eliana Tranchesi, which goes into production this week.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnything Goes\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew Globo Shows Catch Fire\n\n\tIn straight sales, Globo has licensed to top Argentine network Telefe both “All the Flowers” and “Xuxa, the Documentary,” on Brazil’s biggest pop star.\n\n\tIts trailer shown at the Showcase, Globoplay’s latest release, series “Perfect Days” – a stylish but rapidly unsettling abduction thriller chosen by Variety among its Must-See TV titles for Mipcom – has become the most-watched original series on Globoplay of any nationality since its premiere in the Summer, Colla announced, calling the Anonymous Content Brazil production “a thrilling series which still has an impact on me” and which “shows a different side of our audiovisual work.”\n\n\tA second Mipcom title, “Anything Goes,” a plush, fast-paced remake of one of Brazil’s biggest telenovela 1980s hits, hit a 56% audience share at the moment of the murder of the arch villainess, while the production is Globo’s top-grossing primetime telenovela in Brazil, with 16 brands, including BYD, Corona, Uber, Amazon, Paramount, and L’Oréal, participating in 76 branded content actions. \n\n\t“We are storytellers, and our greatest triumph is our commitment to quality and to representing the best of our people — happiness, hard work, creativity, strength, and optimism, among other core values,” Colla said at the Mipcom Showcase. \n\n\t“We always tell stories in a responsible way, stories that move and connect with all kinds of audiences,” she added. “And diversity is not only within the content or genres, such as telenovelas, series, or documentaries, but also in the business models, including finished content, scripted formats, unscripted formats, and co-productions.”\n\n\tMore to come.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWith last year’s news about “The Martian” screenwriter Drew Goddard taking the helm from Lana and Lily Wachowski for a new “Matrix” film, Laurence Fishburne expressed his hesitancy in reprising his role as Morpheus in a future iteration of the sci-fi franchise. \n\n\t“It depends on how good it is, really,” Fishburne said on stage at “The Matrix” reunion at New York Comic Con 2025. “If it’s great, then yeah, if it makes sense. I don’t know if it makes sense.”\n\t\n\n\tFishburne added that he had reached out to the Wachowski sisters about starring in “The Matrix Resurrections,” but was ultimately not invited to return for the sequel. \n\n\n\t“I reached out,” revealed Fishburne. “It just didn’t pan out. I said ‘Thank you very much,’ And Lana [Wachowski] said, ‘Thank you very much, I’ll think about it,’ and that was that.”\n\n\tDuring “The Matrix” panel, moderated by ‘Happy Sad Confused’ podcast host Josh Horowitz, Fishburne and Joe Pantoliano reflected on the success of the film, how they were cast and the cultural impact of Morpheus and Cypher two decades later. After being asked about how “The Matrix” has influenced new generations of filmmakers, Fishburne explained the importance of the film throughout multiple storytelling genres. \n\n\t“There’s no movie that comes after ‘The Matrix’ that’s a sci-fi action or fantasy movie that’s not been influenced by it,” said Fishburne. “It’s everywhere. It’s so pervasive you almost forget where it came from at this point. Now, people don’t realize, but no ‘The Matrix,’ no MCU. It [just] doesn’t look the same.”\n",

It’s so repetitive. ‘Trump this, Trump that.’ Yawn.”\n\n\tFey’s Noem then entered frame, toting an assault rifle and wearing a DHS hat.\n\n\t“That’s right, it’s me, Kristi,” Fey’s Noem said. “I spell my name with an ‘I’ because that’s how I thought it was spelled.”\n\n\tFey’s Noem then gave some behind-the-scenes info on how she recruits people for ICE. She said, “How did I find them? By running ads like this: Do you need a job now? Yeah. Are you a big, tough guy? Yeah. Tough enough for the army or police? No. Do you take supplements that you bought at a gas station? Daily. Do you like to use zip ties because people in your life don’t trust you with keys? You know it. Suck on some of these, big boy. Welcome to ICE.”\n\t\n\n\tCheck out the sketch below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER WARNING: This story contains spoilers from Episode 6 of HBO’s “Task,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tAs one of the young recruits on HBO’s “Task,” Delaware County detective Anthony Grasso (Fabien Frankel) is an enigmatic figure, always ready to spring into action to help Tom Brandis (Mark Ruffalo) locate a missing child in a small-town Philadelphia suburb. Throughout the series, though, small hints have suggested that someone in the tight-knit FBI task force has been leaking information to the motorcycle gang the Dark Hearts, leaving Tom to wonder who could be the mole inside his inner circle of colleagues.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s in Episode 5 that we learn that Grasso has been leaking information to Jayson (Sam Keeley), one of the leaders of the Dark Hearts about the whereabouts of Cliff Broward (Raúl Castillo), revealing that Sam (Ben Doherty) is alive and has been staying with Robbie Prendergrast (Tom Pelphrey) after the deaths of Sam’s parents during a drug-house robbery.\n\n\n\tAs Episode 6 begins with the FBI and Dark Hearts both surrounding Robbie in the middle of the woods, everything that Grasso has worked toward suddenly comes to a halt after the Dark Hearts murder Lizzie (Alison Oliver), his closest confidante on the task force, leaving her body on the side of the road after running her over. While Grasso attempts to grapple with his grief over Lizzie’s shocking death, he finds himself cornered by Tom about his past with the nefarious motorcycle gang.\n\n\tVariety spoke with Frankel about Grasso and Tom’s final confrontation, whether the detective was using Lizzie in earlier episodes, and the Catholic guilt riddled throughout the series.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Peter Kramer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAt the beginning of Episode 6, Grasso and Lizzie find themselves in the middle of crossfire with the Dark Hearts in the woods. When one of the Dark Hearts is about to shoot at Lizzie, Grasso fires the gun right next to her ear, which causes her world to go silent. When he fires the weapon, is he entirely aware of what’s going on with Lizzie as she’s attempting to recover during the heat of the moment?\t\n\n\tHe’s aware that if he can’t solve or create the potential to solve the version of this situation, things for him are going to go horribly wrong. What he doesn’t quite realize until Lizzie is shot near her ear is that [his action] is going to cost the lives of people that he genuinely cares about. \n\t\n\t\tWe see Grasso tell Perry (Jamie McShane) and Jayson to flee the scene, which ultimately leads them to killing Lizzie as they run her over on the bridge. After everything Grasso has been through with the Dark Hearts, what is the moment that he regrets his past with them? Is it because of Lizzie’s death, or is it much earlier in the season?\t\n\n\tHe always has had a tinge of regret about getting involved with the Dark Hearts. There’s the Catholic guilt complex, which is what he has, like “I’ve done wrong and I must repent,” but obviously at no point during the first three episodes is there any awareness that it’s going to escalate where it does. Lizzie’s death is ultimately the overshadowing moment where all his worst nightmares are realized.\n\t\n\t\tEveryone keeps telling Grasso to move on from Lizzie’s death, as he’s actively still grieving her while the task force house is getting investigated. We see him throughout the episode as he’s reflecting on his short time with her, and how she’s made this impression on him.\t\n\n\tHe’s already developed a huge bond with her. It’s funny, because I was getting asked in press if Lizzie is a part of his plan of if he was using her all along, which is what I didn’t believe. I know that when Brad [Ingelsby] was writing the show, he didn’t think that was the case. These are two people who genuinely really get along and develop a real friendship. He never ends up sleeping with her due to the fact that he’s afraid of the marriage bed and that he doesn’t want to do more wrong in the eyes of his Catholicism and his relationship with her, per his relationship with the Dark Hearts. He just genuinely cares about her.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI never saw that he was using Lizzie, especially during one of their first scenes together in Episode 2 when he makes everyone in the bar that she frequents cheer for her.\t\n\n\tI’m glad you didn’t see it like that, because he’s just trying to make her feel good! He cares about her and he can see that she’s a bit of a lost puppy in this police force. He feels sorry for her — not that he feels sorry for her in every aspect, but in that aspect of her relationship with being a police officer. \n\t\n\t\tIn the final moments of the episode, Tom approaches Grasso about the past complaints against him at his previous job, and that he’s aware of his past with the Dark Hearts. The two have a conversation about past sins, and there’s a line about how “God doesn’t seem to forget,” in reference to Tom’s past as a priest. If Grasso had confessed to Tom in that exact moment, would he have been forgiven?\t\n\n\tThat’s such a great question. The whole point of the conversation is forgiven by who? I’m not a very religious person, but I believe in God and I don’t know where I identify in terms of the religious spectrum, but certainly what I feel is that forgiveness has to come from within yourself. I guess if within yourself comes from God, then I don’t know if Tom forgiving Grasso would make him feel forgiven. Brad talked so much about it, and he was saying that when he was a kid that he really struggled with his Catholicism. My mom’s Catholic and I believe a lot of Catholic people have to grow up with this feeling of guilt in the eyes of the Lord. \n\n\tFor Grasso, I don’t know if that guilt would ever be completely alleviated. I suppose that the reason he wants to turn himself in is to take some of that weight off. He would probably have an easier time forgiving himself if he confessed.\n\t\n\t\tHow does the final line that Tom says to him before he leaves stick with him internally? Tom gives him the chance to confess about leaking the information to the Dark Hearts, and Grasso chooses not to.\t\n\n\tIt’s funny, because we talked about that scene and that line so much on set. Brad had written a version of that scene where the scene ended with Tom leaving and saying something like “I’m coming for you,” and Grasso says “So come.” The idea is that it’s Grasso’s last stand. It’s a true moment of defiance, even if he knows in his subconscious that he is going to turn himself in already by that point.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou co-founded a production company with your brother called “Marcel Monique Pictures” last year, around the time that you were filming on “Task.” What did you learn from working with Brad Ingelsby and the team behind the series that you would love to bring onto your company’s future projects?\t\n\n\tWhat Brad does and has done better than anyone I’ve ever met is surround himself with the kindest people to work with. Brad’s choice is always thinking about who is the person that is going to make this experience a more enjoyable one, rather than who is the best person for the job. I was like, “You know what? That’s the way to make movies.” Make them with people you love and work with your friends and family. Take chances on people you love, because they’ll work the hardest for and with you because you’ll get rewarded tenfold.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "description": "\n\tUniversal Pictures has released the first trailer for Steven Spielberg‘s next film, “Disclosure Day.”\n\n\tThe movie stars Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor, ",
    "body": "\n\tUniversal Pictures has released the first trailer for Steven Spielberg‘s next film, “Disclosure Day.”\n\n\tThe movie stars Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell and Henry Lloyd-Hughes. Spielberg developed the science fiction story with screenwriter David Koepp, who previously collaborated with the director as a writer on “Jurassic Park,” “Jurassic Park: The Lost World,” “War of the Worlds” and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”\n\t\n\n\tHere’s the logline: “If you found out we weren’t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … ‘Disclosure Day.'”\n\n\n\t“Disclosure Day” is the 37th film that Spielberg has directed since his (partially lost) debut in 1964 — coincidentally, that initial feature, “Firelight,” was also a science fiction film. He has returned to the genre in several films over the years including the two “Jurassic Park” movies and “War of the Worlds” as well as “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” “Minority Report,” “A.I. Artificial Intelligence” and “Ready Player One.”\n\n\tThe cumulative box office gross of Spielberg’s directing filmography is over $10 billion worldwide. As a director and producer, he has been nominated for over 23 Academy Awards, taking home three including best director wins for “Schindler’s List” and “Saving Private Ryan” in 1993 and 1998, respectively.\n\n\tHis most recent film, 2023’s semi-autobiographical “The Fabelmans” grossed $45 million and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including best picture.\n\t\n\n\tUniversal will release “Disclosure Day” in theaters on June 12. It is produced by Spielberg alongside Kristie Macosko Krieger at Amblin Entertainment.\n\n\tWatch the trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tInstagram is making the jump from mobile devices to the living-room TV for the first time — a bid to ratchet up viewing of short-form Reels, by taking videos to the biggest screen in the house.\n\n\tThe Meta-owned social platform on Tuesday launched a pilot of Instagram for TV, an app designed to display Reels on connected TVs. It is initially available for Amazon’s Fire TV family of devices and only in the U.S.; Instagram expects to widen support for additional devices and launch in additional markets next year.\n\t\n\n\tBut how many people will actually want to use Instagram for TV? The company says it has feedback that there’s a healthy appetite for such a use case.\n\n\n\t“We have seen a ton of demand from people on Instagram to watch Reels on TV,” said Tessa Lyons-Laing, VP of product for Instagram. “We hear all the time that people get together with they’re friends to watch Reels. It’s fun to connect with your friends about this stuff.”\n\n\tInitially, there will not be any advertising on the Instagram for TV app, but that’s something the company will consider going forward, said Lyons-Laing.\n\n\tAidan Marcuss, VP of Fire TV devices at Amazon, commented on the Instagram for TV app launch, “We’re committed to keep pushing the boundaries of entertainment on customers’ biggest screens — the Instagram team has built an awesome experience, and we’re excited to be the first place to offer it.”\n\n\tNote that “Instagram for TV” is different from the previous “IGTV” initiative. Originally launched in 2018, IGTV was not on television sets: It was meant to spur the creation of longer-form video on Instagram, of videos up to 15 minutes in length. (Reels can be up to 3 minutes in length.) The project was phased out in 2022, as Instagram focused on expanding Reels, Meta’s TikTok-like short-form video format. Now, Instagram is taking Reels to HDTVs to try to carve out some share of big-screen viewing time.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Instagram, IG for TV is personalized for individual users, based on the content and creators they follow and engage with. In the connected-TV app, you can explore channels and categories — from trending comedy and sports to music and lifestyle — with Reels grouped together to make it easier to browse. When you select a channel or creator to watch, the Instagram Reels and Stories will autoplay one after the other. It’s the first time Reels content will be organized like this, Lyons-Laing said: “We’ve made a lot of progress understanding content clusters. That hasn’t existed before on Instagram.”\n\n\tThe Instagram for TV app also shows you Reels that are popular among your friends, and there’s a search feature. The Instagram for TV app allows you to add up to five accounts on one home screen, and you can even create a new account just for TV viewing.\n\n\tInstagram released a video clip showing how the connected-TV app works:\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDogwoof has picked up world sales rights to the feature documentary “Birds of War,” which will world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in the World Cinema Documentary Competition.\n\n\tThe film tells the love story of London-based Lebanese journalist Janay Boulos and Syrian-based activist/cameraman Abd Alkader Habak, delving into their personal archive across 13 years of revolutions, war and exile. The film is directed by Boulos and Habak – their feature debut – and is produced by Sonja Henrici, Boulos and Habak.\n\t\n\n\t“ ‘Birds of War’ is an extraordinary, intimate love story forged in the shadow of conflict,” said Dogwoof CCO Oli Harbottle. “Told through years of personal archives, it brings rare emotional clarity to war, exile and the cost of bearing witness.”\n\n\n\tHenrici commented, ” ‘Birds of War’ uses Janay and Habak’s intimate archive to tell stories that news coverage simply misses. I can’t wait to share this film with audiences in 2026 when the film’s central question is ever more prominent in our minds: How can we be together despite our differences?”\n\n\t“In crafting ‘Birds of War,’ we embarked on a journey that transcends borders and political narratives, weaving our love story through the wars, revolutions, and shifting realities of Lebanon and Syria,” Boulos and Habak wrote. “The film mirrors the complexities of the region we call home, yet it is ultimately a deeply human exploration of connection, an insistence that love can grow even in the most fractured landscapes.”\n\n\tHabak continued, “ ‘Birds of War’ captures how conflict reshapes relationships, identity, and belonging, across borders.”\n\t\n\n\tBoulos added. “This film is an intimate chronicle of love, displacement, and survival, shaped by years of revolution and exile, while rooted deep in our lived experience of history unfolding in real time.”\n\n\tMark Thomas of Screen Scotland, which supported the film, added: “The film is the powerful and emotional love story of directors Janay and Habak, whose chance meeting in the midst of the chaos of conflict, changes the course of their lives.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJack Antonoff’s annual benefit concert for the Ally Coalition — his and his sister Rachel’s charitable organization, which has raised over $2 million to support unhoused LGBTQ+ youths — has featured so many stars over its 11 editions that it’s hard to remember them all: Over the years we’ve seen Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey (on the same night), Sabrina Carpenter (singing a “Christmas version” of “Please Please Please”), Lorde, Kacey Musgraves, Phish’s Trey Anastasio, St. Vincent, Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, Clairo, Brittany Howard, the (Dixie) Chicks, Jason Isbell and many other Antonoff collaborators or adjacent people perform at the event, which features his versatile group Bleachers as the house band and annual co-headiner.\n\t\n\n\tMonday night’s Ally Coalition Talent Show, held at the event’s home base of New York University’s Skirball Center, was no exception, with appearances from Hayley Williams, Florence and the Machine frontperson Florence Welch, Anastasio (all pictured above with Antonoff), Rachel Zegler and more.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom left: Jack Antonoff, Florence Welch, Claud, Samia, Rachel Zegler, Hayley Williams and various Bleachers  (Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images for Ally Coalition)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Ally Coalition\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe guests, who perform two or three songs each and often join others, are never announced in advance, so every year features a mix of perennial performers — singer-songwriter Claud said it was their seventh appearance; Anastasio first performed there in 2022 — and newcomers, most of whom have recently been in Antonoff’s orbit. Williams performed with him at Rolling Stone’s “Musicians on Musicians” concert last month; he co-wrote and co-produced Welch’s 2022 album “Dance Fever.” The looseness of the show is reflected in Antonoff’s frequent stage directions, which are often audibles like “Is he ready?” and “Should we flip them?”\n\t\n\n\tThe show is also interspersed with brief sets from comedians; Tuesday night’s included Mike Birbiglia, Chris Laker and Chris Fleming, all of whom were good, although the latter brought the house down with his self-deprecating, highly physical humor.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRachel Zegler (Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images for Ally Coalition)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Ally Coalition\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe show may be fun and funny, but the cause is serious: In addition to the concert, the Ally Coalition held its fourth annual Day of Services in New York last Friday, bringing together local LGBTQ organizations, medical service organizations, and clothing brands to support the at-risk and homeless youth in the community. It also went on tour last year, with Lucy Dacus, Ethel Cain, Djo, Remi Wolf, TV On The Radio, Grizzly Bear, Lauren Mayberry, Joy Oladokun, and others, and hosted service projects at The Grammy Museum and at LGBTQ+ Centers with Maren Morris to pack hygiene kits for LGBTQ+ youth.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHayley Williams (Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images for Ally Coalition)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Ally Coalition\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMonday evening’s show began with a song from Bleachers, followed by two from Andrew Dost, his erstwhile bandmate in the group Fun. — the short-lived Grammy-winning trio that launched Antonoff to stardom — who plays at the top of the show nearly every year.\n\n\tNext up were Claud, Samia, Hank, and Annie DeRusso with a harmony-filled, hilariously profane anti-holiday song about bringing a love interest to meet the family called “Jesus Fucking Christmas” — not to be confused with the South Park anthem, “Merry Fucking Christmas” — that includes the priceless lyric, “The bar’s not even high/ You were two hours late last time/ And you smell like weed, and my parents think you’re useless.”\n\n\n\n\n\tSinger-songwriter Kelsey Lu followed with a pair of songs before a comedy interlude that led into the show’s big finale, as Bleachers took the stage and performed first with Antonoff’s sister-in-law, Rainey Qualley, then a pair with Anastasio, then Rachel Zegler, star of “Romeo and Juliet” (for which Antonoff wrote the music), who sang a lovely version of Joni Mitchell’s holiday-themed “River,” in a range much lower than Joni’s.\n\n\tNext up, Hayley Williams, clad in a tight leather skirt and four-inch heels, rocketed across the stage and launched into “Kill Me” and “Good Ol’ Days” from her Grammy-nominated new solo album, “Ego Death at the Bachelorette Party.” She stepped into a backing vocal role when Florence — who created quite a contrast in her trademark flowing white gown and Stevie Nicks-meets-Lady Macbeth stage moves — took the lead for “Free” and her signature song, “The Dog Days Are Over.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFlorence Welch (Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images for Ally Coalition)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Ally Coalition\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe show wound down with an all-cast cover of Judee Sill’s classic “Lopin’ Along Through the Cosmos,” and closed, as it did last year, with Antonoff’s own “Merry Christmas, Please Don’t Call.”\n\n\tWhile the show is loose and familial — although Antonoff’s sister and father, who usually perform, were absent due to the flu — it’s a monumental undertaking for an unimpeachable cause. \n",

Cohen hopped on the mic and joked the show would now be called \"Andy 100\" before Stern stepped in to reveal it was a prank.\n      \n    \n          At the end of the extension, Stern will have been on SiriusXM for 22 years. \"The Howard Stern Show\" debuted on the satellite radio service in 2006 after initially signing with them in 2004.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Howard Stern\n              \n                          \n                Andy Cohen\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                Podcasts\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tOscar-winning Korean actor Youn Yuh-jung opened up about her remarkable six-decade career during an In Conversation event at the Singapore International Film Festival, sharing candid insights about her unconventional start in the industry, her formative relationship with director Kim Ki-young, and the challenges she overcame to achieve international recognition.\n\n\tThe 78-year-old actor, recipient of the festival’s Screen Icon Award, participated in a wide-ranging discussion with local actors Rebecca Lim and Janice Koh that touched on everything from her 1971 debut film “Woman of Fire” to her recent Hollywood projects, including the Oscar-winning “Minari.”\n\t\n\n\tYoun revealed that her entry into acting was entirely accidental, stemming from a failed university entrance exam in the 1960s. Needing to earn money while attending a less prestigious college, she took a part-time job at a television station, which led to an unexpected audition.\n\n\n\t“I didn’t plan to be actress,” Youn said. “I went to the station for a tour, and they asked me to audition. I said no, I cannot read this line in front of camera. But I did it, and I got accepted as talent.”\n\n\tUnlike today’s system-driven Korean entertainment industry, Youn had no formal training. “I didn’t have any theatrical background or film school experience,” she acknowledged. “That’s why I felt guilty about my job, because all of them from theatrical background, they had training, but I didn’t have any training.”\n\n\tThis lack of formal education became a driving force in her approach to roles. “Every role I get, I studied my lines. I memorized thoroughly. I practiced so many ways because I realized I didn’t have gifted talent. That’s why I needed to practice. Nobody thinks I’m putting that much hard work. They think I’m just doing naturally or something. No, I work so hard,” Youn explained.\n\t\n\n\tHer breakthrough came with “Woman of Fire,” directed by Kim Ki-young, when she was in her early 20s. The controversial role, where she played a country girl who turns femme fatale, was a departure from the typical melodramas of 1970s Korean cinema, where actresses were expected to fit conventional beauty standards.\n\n\t“Back in my time, in Korean standard, if you want to be actress, you got to be most beautiful person,” Youn said. “I’m not pretty by Korean standards. I’m not beautiful. So most of them [films] at the time, there’s the melodrama — the poor girl falls with a rich boy, and then the family against her, blah, blah, same old story. But this script was very different.”\n\n\tDespite winning best actress at the Blue Dragon Awards and Best New Actress at the Grand Bell Awards for her debut, Youn faced harsh criticism. “When you hear about yourself judging by somebody else, it’s not pleasant feeling,” she said. One critic told her that with her voice, she would never make it as an actress. “He saw me blooming, blooming, and he said, ‘You are the first one I made the wrong criticism.’ He always said he was right. But he passed away.”\n\n\tYoun credited Kim Ki-young as a major influence on her career, recalling their unusual working relationship. The director insisted on meeting with her regularly before filming began, which she initially found uncomfortable. “I was thinking maybe he’s plotting or something,” she recalled. “The first day of shooting, he said, ‘Miss Youn, when I met you during the meeting, I told you about something, and you had very weird smile and very strange smile. I want that smile.’ That’s why he was watching me. He was observing me.”\n\n\tKim’s advice about choosing roles stayed with her throughout her career. “He always called me Miss Youn. He said, ‘The main role is not important. Don’t do it, because you have a big responsibility. If you are doing the main role, if you fail there, it’s all your responsibility. So it’s very dangerous. But safe way is just being a supporting actress. That is very safe way, and then you get the money too.'”\n\n\tYoun’s path to “Minari” was equally unconventional. Director Lee Isaac Chung sent her the script through a friend, but she stopped reading at page 40 due to the difficulty of reading in English. “I called her and asked, ‘Is it based on his real life story?’ And she said it is. So I said, okay, I’ll do it. You cannot be genuine more than his real life story. You don’t need any writer. So this must be genuine.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production presented numerous challenges. When the producer asked her to fly economy class from Seoul to Tulsa, Oklahoma, Youn negotiated for business class — and ended up paying for it herself. “I spent a lot of money for that film,” she said. She also hired her own professional translator friend to improve the Korean dialogue, covering the ticket and payment personally.\n\n\t“I sacrificed my time and my money,” Youn explained. “I don’t know why I did that, because I want to make it nice one properly. Because the translation is very important.”\n\n\tDespite the hardships, the collaboration proved fruitful. “That’s why I think we become good friends, Isaac,” she said. “If he comes to Korea, he always visits me. If I go to the States, I always visit him. And he became a huge director now, working for the ‘Oceans 11’ [the prequel] now. I’m so proud of him, I’m very happy as a Korean.”\n\n\tWhen asked about the international recognition following “Minari” — including becoming the first Korean actor to win an Oscar, SAG Award, and BAFTA — Youn remained grounded. “When you become famous, people lift you up with no reasons, and then they tear you down with no reasons,” she said. “Out of kindness, out of malice. So I experienced enough. I’m myself.”\n\n\tAt 78, Youn has adopted what she calls a “luxury” approach to her career. “The true luxury is just do what I like to do,” she explained. “I can choose my time, or I can choose the director, I can choose the scenario. That’s my luxury.”\n\n\tThis selective approach came after years of working intensively to support her two sons as a single mother. “I worked so hard for my two boys. They were in the States boarding school, so I had to pay a lot,” she said. “After they graduated everything, I promised myself, okay, I’ll be free. I’m going to work whatever I want. If I like the director, I will do it, or if the writer has good writing, then I will do it.”\n\n\tRegarding the evolution of the Korean entertainment industry, Youn noted significant changes from her early days. “My time, we just step by step,” she said. “If I get paid this much for this time and if I get paid little bit more for next time. But nowadays, it’s all changed. They have some kind of factory, because I’m old school, so I don’t agree with them 100%.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever, she noted that opportunities for senior actors remain limited. “The roles got very limited because of the production cost. They just cut down, make it very small family. So it’s not many roles for us,” she said. “But now, in my age, I understand everything is because of capitalism.”\n\n\tWhen asked about advice for young Asian actors, Youn demurred. “Usually when you’re young, we don’t listen to elderly persons,” she said. “In Korea, they usually say, ‘Is there any message for the younger generation?’ So I usually say, I’m not the Pope, I don’t have any message.”\n\n\tOn whether she might write a memoir, Youn was firm. “I told one guy, a movie reporter who was fighting with depression, ‘You are the one who could write about my lifetime story. But after I passed away, you can write about me, but not before.’ I don’t like to share my private life.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor the first time ever, Hallmark Channel is teaming up with Walt Disney World for a new original movie. “Holiday Ever After: A Disney World Wish Come True,” will shoot on location at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and is led by Lacey Chabert and Travis Van Winkle. Richard Kind, Christy Carlson Romano, Taegen Burns and Asher Alexander also star with Patrick Renna in a cameo role.\n\n\tThe movie was announced during Saturday’s “The Hallmark Christmas Experience: A Hometown Holiday,” which aired after Chabert’s new movie, “She’s Making A List.” The Disney collaboration film, written and directed by Ryan Landels, will air during 2026’s 17th annual Countdown to Christmas.\n\t\n\n\tHere is the official logline for “Holiday Ever After”: “Lindsey (Chabert) and her extended family head to Walt Disney World to spend a magical Christmas together. But the dream of a jolly holiday gets quickly dashed when Lindsey discovers her room is next door to Philip (Van Winkle), a disastrous first date she recently had, who’s also there on a family trip. As Lindsey and Philip’s paths cross throughout their stay, the frost starts to thaw as they learn they’re not so different from each other after all. Thanks to some Walt Disney World magic, the holiday wish Lindsey made in Cinderella Fountain just might turn their rivalry into romance.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The history between Hallmark and Disney dates back decades, when a shared Kansas City connection and friendship between Hallmark’s founder, J.C. Hall, and Walt Disney himself led to our first-ever licensed products, including the very first greeting card featuring Mickey Mouse,” says Darren Abbott, chief brand officer, Hallmark. “We’re thrilled to expand our partnership beyond the products we create together and onto the screen with this heartwarming and joyful Christmas movie that embodies the very best of both brands.”\n\t\n\n\tSally Conner, Disney’s vp of global content, adds, “Storytelling is at the heart of both Disney and Hallmark, and that magic shines even brighter during the holidays. We’re thrilled that Walt Disney World will serve as the immersive setting for a Hallmark holiday movie highlighting the cheerful festivities of the season. Across our theme parks, resorts, and beyond, countless unique stories unfold and new memories are made every day with our guests. This film is a wonderful way to share that joy and pixie dust with fans everywhere.”\n\n\tHallmark and Disney will release an exclusive collection of products inspired by the movie down the line, including greeting cards, ornaments, gifts and gift wrap, available next holiday season.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChinese audiences pushed animation, action and historical war films to the top of 2025’s satisfaction charts, while comedies and romance all but disappeared from favor, according to new research unveiled at the 7th Hainan Island International Film Festival, China.\n\n\tIn a forum presentation at the festival, Sun Xianghui, president of the China Film Art Research Center, revealed that consumer satisfaction scores for those genres outdid others in the center’s 2025 survey, with films like the Nanjing massacre WWII epic “Dead to Rights”, and animation juggernaut “Ne Zha 2” leading in both satisfaction scores and box office returns.\n\t\n\n\tMirroring trends seen in Western markets, the study showed that Chinese audiences have largely abandoned comedies and romance films in 2025, with not a single romance film figuring in the top satisfaction scores of the survey.\n\n\n\tChina’s local film box office has netted $6.7 billion in the year to date, a figure significantly higher than 2024’s $5.8 billion total. Excluding December’s take, local films counted for some 83.8% of the box office.\n\n\t“In 2025, global film production has entered a period of slow growth,” said Sun. “European production capacity is limited, and the traditional Hollywood growth model shows fatigue, with diminished appeal for blockbuster production and markets.”\n\n\tThe recent success of “Zootopia 2” at the Chinese box office, however, and the eagerly anticipated premiere of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” at the same festival, suggests this downbeat assessment to be a tad presumptuous.\n\t\n\n\tAs of writing, “Zootopia 2” has crossed $393 million at the Chinese box office.\n\n\tThe film has grossed more in China than at the domestic North American market ($187 million), a fact Sun was eager to highlight, but also suggests the continued intertwining of fates between Hollywood studios and Chinese audiences.\n\n\tSeparately, film officials were keen to promote international production in Hainan, pointing to its imminent designation as a Free Trade Port on Dec. 18 as a distinct selling point for producers.\n\n\tOfficials also dangled carrots in the form of living subsidies of up to RMB1 million ($141,000) for “leading talents,” and between RMB200,000- 500,000 RMB ($28,000 – $70,700) for “international talents”, as well as visa-free entry for personnel from 86 countries.\n\n\tThe new Free Trade Port status also promises zero tariffs for imported film production equipment, and income tax incentives for foreign “high-level talent,” while post houses and visual effects companies can, in principle, operate as wholly foreign-owned enterprises.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor those destined to be songwriters, the spark of inspiration strikes early in life. That was one common theme from many of the heartfelt thank-yous and reflections shared by the diverse group of musical artists honored Saturday at Variety‘s annual Hitmakers brunch in Hollywood.\n\n\tSabrina Carpenter, Variety’s Hitmaker of the Year, spoke wistfully of writing her first song at age 10. Tyler, the Creator credited his the roots of his creativity to the “crazy imagination” of his 7-year-old self. Tate McRae got going on writing songs in her bedroom at 13. EJAE, part of the powerhouse pop trio Huntr/x featured in the smash Netflix film “KPop Demon Hunters,” did the same at 10. And 89-year-old blues legend Buddy Guy recalled growing up in rural Louisiana without a steady source of clean water in his earliest years. His family devised a filtering system for rainwater. “There must’ve been something alright with that water,” he observed, because he drank a lot of it and he’s still active as he approaches 90.\n\t\n\n\tRELATED CONTENT: Sabrina Carpenter Tells Hitmakers Crowd ‘Write the Music You Want to Listen To’\n\n\n\tThe ninth annual Hitmakers gathering coincided with the Dec. 3 publication, in print and online, of Variety‘s annual Hitmakers issue, which is a survey of the artists and collaborators behind the year’s 25 most popular songs. The issue puts a big spotlight on the range of tunesmiths, producers and other creative collaborators behind every successful song.\n\n\tAlex Warren, the artist and songwriter behind the global smash “Ordinary,” expressed his deep gratitude for the recognition as Hitmakers Breakthrough of the Year artist. He set the tone early on for emotional remarks to the roomful of music biz insiders. He detailed some personal struggles and the loss of his father at age 9 and the struggles with his mother that followed. \n\t\n\n\tThe job of penning his first album, “You’ll Be Alright, Kid,” was particularly “hard because I had to confront the childhood I tried so hard to forget.” The response to his work reinforces that he’s on the right career path. “I am enough,” Warren told the crowd. “I’m doing what I’m supposed to be doing. I’m here for a reason and I deserve to be here.”\n\n\tBigXthaPlug got the nod for Hitmakers Hip-Hop Disruptor of the Year. He’s part of the UnitedMasters collective that aims to empower artists to work independent of the major music congloms in order to retain ownership of their work. “Thank y’all for recognizing what we’re doing independently — yes independently,” said BigXthaPlug.\n\n\tBenny Blanco was on hard to present the laurel to rising-star band The Marías’ as the Anti-Hit Hitmakers of the Year. María Zardoya, lead singer and co-founder, told the crowd that she has always stood firm against efforts to pop-ify the group’s sound. She thanked Atlantic Records for allowing them to lean into their genuine moods. “Emotion has always taken us further than tempo ever could,” Zardoya told the crowd. “Thank you so much for letting us be emotional wrecks and release whatever we want now.”\n\n\tRELATED CONTENT: Tyler, the Creator Saluted for a Decade of ‘Super-Duper, Awesome S—‘ at Hitmakers\n\n\tThe marathon brunch was emceed by Jem Aswad, Variety‘s executive editor of music. Among the kudos handed out was the Interactive Music in Media nod to video game firm Riot Games for its innovative work to platform music in its game creations.\n\n\tNo less a respected music hitmaker than Jimmy Jam was on had to present Producers of the Year kudos to Jack Antonoff, Mustard and Sounwave, who got the nod for their work with the musical juggernaut that is Kendrick Lamar.\n\n\tJam emphasized the importance of the audience in deciding what qualifies as a hit. “That’s why it’s a team sport,” he said of the music biz.\n\n\tSounwave dug deep when he cited his childhood exposure, thanks to his mother, to the life-coach philosophies of Earl Nightingale as being fundamental early experiences that led him into music. While other kids were listening to hip-hop radio in the car with their moms, he was exposed to ideas for achieving his dreams.\n\n\t“It molded me to understand the power of manifestations,” Sounwave said. Mustard reflected on the road that he’s traveled over the past decade with his longtime collaborator Lamar. He described them as “two kids from Compton trying to figure it out.” And to that end, the overarching goal has always been to “inspire a community and a culture that inspired us. I promise to forever do that while I’m walking the Earth.”\n\t\n\n\tElliot Grainge, leader of Atlantic Records, was recognized as Executive of the Year for his turnaround of the storied music factory with buzzy releases such as Warren’s “Ordinary,” Rosé, as well as longer-standing artists like Bruno Mars, Charli xcx and Coldplay, Cardi B and Twenty One Pilots. He heaped credit on Atlantic’s artists and his executive team. “Labels get a bad rep today for being labels, rightly or wrongly. We are all human,” he observed. The most important role that labels play in the lives of artists is to “push them to heights we all wish we could go to ourselves,” he said.\n\n\tSinger Addison Rae and her collaborators Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjard were tipped as rising stars by receiving the Future Is Female award. “This music exists because of how we showed up for one another,” Kloser told the crowd. “Being part of that trust and support has been very inspiring to me.”\n\n\tFuerza Regida, the Mexican American band from San Bernardino, was feted as Humanitarians of the Year for their work to help families with food drives and and through the hardships inflicted on Latino communities through the ICE immigration raids that have shocked the nation.\n\n\t“This award is the most important because we are for the people. This is our dream,” said the band’s Jesús Ortiz Paz, better known to fans as JOP. \n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” singer Rei Ami was briefly overwhelmed as she accepted her kudos alongside Huntr/x’s EJAE and Audrey Nuna. Ami shook it off with an impromptu pep talk to herself that got a laugh from the crowd: “Don’t cry, bitch. Get it together!” After years of hard work and little recognition, Ami said the trio’s work as Huntr/x presented “the perfect chance for the three of us. An opportunity to become friends and sisters for life.”\n\n\tRising star Rosé, who fielded a big hit with “Apt.” in tandem with Bruno Mars, also reflected on how quickly success can strike. The collaboration with the veteran hitmaker led to “an absolute explosion of surprises and an overwhelming amount of love.” And she admitted that gaining international recognition has been “a tiny bit of a mindfuck.”\n\n\tThe mighty Republic Records prevailed once again as Hitmakers’ Label of the Year. The group’s imprints were responsible for no less than 10 of the tunes on this year’s Hitmakers top 25 list. Marleny Reyes, Republic’s long-serving general manager, accepted on behalf of the company. She said the secret to Republic’s success is found in its leaders and in the artists they champion. “It is an army and a family,” she said while emphasizing, “We got nothing without our musicians who have so much power and energy. They are so inspiring.”\n\t\n\n\tPremier partners for Hitmakers included TikTok, Riot Games, CashApp & Visa.\n\n\t(Pictured: “KPop Demon Hunters” stars Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna and EJAE at Variety‘s Hitmakers brunch)\n",

    "body": "\n\tPolen Ly’s “Becoming Human” has claimed the Golden Hanoman, the top prize at the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival (JAFF), which closed its milestone 20th anniversary edition in Yogyakarta on Dec. 6.\n\n\t“Captivating us with lyrical visual poetry and a tender meditation on memory, loss, and the fragile spaces that hold our shared stories, this film becomes a love letter to cinema itself,” the jury said in awarding the Golden Hanoman to “Becoming Human,” which debuted at Venice. The main competition jury comprised Eric Khoo, Suryana Paramita and Tumpal Tampubolon.\n\t\n\n\tRatchapoom Boonbunchachoke’s Cannes winner “A Useful Ghost” won the Silver Hanoman, with the jury praising its “audacious blend of absurd humor, emotional depth, and sharp social insight.” Antoinette Jadaone’s “Sunshine” received a special jury mention for its “poignant and unflinching commitment to standing beside women whose lives are circumscribed by state controls and societal judgment.”\n\n\n\tIn the Indonesian Screen Awards, Kristo Immanuel’s “Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal” dominated with five wins including best film, best director and best screenplay (co-written with Jessica Tjiu). Omara Esteghlal won best performance for his work in the film, while Afiqa Kirana also received best performance honors for “The Period of Her.”\n\n\tThe festival drew more than 30,000 visitors over eight days, marking its largest and most significant edition to date. The event presented 227 films from 43 countries, including 27 world premieres and 87 Indonesian premieres, alongside 47 discussions, forums and public lectures.\n\t\n\n\tFestival director Ifa Isfansyah emphasized the ongoing challenges facing the film ecosystem. “Moving forward, the challenges will only grow — particularly in how we think about the sustainability of the film ecosystem amid rapid changes in media and digital landscapes,” he said, highlighting the urgency of film archiving initiatives.\n\n\t“Two decades of JAFF are about togetherness, celebration, and mutual trust,” Isfansyah added, noting that colleagues from international festivals have reached out to collaborate on concrete archiving steps.\n\n\tThe festival showcased works by 34 debut directors and 63 female directors, reinforcing its commitment to emerging talent and women filmmakers. The event was supported by 78 partners and collaborators.\n\n\tProgram director Alexander Matius highlighted the enthusiastic audience engagement throughout the festival. “Many discussions took place, including Q&A sessions with filmmakers that lasted well into the early hours of the morning and were attended enthusiastically by almost the entire audience,” he said.\n\n\tExecutive director Ajish Dibyo noted the festival’s environmental initiatives, including waste management efforts that processed more than 1,500 kilograms of waste this year. He also emphasized the growing involvement of younger generations within the organizing team as a positive sign for JAFF’s future sustainability.\n\n\tOther winners included Whammy Alcazaren’s “Water Sports,” which won both the Blencong Award and the Students Award for its innovative approach to climate change themes. “Becoming Human” also received the Netpac Award, while “Sunshine” claimed the Geber Award.\n\n\tThe festival’s industry component JAFF Market concluded earlier in the week. \n\t\n\t\tJAFF 2025 Winners\t\n\n\tMAIN COMPETITIONGolden Hanoman: “Becoming Human” (Polen Ly)Silver Hanoman: “A Useful Ghost” (Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke)Jury Special Mention: “Sunshine” (Antoinette Jadaone)\n\n\tBLENCONG AWARDWinner: “Water Sports” (Whammy Alcazaren)Jury Special Mention for Light of Asia: “Hyena” (Altay Ulan Yang)\n\n\tINDONESIAN SCREEN AWARDSBest Film: “Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal” (Kristo Immanuel)Best Director: Kristo Immanuel (“Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal”)Best Screenplay: Kristo Immanuel and Jessica Tjiu (“Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal”)Best Cinematography: Vera Lestafa (“Dopamine”)Best Performance: Omara Esteghlal (“Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal”), Afiqa Kirana (“The Period of Her”)Best Editing: Ryan Purwoko (“Better Off Dead/Tinggal Meninggal”)Best Production Design: Ahmad Zulkarnaen and Wahyu Efata (“Ikatan Darah”)Best Music: Anto Hoed, Melly Goeslaw (“Rangga & Cinta”)Best Sound Design: Pramudya Adhy Wardhana, Ridho Fachri, Renaldy Lomo, Alexandrie Dolly (“The Period of Her”)Best Poster Evan Wijaya and Jozz Felix (“Sore: A Wife From the Future/Sore: Istri Dari Masa Depan”)\n\t\n\n\tNETPAC AWARD“Becoming Human” (Polen Ly)\n\n\tGEBER AWARD“Sunshine” (Antoinette Jadaone)\n\n\tSTUDENTS AWARD“Water Sports” (Whammy Alcazaren)\n",

    "body": "\n\tMark your calendars: “The Boys” is back for one more round next April and we’ve got your first look  at the bloody battle ahead.\n\n\tThe fifth and final season of Amazon Prime Video’s satirical superhero series will premiere with its first two episodes on April 8. New episodes will be rolling out each week through the series finale launch May 20.\n\n\tPer the description for “The Boys” Season 5, “In the fifth and final season, it’s Homelander’s world, completely subject to his erratic, egomaniacal whims. Hughie, Mother’s Milk, and Frenchie are imprisoned in a ‘Freedom Camp.’ Annie struggles to mount a resistance against the overwhelming Supe force. Kimiko is nowhere to be found. But when Butcher reappears, ready and willing to use a virus that will wipe all Supes off the map, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change the world and everyone in it. It’s the climax, people. Big stuff’s gonna happen.”\n\t\n\n\tThe final-season premiere date announcement came out of “The Boys” panel at CCXP Brazil Saturday, where series creator Eric Kripke and some of the cast also showed off the first teaser trailer. In the video, which fans can view below, you’ll get a sneak peek of the on-screen reunion between “Supernatural” alums Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. \n\n\n\tWhile Ackles is reprising his role as Soldier Boy, Padalecki’s part in “The Boys” has been kept under wraps. The teaser shows Padalecki’s unnamed character entering a room followed by Soldier Boy and Homelander (Antony Starr), hinting at a storyline between Padalecki and Ackles, who played brothers Dean and Sam Winchester for 15 seasons on the Kripke-created series “Supernatural.”\n\t\n\n\tAlso in the trailer, we see Butcher (Karl Urban) reunite with Hughie (Jack Quaid), Annie (Erin Moriarty) and The Boys after abandoning them at the end of Season 4. It appears they’re all going to go down swinging together to try to prevent the end of the world. \n\n\tIn addition to Urban, Quaid, Starr, Moriarty, Padalecki and Ackles, “The Boys” stars Jessie T. Usher, Laz Alonso, Chace Crawford, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, Colby Minifie, Cameron Crovetti, Susan Heyward, Valorie Curry.\n\n\tBased on Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson’s best-selling comic book series of the same name, “The Boys” TV series is created by showrunner Eric Kripke. Executive producers include Kripke, Ennis, Robertson, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, James Weaver, Neal H. Moritz, Pavun Shetty, Phil Sgriccia, Michaela Starr, Paul Grellong, David Reed, Judalina Neira, Jessica Chou, Gabriel Garcia, Ori Marmur, Ken F. Levin and Jason Netter. \n\n\t“The Boys” hails from Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios in collaboration with Kripke Enterprises, Original Film and Point Grey Pictures.\n\n\tThe series is the flagship show in a growing “The Boys” universe at Amazon, which also includes spinoffs “Gen V,” animated anthology “The Boys Presents: Diabolical” and the upcoming Ackles-led prequel “Vought Rising,” as well as a Mexico-set series still in the development stage.\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “The Boys” Season 5 here and via the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRealtor and star of Netflix’s “Owning Manhattan,” Ryan Serhant, has a motto that drives him to success: “Expansion, always in all the ways.”\n\n\tBut that expansion comes at a price.\n\n\tThe company is now four years old, and Season 2 of the series follows the CEO and his team of top agents as they sell some of the city’s hottest properties, including a showstopping penthouse at 200 Amsterdam Avenue with an asking price of $31 million.\n\t\n\n\tAudiences have seen Serhant go from Bravo’s “Million Dollar Listing” to the CEO of his over company. The pressures of managing the company and being a parent take their toll.\n\n\n\tThroughout the season, audiences see as Serhant struggles, and the stress gets too much to the point that he has an emotional breakdown on screen. It’s his most revealing moment yet.\n\n\t“No one cries for the person at the top,” says Serhant when asked about showing this vulnerable side.\n\n\tWorld of Wonder co-founders and the show’s executive producers, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, who also produced Bravo’s “Million Dollar Listing,” cast the rising realtor in the New York edition of the franchise. Bailey said, “Ryan does always present as a selling machine, but there is this other side to him that I think he keeps closely guarded, because he is such a sales force.” Bailey continued, “To see it was really great, because I think perhaps some people don’t believe he’s got that.” He added, “He’s a big softie.\n\n\tBarbato concurred, “This is just the first time he’s truly revealed the depth of his vulnerability, and that’s what makes this season so compelling, and that is also why Ryan has been so successful for so long, because he isn’t just a selling machine, there’s a real depth there to connect with.”\n\t\n\n\tThat vulnerability adds to the emotional stakes of the new season. In addition to exposing this emotional side, familiar faces return. Chloe Tucker Caine is back to work after maternity leave, and she has plenty of work to do.\n\n\tFormer Corcoran broker Peter Zaitzeff joins the company and goes head-to-head with the agents and competes to get his name on the sales board.\n\n\tHere, Serhant talks about showing this side to him, company growth and how the mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has impacted Manhattan real estate.\n\t\n\t\tI’m going to start with the final episode because all season we’re seeing your struggle to be this great dad to your daughter, but you also have to focus on work and you’re shown to be at your most vulnerable as you sacrifice family. What was that like, allowing that to be filmed on camera?\t\n\n\tI haven’t talked about that yet, because I’ve only seen it once. Season 1 was a startup story. I was on the defensive the entire time. As a startup, l was like, “We’re not going to make it. This is insane. Why am I doing this? People are leaving. I’m firing people on camera live. I’m going to put all this out there to the world.” It was incredibly stressful. The people that I was letting go of were not good for my enterprise. So they were the villain.\n\n\tEvery show has a hero, and every show has a villain, whether you like it or not. You’ve got Romeo, and you’ve got Mercutio. And I personally was struggling while we were filming the show, because we film in real time. We film September through May, whatever happens happens, which I think is the magic to making a great show like this. Nothing is forced. Everything is authentic, whether you like it or not, and you’ve got to show up and be vulnerable every day. Otherwise, no one cares anymore. I was struggling the whole time because I was like, “I don’t think there’s a villain. Who’s my villain?” And then I watched the show, and I have a text message to Randy and Fenton and one of our other executive producers, Kelly, saying, “Oh my God, is my villain me?” I’m the villain of my own story. What just happened? I sat there at the end of the finale. I felt incredibly terrified, scared and nervous. I remember the deal I made with myself, my family, the people around me, that if I’m going to do a TV show, there’s no point in making something average, it’s got to be something no one has ever seen before, and you have to go big, or you gotta go home, and that means putting everything out there, whether you like it or not. It’s uncomfortable for me. If that story helps anyone else, then I guess it was worth putting it out there.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBut it’s this theme that runs through the show, and it is so relatable. Everyone struggles with that balance. I guess I should ask you, how are you doing?\t\n\n\tI’m going to get texts asking if I’m ok. But I’m so excited. We’ve been working on this for such a long time. I think you have good days and you have bad days. I built a real estate business on the back of Bravo, and I’m building a real estate company in real time, on the back of Netflix. I have never seen anyone do that before, and that’s something I find very exciting. I built a real estate team and an entire business season by season, and took it to the next level. And I am better now. At the time, it was a lot. No one cries for the person at the top, but heavy is the head that wears the crown. It is not all it’s cracked up to be, and what you end up dealing with all day long are the things that no one else can handle. That’s what I do.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about growth, and Chloe mentions it in Episode 3. How much has Serhant grown since the end of Season 1? I remember last time we spoke, after the show aired, you said the Serhant website crashed.\t\n\n\tWe’re so ready now. It did. It was insane.\n\n\t“Owning Manhattan” came out in June 2024. We gained a million followers and subscribers across accounts just from the global awareness. We were in a couple of markets, but we were predominantly in Manhattan. It’s what we do, and it’s the majority of our revenue today. So 18 months later, I just opened in my 14th state. We went from a couple of hundred people to 1500 people. Now I have a staff of 200 to help manage. I raised money. You see that in the episode, too. You also see a venture fundraise. I’ve never seen a venture fundraise, and I give Netflix a lot of credit too, for looking at everything we shot and not just saying, “Nah, that’s not the format, or nah, that’s not what people want to see.” This show is a window that no one’s opened before, and what’s inside that window.\n\n\tWe raised the largest prop tech seed round in history. I’m on my way to opening in 12 more states and doubling the size of the company. My hope was in Season 1 that we were going to do, $3 billion that year. We do a billion dollars a month, and moving fast.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve talked about the power of social media. You’ve been using it to promote the season. How has that changed the business?\t\n\n\tA couple of ways. Most real estate brokerages and tech companies buy revenue. You incentivize customers to come to you instead of going elsewhere, especially when you’re building and growing, you go buy agents, and you buy teams. That’s what banks do, all companies, until you get to a point of equilibrium, when everybody wants an income too. Because of Netflix and social, I’ve never bought a single dollar of revenue at this company.\n\t\n\n\tWe’re going into great markets because the demand for what we do, compared to our competition, is so strong. As you can imagine, a lot of people who watch the show are in the real estate business, and we have people ready to set up Serhant offices all over the world because of Netflix and then because of social.\n\t\n\t\tThe season finale was interesting with the possible partnership with Harley and Jeffrey. I thought, “That’s quite a cliffhanger to end on.”\t\n\n\tThe music plays, and my eyes look up, and I break the fourth wall.\n\n\tThe show opens with me turning to the camera, which I think just sets the audience up to think, “I don’t understand what I’m watching now. This is not normal.” I don’t do it again until the final scene of the season. I love that book end, and I fought to have more, because the audience is watching the growth and fall through my eyes, so let’s talk to the camera more. We shot a lot more of me, but credit to our producing team and Randy and Fenton, who said, “Ryan, you don’t know everything. The book end is what works the best.” And I agree now.\n\t\n\t\tI have to ask, after Zohran Mamdani was elected, people were like, “I’m going to leave New York. I’m moving to Florida.” Are people from New York really taking an interest in Florida real estate?\t\n\n\tSome people have taken an interest in Florida real estate for a long time. It goes from warm to hot back to warm, and it is a tax advantageous state, not just to live in, but to build. It incentivizes companies as much as it incentivizes individuals to be there.\n\n\tMaybe 36 hours of the Mamdani discount, we sold a townhouse in Gramercy, the next day, for half off, because the seller thought the world was over. They took a deal. It was $14 million. Our client got it for $7.5 million and signed a contract nearly immediately. Politicians come and go. New York City is forever. Manhattan has gone through terrorist attacks, hurricanes, financial collapse, and global pandemics. It can go through one politician. We made it through David Dinkins. We can do anything.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSabrina Carpenter showed up with gusto on Saturday at Variety‘s annual Hitmakers event, accepting her Hitmaker of the Year honor in front of a star- and executive-studded audience and quipping about the very action-packed year that brought her to this summit.\n\n\tThe pop superstar, who has seen her career explode in recent years, gave the Hollywood crowd some words of wisdom from an artist who started writing songs at the age of 10.\n\n\n\t“The easiest way to write a bad song is to try to write a hit,” Carpenter said. “Write the opposite of what you think a hit is. Write what speaks to you, write something that only you can write. Write the music you want to listen to yourself. Add the weird chord progression and key change, and call men stupid in as many ways as you can.”\n\t\n\n\tCarpenter’s kudo was presented by her longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff. The mega-producer and Bleachers member saluted Carpenter’s versatility as a performer, songwriter and artist who has handled the burdens of success well.\n\n\t“The really crazy thing is that she can write like that,” Antonoff said, praising Carpenter’s instincts as a tunesmith. \n\n\tCarpenter also has the utmost respect for her fans, he said. She starts out with “the assumption that people are smart,” he said. “If you really believe people are smart, you can get away with things. That key change in ‘Please Please Please’ that is so thrilling — that is the kind of stuff that matters and is interesting.”\n\n\tCarpenter, who read her remarks from a diary, praised songwriter Amy Allen, who was in the room, and others for being a support network that encourages her most “crazy ideas.” \n\t\n\n\tCarpenter expressed her gratitude and awe at the artistry that happens “every time we get the privilege to be in a room with things that make noise,” she said. \n\n\tThe artist who is riding high on the success of her latest single, “Manchild,” thanked her label home, Island Records, for their faith in her decisions, or what she described as “not trying to tell me what a hit is. That’s rare,” she said.\n\n\tCarpenter concluded with a shout-out to her audience. She echoed the comments of numerous Hitmaker award recipients in observing that songs are only hits after they are embraced by listeners.\n\n\t“Thank you to the fans that makes these hits,” Carpenter said.  “Thank you to the fans that learn the lyrics and sing the songs and make them hits — whatever that means.”\n\n\tCarpenter is currently nominated for six Grammy Awards, including the top three all-genre categories: album of the year, record of the year and song of the year. She’s also nominated for best pop vocal album, best pop solo performance and best music video.\n\n\tIn February, Carpenter won her first two Grammys, taking home prizes for best pop solo performance for “Espresso” and pop vocal album for “Short n’ Sweet.” Her first arena tour launched in September 2024, and in March, she set off on the European leg, before returning to the States this fall as it morphed into a “Man’s Best Friend” tour. “Manchild,” the single that preceded the latest album, became a blockbuster immediately upon release in June, followed by the full collection, which debuted to strong reviews in August. \n\n\tVariety‘s Hitmakers event had plenty of other star power. Fellow honorees at the luncheon included Rosé, Tyler, the Creator, Megan Moroney, BigXThaPlug, Role Model, Addison Rae, Tate McRae, Buddy Guy, Alex Warren, the Marías, the singing voices of HUNTR/X (EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI), Fuerza Regida, Sounwave, Mustard and Jack Antonoff.\n\n\tPresenters for the Hitmakers program included Laufey, Miles Caton, Benny Blanco, Jimmy Jam, Jake Shane and others.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe title of Luigi Celeste’s memoir, “Non sarà sempre così”— which serves as the source material for Francesco Costabile’s more bluntly-titled Italian melodrama, “Familia” — translates to: “It won’t always be like this.” It’s an elegiac promise that has the whiff of a wistful warning. And considering what we learn about Celeste’s family in book and film alike, it’s a rather apt précis for the seemingly inescapable threat that looms over this young man’s life. Told with wounding simplicity and a candid sense of assurance (much of it due to the strength of the film’s tightly wound performances), “Familia” is a portrait of a family trying to escape the violent trappings of a father intent on reshaping it in his own image.\n\t\n\n\tWhen we first meet the Celeste family, they look like any other unit: Franco (Francesco Di Leva) and Licia (Barbara Ronchi) live in a homey apartment together with their two young boys, Luigi (Francesco De Lucia) and Alessandro (Stefano Valentini). It’s only in between their honed and familiar gestures that you begin to see what’s simmering underneath their placid smiles: Franco is a bully of a father and a husband. \n\n\n\tHis wife has learned to navigate his temper, while his boys have begun to see him with a mix of horror and awe. Franco is the kind of father who slaps his kid for not greeting him with a kiss, and then immediately embraces him against his will. Violence and tenderness are one and the same in that household: “When there are noises, we have to wait,” the brothers know — code for staying in their room while Franco hits Licia with impunity.\n\t\n\n\tBut that’s only preamble to the real story behind “Familia,” which quickly shatters the unnerving picture of the Celeste family when Licia finally stands up to Franco and gets the authorities involved. Costabile pierces through the staid formalism of his compositions (with a spare use of music that insists, instead, we linger in tense silence with this family) with an explosive scene where the husband and the young boys are taken from Licia — he to jail, they to social services. \n\n\tWhen we catch up with them all again years later, the grown-up boys and Licia have moved and made a different life for themselves away from Franco. But the scars from that incident, not to mention the damage from the time mother and sons spent apart while navigating a bureaucracy designed to keep kids safe from abusive households, lingers still in the apartment they all share. And so when Franco reappears in their lives, Luigi (Francesco Gheghi), in particular, will have to assess how much of his current life has been shaped by his father — and, most obviously, by his absence.\n\n\tCostabile’s film rightly focuses on Luigi, the sensitive boy who has grown to become an angered young man whose friends are neo-Nazis intent on nurturing his aggrieved sense of entitlement. As his father resurfaces in his life, slowly worming himself into family dinners and turning Licia once more into a defensive and defenseless pliable wife eager to keep her boys safe, Luigi is constantly trying to find place for his anger, for his melancholy, for his own sense of alienation. It makes sense that bearing witness to domestic violence at home would push him to contain and destroy the gentleness that had once shielded him; he both wants and loathes wanting to be his father. \n\n\tAt times, Costabile, Vittorio Moroni and Adriano Chiarelli’s adapted script plays like a character portrait of a fascist that’s all too simple and simplistic: Hurt people hurt people, yes, but also, violence begets violence. Yet Gheghi finds layers and textures within those bland platitudes, with Costabile’s camera lingering in the actor’s balled up fist of a performance enough to see the moments when it cracks open. \n\n\tFor instance, there’s a dinner party scene where DP Giuseppe Maio unnervingly steady camera begins in a medium shot that lets us see the entire family at the table, the tension slowly ratcheting up between father and son as we move in, ever so slowly, so we can see only the two of them in the shot, only to move closer in to offer an uncomfortable close-up of Luigi. Such steady, discomfiting formalism is felt throughout, and allows “Familia” to really settle into a naturalism that makes the heightened, violent tragedy to which it builds (the film feels almost Oedipal), all the more affecting.\n\t\n\n\tGiven how such a premise lends itself to overly familiar contemporary conversations around toxic masculinity and male loneliness — not to mention generational trauma — it’s quite revealing that it is Rochi’s wildly restrained take on Licia that most shines through. Di Leva (who won best supporting actor at the David di Donatello awards) and Gheghi (who won the Orizzonti Award for Best Actor at Venice in 2024) may have the showier roles, but it is Rochi’s quiet dignity as a woman who cannot imagine a way out from living with the man she thought she had outrun that is most devastating. Licia is a woman seemingly trapped in a life of her own making, whose agency has been ground to dust by the sheer presence of a man she once loved and now can only fear. And Rochi captures it all with her eyes, which feel like they’re constantly roaming around for an exit out of a story she can’t believe she’s forced to endure.\n\n\tItaly’s submission the Oscar international feature category is a rather modest affair, most successful when it zeroes in on its titular family unit. Less so, perhaps, when it twists itself into more of a stoic thriller whenever Luigi’s fascist friends come into the picture. Such genre-hopping makes it quite faithful, one imagines, to Celeste’s memoir; the young boy’s life felt like it could swing from maudlin melodrama to violent action film with the blink of an eye (or the punch of a fist). On screen, though, such disparate sensibilities all but cleave “Familia” in half. \n\n\tEven so, the vulnerable performances Costabile elicits from their actors (which thrive in the long, studied takes that echo the filmmaker’s previous work in documentary filmmaking) are what make the film sing. And they are what make the film’s final moments (part Hitchcock, part Almodóvar) more hopeful than they deserve to be, as if the Italian filmmaker had waited until their final shot to truly capture the promise of the title of Celeste’s memoir amid a bleakness that thankfully doesn’t feel overwhelming. It won’t always be like this; perhaps it can be different, but at what cost?\n",

She looked ready to catch eyes in a skin-tight dress that gave a glimpse of her lacy underwear beneath ... and she certainly has our attention!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Alix Earle\n              \n                          \n                Braxton Berrios\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Breakups\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

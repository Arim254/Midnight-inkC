    "body": "\n\tFor Hudson Williams, the Golden Globes is a finale of sorts to a hall-of-fame press tour since shooting to global stardom as Shane Hollander in “Heated Rivalry.”  The newly appointed heartthrob of Hollywood met the moment on Sunday night, wearing a Georgio Armani white suit jacket styled with an open neckline, deliberately skipping a shirt and tie to showcase a gold serpent necklace.\n\n\tThe sinuous statement necklace was actually partly inspired by Williams’ own snake tattoo. “He has a keen liking of them so it seemed to be a natural fit,” stylist Anastasia Walker, who dressed him for the Globes, tells Variety. \n\n\n\tPart of Bulgari’s emblematic Serpenti collection, the Tubogas design coils in yellow gold with pavé-set diamonds and onyx accents, using the brand’s signature serpent-inspired motif that’s rooted in mythic symbolism of wisdom, seduction and transformation. The serpent theme has been central to Bulgari since its launch in 1948, with the flexible Tubogas technique allowing the gold to wrap fluidly. It’s also not the first time serpentine jewelry has been worn during an awards show. Last year, Walton Goggins wore multiple pieces of snake-themed jewelry at the 2025 Emmy Awards as a nod to a pivotal plotline in his season of “The White Lotus.”\n\n\tAs for the ensemble as a whole,  Walker says she already has a “good understanding of what silhouettes Hudson gravitates towards so this look was carefully selected with that in mind: Classic with a dose of sex.”\n\n\tWilliams’ fashion journey didn’t start at the Globes: during “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” appearance earlier in the week, Williams shifted gears in an all-black Balmain ensemble consisting of a tailored jacket and coordinating pieces, also styled by Walker. His most headlining fashion moment was a straight-off-the-runway burgundy leather jacket from Todd Snyder that he wore on the streets of New York City last week.\n\n\n\tWhile his “Heated Rivalry” press tour might be coming to a close (for now), he’s already given us a plethora of fashion inspiration to pull from until Season 2 — as well as many more red carpet moments in his future. \n\n\tShop the exact Bulgari necklace worn by Williams below (in addition to a few more affordable dupes):\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNO. 1 BESTSELLER\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPetit Moments Snake Chain Necklace\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tConnor Storrie may not be up for a Golden Globe tonight but the “Heated Rivalry” star made a case as a breakout style darling on the Beverly Hilton carpet with a retro look — mullet and all. \n\n\tThe actor arrived in a sharply tailored Saint Laurent tuxedo by Anthony Vaccarello, featuring a rich black grain de poudre jacket with silky peak lapels and matching high-rise trousers accented with subtle satin side stripes. Underneath, a crisp white cotton poplin shirt and a skinny silk satin black tie gave the ensemble a refined, streamlined silhouette, while Saint Laurent Chelsea boots in grained leather added a purposefully dressed-down dose of cool. A delicate Jean Schlumberger lapel pin from Tiffany & Co. completed the look.\n\n\n\tThe star of his ensemble, however, was a pair of Saint Laurent aviator sunglasses. The SL97 shades anchored the look with unmistakable ’70s swagger. Storrie is far from the only star to top off his outfit with a pair of sunnies. The accessory has become a staple of red carpet fashion. Jacob Elordi, Michael B. Jordan, Glenn Powell, Adam Brody and Miley Cyrus all donned tinted glasses to the Golden Globes, with most of them boasting the same high-ticket designer price tag as their suits and gowns.\n\n\tStorrie did end up on stage alongside Hudson Williams while presenting best supporting actor in a TV series. “Sorry, it’s a little nerve-wracking being here at our very first Golden Globes,” Storrie said while giving a dramatized shudder. Williams then offered a piece of advice from the stage, nodding to the steamy, often unclothed scenes they’ve shared on screen: “Just take a deep breath and picture everyone in the audience… You know.”\n\n\n\tShop the exact SL97 sunglasses worn by Storrie (in addition to similar aviator styles) below:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSIMILAR STYLE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSaint Laurent Round Sunglasses\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSIMILAR STYLE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRay-Ban Round Tinted Sunglasses\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t$56.25\n\n\n\t$108.50\n\n\n\t48% off\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Adolescence” star Erin Doherty took home her first Golden Globe on Sunday night, winning the trophy for female actor in a supporting role on television with a salty acceptance speech including an f-bomb and an s-bomb — at least one of which CBS censors appeared to miss.\n\n\t“I made a promise to my mom I wouldn’t swear, but what the fuck? Holy shit! Sorry mom,” she said, while being heavily bleeped by CBS. Doherty then dedicated her win to therapists, given her role on “Adolescence.”\n\t\n\n\t“I didn’t want to assume but i feel like we all know therapists,” she said. “Life can be tough. Mental health is everything. Thank you to therapists and it was an honor to play one.”\n\n\n\tDoherty previously won the 2025 Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a limited or anthology series or movie, and is coming off a Critics Choice Awards win for best supporting actress in a limited series or movie made for television. On Sunday night, Doherty joined fellow stars Stephen Graham (best actor in a limited series) and Owen Cooper (supporting actor) in also winning a Globe.\n\n\tDoherty, who plays Briony Ariston in the series, is also nominated at the 2026 SAG-AFTRA Actor Awards for outstanding performance by a female actor in a television movie or limited series. (She’s previously won the Actor Award — formerly known as the SAG Award — as part of “The Crown” cast in 2020 and 2021.) \n\n\tThe actress was nominated against Aimee Lou Wood (“The White Lotus”), Carrie Coon (“The White Lotus”), Parker Posey (“The White Lotus”), Catherine O’Hara (“The Studio”) and Hannah Einbinder (“Hacks”).\n\t\n\n\t“Adolescence” has been an awards darling; at the Emmys, besides Doherty’s honor, the show took home best limited series, best actor (Stephen Graham) and best supporting actor (Owen Cooper). \n\n\t“Adolescence” received five Globes nominations this year. Besides Cooper and Walters, that included best performance by a male actor in a limited series, anthology series or a motion picture made for television (Stephen Graham), best performance by a male actor in a supporting role on television (Owen Cooper and Ashley Walters), and best television limited series, anthology series or a motion picture made for television.\n\n\tThe female actor in a supporting role on television category encompasses all genres — including comedy, drama and limited series fields. Last year’s winner was “Baby Reindeer” star Jessica Gunning.\n\n\tComedian Nikki Glaser hosts the 83rd Golden Globes, airing live on CBS from the Beverly Hilton hotel. Dick Clark Prods. is behind the telecast, with Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner as producers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Golden Globes are over, but we still have a few burning questions: What stars took most advantage of the open bar? How many “Heated Rivalry” jokes were cut? Did CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil consider ending the show with a monologue making it all about himself? We may never know, but check out the night’s biggest snubs and surprises below.\n\t\n\t\tSurprise: Teyana Taylor wins best supporting actress over tight competition\t\n\n\tWhile “Sentimental Value” star Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas was the pundit pick and Amy Madigan’s villainous turn in “Weapons” gained steam in the race, Taylor secured the Globes win for her explosive performance in “One Battle After Another.” \n\t\n\t\n\t\tSnub: Best original score not shown on television\t\n\n\tThere are a zillion awards — find room for one more! The “Smartless” bit took forever… substitute this in for that!\n\n\t\n\t\tSurprise: Wagner Moura moves past A-listers for best actor in a motion picture, drama win\t\n\n\t“The Secret Agent” has been gaining heat during this award season, and its Brazilian star was able to overtake big names such as Oscar Isaac, Dwayne Johnson and Michael B. Jordan for the Globe.\n\t\n\t\tSnub: Ryan Coogler loses to Paul Thomas Anderson in screenplay race\t\n\n\tIt was widely believed that Coogler would take script honors for “Sinners” and Anderson would grab the directing Globe for “One Battle After Another,” but that wasn’t the case.\n\t\n\t\tSurprise: Michelle Williams takes best actress in a TV series (limited), but wasn’t there to accept the award\t\n\n\tSarah Snook’s turn in “All Her Fault” was predicted by award prognosticators as the winner in this starry category, which also included turns from Claire Danes, Rashida Jones, Amanda Seyfried and Robin Wright. Yet Williams’ performance as Molly Kochan in “Dying for Sex” landed her the Globe.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSnub: No clips from films for the first hour\t\n\n\tGive us a taste of the movies — it always makes the night feel more special! After all, the podcast nominations got clips!\n\t\n\t\tSurprise: Amy Poehler takes the first-ever podcast Globe\t\n\n\tHer podcast is very charming, but it’s wild that it began on March 18, 2025.\n\t\n\t\tSurprise: The DJ bringing some heat with interstitial music.\t\n\n\tWatching Stellan Skarsgård take the stage to Usher’s “Yeah!” was a deliriously surreal moment, along with Macaulay Culkin taking the stage to Mark Morrison’s “Return of the Mack.”\n\n\tVariety parent company PMC owns Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge. Polymarket is the exclusive prediction market partner of the Golden Globes.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRicky Gervais wasn’t at the Golden Globes, where he won the award for best comedy special, so presenter Wanda Sykes took the opportunity to thank “God and the trans community” while accepting the trophy on his behalf.\n\n\tSykes is referencing the fact that Gervais, an atheist, drew criticism over jokes mocking trans people in his 2022 Netflix stand-up special “SuperNature.” Although Gervais hasn’t spoken out about those inflammatory comments, CEO Ted Sarandos came to his defense at the time, saying that comedians figure out where the line is by “crossing the line every once in a while. I think it’s very important to the American culture generally to have free expression.”\n\t\n\n\tGervais was feted for his newest Netflix special, “Morality,” winning in the relatively new category over fellow comedians Bill Maher (“Is Anyone Else Seeing This”), Sarah Silverman (“Postmortem”), Kumail Nanjiani (“Night Thoughts”), Kevin Hart (“Acting My Age”) and Brett Goldstein (“The Second Best Night of Your Life”). \n\n\n\tBefore announcing the winner, Sykes took the opportunity to roast all of the nominees including Maher (“You give us so much, but I would love a little less. Try less”), Goldstein (“You are handsome. You’ve got that great super villain voice, and you are charming. You would’ve made a great Menendez brother”), Hart (“Kevin is the richest guy in this category, and yet I know he wants it the most. You’re a true American, Kevin”), Nanjiani (” love that you prove that male comedians can be funny without being chubby”), Gervais (“I love you for not being here. I love you, Ricky, but if you win, I get to accept the award on your behalf, and you are going to thank God and the trans community”) and Silverman (“I love that we are such close friends. We haven’t talked in five years, but we are so close”).\n\t\n\n\tGervais won the inaugural Golden Globe for stand-up special in 2024 for “Armageddon” and has been nominated 10 times over the years for TV shows including “The Office” and “Extras.” A five-time Golden Globes host — and a provocative one at that — Gervais is known for his no-holds-barred approach to comedy. In an interview with Variety in May, when he was getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Gervais said that he “likes that people feel slightly uneasy” when he starts a joke: “I can justify anything. I’m never that brutal. It just seems like it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRhea Seehorn won the Golden Globe for best actress in a TV drama for her performance as Carol Sturka in “Pluribus” on Apple TV. This is her first Globe nomination and win.\n\n\tSeehorn was overcome with emotion when she took the stage to accept the award. Looking at a sheet of paper, she said, “My speech says, ‘Get a prescription for beta blockers,’ but I did not. Sorry! I’m going to do my best. I’m sorry, I am just a little shocked!” And before even beginning her speech, she gushed to one of her award presenters: “Queen Latifah, I met you about 20 years ago between jobs at a Koo Koo Roo and you were so nice, so thanks!”\n\t\n\n\tSeehorn acknowledged each of her fellow nominees by name and praised their performances. “Actually, to all the women in this room: I’ve been a lot of these parties that get pretty scary for someone like me sometimes,” she added, referencing the long string of events celebrities attend during awards season. “And the women in this room have been incredible in the last couple of weeks. Thank you for that,” she said.\n\n\n\tAt the end of her speech, after thanking “Pluribus” creator Vince Gilligan and other collaborators, friends and family, she said, “I am still so grateful that I get to do this for a living, and this is incredible icing on that cake.”\n\n\tSeehorn is beloved for playing Kim Wexler in “Better Call Saul,” the “Breaking Bad” spinoff that ran on AMC for six seasons from 2015 to 2022. The role earned her nominations for three Critics’ Choice awards and two Emmys in addition to three Actor awards as part of the show’s ensemble. For “Pluribus,” she won the Critics’ Choice award for best drama series actress.\n\t\n\n\tAlso nominated for this year’s Golden Globe for best TV drama actress were Kathy Bates (“Matlock”), Britt Lower (“Severance”), Helen Mirren (“MobLand”), Bella Ramsey (“The Last of Us”) and Keri Russell (“The Diplomat”).\n\n\t“Pluribus” was also nominated for best TV drama.\n",

The couple’s son, Nick, has been arrested in connection with their deaths.\n\n\tAs she was closing the show, Glaser wore a “Spinal Tap” baseball cap, and said of the ceremony that “This one went to 11.” That, of course, is a riff on the famous bit from Reiner’s 1984 comedy classic, in which the band’s amps go up to 11, in case they “need that extra push over the cliff.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Golden Globes was the second awards ceremony this season to pay tribute to Reiner. The Critics Choice Awards, which aired Jan. 4, took a moment to honor the late director during host Chelsea Handler’s opening monologue.\n\n\n\t“Everyone in this room knows that the nicest guy in Hollywood was Rob Reiner,” Handler told the crowd. “Anyone who ever spent time with Rob Reiner knows that the minute you met him, he felt like an old friend when you were in a conversation with him. He was present, he was focused, and he was funny, and he would ask you tons of questions, whether you were discussing politics or film or the latest beauty trends. He was all in after I sent him a text thanking him for dinner a few months ago. He texted me back and said, ‘We had so much fun with you last night. Thanks for explaining so much about plastic surgery. It was very edifying.’”\n\n\t“Rob and Michele were tireless in their efforts to so many important causes, all stemming from one basic idea: Decency, and that we should all look out for each other,” Handler continued. “I think we can all agree that we definitely need more of that. So let’s use tonight as a reminder of that decency and as a reminder of everything Rob and Michele represented and fought so hard for.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the aftermath of Reiner’s death, many of his former collaborators issued statements honoring his legacy and friendship. A group of his closest Hollywood friends, including Billy Crystal, Larry David, Martin Short and Albert Brooks, released a joint statement in which Reiner was praised not only as “a great comic actor” but also a “master storyteller.”\n\n\tVariety parent company PMC owns Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Secret Agent” star Wagner Moura won the Golden Globe for best actor in a drama at Sunday night’s star-studded awards ceremony, making history as the first Brazilian actor to ever win in this category.\n\n\t“‘The Secret Agent’ is a film about memory — or the lack of memory — and generational trauma. I think that if trauma can be passed along generations, values can too,” Moura said in his acceptance speech. “So this is to the ones that are sticking with their values in difficult moments.”\n\t\n\n\tMoura was nominated alongside Joel Edgerton (“Train Dreams”), Oscar Isaac (“Frankenstein”), Dwayne Johnson (“The Smashing Machine”), Michael B. Jordan (“Sinners”) and Jeremy Allen White (“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”). He had previously been nominated for best actor in a TV series — drama for his work on “Narcos.” In addition to being the first Brazilian winner, Moura was also the first Brazilian performer to be nominated in the best actor – drama category.\n\n\n\tThe Golden Globes, held at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, was hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser, who returned as emcee for the second year in a row.  Variety parent company PMC owns Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge. In addition to Moura’s nomination, “The Secret Agent” is nominated for best motion picture — drama, the first Brazilian production recognized in the category, and best foreign language film.\n\n\tIn “The Secret Agent,” set in 1977 Brazil under military rule, Moura stars as technology expert and political dissident, attempting to flee persecution and resist an authoritarian deceitful regime.\n\t\n\n\tThe political thriller, from filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho, debuted to massive acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival, becoming the year’s most-awarded title at the fest: Moura won the best actor award; Mendonça Filho was named best director; and the film won both the Art House Cinema Award and the FIPRESCI Prize for best film.\n\n\tMoura has been nominated for a slew of awards for the role, including at the Gotham Awards, the Satellite Awards, the Critics Choice Awards, among other nominations from guilds and critics groups.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Hamnet” star Jessie Buckley won the Golden Globe for best actress in a drama at Sunday night’s star-studded awards ceremony.\n\n\tThe win continues a streak for Buckley, who won the Critics Choice award for her performance last weekend, and has also been nominated for the Screen Actors Guild’s Actor Awards.\n\n\tBuckley was nominated alongside Jennifer Lawrence (“Die My Love”), Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”), Julia Roberts (“After the Hunt”), Tessa Thompson (“Hedda”) and Eva Victor (“Sorry, Baby”). This was Buckley’s first Golden Globe nomination.\n\t\n\n\tIn her acceptance speech, Buckley began by saying, “This is not a normal feeling or situation to be in, but thank you, Golden Globes, thank you Focus and everybody who supported this film.” She then thanked many of her collaborators on the film, with a special shoutout reserved for the film’s key grip, Tomasz Sternicki. \n\n\n\t“I found [Tomasz] one day at the back of his truck, and he was chopping up potatoes and onions and meat. He was making — and he brought his ginormous cast iron pot over from Poland — and he was making soup. And this soup started turning up on set, so it was delicious.” \n\n\tIn “Hamnet,” Buckley plays Agnes Shakespeare as she falls in love with a poor Latin tutor named William (Paul Mescal), who goes on to become the famed playwright. The historical fiction story follows the Shakespeares’ love story as they wed and have three children, but tragedy strikes when their only son, 11-year-old Hamnet, dies from the plague. The film, directed by Oscar winner Chloé Zhao, explores the family’s grief over the devastating loss and how the tragedy inspired Shakespeare’s play “Hamlet.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Focus Features film earned six nominations at this year’s Golden Globes, including best motion picture drama, best supporting actor (Mescal), best director (Zhao), best screenplay (Zhao and Maggie O’Farrell) and best original score (Max Richter). It went on to win best drama in addition to Buckley’s award.\n\n\t“Hamnet” debuted at the Telluride Film Festival in August, where Buckley’s devastating performance was hailed as her best work to date. The actress previously starred in “Women Talking,” “Wild Rose” and “The Lost Daughter,” for which she earned a best supporting actress Oscar nod; she will next be seen starring in “The Bride!”\n\n\tVariety parent company PMC owns Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\t“One Battle After Another,” a blistering satire about radical politics, and “Hamnet,” a look at William Shakespeare’s complicated domestic life, took top prizes at the 83rd Golden Globe Awards. “The Studio,” a send-up of Hollywood, was named best TV series (musical or comedy) and “The Pitt,” which takes place in an over-stretched hospital, won best TV series (drama). Best limited or anthology series went to “Adolescence,” the story of a murder investigation that unfolds in one shot.\n\n\tThe Globes, unlike the Oscars, delineates films by genre. That meant “One Battle After Another” won best picture (musical or comedy), while “Hamnet” was crowned best picture (drama). It was a big night for Warner Bros. Discovery, which produced “One Battle After Another,” as well as “The Pitt.” “One Battle After Another” scored a leading four prizes, with writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson nabbing trophies for the film’s screenplay and his direction. “Hamnet” won two statues, including best actress for Jessie Buckley’s portrayal of a grieving mother. Focus Features produced the movie.\n\n\t“Adolescence,” which was backed by Netflix, won four prizes in total, the most of any TV show. Its creator Stephen Graham won best actor in a limited series, while Erin Doherty was named best supporting actress in a TV drama for the show. Owen Cooper, their 16-year-old co-star, won best supporting actor in a TV drama, becoming the youngest ever winner in the category.\n\n\tNikki Glaser returned as emcee for the second year in a row. In her opening monologue, she poked fun at everything from Bari Weiss (“CBS news: America’s newest place to ‘See B.S. News.'”) to the Epstein files (“The Golden Globe for best editing goes to… the Justice Department!”) to Warner Bros.’s pending sale to Netflix. She also lampooned Hollywood’s self-obsession, calling the Globes, “without a doubt the most important thing that’s happening in the world right now.”\n\n\tThere were more somber reminders of politics on display. Celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Wanda Sykes wore pins to the ceremony with the messages “Ice Out” and “Be Good” to honor the memory of Renée Macklin Good, who was killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this week. Several winners also used their time on stage to urge viewers to exhibit compassion and understanding, an apparent nod to the country’s polarization. \n\n\tTop acting honors went to Rose Byrne, named best actress in a musical or comedy for her work as the mother of a child with a pediatric feeding disorder in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” and Timothée Chalamet, who picked up best actor in a musical or comedy prize for playing a ping-pong player in “Marty Supreme.” Chalamet had previously been nominated four times without ever winning.\n\n\t“My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up,” Chalamet said. “Always be grateful for what you have. It’s allowed me to leave the ceremony in the past empty-handed with my head held high. I’d be lying if I said those moments didn’t make this moment that much sweeter.”\n\n\tWagner Moura won best actor in a drama for playing a political refugee in “The Secret Agent.” “If trauma can be passed along through generations, values can too,” Moura said. \n\n\tNoah Wyle earned best actor in a TV drama for playing a hard-charging doctor in “The Pitt,” while Rhea Seehorn won best actress in a TV drama for her performance as a novelist confronting an alien virus in “Pluribus.” “I meant to get a prescription for beta blockers but I did not,” Seehorn said. “Sorry!”\n\n\t“The Studio’s” Seth Rogen was named best actor in a TV comedy for his performance as a blundering movie executive in the Apple TV series. Jean Smart won best actress in a TV comedy for her work as a stand-up comic in “Hacks,” marking her third Golden Globe victory. “What can I say, I’m a greedy bitch,” Smart joked. \n\n\tMichelle Williams won her third Golden Globe, this one in the best actress in a limited series category, for her performance as a terminally ill woman in “Dying for Sex.” \n\n\tTeyana Taylor was named best supporting actress for playing a revolutionary in “One Battle After Another,” and Stellan Skarsgård won best supporting actor for his turn as an emotionally remote filmmaker in “Sentimental Value.” Taylor gave one of the night’s most emotional speeches. “To my Brown sisters and little brown girls watching tonight, our softness is not a liability,” Taylor said. “Our depth is not too much. Our light does not need permission to shine. We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space.”\n\n\tIn addition to honoring film and television, the Globes recognized podcasts for the first time, handing out the top prize to “Good Hang With Amy Poehler.” “I don’t know about awards shows, but when they get it right, it makes sense,” Poehler joked.\n\n\tStreaming sensation “KPop Demon Hunters” won two honors, including best animated feature and best original song for its anthem, “Golden.” And Brazil’s “The Secret Agent” was named best international feature.\n\n\tSykes, presenting the award for best standup special, trolled Ricky Gervais for his past anti-trans jokes and atheism. The comic wasn’t in the ballroom when he won the Globe for his latest show, “Mortality,” so Sykes accepted his statue while “thanking God and the trans community.” It was Gervais’ second consecutive win in the category.\n\n\t“Sinners,” a vampire film set in the segregated South, won the prize for best cinematic and box office achievement.\n\n\tSee the full list of winners below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFRANKENSTEIN (Netflix)\n\n\tHAMNET (Focus Features) (WINNER)\n\n\tIT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT (NEON)\n\n\tTHE SECRET AGENT (NEON)\n\n\tSENTIMENTAL VALUE (NEON)\n\n\tSINNERS (Warner Bros.

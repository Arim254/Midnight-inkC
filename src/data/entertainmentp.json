    "body": "\n\tCommercial breaks often give TV viewers time for a trip to the bathroom — but never quite like this.\n\n\tIn a 30-second ad that aired during NBC’s telecast of Super Bowl LX, Liquid I.V., a maker of electrolyte drink mixes, decided to give viewers a royal flush: a series of toilets and commodes singing about the need to examine the color of one’s urine to ensure proper hydration. The spot showed a series of different latrines and urinals crooning a cover version of the Phil Collins power ballad “Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),” by the singer Ejae, who is known for her recent work in the film “KPop Demon Hunters.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe concept “is one of those things that just makes you sit up a little bit straighter in your chair, and you’re just uncomfortable enough,” says Stacey Andrade-Wells, the company’s chief marketing officer, during a recent interview. And while the ad doesn’t discuss the actual product it’s pitching until its final seconds, “it all comes together at the very end,” she adds, and consumers will “understand now why these toilets are singing.”\n\n\n\tLiquid I.V. jumped into a very crowded pool. More marketers of health and wellness products and services came to the Super Bowl to tout weight loss pills, telehealth services and even getting consumers to take tests that might identify potential maladies. Andrade-Wells attributes the interest in “a refocus on health and wellness” in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. Taking care of one’s mind and body has become “such a critical part of people’s everyday lives,” she says. “And that trend is not going anywhere.”\n\t\n\n\tUnlike many of the others, Liquid I.V. bet on a creative concept, not a famous face.  Super Bowl viewers will see Serena Williams tout the telehealth provider Ro; Kenan Thompson, Ana Gasteyer, DJ Khaled and others in a commercial for a new Wegovy weight loss pill; and Octavia Spencer and Sofía Vergara  spotlight a new urine test from Boehringer Ingelheim meant to highlight kidney function.\n\n\t“One thing that we were very intentional about when we were creating this idea was most brands are going to show up to the Super Bowl with celebrity talent in their ads, and ultimately, you see so many celebrities. You start to misattribute,” says Andrade-Wells. “It becomes almost a little bit of celebrity fatigue.” Liquid I.V. told its ad agency, Anomaly, that any Super Bowl commercial ideas “would not rely on celebrity talent.”\n\n\tAnd while Liquid I.V. has never run a commercial in the Super Bowl before, its owner, Unilever, most certainly has. The consumer-products giant has placed commercials for Hellmann’s mayonnaise in the Big Game for six consecutive years, including in 2026. And its Dove is appearing for the second time in as many years on Sunday.\n\n\tPotty humor can also be a tricky conceit to pull off for a Super Bowl audience. Gross-out jokes don’t always play well for a broad crowd that often includes families and kids. But others have found a way to approach the subject without alienating crowds often eating as they watch the Big Game.\n\n\tGeorgia-Pacific’s Angel Soft last year ran a 30-second spot during Fox’s telecast of Super Bowl LIX featuring a cute animated ‘angel” figure telling the audience they had time to dash to the bathroom. The commercial even featured a countdown clock. WK Kellogg’s Raisin Bran may step closer to the bounds of good taste with an ad on Sunday slated to run on Peacock that features William Shatner as “William Shat” talking about a high-fiber version of the cereal. The commercial will stream only, rather than appearing in NBC’s linear feed.\n\n\t“I’m sure we’re going to get some people who are like, ‘I can’t believe they’re telling me to look at my pee,’” says Andrade-Wells. “But it isn’t offensive.”\n\n\tIndeed, getting people to converse about their bathroom habits is the point. “Our goal is to inspire behavior change,” says the executive. “We want people at their Super Bowl parties to be debating it with each other. And ultimately, we want them to think about hydration.”\n\t\n\n\tTo make its point further, Liquid I.V. is putting some ad money into places where people might talk further about its ad — like barroom bathrooms in San Francisco, where this year’s Super Bowl takes place, and in the hometowns of the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots. The company has also arranged to have Monday christened National Rehydration Day and has worked out a way to get Liquid I.V. delivered to consumers via a partnership with DoorDash.\n\n\tPeople can always drink more water, of course, but the goal of this Super Bowl commercial is to get them to think about something slightly more complex. Liquid I.V. has “about 37% national awareness as a brand” and “about 18.5% household penetration, says Andrade-Wells. “Still less than half of America is aware this brand even exists.” After Sunday’s Super Bowl debut, that probably will no longer be the case.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBen Affleck’s latest Super Bowl commercial for Dunkin’ serves up a lot more than coffee and doughnuts.\n\n\tJennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Jason Alexander, Ted Danson, Alfonso Ribeiro, Jaleel White and Jasmine Guy all join Affleck and frequent partner Tom Brady in a surprising spot that shows the ensemble acting in a long-lost sitcom called “Good Will Dunkin’” The show answer the never-asked question of what the 1997 drama “Good Will Hunting,” starring and devised by Affleck and Matt Damon, might have looked like if it were presented in comedy form.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe show contains multiple references to the “Good Will Hunting” script, even as it makes references to shows like “Friends,” “Cheers,” “A Different World,” “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” “Seinfeld” and “Family Matters.” The various actors got a special effects tune-up and were de-aged via production techniques. But the spot was shot on film on a real set.\n\n\n\tDunkin made a callback to 1990s TV because it wants to celebrate its first advertisement for iced coffee, which debuted in1995.  As part of the look back, Dunkin will give away 1.995 million free iced coffees of any size starting Monday, Feb. 9. Guests can redeem the offer using code GOODWILLDUNKIN in the Dunkin’ app.\n\n\tDunkin will also offer a limited collection of vintage apparel inspired by the 1990s – all sourced vintage shops in Boston! Fans can shop at DunkinRunsOnMerch.com Sunday night after the ad runs.\n\n\tThe Dunkin ad is the latest in a series of hilarious and star-studded spots Affleck has made for the coffee and pastry chain since 2023. Some spots featured a musical group called the “DunKings” and enlisted actors including Jeremy Strong and Casey Affleck. Two spots featured cameos by Jennifer Lopez, Affleck’s former spouse.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMadison Avenue tapped the brakes on most somber Super Bowl commercials Sunday night, with many trying to do something Big Game ads haven’t always done — make people feel good.\n\n\tA dizzying array of spots featured famous faces in frantic, frenetic scenarios, including Ben Stiller and Benson Boone trying to out-flip each other for delivery-service Instacart while dressed in throwback musicians costumes. Andy Samberg cavorted on behalf of Hellmann’s mayonnaise, dressed as some sort of off-kilter Neil Diamond wanna-be. And a bevy of “SNL” cast members past and present appeared throughout the night — Ana Gasteyer and Kenan Thompson for Wegovy; Colin Jost and Michael Che for DraftKings; Heidi Gardner for Homes.com and Apartments.com. Meanwhile, Bowen Yang joined up with frequent “SNL” guests Scarlett Johansson and Jon Hamm for Ritz Crackers.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t“The feeling is pretty damn joyful,” says Ellie Bamford, chief strategy officer of North America for the large ad agency VML. She felt the commercials struck the right note, moving away from sad stories and playing up fun and nostalgia.  In past Super Bowls, “brands have gone with things that felt too heavy, too divisive,” she says. This year, she says advertisers “swung away” from moralizing and “telling people what to think.”\n\n\n\t“We can’t ignore the absurdity in the ads this year,” says Erin Sarro, a creative director at Two Tango Collaborative, an advertising consortium based in Richmond. The Instacart ad, she says, “offered a fever dream” with Stiller and Boone looking like “an Italian mustache new wave duo.”\n\t\n\n\tOther commercials played up the surreal. Liquid I.V., a hydration mix for water, unveiled a commercial filled with toilets and commodes singing a cover of an old Phil Collins song. Budweiser struck a chord Sunday night with a spot that told the tale of one of its Clydesdale horses growing up alongside an American bald eagle — all to the strains of Lynyrd Skynyrd’s classic “Free Bird.” Ben Affleck returned for his fourth Super Bowl effort for Dunkin’, this time luring Jennifer Aniston, Tom Brady, Jason Alexander, Jasmine Guy, Tom Brady and Jaleel White for a spot that evoked 1990s sitcoms.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Instacart executive behind the company’s offbeat Super Bowl entry says consumers always appreciate “levity and joy” as well as “a moment of escapism.”\n\n\tTo be sure, several spots tried to make people ponder bigger issues. A commercial from Rocket Mortgage and Redfin showed viewers the story of two families — one white, one Latino — who viewed each other skeptically until the Latino family’s daughter finds the white family’s lost dog. Advertising agency executives praised the intent, and the decision to commission Lady Gaga to sing the “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” theme from “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.” But they also suggested the spot skated past some difficult issues tied to race and class.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe sheer glut of happy ads may drown out some of the more serious or innovative creative choices. “We know what works in the Super Bowl,” says Omid Amidi, co-chief creative officer of McKinney, an agency based in Durham, NC. “It’s mostly celebrities, a music cover, animals and puppies. It just feels like we are really playing the hits, without taking any swings.”\n\n\tViewers were inundated with messages from a swell of A.I. companies. Amazon aimed for humor, with Chris Hemsworth expressing fear of what his new Alexa assistant might do to him. Anthropic threw a sharp elbow at rival Open AI with a spot that made fun of a decision to incorporate commercials into a tier of ChatGPT. For its part, Open AI tried to make people forget their worries about the technology.\n\n\t“They are showing up as any industry that is so young would, and starting to figure out all the different places they might take,” says Daniel Lobatón chief creative officer, North America, for David, a Miami agency. “Some are more serious and earnest.”\n\t\n\n\tGetting a Super Bowl ad to hit all the high notes is tough, says Rob Reilly, glolbal chief creative officer of WPP. “It’s hard to make these things. It is really difficult. There are a lot of people who are involvled in decision making, and a lot of cooks in the kitchen.”\n\n\tSome executives wondered if the Dunkin’ ad, for all its celebrities, missed the mark. “It really didn’t quite pay off,” says Bamford. In past efforts, the company spent more time making sure its doughnuts and coffee got more screen time. \n\n\tBalancing celebrities and marketing messages can be a difficult assignment notes Diane Sayler, a senior director at Mars Snacking who oversees marketing for the company’s salty snacks, during a recent interview. “In my opinion, one of the worst possible things that can happen to a Super Bowl marketer is they remember your celebrity or your song or your ad concept, but not your brand.” Mars’ Pringles tapped Sabrina Carpenter for its Super Bowl commercial, but played up attributes of the snack. In most scenes of the ad, the singer or other around her were seen eating one chip after another — a nod to a revived slogan, “Once you pop, the pop don’t stop.”\n\n\tAn unorthodox ad from Coinbase also spurred debate. The spot used very little in the way of glitzy production, instead giving viewers what looked like a karaoke screen in a bar, and spurred them to sing along to a Backstreet Boys song. In 2022, the cryptocurrency company ran a similar effort, putting a floating QR code on screen — and nothing else. “It’s their schtick,” says Bamford.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Have we gotten to a point where we are over-celebriti-ed? I don’t know,” says Reilly. “It seems to be the thing people enjoy.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump took to social media during the Super Bowl to criticize Bad Bunny’s halftime show. \n\n\t“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World. This ‘Show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the Best Stock Market and 401(k)s in History!”\n\t\n\n\tTrump continued, “There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a Halftime Show and watch, it will get great reviews from the Fake News Media, because they haven’t got a clue of what is going on in the REAL WORLD — And, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new Kickoff Rule. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! President DONALD J. TRUMP\n\n\n\tAs the Super Bowl was beginning, Trump was on a happier note as he posted: “Enjoy the Super Bowl, America! Our Country is stronger, bigger, and better than ever before and, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!”\n\n\tWhen the NFL and Apple Music announced Bad Bunny as the 2026 Super Bowl performer last September, the news immediately sparked MAGA outrage. Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was quick to condemn Bad Bunny and was the first to threaten that ICE agents would be present at the Super Bowl.\n\n\t“It’s so shameful they’ve decided to pick somebody who seems to hate America so much to represent them at the Halftime Show,” Lewandowski said at the time. “We should be trying to be inclusive, not exclusive. There are plenty of great bands and entertainment people who could be playing at that show that would be bringing people together and not separating them.”\n\t\n\n\tBad Bunny’s selection was especially notable as the Super Bowl marks the Grammy winner’s only U.S. concert appearance that’s set for this year, as his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour is not stopping in the States. Bad Bunny told I-D magazine that his fear of ICE raids was part of the reason why he skipped touring in the U.S.\n\n\tTrump told NewsMax’s “Greg Kelly Reports” soon after it’s “absolutely ridiculous” that Bad Bunny is performing at the Super Bowl Halftime Show, although the president claimed not to know the artist.\n\n\t“I’ve never heard of him,” Trump said. “I don’t know who he is… I don’t know why they’re doing it. It’s crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment — I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”\n\n\tWhen Bad Bunny hosed “SNL” last October, he said that playing the Super Bowl Halftime Show was notable for “all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGeneral Motors hopes to turn a fourth-quarter Super Bowl commercial into the equivalent of a moon launch for the automaker’s debut in Formula 1 racing.\n\n\tA 30-second ad offers a first look at the livery, or vehicle body, that stands at the center of the new auto entry from Cadillac Formula 1. But it also endows the reveal with a sense of history, utilizing President John F. Kennedy’s famous 1962 speech about sending a spacecraft to the moon: “We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Viewers will also hear actual dialogue between Mission Control and astronauts from the Apollo mission.\n\t\n\n\t“We want to plant the flag that we are America’s new home team to root for,” says Ahmed Iqbal, chief marketing officer, Cadillac F1, during a recent interview. The spot is meant to offer “a value proposition you can provide the fan, whether you’re a core F1 fan for the last 70 years, or if you’re a brand-new fan that just watched the “F1” movie, and you’re still trying to figure out if you like it or not,” he says. “You get to go on the journey with us and figure out exactly what it takes to build a team.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCadillac Formula 1 is backed by General Motors and TWG Motorsports and is the first new team to join the sport since 2016. The F1 spot was created with Translation, the independent marketing agency led by entrepreneur Steven Stoute.\n\n\tExecutives believe the spot will stand apart from the pack, even in a fourth quarter that, if it follows recent Super Bowl dynamics, could feature a down-to-the-wire match between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots. Viewers “can relate to ambition, can relate to taking on a challenge and doing it with no promise of success,” says  Mina Mikhael, an executive creative director at Translation., The Super Bowl features “lots of cool celebrity spots, lots of fun spots, lots of very heartfelt spots. You have to stand out from that.”\n\t\n\n\tThe ad shows the new Cadillac Formula 1 vehicle being formed out of parts, all of which can be seen individually over a desert landscape. The spot was indeed filmed in Death Valley National Park and “we hung car parts on wires” and used special effects to show the livery being assembled, says Steve Horn, an executive creative director at Translation. Such a scene was critical, he says, “especially when the hero of our spot is the machine.”\n\n\tGM worked over the weekend to build anticipation for the commercial, with a display in Times Square. The new car was concealed in a  glass box with frosted windows that allowed passers-by to see the silhouette of mechanics assembling the car throughout the weekend.\n\n\tBut the ad will serve as the true test of interest in Cadillac’s new track. GM will no doubt be looking to see who decides to cheer the new Formula 1 team on as it revs promotional engines.\n",

    "description": "\n\tBad Bunny promised “the world will dance” in his advertisement before the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show, and his joyous, elaborate, unapologe",
    "body": "\n\tBad Bunny promised “the world will dance” in his advertisement before the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show, and his joyous, elaborate, unapologetic, unity-themed performance did not disappoint as he — with Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin and many more — raced through a medley of his songs, introducing them and himself to many of the more than 100 million viewers.\n\n\tThe show was steeped in the tradition of Latin America and especially his native Puerto Rico, as the elaborate set included a house (similar to the one in his “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí” residency in Puerto Rico — which was previewed in Variety‘s Bad Bunny cover story last June — transforming the space into a Puerto Rico vecindad, with a barber shop, liquor store, and the iconic “casita,” the small house where he would welcome celebrity guests during his Puerto Rico residency. On Sunday night, Karol G, Cardi B Young, Miko Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal were spotted dancing under the casita’s roof as the performance moved through a mock sugar-cane field, a giant dancefloor filled with exuberant dancers — and an actual wedding, his rep confirms. The performance was so loaded with Easter eggs and subtle political references that his fans will be decoding it for weeks.\n\t\n\n\tBut unity was a key theme. At the end of the performance, Bad Bunny declared “God Bless America,” before naming every country in North and South America, and the Caribbean, including the United States, Canada and, of course, his “motherland,” Puerto Rico. \n\n\tBehind him, a billboard flashed in giant letters: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love,” likely a direct rebuke to the negative comments — many of them racist — that he received before he’d even set foot on stage. Many moments and elements in the show could also be perceived as a rebuke to the Trump administration and its brutal anti-immigration policies.\n\t\n\n\tThe show was threaded with references to his island and references to politics — including a cream Zara jersey stamped with the number 64, a possible nod to the first-reported death toll of Hurricane Maria — but the night was, above all, a dance party.\n\n\n\tAt the center of the performance, Gaga sang a salsa-inflected version of her 2024 hit with Bruno Mars, “Die With a Smile,” as the couple were married onstage.\n\n\tIn another nod to Puerto Rico, Bad Bunny welcomed fellow native Ricky Martin to the stage for a brief version of “lo que le pasó a Hawái”— from Bad Bunny’s Grammy-winning latest album, “Debí tirar más fotos.”\n\n\tIn perhaps the performance’s most loaded political moment, Bad Bunny’s Grammy acceptance speech, during which he’d said “ICE out” and gave an impassioned speech in English about racism, was replayed on a small television as a young boy — who certainly resembled Liam, the 5-year-old who was incarcerated by ICE in Minneapolis last month — and then the singer handed him his Grammy Award.\n\n\tBefore the game, a group of protesters gathered near Tasman Drive by the stadium’s East Side entrance, carrying “ICE OUT!” towels and “Abolish ICE Now!” posters as football fans streamed inside. (Despite earlier threats from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE agents were not in evidence at the Super Bowl.)\n\n\n\tThe singer opened the show with his hit “Tití Me Preguntó,” kicking off the energy immediately, walking through a the sugar-cane field, bumping into viejitos playing dominoes, a Villa’s Tacos stand, and Toñita, the owner of the Caribbean Social Club, who handed the singer a shot of rum. He then moved past a nail salon, a barber shop, and a boxing match with Puerto Rican boxers Xander Zayas and Emiliano Vargas.\n\n\tAfter the high-octane opener, Bad Bunny emerged on the rooftop of a Super Bowl-recreated casita for “Yo Perreo Sola” as some A-list Latino stars, including Karol G, Cardi B, Jessica Alba, and Pedro Pascal were seen perreando under the on-field roof in another display of Latino unity. (Alix Earle and some other non-Latino stars worked their way onto the small porch, too.)\n\t\n\n\tAs Bad Bunny sang his hit “Monaco,” Lady Gaga joined the show on an elevated platform for a Puerto Rican wedding recreation, emerging as a salsa singer for a Latinafied reimagining of “Die With a Smile,” supported by legendary salsa group Los Sobrinos. After the performance, Bad Bunny joined Gaga  onstage for a joyful dance to “Baile Inolvidable.” The moment stood out as one of the show’s most powerful: Bad Bunny, the most dominant Latino star in the world, sharing the stage with Gaga, a universally beloved pop veteran, for an unapologetic Latino reinterpretation of one of the biggest pop songs on the planet — unity, indeed.\n\n\t“Dance, dance, dance without fear,” Bad Bunny said in Spanish to end the song before falling onto a crowd of dancers that caught him for the start of “Nueva Yol.”\n\n\tAfter Gaga, a poignant moment followed, led by the second music guest of the evening: Ricky Martin. The Puerto Rican star appeared onstage sitting on one of the plastic chairs that emulated the “Debí Tirar” album cover. He sang alone, with an empty chair next to him as dancers behind him enacted an electrocution after an apagón, or blackout — a direct reference to the 11 months it took for power to be restored on the island following Hurricane Maria in 2017. \n\n\tThe empty chair may have represented the more than 3,000 lives lost in the hurricane. (Just a few days ago, Martin wrote an open letter to Bad Bunny in Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Día praising Bad Bunny for headlining “stages around the world carrying his language, his accent, and his story.”) \n\n\tThe pair then performed “El Apagón,” the 2017 song Bad Bunny released about the blackout, where Bad Bunny let out the expletive: “Puerto Rico está bien cabrón!” (basically “Puerto Rico is the shit!”). \n\n\tMartin’s appearance at the Super Bowl halftime show makes sense thematically also because he became the face of Latin music’s U.S. crossover in the late 1990s, particularly with his smash single “Livin’ La Vida Loca.”  While they didn’t perform the track on Sunday, Martin and Bad Bunny joined forces on “Cántalo” from Martin’s “Pausa” EP in 2020.\n\n\n\tAs the performance wound down, dancers carrying flags from across the Americas moved to an electrified rendition of “Café Con Ron,” backed by Los Pleneros de la Cresta. Bad Bunny later appeared holding a football and made his “God Bless America” statement, revealing a message written on the pigskin in his hands: “Together, we are America.”\n\t\n\n\n\tThe show ended with the hit “DTMF,” before the football field became a dance party while a fireworks show went off. \n\n\tAs has been widely noted, Sunday’s halftime show was the first primarily Spanish-language performance to take place at the Super Bowl, although Bad Bunny was a guest back in 2020, when he and J Balvin guested during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez’s headlining performance; Gloria Estefan, who performed during the halftime show in 1992 with Miami Sound Machine, is the only other previous Latin halftime performer.\n\n\tWhile Bad Bunny’s performance was an exuberant and deeply coded celebration of Latin American culture, it was also a statement that culture is meant to be shared. Love is stronger than hate, together we are America  — and everyone is welcome on the dance floor.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTurning Point USA clearly saw Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime booking as an affront to the nation that needed to be met by an alternative event for conservative viewers, but the “All-American Halftime Show” opted not to offer much in the way of provocation in return. Rather than come off as a protest event, the 35-minute program offered a set of mild, largely non-political performances that could have been mistaken for a vintage CMT or Nashville Network special — even from Kid Rock, who was on his very best behavior during a quick two-song appearance.\n\t\n\n\tBad Bunny? Never mentioned, or even alluded to… which was the case for anything else that might have raised much of an eyebrow or a stir, in a show that could have aired at just about any time in the 21st century, aside from the closing montage of Charlie Kirk imagery.\n\n\n\tWithout an announcer to offer context, there was no indication of where the performances were being broadcast from, or if they were taking place in real time. According to sources, the show was pre-taped in Atlanta.\n\n\tBrantley Gilbert was up first, followed by fellow country artists Gabby Barrett and Lee Brice, before Kid Rock closed things out in an enclosed setting where a crowd of what looked to be about a hundred fans stood cheering on either side of a huge thrust ramp that extended across the studio floor.\n\n\tPolitics were limited to Brice singing “Real American,” which extols a place where “everything’s made in the USA,” and Brice premiering a brand new song, “Country Nowadays,” in which he complains about seeing “a picture of a flag up in flames while people cheer,” along with making the statement, “little boys ain’t little girls.” \n\t\n\n\tBrice said, “Charlie gave people mics so they could say what’s on their mind. This is what’s on mine.” The chorus of his new song: “Say I’m some right-wing devil ’cause I was down-south-Jesus-raised / It ain’t easy being country in this country nowadays.”\n\n\tFour Black men stood on stage to introduce the main attraction — “Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our brother, Robert Ritchie” — in a fleeting show of people of color. \n\n\tKid Rock started with some literal firepower, at least in the pyro department, as he sang an inoffensive version of his venerable rap hit “Bawitaba.” Much of the performance appeared to be pre-recorded, as he only raised the mic to his mouth for about half of the lyrics, if that, as widely noted on social media. But he seemed to be fully on-mic as he sang the closing ballad, “Till You Can’t,” a cover of a sentimental country hit from a few years back by Cody Johnson.\n\n\tIn his only spoken remarks, Kid Rock introduced “Till You Can’t” by saying that he was awakened one night with the Johnson song in his head and felt there was “a verse that still needed to be written for this song.” He then sang his self-penned addition, which was effectively an evangelical altar call: “There’s a book sitting in your house somewhere that could use some dusting off / There’s a man who died for all our sins hanging from the cross / You can give your life to Jesus and he’ll give you a second chance / Till you can’t.” \n\n\tAt song’s end, the camera moved over to big-screen photos of the late Charlie Kirk and his widow, Erika Kirk, who is now in charge of TPUSA, followed by a fade to darkness and closing credit that still did not offer many hints where the performance was taking place.\n\n\tThe show began with Gilbert’s guitarists offering “The Star Spangled Banner” in the tradition of Jimi Hendrix, before the singer himself emerged and led the band in a style closer to hard rock than classic country, as has been his custom. Barrett stuck closer to a Carrie Underwood style of country, starting with her breakout hit “I Hope” and following it with “One of the Good Ones.” Brice sang his hit “Drinking Class,” which includes the chorus “If you gotta label me, then label me proud / ‘Cause I belong to the drinking class,” a hit that conflates patriotic self-esteem with “rowdy” bar behavior and alcohol consumption.\n\t\n\n\tA snafu arose when TPUSA announced on its X feed that the show would not be broadcast there, and viewers should turn their attention to the org’s YouTube channel. There, viewership was shown as peaking at just over 5 million when Kid Rock came on at 9:35 p.m. ET. With the third quarter of the Super Bowl having already begun after Bad Bunny’s shorter halftime performance and while Kid Rock was still on, YouTube viewers for the “All-American Halftime Show” dipped slightly to 4.4 million by the time the headliner finished.\n\n\tThe show was also available on other platforms and networks, like OAN, which was late to jump into the feed amid its nightly news program. There was no immediate estimate of overall viewership.\n\n\tAlthough references to the big show in California and its lead performer were nil, Kid Rock had earlier described what he saw as the intent for the program. “We plan to play great songs for folks who love America. We’re approaching this show like David and Goliath. Competing with the pro football machine and a global pop superstar is almost impossible…or is it?” He continued, referencing Bad Bunny: “He’s said he’s having a dance party, wearing a dress, and singing in Spanish? Cool. We plan to play great songs for folks who love America.” \n\n\tDetractors have noted the alternative halftime show’s inability to draw any current country hitmakers — the country performers on hand all had their runs of hits in the 2010s, except Barrett, who had her smash in 2020 — with some wondering where Jason Aldean, the most popular musician friend of President Trump, was. Aldean did at least come up for a mention, as Gilbert noted that his life was changed when Aldean recorded a song he co-wrote, the pioneering country-rap hybrid “Red Dirt Anthem,” which he then sang and rapped.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMost Super Bowl commercials aim to be faster, louder and shinier than the rest. And then there are Big Game ads from advertisers like Coinbase.\n\n\tAfter mystifying Super Bowl viewers in 2022 with a decidedly lo-fi ad showing nothing but a floating QR code, the cryptocurrency trading platform has returned with another spot that’s so spartan it looks like it was created by someone working on an Apple II in the 1980s. The 60-second spot emulates a karaoke screen at a bar, with basic computer animation and less-than-stylish graphics. The emphasis is on lyrics from the 1997 Backstreet Boys song “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)” and the first words people will see on screen are “Oh my god we’re back again.”\n\t\n\n\tThe no-frills approach is the point. By not emulating “that kind of more polished feeling than every other ad at the Super Bowl time typically has,” Coinbase believes its commercial is more likely to capture attention than many of its celebrity laden counterparts, says Cat Ferdon, Coinbase’s chief marketing officer, during a recent interview.\n\n\n\tThe commercial aims to create a communal moment, the executive says and get all members of the Super Bowl audience singing the song, which has words the company hopes will suggest the broader appeal of cryptocurrency. “We’re still competing with people’s cell phones, and this ad will undoubtedly get them and anyone to look up,” she says. “We’re really trying to effectively use this as the world’s biggest singalong, to show that crypto isn’t just for techies, but really for anyone who knows the lyrics.”\n\t\n\n\tCoinbase isn’t the first Super Bowl advertiser to take an extremely basic approach to its pitch. In 2020, Lifeminders.com, an email advertising company, ran what was basically a few lines of black text against a yellow screen, proclaiming that the spot was “the worst commercial in the Super Bowl.” As an error-filled version of the piano exercise “Chopsticks” plays, the ad told the audience that “We’re information experts. (Geeks). But we don’t know diddley about making ads.” In 2021, Oatly ran a spot that showed a senior executive in a field playing a keyboard and singing about its chief product, oat milk.\n\n\tThe commercials come off like  cutoff jeans and a tank top at a formal affair. Viewers typically tune into the Super Bowl to see the best of what Madison Avenue has to offer. Expectations are high for surprise celebrity cameos, dazzling images, clever uses of popular songs and, in some cases, the chance to see a culture-defining effort like Apple’s famous “1984” commercial, which blew minds with its depiction of an athlete rebelling against autonomous society, or Chrysler’s 2012 “Halftime in America” spot, which featured a grim Clint Eastwood telling the nation to get back on the playing field after being hit by a significant recession.\n\n\tSome of the unembellished spots stand out despite their rudimentary nature. GoDaddy, a web hosting company, thrived for years with bare-bones commercials that initially played on the potential for seeing a scantily clad female character. Cash4Gold, a trader that usually relied on cheaply made direct response commercials, in 2009 made a Super Bowl ad that used celebrity pitchman Ed McMahon and rapper MC Hammer.\n\n\tSuch efforts have surfaced as the ranks of the annual Super Bowl ad roster have swelled to include more start-ups and first-time entrants. Many of these companies have little experience with mainstream advertising, and most of their focus has instead been on using digital outreach to cultivate specific customer niches. The best Super Bowl ads find a way to capture the attention of tens of millions of viewers, while driving home a need for a product or the reliability of an overall brand.\n\n\tCoinbase executives believe their approach works. The company’s 2022 commercial “was probably the most talked about ad” of that year, says Ferdon. After the QR code appeared in the Super Bowl, Coinbase saw 20 million hits on its landing page in one minute, the company revealed following the end of the 2022 game. Its app crashed in the immediate aftermath.\n\t\n\n\tPerhaps Coinbase knows something about the Super Bowl audience that others don’t?\n\n\tOf the 120 million tuning in to the gridiron classic, “I think 110 million have had a bit to drink,” says Joe Staples, Coinbase’s vice president of creative. “This is fun and it’s supposed to be kind of our gift to that moment.\n\n\tThe Coinbase team considered every element of design in the ad, he says. Should they add some of he backgrounds people see on karaoke screens in bars, like waterfalls? Should the graphics have fuzzy edges? Should the ad try to use some of the heart-shaped graphics that sometimes surface as lyrics scroll?\n\n\t “Almost all of our conversations were about restraint,” says Staples. “So people can just focus on themselves.”\n\n\tIf it works, the ad will also help lend something that is not often attributed to cryptocurrency companies: emotion. Executives hope that spot spurs “a sense of togetherness” and that viewers will start to sing along with the tune, says Ferdon. “We know that 60% of Americans who watch the Super Bowl watch it together. It’s not exactly a solemn, singular pastime. It’s something we do in a group. And we really think that this kind of captures the spirit of it,” she says.  “We’re not just buying airtime with this ad. We really designed like a shared high energy experience for our community to participate in and do that together.”\n\n\tA winning Super Bowl commercial says Ferdon, sometimes must break old rules. “Ideas stand out,” she says. “And doing things other people aren’t doing stands out.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wear the mission. Text merch to 71776 for official TPUSA merch.”\n\n\tThose were the first words greeting thousands of viewers as they joined Turning Point’s YouTube channel for the 15-minute countdown before their alternate All-American Halftime Show, as a chyron ran nonstop at the bottom of the screen, hawking merchandise and begging for text signups .\n\n\tIt was a fitting start for a slapdash night of music that seemed half-hearted from the start. The whole event was predicated on outrage from the MAGA faithful over Bad Bunny, a proud Puerto Rican who performs in Spanish, being selected to perform the Super Bowl halftime show. Because those angry about Bad Bunny couldn’t say the quiet part out loud — outside of Turning Point conspicuously surveying fans about what kinds of music they would want, and one of the choices was “Anything in English” — vague language was instead used to invoke patriotism.\n\t\n\n\tUnfortunately, the All-American Halftime Show was unable to evoke much more than a shrug, with halfhearted pop-country performances that showed the limitations of booking a big show with minimal talent. \n\n\n\tAs the YouTube live viewer count approached 5.5 million viewers, Brantley Gilbert’s guitarist kicked things off with a solo electric guitar rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” that would struggle to elicit more than polite applause from Jimi Hendrix. Drenched in red lighting, Gilbert’s set was inoffensive twang that felt like the emotional resonance was sucked out by a rock-and-roll vampire.\n\n\tThe only ear-demolishing moment came during Gilbert’s hip-hop verse in “Dirt Road Anthem,” with his fauxhawk looking less like a style choice and more like his hair hoping to escape ridicule. Ultimately, it was a reminder that while Gilbert said he took the gig because he “imagined my kids watching their daddy perform at halftime during the biggest game in American Football,” he hasn’t actually done that. The move here is carving out a niche MAGA audience and some appreciative Fox News hits, so just be honest.\n\t\n\n\tThe open-mic night trudged along, as bunny emojis menacingly flooded the live chat and broke up the RNC-lite staging of the musical acts. Lee Brice’s three-song set was accurately described by his closer, “Hard to Love,” and Gabby Barrett’s two-song blip proved these two artists still aren’t ready for prime time. Their gambit to align themselves with the MAGA crowd might be their only hope in elevating their careers.\n\n\tThe highlight was undoubtedly headliner Kid Rock, whose stage presence has elevated his career for decades. Starting energetically with bright lights, a big flag and a huge fur coat, it was fun for a moment to root for the guy taking a shot at the nearly-30-year-old rap-rock anthem “Bawitdaba.” Breaking it down with a big fedora and jean shorts, Kid Rock resembled someone’s fun-loving uncle four drinks deep in a Tampa karaoke bar. But it quickly became clear that the self-described “American Bad Ass” decided that lip syncing to the backing track was too square, so he just kinda…stopped. It was the night’s only truly unexpected moment.\n\n\tA classical duo then played a lengthy string interlude, and Kid Rock was reintroduced with his very serious government name, Robert James Ritchie, to play a very serious song, a cover of Cody Johnson’s “Til You Can’t.” It was a somber moment that likely sent audiences scrambling to pop open another beer.\n\n\tIt’s jarring to remember that, prior to MAGA, Kid Rock’s biggest political affiliation was stumping for Mitt Romney’s milquetoast 2012 presidential campaign. Yet in 2016 — the year after his singles last hit the Billboard Hot 100 — he rode hard for the loud-mouthed Trump. Since then, he’s been riding that wave of partisan relevancy, popping up at random functions to rap at puzzled congressmen and sing mawkish ballads to wealthy donors. Hey, the Trump family is making money off of this MAGA thing — why can’t other grifters with merch stores full of American flag gear jump on the train?\n\n\tMeanwhile, while the Turning Point show screamed about patriotism, Bad Bunny’s official show was filled with highlight after highlight of things that are exciting about America: A nation full of people who came here with talent and differences worth embracing. Even if you don’t speak Spanish, the visual storytelling evoked so many people living the American dream, from the workers in the opening segment, to elderly folks, female friendships, dancing, drinks and unabashed jubilation and unity.\n\t\n\n\tIgnore the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it shot of a few guys grinding on each other, and there was even plenty that the MAGA crowd would enjoy if they bothered to watch it: A real-life wedding! Beautiful women dancing! A great, big declaration of “God Bless America”!\n\n\tBut there was never going to be a good-faith effort to meet Bad Bunny’s show halfway. Like clockwork, Trump sent out a long message on Truth Social minutes after it ended, slamming it as quickly as possible. (Note to Trump: “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying” … he sings in Spanish, dude! Better take that cognitive test again.)\n\n\tIn the end, the final words shown during Bad Bunny’s performance were seen on a massive video screen: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.” \n\n\tThe final words on the Turning Point broadcast? “Get involved,” next to a QR code begging for more money.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Pokémon” is turning 30 this year, and the franchise is kicking things off with a star-studded (and Pokémon-filled) ad on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\n\tTrevor Noah, Lady Gaga and more celebrities reveal their favorite Pokémon and appear alongside animated versions of them in the commercial, titled “What’s Your Favorite?” Noah starts by walking down a sunny boardwalk and asking, “What’s my favorite?” He’s followed by actor Maitreyi Ramakrishnan (“Never Have I Ever,” “Freakier Friday”), who describes her favorite “jet-black” Pokémon while sitting in a make-up chair. Formula One driver Charles Leclerc appropriately says his favorite is “extremely fast,” rapper Young Miko likes her “limitless” Pokémon and Blackpink member Jisoo says hers is “so cute.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a recording studio, Lady Gaga reveals that her Pokémon “has a 12-octave vocal range” and “always finds a way to make it funny.” The camera pans over and the adorable, singing Pokémon Jigglypuff is sitting on the couch. The two huddle over a microphone and have a duet together, singing Jigglypuff’s iconic, self-named song that puts people to sleep from the “Pokémon” anime. \n\n\n\tThe rest of the stars are soon joined by their Pokémon partners. Noah is paired with the yellow, goofy duck Psyduck. “Every single time you met a new Pokémon, it felt like you met a new part of yourself,” he says. Luxray, the big, electric lion, naps on Ramakrishnan’s desk as she says, “he likes to sleep. Just like me.”\n\n\tJisoo likes Eevee for its ability to transform into various forms, and Young Miko adores the ghost Pokémon Gengar because “he’s mischievous but that’s sort of his love language.” Spanish soccer star Lamine Yamal is paired with the formidable legendary Pokémon Zygarde, and Leclerc reveals his partner to be Arcanine, the fast and powerful fire-type.\n\t\n\n\t“This is one of those moments where you get to reward your childhood self,” Noah told Variety about getting the call to be part of the Super Bowl ad. “‘Pokémon’ has been part of my life since the age of 9 or 10. It first came to South Africa in the Pokémon trading card packs. Kids went crazy trading them around. But it really blew up in my life with the Game Boy.”\n\n\tNoah said he played the original “Red,” “Blue” and “Yellow” versions of the first “Pokémon” video games,  and watching Psyduck in the anime TV show cemented the creature as his favorite. Psyduck, one of the main Pokémon used by Misty in the series, was a water-type who could use powerful psychic moves, but the timing and effectiveness of its abilities was disrupted by its constant headaches.\n\n\t“I feel like ‘Pokémon’ is a perfect allegory for society. It’s like this crazy world where you’ve got all these different characters who have their strengths and weaknesses,” he explained. “The reason I choose Psyduck is because I grew up as a neurodivergent kid, still figuring out what ADHD does in your brain. When I watched Psyduck in the TV show, it’s this little weirdo in a weird world. Psyduck can’t handle its brain. It’s trying to figure out how things work. It’s the most powerful, then the least powerful. It can literally freeze the whole world, levitate everything and throw it away, but then sometimes it can’t even walk out of a Poké Ball in the right direction. It was the classic tale of of the unlikely hero, the hero that we hope we all have inside us. We don’t expect it, and then against all odds you figure everything out, and you come out on top”\n\n\t“Pokémon” is celebrating its 30th anniversary with the new video game “Pokopia,” a life simulation game set for release on March 5 on the Nintendo Switch 2. The first-ever Pokémon outdoor facility, PokéPark Kanto, also opened this month in Tokyo.\n\n\n\n",

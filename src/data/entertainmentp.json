    "body": "\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\tNov 28, 2025 6:35pm PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOscar Predictions: Best Actor — Timothée Chalamet and Leonardo DiCaprio Solidify as Ethan Hawke Emerges as the Season’s Wild Card\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\tVariety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety chief awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEthan Hawke\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsabrina lantos\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Actor Commentary (Updated Nov. 28, 2025): Timothée Chalamet and Leonardo DiCaprio may appear in the second and third positions on the latest projections, but the two megastars remain the most secure bets for best actor nominations at this stage. \n\n\tChalamet’s work in “Marty Supreme” continues to generate some of his strongest career notices, while DiCaprio’s commanding turn in “One Battle After Another” has maintained a level of industry respect and consistency that’s difficult to shake. Both actors feel firmly embedded in the season’s narrative, reinforcing the sense that they’re headed toward another stop at the Dolby Theatre.\n\n\tBut the most intriguing development comes from Ethan Hawke, who is quickly emerging as this year’s potential spoiler. With four Oscar noms across acting and writing — and no wins to date — Hawke’s overdue narrative is beginning to take shape, bolstered by the growing popularity of Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” The idea of Hawke finally claiming his first Academy Award for a Linklater film adds an extra layer of serendipity. \n\n\tMeanwhile, other viable contenders and dark horses — including Michael B. Jordan’s powerful turn in “Sinners” and Wagner Moura’s acclaimed work in “The Secret Agent” — show the category remains competitive and fluid. \n\n\tAnd let’s not count out performances like Oscar Isaac (“Frankenstein”), Dwayne Johnson (“The Smashing Machine”), Jesse Plemons (“Bugonia”), George Clooney (“Jay Kelly”) and Jeremy Allen White (“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”) — who could all get boosts from Golden Globes. Critics Choice and/or SAG. \n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed category classifications are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Ken Woroner/Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: John Rosario/Chosen Family, LLC\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett C\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}})}();\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tThe Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade was no turkey for NBC. In fact, the broadcaster’s 2025 airing of the annual event is poised to record its biggest combined audience ever.  \n\n\tPer early Nielsen data, the 99th annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade pulled in 34.3 million viewers across NBC and Peacock, with 25.4 million viewers tuning in for the NBC telecast beginning at 8:30amET on Nov. 27. It should be noted that this Nielsen data is preliminary and will change when it becomes official in the coming days.\n\t\n\n\tStill, as it stands, this year’s parade is up 8% in total viewers over 2024, which managed to bring in 31.3 million combined viewers, which was itself a 10% increase over 2023’s 28 million viewers. Per NBC, the 2025 parade was also up 13% in the adults 18-49 demographic from 2024. NBC also claims that numbers were up across all demos, including a 20% increase in viewers under 25. \n\n\n\t“These record-breaking numbers signify how beloved this parade is to our audience and we couldn’t be more thrilled to begin the holiday season on such a wonderful note,” said Jen Neal, executive vice president of live events and specials for NBCUniversal Entertainment. “A profound thank you to Macy’s for their partnership in producing such an iconic event.”\n\n\tElsewhere on the day, the National Dog Show drew 12.8 million viewers, an increase of 4% over 2024. \n\n\t“This year’s record-breaking ratings are a powerful testament to the creative mastery, technical precision and storytelling ambition Macy’s offers,” said Sharon Otterman, chief marketing officer of Macy’s. “We are deeply proud to create entertainment that showcases today’s top talent and captures the cultural zeitgeist to connect with our audiences and consistently redefine the benchmark for televised and streaming programming. As we look toward the 100th Macy’s Parade, we remain dedicated to leveraging our unique capabilities to inspire wonder and joy for millions nationwide, ensuring our programs exceed expectations year after year.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLoeloe Hendra, whose feature debut “Tale of the Land” won the Fipresci Award at the Busan International Film Festival and screened at the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival, has a new project selected for the JAFF Future Project with “A Life Full of Holes,” a drama about Indonesian migrant workers.\n\n\tThe Indonesia production, directed by Hendra and produced by Indra Yudhitya, Dewi Umaya and Hendra through production company Onomastika Films, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\t“A Life Full of Holes” follows 17-year-old Sula, who carries the weight of a fractured family after her mother, Lastri, leaves to work as a migrant worker in Taiwan and her father abandons them for another woman. While dreaming of becoming a famous content creator, Sula works in a small shop and cares for her two younger siblings with almost no financial support.\n\n\n\tFear rises when an ambulance returns the body of a migrant worker and Lastri cannot be reached. After being evicted due to her father’s debts, Sula and her siblings move in with an uncaring uncle. Determined to find her mother, she seeks help from her boyfriend, Agus, and contacts Sri, a senior migrant worker, eventually securing a chance to go to Taiwan with Cak Nan, a musician invited to perform there.\n\n\tIn Taiwan, Sula discovers her mother is frail and hiding a painful secret: Lastri lives with an abusive migrant partner and has a child with him. After Lastri dies in a work accident, Sula returns home with grief and a new sibling. Though she rises to become a famous content creator, she can never restore her family’s lost unity.\n\t\n\n\tFor Hendra, the project represents deeply personal territory. “I grew up without parents. Since childhood, both my parents worked as migrant workers abroad,” the director says. “Behind the phrase ‘for a better future,’ lies an invisible wound — children who grew up without love and parental figures. This film is a voice for those who have long been silent, facing stigma and being labeled abandoned.”\n\n\tAs the child of migrant workers, Hendra knows what it feels like to be considered a burden and endure ridicule. “This story reflects me, and millions of other migrant children,” he says. “This film highlights that the struggle of migrant children is not only about waiting for their parents to return home, but also about surviving emotionally.”\n\n\tThe title serves as an analogy for the lives of migrant workers trapped in a cycle of hope and harsh reality: divorce, abandoned children, violence. “This film is important as a bridge to collective awareness, a tribute to those who survive, and an encouragement to create a more caring environment,” Hendra says.\n\n\tThe producers emphasized the urgency of the subject matter, noting that the film is rooted in the anxiety surrounding the realities of Indonesian migrant workers, which touch millions of families. Of the 9.2 million migrant workers, nearly half are illegal, facing the risk of abuse, exploitation and the loss of their human rights.\n\n\t“Behind these numbers are rarely heard stories: children deprived of parental love, families torn apart, and women struggling alone in a foreign land,” the producers say. “For Loeloe, this story is deeply personal — he is the son of migrant worker parents. This authentic perspective strengthens the story.”\n\n\tThrough an intimate and realistic approach, the film depicts the love, pain and longing within a migrant family — a universal issue. Production will take place in Java and Taiwan, involving local talent to maintain cultural authenticity.\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the filmmakers aim to connect with local investors and prospective international co-production partners who can support and collaborate in bringing the project to fruition. The film is planned to be shot in Indonesia as well as abroad, specifically in countries with the largest number of Indonesian migrant workers, with Taiwan as one of the key locations.\n\t\n\n\t“We hope this film opens important conversations about migration and becomes a voice for Indonesia on the international stage,” the producers say.\n\n\tThe project is currently in development. JAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAaron Wilson, whose debut feature “Canopy” premiered at Toronto, has a new project selected for the JAFF Future Project with “Under the Banyan Moon,” a cross-cultural romance set between Australia and Indonesia.\n\n\tThe Australia-Indonesia co-production, directed and produced by Wilson alongside Michael McMahon through production company Left-Handed Productions, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\t“Under the Banyan Moon” follows Stella, a 33-year-old schoolteacher from Adelaide, who is blindsided when her fiancé confesses something that completely unravels the future she thought they were building together. Shaken, she ends their four-year relationship and her best friend does what best friends do and takes her on an impulsive escape to Bali.\n\n\n\tA chance reconnection with her old university love, Elang, soon draws her onward to Yogyakarta — but instead of rekindling the past, Stella finds herself unexpectedly drawn to Aditya, Elang’s grounded and enigmatic best friend. As the two drift through the layered, vibrant world of Jogja, their quiet but undeniable connection forces them both to confront the difference between the comfort they’ve clung to and the courage to imagine a new kind of future.\n\n\t“This story comes from a deeply personal place, and has been quietly brewing since my first feature, ‘Canopy,'” Wilson says. “The idea of a romance that bridges Australia and Indonesia, one as close neighbours, has grown out of my decades moving between Australia and Southeast Asia, shaped by the people I’ve met and the cultural textures and relationships that have stayed with me.”\n\t\n\n\tAs a director and writer, Wilson is drawn to the small human moments that reveal who people really are. “This film is about celebrating that connection, leaning into the differences that make us intriguing and the quiet threads that bind us in ways we don’t always realise,” he says.\n\n\tWilson wants to convey the universality of connection through a vibrant cross-cultural romance. “It’s essential that we see the story from two distinct points of view, two people from completely different worlds who change each other in ways they never expected,” he says. “We don’t fall in love because life is perfect, we fall in love because something breaks, and someone sees us clearly in the vulnerable space that opens up.”\n\n\tWilson also wants audiences to feel the color, rhythm, energy and majesty of Adelaide and Yogyakarta, not just as exquisite settings but as two layered emotional characters that have never truly been brought together on screen. “The film is grounded in quiet human moments, but it’s designed as a grand, global love story,” he says. “It should be one that speaks to the heart, celebrates cultural exchange, and reminds us that love, in all its forms, remains one of cinema’s most universal languages.”\n\n\tProducer McMahon adds, “I was immediately struck by the work he had done in crafting a script that intimately explores the connections between Australia and Indonesia — and by his clear intention to partner with the right Indonesian creative collaborators for us to shape it further.” \n\n\tMcMahon emphasized the need for stronger cinematic collaboration between the two countries. “We are neighbours, yet our cinematic storytelling collaboration has remained limited,” he says. “It’s time for that to shift, and this cross-cultural love story between Stella and Aditya offers a genuine and compelling way forward.”\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the filmmakers hope to connect with an Indonesian production company that’s excited to join them on the journey and help shape a film they believe will resonate with Indonesian, Australian and international audiences alike. “Attending JAFF Market to pitch ‘Under The Banyan Moon’ gives us a rare and valuable opportunity to engage with a wide cross-section of the Asian screen industry, but especially in Indonesia, where so much of the film is set and where its emotional heart lies,” the filmmakers say.\n\t\n\n\tWith sales agents, financiers and creative collaborators present, JAFF Market offers an ideal environment to build the partnerships that will carry the project forward. “It’s also exciting to be part of an initiative supported by key organisations in South Australia and Indonesia, that reflects a genuine commitment to strengthening creative ties between our two countries and the region,” they say.\n\n\tThe project is currently in development. JAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n\n\tWilson’s “Canopy” is a nearly wordless World War II survival drama set in the jungles of Singapore. The film competed at the Shanghai International Film Festival and screened at major festivals including Toronto, Busan, Rotterdam and Taipei. His second feature “Little Tornadoes,” co-written with acclaimed Australian author Christos Tsiolkas, won the ADG Award for Best Direction in a Narrative Feature Film (Budget Under $1 Million) in 2022.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLast year’s inaugural JAFF Market served as an experiment – Indonesia’s first-ever film market testing whether the local industry was ready for such a platform. The answer, according to organizers, was an overwhelming yes.\n\n\t“We were humbled and grateful for the overwhelming response and engagement by so many different stakeholders in the film industry and realized that JAFF Market is indeed a much-needed platform for the industry to come together, share information and gain new insights, conduct business and expand the dialogue on the future of film in Indonesia and beyond,” says Linda Gozali, JAFF Market director.\n\t\n\n\tFor year two, organizers brought on Amar Bank as a sponsor. “We worked to streamline some of the shortcomings from year one, worked to get a sponsor from the finance sector, Amar Bank, to join us in the journey to enable the market to provide better infrastructure and maintained the elements of welcoming warmth of the Indonesian film industry and community,” Gozali says.\n\n\n\tThe JAFF Market isn’t positioning itself as a rival to established regional platforms like Busan’s Asian Project Market, Hong Kong’s FilMart, the Singapore International Film Festival’s market initiatives, QCinema’s project labs in the Philippines or Taiwan’s TCCF.\n\n\t“JAFF Market does not aim to compete but to work alongside each other’s initiatives,” says Yulia Evina Bhara, JAFF Market advisor. “We are partnering with Busan’s ACFM, Adelaide Film Festival, Tokyo’s TIFFCOM, Korea’s KOFIC, Malaysia’s FINAS, Asian Film Alliance Network, France’s CNC and more to build more bridges and ties to complement and learn from them.”\n\t\n\n\t“JAFF Market is the new kid on the block but we have a very strong local market that is still growing rapidly and have an appetite for connection, collaboration and new talents so we believe that JAFF Market can be the gateway for Indonesia to work closer within the local ecosystem and connect the international interest in the local markets,” Bhara adds. “As Busan grew alongside with the rise of Korean cinema, JAFF Market wants to be a part of the growth of Indonesian cinema to the world.”\n\n\tLorna Tee, JAFF Market advisor, identifies systemic challenges across the region. “Southeast Asia is such a vibrant and diverse geographical and cultural arena, filled with exciting talent in all departments but there are still fundamental gaps in knowledge, the ecosystem and the industry as a whole where areas of talent development, financing, legal, marketing and distribution, audience development, critical film discourse and policy to safeguard and enhance the film industry may be lacking,” Tee says.\n\n\t“Institutional support is inconsistent as the government in the region has varied interests and agenda but we hope to engage the stakeholders in the region to come together during JAFF Market to work on being collaborative instead of competitive within the region as the market is home to more than 700 million people, a sizeable market filled with a large proportion of young people, and the efforts to connect will enlarge the footprint of the films and filmmakers,” Tee adds.\n\n\tGozali notes changing patterns in this year’s submissions. “We are seeing a trend toward more family films, animation, thrillers and new directors infusing more humor and comedy into films as the industry finds ways to attract new audiences and engage on relevant subjects that are hot socio-political themes in the region and possibly globally too,” she says. “Producers understand the need to be ahead of the game and be the ones to shape the appetite of the audience instead of catering the same tired troupes but there is work to be done to pave the way for new genres and voices – convincing the investors, exhibitors and talents – and JAFF Market would also like to enable more programs and events that would enable the producers in that direction.”\n\n\tThe second edition has refined its approach to deal-making. “We are inviting and engaging in a more diverse group of international players that are interested in Indonesia so there are many more new international presence as it is important to not just reach new audiences, but new possibilities in partnerships and deal making,” Bhara says. \n\t\n\n\t“We curated more personalized meetings for our participants, guests and exhibitors. Our content market, project market, talent labs, market conferences, and plaza stage are all structured to cater to different segments of the film industry and we brought on new partnerships to present awards and additional opportunities to engage with local and international partners while utilizing JAFF Market both as a platform for dealmaking but also for promotion and greater engagement with the media and industry as a whole,” she adds.\n\n\tTee emphasizes that producers need to arrive properly prepared. “Many producers who are less experienced in the markets arrive expecting deals to be done with just a premise or a proposal but without a clear understanding of the value of the projects in the market, be it for the financing, sales and distribution or festivals, it would be a waste of time,” she says. “Producers need to understand the package that the market requires and not just how they envision the film to be.”\n\n\tOn navigating budget pressures and financing volatility, Gozali sees the market as a connector. “JAFF Market moves alongside all the changes in the global industry by connecting the vibrant Indonesia film industry with each other and with the world,” she says. “There is enough resources in the market but for the right projects and talents and the programs at JAFF Market aims to help shape the right projects with the right target audience.”\n\n\t“JAFF Market is working closely with all the different government agencies from Indonesia and abroad, to enhance the understanding by the agencies and organizations tasked to support the film industry but ultimately, the policy must look at long term and sustainable infrastructure for all programs and not be ad hoc on the support mechanism,” Gozali adds. “We are also engaging with the corporate, finance and high net worth individuals to bring in new perspectives on financing. And we are focused on pushing further beyond just producing films, but how can the films reach an audience, locally and globally, onto as many distribution channels as possible.”\n\n\tBhara credits Yogyakarta’s atmosphere as an asset. “Jogja provides a casual and artistic landscape that allows for business to happen in a less frantic manner,” she says. “JAFF Festival also has built a strong following over the past 20 years and the attraction of being at the festival is an appeal we will continue to cherish.”\n\t\n\n\tGozali sees year two’s attendance increases as a vote of confidence. “Year two has seen increases in both the number of exhibitors, accreditation, media attendance, and more enquiries by different sectors to be involved in the JAFF Market – and we are excited to not just see the numbers increase, but the trust and faith placed by the film industry with their enthusiasm, participation and contribution,” she says. “We can only project long term vision if we have a long term support by the industry and the authorities where we can connect the national and international, corporate and community and filling in the gaps that are present in the industry so that JAFF Market becomes a solid platform for business of films and more.”\n\n\tBhara outlines the obstacles ahead. “The biggest challenges of the market stem from the lack of long term institutional support, a year round dedicated experienced and enabled team, and the ability to engage with all the different stakeholders locally and internationally to encapsulate as many aspects of the film ecosystem as possible,” she says. “The JAFF Market management is aware of areas where we can further develop and enhance the effectiveness to be a practical, rewarding and fun platform for all our partners, sponsors, exhibitors, filmmakers, producers, talent and the media to enable everyone to benefit fully in their time here – we are working round the clock with a dedicated team to ensure the best experience for all.”\n\n\tTee acknowledges geographical constraints while emphasizing steady development. “As a film market, we can only develop alongside the growth and potential of what the industry, and the city of where it is located,” she says. “Yogyakarta is not easily accessible to international flights and connections so it remains a hurdle to attract the international industry – as we are still taking baby steps to fine tune the role and positioning of JAFF Market, we are more focused on building a strong foundation for JAFF Market alongside the festival.”\n\n\tFor now, the market remains film-focused. “We must admit that we have yet to explore much beyond films but it is something we would definitely welcome for the future programs of JAFF Market,” Tee says.\n\n\tThe JAFF Market takes place alongside the 20th Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival (JAFF). \n",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Tazewell, the Oscar-winning costume designer behind “Wicked,” has joined the creative team of “Rose Pandanwangi,” an Indonesia-Philippines co-production about celebrated seriosa singer Rose Pandanwangi, the filmmakers revealed to Variety.\n\n\tThe project, directed by Razka Robby Ertanto (“Yohanna”) and produced by Chelsea Islan, Ertanto and Kristine de Leon through production company Summerland, was selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\tTazewell’s involvement marks a significant coup for the biographical drama, bringing his award-winning expertise to a story that spans post-war Indonesia and the Netherlands. The designer won the Academy Award for best costume design for his work on “Wicked.” \n\n\n\tSet in post-war Indonesia, “Rose Pandanwangi” follows the eponymous seriosa singer whose life mirrored the turbulent birth of a nation. Born in wartime Makassar with a voice powerful enough to move soldiers to tears, Rose navigated shifting empires, identities and expectations. After years of exile in Rotterdam, she returned to Jakarta determined to pursue her dream, rising from factory worker to national icon while balancing motherhood and ambition.\n\n\tThe film chronicles Rose’s career as it flourished even as her marriage quietly unraveled, the gap between domestic life and artistic calling widening beyond repair. In Jakarta’s postwar art circles, she found kinship with painter Sudjojono, whose fierce devotion to truth and freedom reignited her own. When political darkness descended and Sudjojono vanished during the anti-communist purge, Rose faced a world where voices like hers were forced into silence.\n\t\n\n\tFor Ertanto, the project represents a deeply personal artistic mission. “Her voice pierced through time, but her story was left behind in history,” the director says. Seriosa music, Indonesia’s unique adaptation of the Western art song, profoundly shaped his artistic identity.\n\n\tBrought to the archipelago by the Dutch through German Lieder as early as the 16th century, seriosa evolved into a refined and expressive form that fused Western vocal techniques with Indonesian languages, values and nationalistic themes. In the 1940s, Rose Pandanwangi emerged as a leading figure in the genre, embodying technical excellence as well as deep cultural pride and resilience.\n\n\tErtanto’s journey toward the film began with a visit to an exhibition of paintings by Sudjojono, a pioneer of Indonesian modern art. Known for his evocative portrayals of women, the painter’s works drew Ertanto in, but it was the quiet presence of Sudjojono’s wife, Rose Pandanwangi, who appeared again and again on his canvases, that sparked the director’s interest.\n\n\t“In her gaze, I sensed a story waiting to be told,” Ertanto says. “That was the moment I knew I had to make this film.”\n\n\tProducer de Leon (“Agapito”), who met Ertanto at Cannes, was immediately drawn to his passion and precision. “He is a meticulous director with a deep love for Southeast Asian history and a genuine commitment to telling women’s stories with nuance and care,” de Leon says.\n\n\tAs a Filipina producer and mother, de Leon felt a profound connection not only to the story but also to Rose herself as a woman, artist and mother navigating the balance between creative ambition and personal responsibility.\n\n\t“‘Rose Pandanwangi’ is more than a biopic of an iconic Indonesian seriosa singer; it is an intimate and layered portrait of a woman who refused to be silenced by war, patriarchy, displacement or politics,” de Leon says. The film follows Rose across continents and decades, from Japanese-occupied Indonesia to post-war Europe to her eventual return home where she became a national icon.\n\n\tThe project is currently in development. JAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe newly refurbished version of “The Beatles Anthology” has been rolling out on Disney+ over a period of days this week, with a newly commissioned Episode 9 premiering on the service Friday night. It gives the epic 1995 docuseries more than just a new edit and a fresh set of paint: it gives it an all-new finale that feels sweeter than the way the original project faded out with the gradual breakup of the most popular band of all time. And fans aren’t likely to mind the extra hour’s worth of either added context or additional sentiment.\n\t\n\n\tWith the new episode about to premiere, its director, Oliver Murray, told Variety about his intentions for this fresh finale. He’s the same man whom Apple Corps drafted to a short movie about the “final Beatles single,” “Now and Then,” when that was unveiled two years ago. Even though he was not yet a teenager when the original “Beatles Anthology” first aired in prime time 30 years ago, Murray was considered the right candidate to draw together footage that was shot at the time with Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. The three ex-Beatles became active Beatles once again at that point in drafting old John Lennon home demos to expand upon for “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love,” songs that were added to the “Anthology” albums also being released in ’95. And they even attempted, briefly, “Now and Then,” although it took till 2023 for that third number to come to fruition, but it at least gets foreshadowed in the new Ep9. \n\n\n\tThe British filmmaker says he gave himself the mission to humanize the three musicians as they reassessed their legacy in the ’90s, while also recognizing that their story is “modern, 20th century folklore (that) doesn’t age, in the same way that something like ‘The Lord of the Rings’ doesn’t age.” (The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\t\n\n\tThe Apple people were clearly pleased with your work on the “Now and Then” film, to assign you this… assuming that it indeed came after you’d finished that, and you weren’t working on them simultaneously.\n\n\tI was in L.A. doing press for the “Now and Then” short film with Jonathan Clyde [the director of production for Apple Corps], and the last day of us being there, I was asked to come and see him in an office in Santa Monica, and he said, “We’re doing the ‘Anthology’ — redoing it, re-releasing it — and it would be great if there was an extra episode. Would you take time over Christmas to have a think about what that might look like? Look at the materials, talk to the film archivist and photo archivist at Apple and watch material and come back with a treatment.” So in-between my Christmas dinners and trips to see family, I was scribbling all sorts of ideas, with a loose brief that it would be great if we could keep going through the ‘90s sessions we used for “Now and Then.” In making that, we’d only scratched the surface of the “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love” material, so I knew that we would be able to get that in. But I really wanted to kind of go above and beyond and use episode 9 as an opportunity to work untethered from the chronology of 1-8.\n\n\tWe had 1-8 sorted, and I knew what that looks like .because they’re doing a faithful reconstruction of it. So the gift of 9 was that then we get to go back with a more contemporary sensibility and discuss how the band felt. How it felt to be a Beatle was the north star of episode 9.\n\n\tI also liked the idea of making the “Anthology” feel a bit more cyclical. The themes of the brotherhood and the way that the band find each other in episode 1 is reflected in how they sort of rebuild their friendship in episode 9. So it comes full circle. Rather than episode 8 being the finishing point, where they break up, it was an opportunity to lift the kind of heavy fog of what was going on at the very end in 1970 and finish it in a much more positive light.\n\n\tIt’s interesting that your episode, episode 9, ends in the mid-‘90s, with the footage of making “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love” and the promotional interviews for the original “Anthology.” There are no contemporary interviews or references to what came after, and it stops in time there just as surely as the original series stopped in 1970. It almost feels as if your episode could have been cut together as a final episode 9 in 1995, if there’d been time or willingness to consider that.\n\t\n\n\tYeah. Every time I shut the door in the edit suite, I sort of imagined myself saying, “Right, OK, it’s 1995.” And I could have gone and spoken to Ringo or Paul. But I didn’t really like the idea of Ringo in 2025 talking about an interview that he gave in 1995 about something that happened in 1965. It was all too nebulous to do that.  Given that the “Anthology” is sort of this artifact that you have to put white gloves on to mess with, I wanted to take the gloves off and make something that had more modern rhythms or feel. But I still wanted it to feel that it was tethered to something that was ultimately made 30 years ago … I wanted to approach it thematically, where we could go anywhere we liked, when we’re talking about memory or brotherhood or that kind of tumbler jar existence they lived in. But I also did want to stick to that old mantra of “arrive late, leave early” in the story.\n\n\tObviously I didn’t know it was gonna play out like this, but to do “Now and Then” first was kind of interesting. Because you could almost put “Now and Then,” the short film, on the end as episode 9.5m in a way, because it all tethers together. I really loved getting Paul in there in episode 9 saying, “You know, ‘Now and Then’ maybe hasn’t gone away [as a possibility to complete someday]. It’s the Beatles — you never know.” You actually also see George say, “I think we should leave it, and we’ll come back to it,” and knowing what happens to George, that’s a very sad moment.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul McCartney being interviewed for “The Beatles Anthology”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Corps Ltd.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut yeah, it was important to me that the pool of material we were working from had a time and a place. It was made in 2025, but the world that we’re absorbed in is from anywhere between ‘91 and ‘95.\n\n\tI was excited by as well by the fact that they’re interviewed in Studio Two [at Abbey Road]. everyone wants to see new Beatles stuff. Unseen stuff is always the holy grail. I couldn’t believe that there was the interview of the three of them at Studio Two that was unseen. Because it’s great from 1 to 8 to see them talking individually, where it was then montaged together, curated by a team of producers. But in 9, you see the three of them talk about the things that they want to talk about together — also having seen each other’s interviews by then, which is kind of cool, because they start to understand that each of them saw the story differently.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRingo Starr at Studio 2 at Abbey Road Studios for “The Beatles Anthology” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Corps Ltd.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd Ringo says as much. He says, “Look, this isn’t my ‘Anthology.’ It’s our ‘Anthology.’” He’s just saying that it’s all of our stories and even the individual Beatles themselves can’t get their arms around their own legacy. It’s this big, sprawling, modern folklore, almost, that morphs and adapts. And another reason to stick to material no newer than ‘95 was because their story does adapt. It’s almost like the Beatles are bigger than ever. It’s been kind of lifted out of the vinyl records and tape cassettes into pixels and streams, and it’s in the feed, if you like. It’s morphing again. It’s not just nostalgia. It seems to be able to evolve into a very sort of immediate and resonant music for young people.\n\n\tSome of this material was seen on the extras that were on the extras on the 2003 DVD boxed set. Some of us either never watched those extras or have forgotten them. But in this episode 9, when I saw that charming moment where the three guys were singing and “Thinking of Linking,” one of the first original songs the Beatles ever started dreaming up, I searched and realized that had first appeared to the hardcore fans among the DVD extras. But even the stuff that has previously been issued in some fashion was never edited together to really tell a linear story people would sit down and watch, so there’s been a need for that, for decades. For those of us who aren’t hardcore enough to keep track of these things, is most of the material you used for this episode stuff that’s already been out there as extras, or did you actually dig up stuff that hadn’t been seen in any form?\n\n\tI think it’s about 50/50. So, 50% unseen. But I think it cannot be understated how much work has gone into the restoration, and the work that Park Road Post [Peter Jackson’s company] have done. Yeah, sure, there’s a whole load of DVD rips and that kind of thing, which is fine. But the fact that this thing has been scrubbed up the way it has makes all the difference. And I got to go back to the rushes of that kind of stuff. So for the 50% of the stuff [that has been seen in some form], we’re seeing familiar material in a different context. And your example, “Thinking of Linking,” that has been properly put up. You know, it deserves to be on a premium streamer like Disney because of all the work that’s gone into properly finishing off that material. It’s not ideal when this stuff sort of gets leaked onto YouTube, because yeah, people have seen some of it, but they were seeing a proxy version of what it should be.\n\t\n\n\tWhen the three of them are there in the ‘90s singing quasi-Beatles versions of “Blue Moon of Kentucky” or “Ain’t She Sweet,” those are wonderful moments that kind of hark back to the more casual moments of the “Let It Be”/”Get Back” sessions where they were messing around with oldies, except here, 25 years later, it’s more relaxed. We don’t have to be looking for clues as to what kind of a mood they’re really in.\n\n\tOn the one hand, I wanted to make sure there was plenty of stuff in there for the lifelong Beatle fans that want things they haven’t seen or heard. But I also wanted to think about a younger audience coming to this. Because 9 sits outside of the chronology. So if you wanted to go straight to 9 as a kind of intro to the Beatles, there’s an element of it that I think serves that purpose. And the stories about the haircuts and the boots, and an overview of just how great they were live and how inventive they were in the studio… I was trying to make sure it was accessible for someone that’s coming to the Beatles’ story for the first time, but yp also have loads and loads of nice bits with all sorts of meaningful story depths. The trick was not to land in the middle, where it didn’t really do either of those things.\n\n\tAlso, the north star of the piece being about how they felt being a Beatle means that sometimes that they have those great moments of pride in what they did. And there’s also a lot of melancholy in it. Because I think being a Beatle, especially beyond the operational years, was probably, it’s fair to say, something that especially George kind of fell in and out of love with — you know, constantly being branded with a badge you can’t take off, which is “George Harrison: Beatle.” So that all plays into it, all the different colors of their personalities and the way that they wore that their Beatle tag.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGeorge Harrison being interviewed for “The Beatles Anthology”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Corps Ltd.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWe think of Paul and Ringo as the happiest or most enthusiastic Beatles, historically. John’s no longer around at that point this is being filmed, so in his absence, we think of George as the most skeptical one. Watching it, I think we’re kind of looking at George and thinking, “Are you really happy to be here? Have you reconciled yourself with this?” And it seems like it’s the George we know and love who’s kind of taking almost an outsider view of things at times, but he does happy to be there and a willing participant. So that kind of reconciliation feels good to watch, I think, especially for people who’ve watched “Get Back” or “Let It Be” and aren’t sure how to think about the Beatles’ latter days. Ultimately, it’s just funny that 50-plus years later, we’re still thinking about these relational dynamics between these guys, and how each one related to the other three.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s amazing to me as well that even though there’s such a long amount of time — a couple of decades — where they really didn’t spend time together at all, that when they get back into a room, when they go to Abbey Road and the three of them sit there, those dynamics that we identify from the interviews are alive and well and have just been lying dormant for two decades. Because when they’re back sitting there, Paul is still the one racing ahead, full of ideas, full of exuberance to create. And then I think George, through those ‘90s sessions, is kind of occupying a Lennon-esque position as well, or at least filling some of that void, energy-wise. And Ringo sits there and says very little, and then he suddenly comes out with the absolute cherry on the cake they’re making, which is either funny or particularly poignant. And those dynamics clearly were kind of forged in the hours and hours that they spent together through teenage years and into the Beatles.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRingo Starr, Paul McCartney and George Harrison relax on the grounds of George’s house at Friar Park filming material for “The Beatles Anthology,” as seen in the new episode 9. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Corps Ltd.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThat’s why I think it’s this kind of full circle moment, that music brought them together when they were kids and music brought them back together in the ‘90s. When you see them sitting there on the grass at George’s estate just playing a tune, it kind of makes me think that that’s such a lovely way to end the definitive Beatles story — much more in keeping, I think, with their legacy than for it to just sort of slowly drift away in 1970.\n\n\tWe’re 30 years out from that footage now — which, it’s hard to fathom, is further out than “Anthology” was out from 1970 in 1995. For those of us of a certain age, it’s sort of a time warp. Because in ‘95, we thought of the Beatles as being really old and far along. But they look really comparatively youthful in this footage, even as we also register that they are middle-aged men.\n\n\tYeah, I agree. Well, I mean, it resonates for me. I was 10 when the “Anthology” came out the first time around. I remember watching it because my family had just moved house and it was just a sea of boxes everywhere, and they got the TV and made a makeshift TV stand out of boxes. And it was one of those moments where my parents just said, “Right, this is what we’re watching,” and in those days, there was no TV anywhere else; that was the house TV, and it went on for everyone to watch. And I was just as skeptical as you imagine a 10-year-old would be to watch whatever your parents want to watch. But then this story of these young working-class kids who were your classic, almost cliched kids with a dream that went on to conquer the world… it grabbed me, in a timeless way. Because certainly in Britain, and I think probably all over the world, it’s modern, 20th century folklore. It doesn’t age in the same way that something like “The Lord of the Rings” doesn’t age. The techniques it was made with may age, but I think it’s got the same sort of lasting quality.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOliver Murray, director of the new episode 9 of “The Beatles Anthology”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Lopez\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSo I wanted to try and humanize them as much as possible, because that’s what I think that I was most drawn to about the sessions that they record in Paul’s studio for “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love.” I think they feel youthful because they’re doing something that they were doing together as teenagers. So they’re having a lot of fun and kind of almost reverting back to 20 years ago. They don’t seem like men in their fifties, curmudgeons regurgitating old stories. It’s a whole new chapter for something that they left behind when they were still in their twenties. It blows my mind that George says he was 24 when he made “Sgt. Pepper.” At that age I was probably trying to impress a girl by making a bong from a potato or something stupid like that.\n\n\tIt now exists like a cultural language that’s passed down from one generation to the next. And for those of us that weren’t there first time round, it doesn’t get old, like good literature or something doesn’t age. It’s kind of Shakespearean in its longevity.\n",

Tim Walz didn’t waste a second clapping back after Donald Trump hurled an ugly slur his way -- firing off a simple, deadly one-liner that landed hard.\n      \n    \n          In an X post Friday, Walz fired back with, \"Release the MRI results\" -- a shot aimed at Trump, who’d just hopped on Truth Social late Thanksgiving night to unload a marathon immigration rant ... taking swipes at Minnesota’s Somali community and tossing the nasty r-slur at Walz.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Walz hit back by poking at Trump’s own health mystery -- that hush-hush MRI he reportedly got during an October stop at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n      \n\n          The White House claimed he underwent \"advanced imaging\" and some \"preventive assessments,\" bragged his labs were \"exceptional,\" and even said his \"cardiac age\" was 14 years younger ... but never actually explained what any of those scans were for.\n      \n    \n          Trump’s late-night screed was also packed with racist jabs at Rep. Ilhan Omar and claims that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Somali refugees were overrunning Minnesota.\n      \n    \n          For the record ... Census data puts the state’s Somali population somewhere roughly between 61K and 80K -- nowhere near the numbers Trump claims.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                Tim Walz\n              \n                          \n                Social Media\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

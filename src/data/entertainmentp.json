This is what we’ve been saying to each other for the past week or so — but nevertheless, they have persisted. Yes, yes, we know, Peak TV has peaked, and yet, there is still so much television coming our way in 2026. And this list of 53 is nearly all scripted series, save for major reality events like the 50th season of “Survivor” and the Emmy-winning competition “The Traitors.” Note: This introduction breaks down a tonnage of 2026’s undated highlights by streamer, so if you want to just skip to the list, just click here!\n\n\tWhereas in past years, it’s become a trend to play hide-the-ball with release dates during the competitive Emmys window in the spring, this year has been different; there’s already a pretty full schedule into March and April. January is as full as we can remember, with returning hits — HBO Max’s Emmy-winning “The Pitt,” Shonda Rhimes’ Netflix smash “Bridgerton” — sure to dominate conversation, with franchise offshoots such as HBO’s “Game of Thrones” spinoff “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” and Paramount+’s “Star Trek: Starfleet Academy.” (Yes, there are also new shows that aren’t based on IP! See below.)\n\n\tAnd then there are the vast undated masses. For HBO and HBO Max, we know the third seasons of “The Comeback” and “Euphoria” are coming in March and April, respectively, but we don’t know exactly when yet. “Half Man,” Richard Gadd’s follow-up to his Emmys behemoth “Baby Reindeer” (a co-production with the BBC) will be coming during the Emmys window, surely, as will the final season of “Hacks” and the limited series thriller “DTF St. Louis” (starring Jason Bateman, David Harbour and Linda Cardellini). HBO will also have “Rooster” (starring Steve Carell), a new Larry David show, “Lanterns,” “House of the Dragon” returning in the summer — and more.\n\n\tThe Netflix tsunami will continue, with the returns of the anthology satire “Beef” (starring Carey Mulligan and Oscar Isaac this time), “Ginny & Georgia,” “The Gentlemen,” “The Witcher,” “3 Body Problem,” “The Hunting Wives,” the final season of “Outer Banks” and much, much more. We’ll also be treated to new versions of “Little House on the Prairie” and “Man on Fire,” and classic literary adaptations of “East of Eden” (with Florence Pugh, Christopher Abbott and Mike Faist) and “Pride and Prejudice” (with Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden). Also among the streamer’s 2026 offerings are Dan Levy’s new comedy “Big Mistakes,” the conclusion of the much-loved “Heartstopper” series with “Heartstopper Forever,” the Rachel Weisz-led “Vladimir” and the Jed Mercurio-created thriller “Trinity” (with Gugu Mbatha-Raw and “Bodyguard” star Richard Madden, working with Mercurio again). The Duffer brothers will venture into post-“Stranger Things” content for Netflix with the horror drama “Something Very Bad Is Going to Happen” and “The Boroughs” — and yes, the animated “Stranger Things: Tales From ’85.” Not detailed here, but get ready for it: 4,000 offerings of Netflix reality series, true crime docs and unscripted competition shows like “Clue,” based on the game.\n\n\tDeep breath after the Netflix paragraph! Apple has announced a lot of its spring programming, but among its un-dated series are another season of “For All Mankind,” the Anya Taylor-Joy-led limited series “Lucky” and (presumably!) “Ted Lasso” Season 4. (And fingers crossed Jessica Chastain’s thriller “The Savant” finally gets on the schedule!) Change is afoot at Paramount+ under David Ellison’s new regime, but soon-to-depart mega-producer Taylor Sheridan will have “The Madison,” “Dutton Ranch” and “Nola King” all heading our way in 2026. Since Showtime exists in name only now, the final seasons of “Yellowjackets” and “The Chi” are now Paramount originals, and will close out their runs there (as will “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds”). “Lioness,” “MobLand,” “Dexter: Resurrection,” “The Agency” and “Colin From Accounts” will return as well.\n\n\tAs for Amazon, its Prime Video service will debut “Bait” (starring Riz Ahmed, which premieres at Sundance), the highly anticipated live action series “Spider-Noir” led by Nicolas Cage, “Blade Runner 2099,” the “Legally Blonde” prequel “Elle” and “House of Spirits” — you can file those three under IP adaptations we’re fine with, and yes, we’re hypocrites! “Every Year After,” based on Carley Fortune’s romance novel “Every Summer After,” and “Off Campus,” based on Elle Kennedy’s popular book series, are among Prime Video’s other 2026 dramas.\n\n\t(Almost there, we swear, we’ve just got Peacock, Hulu and FX to go.)\n\n\tFirst up, Peacock! The streaming home of Bravo’s reality hits and NBC shows (and its library) is coming off the success of Sarah Snook thriller “All Her Fault,” and in 2026, they’ll continue to lean into genre programming. There’s the family drug-running drama “M.I.A.” (from “Ozark” co-creator Bill Dubuque), the long-gestating “Friday the 13th” series “Crystal Lake” (with Linda Cardellini), thriller “The Good Daughter” (Rose Byrne and Meghann Fahy play sisters) and a team of all-stars for the Elin Hilderbrand adaptation “The Five-Star Weekend”: Jennifer Garner, Regina Hall, Chloë Sevigny, Gemma Chan and D’Arcy Carden are the core cast. Peacock is also the destination for a little thing we call the Olympics (the opening ceremony in Milan is on Feb. 6).\n\n\tOver on Hulu, the Disney-owned streamer will be subsumed into Disney+ at some point this year, but it’s still offering plenty of originals, including the eagerly awaited “The Testaments,” Margaret Atwood’s sequel to “The Handmaid’s Tale” and Mindy Kaling’s new comedy “Not Suitable for Work.” Sure to be highlights also are “Furious,” Elizabeth Meriwether’s retelling of the 1987 Debra Winger movie “Black Widow” (not that Black Widow!) starring Emmy Rossum, and “Phony,” a mystery starring Connie Britton and Sam Nivola. Scripted shows “Only Murders in the Building” and “Rivals,” and reality series “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” and “The Kardashians” are set to return with new seasons.\n\n\tFor FX, Season 18 of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” Season 2 of “Adults” and Season 5 of “The Bear” will all be on the network this year. And though Ryan Murphy’s “The Beauty” is dated below, his three (3!) other FX shows are not: anthology “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette,” “The Shards” (with Bret Easton Ellis) and lucky Season 13 of “American Horror Story,” with its huge, all-star cast. Limited series “Cry Wolf,” created by Sarah Treem, and starring Olivia Colman and Brie Larson, is on offer this year, as is the untitled “Snowfall” spinoff, which follows the original show’s characters Wanda and Leon.\n\n\tOK, thank goodness, here’s the list!\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHarlan Coben’s Run Away\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Ben Blackall/Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJan. 1, Netflix Cast: James Nesbitt, Ruth Jones, Minnie Driver, Alfred Enoch\n\n\tStreaming now is Netflix’s annual New Year’s Harlan Coben mystery! The limited series, adapted from Coben’s 2019 novel, tells the story of a dad, Simon (James Nesbitt), who seems to have a perfect life until his daughter runs away. Upon finding her strung out on drugs, he does everything he can save her — only to learn she’s not alone, untangling a whole new world of violence. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Medicine\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Fox\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJan. 4, Fox (after the NFL game; Tuesday timeslot begins Jan. 6.)Cast: Josh Charles, Abigail Spencer, Annie Potts, Josh Segarra, CreeBased on the British series “Doc Martin,” the procedural focuses on very blunt surgeon Martin Best (Charles), who leaves his successful job in Boston and becomes the general practitioner in a small town on the East Coast where he spent summers as a child.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBeast Games\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: David Scott Holloway/Prime Video\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJan. 7, Prime VideoHosted by Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, Season 2 of the game show will feature 200 competitors (100 of the strongest in the world and 100 of the world’s smartest) battle it out for a $5 million prize. Plus, Jeff Probst makes an appearance for a “Survivor” crossover.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Masked Singer\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Fox\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJan. 7, FoxNick Cannon returns once again as host for Season 14, with panelists Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, Robin Thicke and Rita Ora. For the first time, this season will be called “America’s Insider,” in which artist Kylie Cantrall will share behind-the-scenes hints and clues.

    "body": "\n\tPaul Mescal is looking to take a break from the spotlight after the past few years put his career into overdrive. \n\n\tAfter breaking through in the film world with “Aftersun” in 2022 — which earned the 29-year-old Irish actor his first Oscar nomination — Mescal made his blockbuster debut with 2024’s “Gladiator II” and starred in both indie romance “the History of Sound” and buzzy awards contender “Hamnet” in the past year. Next up, he’ll play Paul McCartney in Sam Mendes’ four anthology Beatles films, due out in 2028 — but hopes to keep a low profile until then, as he told The Guardian in an interview alongside his “History of Sound” co-star Josh O’Connor.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m five or six years into this now, and I feel very lucky. But I’m also learning that I don’t think I can go on doing it as much,” Mescal said. When asked if that means “rationing” his workload, he replied: “I think so. I’m gonna have to start doing that. For sure.” However, Mescal added that “rationing doesn’t necessarily mean less.”\n\n\n\t“It means learning that films like ‘The History of Sound’ take more out of the well,” he clarified. “You can’t keep going back and expect to consistently deliver something you’re proud of. What that rationing looks like, I don’t know. I miss being on stage, so I might have a time when I’m only doing theatre for a couple of years. I also have different priorities in my personal life that I want to attend to.”\n\n\tBut is Mescal worried his burgeoning career might lose momentum if he disappears for a while? “That’s the great fear,” he said. “But what’s the alternative? I don’t want to resent the thing I love.”\n\t\n\n\tBesides the Beatles biopics — in which he’ll star alongside Harris Dickinson as John Lennon, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison and Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr — Mescal has nothing else on his docket besides occasionally filming Richard Linklater’s “Merrily We Roll Along,” which is shooting over the span of two decades as its actors age. However, he’s currently in the thick of an awards campaign for “Hamnet,” Chloe Zhao’s historical drama in which he plays William Shakespeare. The film has earned rave reviews and sparked Oscars buzz for Mescal and his co-star Jessie Buckley.\n\n\t“Once I’ve finished promoting that, I hope nobody gets to see me until 2028 when I’m doing the Beatles,” Mescal said. “People will get a break from me and I’ll get a break from them.”\n\n\tRead Mescal and O’Connor’s full Guardian interview here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAudiences flocked to cinemas to say goodbye to the Upside Down over New Year’s. \n\n\tMovie theaters earned between $25 million to $28 million by showing the finale to Netflix‘s “Stranger Things,” sources tell Variety. It’s very hard to get an exact number, because tickets came with vastly different pricing. AMC and Cinemark charged $20 for a concession voucher, for example, while Regal Cinemas and other circuits charged $11, a nod to the supernatural character played by Millie Bobby Brown.\n\t\n\n\tA spokesperson for Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this week, the Duffer Brothers, the show’s creators, announced on social media that 1.1 million vouchers had been sold. AMC said it generated $15 million from the more than 753,000 people who bought food and beverage credits. The chain had slightly more than one-third of the total theater count. \n\n\n\tThe results are good news for theaters, which are having a robust holiday season after a disappointing year that saw domestic ticket sales hit roughly $8.9 billion, a 1.5% increase over the middling 2024 results and far below the $11 billion that the business generated prior to COVID. But 2025 did close with some welcome successes such as “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” “The Housemaid” and “Marty Supreme.”\n\n\t“Stranger Things,” a homage to ’80s fantasy adventures such as “The Goonies” and “E.T.,” has become one of the most popular shows in Netflix’s history. It ended its five-season run with a super-sized, two-hour finale that debuted on New Year’s Eve. Netflix has often had a complicated relationship with exhibitors, who have refused to show some of the streamer’s movies because they do not adhere to traditional theatrical windows. Many cinemas are concerned about Netflix’s plans to buy Warner Bros., fearing the company would shorten the amount of time between a film’s debut and its bow on home entertainment platforms.\n\t\n\n\tBut on Friday, AMC chief Adam Aron hinted that the streamer will look for more ways to have its programming shown on the big screen. \n\n\t“At AMC, our company is excited about the prospect of taking more Netflix content to theater-goers, and I might add that the working relationship between the two companies in our two recent projects has been easy, creative, and seamless,” Aron said in a statement. “It should come as no surprise then that our two companies already have actively commenced discussing what additional Netflix programming can be shown on AMC’s giant screens.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJill Scott is making her return to music with the announcement of her sixth album, “To Whom This May Concern,” releasing on Feb. 13 via the Orchard.\n\n\tThe album, which is Scott’s first in over a decade, will feature collaborations with Ab-Soul, J.I.D., Tierra Whack and Too Short, as well as production from DJ Premier, Adam Blackstone, Om’Mas Keith, Camper, Andre Harris, Trombone Shorty, Seige Montracity, Eric Wortham, DW Wright and VT Tolan. To coincide with the album announcement, Scott has released its first single “Beautiful People.”\n\t\n\n\tIn an interview with Million Dollaz Worth of Game in late December, Scott spoke about some of the themes of the album, discussing the songs “Pay You on Tuesday” and “Don’t Play.” “It’s a lot of living in this album,” she said. “It’s a lot of revelation. Musically, it’s a full spectrum. Had some wonderful musicians come in. I feel touched all over, literally… The musicianship on this project and the people that gravitated towards it, I couldn’t be happier. I couldn’t have ever even imagined who is on this album.”\n\n\n\tThe R&B singer last released her fifth album “Woman” in 2015, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. In 2025, she celebrated the 25th anniversary of her first album, “Who Is Jill Scott?: Words and Sounds Vol. 1,” and gave a special “Jill Scott & Friends” performance at Essence Festival in July. \n\n\tSince her last album, Scott has been building her Hollywood resume with acting roles on the CW’s “Black Lightning,” “First Wives Club” and, most recently, a guest appearance on “Abbott Elementary.” She will next appear in Tyler Perry’s “Why Did I Get Married Again?” for Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTony Dokoupil, who starts Monday as anchor of the “CBS Evening News,” spoke out on New Year’s Day about where he thinks the press has gone wrong, and vowed that starting Monday, the audience would come first — ahead of advertisers, politicians or corporate interests including CBS owners Paramount Skydance. \n\n\t“People do not trust us like they used to,”he said in a video on CBSnews.com and posted to social media.\n\n\n\t“On too many stories, the press has missed the story,” he continued, “And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates, and not the average American. Or, we put too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\t\n\n\tThe former “CBS Mornings” host said he has felt that “the most urgent questions simply weren’t being asked” by current TV news journalists. \n\n\tDespite his long career in the news, the incoming anchor’s statement Thursday was notable in that it seemed to agree with critics of mainstream media such as President Trump, implying journalists aren’t doing their jobs competently. In the statement, Dokoupil said he had talked to people around the country who questioned coverage of topics like Hilary Clinton’s emails or the president’s fitness for office. \n\n\tDokoupil, who was previously at MSNBC, The Daily Beast and Newsweek and joined CBS in 2016, could have a challenge ahead of him. When he was named to the “CBS Evening News” post by new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, Variety‘s Brian Steinberg wrote, “The job comes with a difficult mission attached. The program, which has ties to legendary personnel like Walter Cronkite, has been mired in third place behind ABC’s ‘World News Tonight’ and NBC’s ‘NBC Nightly News’ for years.” Dokoupil is likely aligned with some of Weiss’ views, such as her pro-Israel stance, Steinberg wrote.\n\t\n\n\t“I report for you,” Dokoupil promised, “which means I’ll tell you what I know, when I know it and how I know it. And when I get it wrong, I’ll tell you that too.”\n\n\tDokoupil finished his statement by promising to uphold the truth asking viewers to hold him accountable, “It also means I’m going to talk to everyone, and hold everyone in public life to the very same standards. After all, I became a journalist to talk to people. I love talking to people about what works in this country, what doesn’t, and not only what should change, but the good ideas that should never change. I think telling the truth is one of them.\n\n\t“Hold me to it,” he concluded. \n\n\tWatch his message below:\n\n\"On too many stories, the press has missed the story. Because we've taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.\"That changes now.

    "body": "\n\tThe TV series “Tehran” returns to Apple TV next week even though production wrapped back in 2023. What caused the postponement of this critically acclaimed drama depicting dueling espionage efforts between Israel and Iran was never specified by the streaming service. But sensitivities regarding the real-life battles that have ravaged the Middle East are suspected of being a factor in the delayed return of “Tehran,” which is co-produced by Israeli public broadcaster Kan 11.\n\t\n\n\tBut that’s far from the only sign of disruption in Israel’s entertainment business these days. And while the struggles currently gripping the country’s film and TV industries aren’t entirely attributable to the pall the Netanyahu administration has cast over just about anything with Israeli or even Jewish connections, it’s an issue to be sure.\n\n\n\tThe cloud of controversy that has enveloped Israel since Oct. 7, 2023 was a much-discussed topic at this year’s inaugural Jerusalem Sessions event, held last month in the country’s capital city. Conversation touched on a chilling effect being felt in the marketplace of an important industry export: local TV shows into other global territories.\n\n\tOn the latest episode of the Variety podcast “Strictly Business,” hear from some of the industry pros who came to Jerusalem Sessions from the U.S., Europe and the host country to share their insights.\n\n\tThe Israeli TV industry has always prided itself for punching far above its weight in its ability to sell shows beyond its borders. First there was success in formats adapted to other languages in other countries, like the HBO series “In Treatment” or Showtime’s “Homeland” and “Your Honor.” More recently, Israel demonstrated its ability to capitalize on the increasingly global market for content opened up by the explosion of streaming services. TV shows like “Fauda” and “Shtisel” that were never intended to play outside of Hebrew-speaking market found second and third lives in other countries in subtitled versions.\n\t\n\n\tBut the Israelis say this business is not as strong as it used to be, Productions with an Israeli provenance are feeling the pain regardless of whether the content is remotely controversial or even pertinent to the war. Plus there are other challenges: the Israeli industry may not have any bigger problem than the one its own government represents. The Israeli broadcaster KAN faces an existential threat of its own under fire from the Netanyahu administration. And the Israeli film world is no less beleaguered, with the government threatening to withdraw crucial funding sources when movies that dare to stray from the party line are recognized.\n\n\t“Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tThe Asian Film Awards Academy has modified the format of its upcoming 19th edition, eliminating competitive categories and the red carpet ceremony in favor of a scaled-back event focused on special honors following last year’s deadly Hong Kong fire.\n\n\tThe academy announced that the 2026 ceremony, scheduled to take place in Hong Kong, will present special awards “in a dignified and minimalist manner” rather than proceeding with its traditional competitive format.\n\t\n\n\tThe format adjustment follows what the academy described as “the significant incident in Hong Kong last year and its impact on the community.” The decision aligns with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government’s postponement of official celebrations and its recommendation for a restrained approach to public events in the wake of the tragedy.\n\n\n\t“This is a well-considered decision,” said Dr. Wilfred Wong, chairman of the Asian Film Awards Academy. “We believe that, in the current environment, adopting a solemn and minimalist format for the awards ceremony is the most appropriate arrangement. At this time, we have chosen to honor filmmakers in a restrained manner as a mark of respect to all sectors of the community.”\n\n\tThe academy emphasized that while the ceremony format has changed, its core mission remains intact. The organization expressed gratitude to filmmakers and partners for their support of the modified edition, stating that it will “continue to work closely with all sectors to contribute to the future development of Asian cinema.”\n\n\tThe Asian Film Awards, which recognize excellence in pan-Asian filmmaking, have been presented annually since 2007.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney+ has acquired the Irish narrative short film “Brown Bread” following a successful festival run that began with its world premiere at the Galway Film Fleadh in 2025.\n\n\tThe film is now streaming across Disney+ platforms throughout Europe.\n\n\tWritten and directed by Shaunagh Connaire, “Brown Bread” marks the narrative debut from writer/director Shaunagh Connaire, the two-time Emmy-nominated Irish journalist who has produced documentaries for the likes of the BBC and PBS Frontline and also served as communication director for George and Amal Clooney‘s Foundation for Justice.\n\t\n\n\tThe film — described by Connaire as a “modern twist on the Irish emigration story” — is led by Emmy-winning actress Fionnula Flanagan (“Lost,” “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes”), Katie McGrath (“Merlin,” “Supergirl”) and Dermot Crowley (“Luther: The Fallen Sun,” “The Death of Stalin”).\n\n\n\tInspired by Connaire’s own experience of being unable to travel to Ireland from the U.S. to attend her godmother’s funeral, the story follows Áine (McGrath), a woman whose return to Ireland from New York to attend her godmother’s memorial mass stirs up old tensions, grief, and unspoken affection in her rural family home. Flanagan stars as Betty, a proud but emotionally restrained mother struggling with her daughter’s return, while Crowley plays Áine’s father Seamus.\n\n\t“Having my first scripted film acquired by Disney so early in its life is so wonderful,” said Connaire. “I wanted to tell a story rooted in Irish life but expansive enough to travel. To see that belief reflected in a global acquisition like this is incredibly affirming, and a reminder that small, specific stories can resonate far beyond where they begin.”\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Julie Ryan through her production company MK1 Studios, the film was shot entirely in Connaire’s hometown of Longford, Ireland. Funding was provided by Creative Ireland (Longford), with additional support from Sam and Amelia Dennigan and Anne Heraty, who served as Associate Producers. The film is distributed by Network Ireland.\n\n\t“From the outset, we felt Brown Bread was a very special film, not because it was trying to be big, but because it was precise, truthful and emotionally brave,” said Ryan. “We were always thinking globally, and Shaunagh has an extraordinary instinct for character and tone that allows stories rooted in place to travel. Seeing a film made in rural Longford now finding a home with Disney reinforces our belief that stories rooted in Irish life can resonate well beyond their place of origin.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter a bullish year bolstered by local blockbusters, the 2025 French box office dropped by 13.6% to 156.79 million admissions, according to the National Film Board (CNC) and Comscore reports. Based on the average ticket price of €7.45 ($8.75), the box office grossed an estimated $1.17 billion.\n\n\tWhile the market share of French films rose to 37.7% — which is “unrivaled anywhere else in Europe,” per the CNC — the box office suffered from the absence of a local tentpole and was essentially dominated by Hollywood fare. Disney took the first three slots of the year with “Zootopia 2,” which topped the chart with 6.18 million admissions, followed by “Lilo & Stitch” (5.10 million) and James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire & Ash” (4.58 million). Then came Apple and Plan B’s Brad Pitt racing drama “F1: The Movie” (3.31 million) and Universal’s “Jurassic World: Renaissance” (2.97 million).\n\t\n\n\tThe biggest local hit of 2025, “God Save the Tuche” — the fifth installment in Pathé’s comedy franchise — sold around 3 million tickets and was the only French film which made it in the top 10 (in the sixth spot). Four local films appeared in the top 30, notably Cedric Jimenez’s ambitious sci-fi thriller “Dog 51.” That’s a stark contrast from 2024, when the top three French films in 2024 (“A Little Something Extra,” “The Count of Monte Cristo” and “Beating Hearts”) had garnered 25 million admissions combined.\n\n\n\tInternationally, France was the market that “showed the most severe year-on-year decline in 2025,” Comscore said in its report, noting that markets such as Germany, China and Australia recorded growth. The U.S. and Canada saw a slight increase in box office revenue, while the U.K. ended the year on the same level as in 2024. But the CNC flags that France still hosts Europe’s leading nation of moviegoers. Germany closed the year at roughly 85 million admissions, followed by Italy at 67 million and Spain at 65 million, per the CNC.\n\t\n\n\tThe breadth of local films released throughout the year contributed to the high market share. Several French titles posted solid runs; for instance Ken Scott’s “Once Upon My Mother” crossed 1.4 million admissions, Franck Dubosc’s “Un ours dans le Jura” reached around 1.4 million and Thierry Klifa’s “The Richest Woman in the World” starring Isabelle Huppert sold nearly 900,000 tickets.\n\n\tAs it often is in France, auteur-driven cinema remained a bright spot, delivering sleeper hits and surpassing expectations. The CNC cited the strong performance of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” Oliver Laxe’s “Sirât,” Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent,” Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident,” Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” Ugo Bienvenu’s “Arco” and Hafsia Herzi’s “The Little Sister.”\n\n\t“2025 was a mixed year for theatrical cinema, with a declining market due to a lack of unifying films and surprise hits like in 2024, but with a sharp rebound at the end of the year, driven by a strong offering of films, particularly American ones,” said Gaëtan Bruel, president of the CNC. “This result should not obscure the relevance of our model in the long term: a network of theaters with unparalleled density that allows a wide variety of films to reach all audiences, and a market share for domestic films that makes France an exception in Europe and around the world.”\n\n\tThe year ended on a rebound, powered by a cluster of U.S. pics. Besides “Zootopia 2″ and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried’s erotic thriller “The Housemaid” (released in France by Metropolitan Filmexport) proved to be a late-year hit, released on Dec. 24 and drawing 1.1 million admissions in just a week; as well as Vincent Munier’s wildlife documentary “Le chant des forets” with 360,000 admissions.\n\n\tBruel is optimistic about the prospects for 2026. Addressing the healthy performance of director-led films, he argued that French audiences are lured by “original and daring offerings.” He added, “From this point of view, 2026 promises to be a very rich year.”\n\n\tAmong the most promising 2026 releases cited by the National Exhibitors Federation (FNCF) are: Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey,” Steven Spielberg’s “Disclosure Day,” Andrew Stanton’s “Toy Story 5,” Antonin Baudry’s “De Gaulle” and Philippe Lacheau’s “Marsupilami.” There’s also Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part 3,” Ruben Ostlund’s “The Entertainment System is Down,” James Gray’s “Paper Tiger” and Alejandro González Iñárritu’s “Digger” in the pipeline. \n\t\n\n\tTop 10 movies at the French box office (in admissions) in 2025: \n\n\t“Zootopia 2”: 6.18 million\n\n\t“Lilo & Stitch”: 5.10 million\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire & Ash”: 4.58 million\n\n\t“F1: The Movie”: 3.31 million\n\n\t“Jurassic World: Renaissance”: 2.97 million\n\n\t“God Save the Tuche”: 2.95 million\n\n\t“A Minecraft Movie”: 2.66 million\n\n\t“Mufasa: The Lion King”: 2.64 million\n\n\t“How To Train Your Dragon”: 2.55 million\n\n\t“Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning”: 2.46 million\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for the series finale of “Stranger Things,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tMatt and Ross Duffer, the creators of “Stranger Things,” didn’t expect the review bombing that took place after the series’ penultimate episode dropped on Netflix on Christmas Day — but they’re still extremely proud.\n\n\tThe three episodes brought the season’s Rotten Tomatoes score down to 56% — the lowest by far, with Season 4 sitting at 89%, Season 3 at 86%, Season 2 at 90% and Season 1 at 96%. “The Bridge,” the seventh episode, during which Will (Noah Schnapp) came out as gay to his friends before battling Vecna, became the lowest-rated episode of the series with a score of 5.6 out of 10 and 96,000 reviews.\n\t\n\n\t“The coming out scene is something we’ve been building to for nine years now. It was a really important scene for us, and a really important scene for Noah — not just from a thematic point of view, but also a narrative point of view,” Ross Duffer tells Variety on Jan. 1 during a lengthy postmortem following the series finale. “This show has always been about our characters overcoming evil, and in order to overcome this evil, Vecna, in so many ways, represents all the dark thoughts and the evil of society. And for our characters to overcome that, it really becomes about embracing themselves, and then also embracing one another and coming together.”\n\n\tThe scene was “the final step in Will’s journey, and Will is, in so many ways, the key to defeating Vecna,” adds Matt Duffer. “Volume 1 is really about self-acceptance, right? I mean, that’s sort of step one. And then step two is Will is talking to Robin — it’s something that he wants to do. He’s trying to figure out how to come out, and he knows that he needs to do that, and that that’s the final step for him. And he finds the courage to be able to do it. And it’s really the ultimate fuck you to Vecna. That was the intention.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX © 2025\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile the episode was torn apart online, that doesn’t change how the creators feel about it.\n\n\t“We’re proud of the episode, and we’re proud of the scene, and proud of Noah, who gave a really brave, very vulnerable performance,” says Ross. \n\n\tThe scene was extremely important for Schnapp, Matt says, and the three of them have stayed close amid the mixed reviews.\n\n\t“I think that’s where Ross and I were most sensitive, was Noah — because of how close to home this hit for him,” he says. “And our goal was to make sure that he was comfortable and happy with the scene. And when he was, we felt good about it. I’ve been texting with him a lot, but texting with him specifically after that scene and after that episode aired. And he’s in a really good place. He’s very proud of the scene, and we’re proud of the scene.”\n\n\tBut still, even in 2025, the online hate surprised them. “No is the honest truth,” Matt says when asked whether he’d anticipated the homophobic backlash. “Because it is, as Ross said, something we’ve been building for a really long time. I always say, Ross and I are many things, but subtle is not one of those things!”\n\n\tAfter the episode dropped, Matt also told Variety that the duo “spent longer writing” the coming out scene than any other — and that it was all about collaboration.\n\n\t“We were so concerned about getting it right. There were a lot of things that went into it. I mean, we’re definitely nervous about how it’s going to go over with everyone. But not as nervous as we were handing it over to Noah. Because ultimately, it needed to resonate and be truthful for him. We really were writing it to and for Noah. He wrote us sobbing after he read it. So it really worked and resonated for him, which was great,” he said. “On the day, frankly, there wasn’t really much direction at all. Noah spent a long time — I mean, months — prepping for that scene, that moment. Luckily, that script was done well in advance. I know he did a lot of work himself… And most of what’s in there is the first take.”\n\n\tKate Aurthur contributed to the reporting of this story.\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Break Down the Series Finale• The Duffer Brothers on Noah’s Coming Out Scene• Noah Schnapp on His Emotional Coming Out in Volume 2• Stranger Things Finale: How It Ended, Who Survived• Director Shawn Levy on Key Moments of Final Season• Noah Schnapp on His Powers Revealed in Volume 1\n",

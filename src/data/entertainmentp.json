    "body": "\n\tTa-ta, Tiva: The “NCIS” story of Anthony “Tony” DiNozzo and Ziva David ends here, at least for now. Paramount+ and CBS Studios announced Friday that “NCIS: Tony & Ziva” has been canceled after one season, and won’t be back for a Season 2.\n\n\tThe “NCIS” spinoff starred Michael Weatherly and Cote de Pablo, reuniting as their fan favorite “NCIS” characters for a new series taking place around a decade after they and their characters left the series mother ship. \n\t\n\n\t“We feel incredibly lucky to have had the chance to play these characters once again and to tell the next chapter of Tony and Ziva’s story,” Weatherly and de Pablo said in a joint statement. “Our deepest thanks go to our extraordinary cast, crew, writers, directors, and producers, and to our partners at CBS Studios and Paramount+ who helped make this dream a reality. But most of all, we want to thank the fans around the world who joined us on this adventure and finally got to see Tony and Ziva find their happily ever after.”\n\n\n\tThe 10-episode spinoff series debuted on Sept. 4 and opened solid for the streamer — but then saw a rapid 51% drop-off across the first three episodes, according to Luminate data. \n\n\tIn his review of the show, Variety‘s Chris Willman — who covered “NCIS” for much of its early run — raved that it was the best of the many “NCIS” spinoff shows. “Certainly none of the others have tried like this one does, let alone succeeded, at recapturing the overriding wit that set ‘NCIS’ apart from all the other procedurals when it came into its own in its salad days in the 2000s,” Willman wrote. “At last, it’s a take on the show that doesn’t shrink away from the fact that 90% of the audience is there for the relationships, not the murder-of-the-week.”\n\t\n\n\tAlong with de Pablo and Weatherly, “NCIS: Tony & Ziva” starred Amita Suman, Maximilian Osinski, Julian Ovenden, Nassima Benchicou, Lara Rossi, Isla Gie, Terence Maynard and James D’Arcy. \n\n\tHere’s the logline for the show, which remains available on Paramount+: “‘NCIS: Tony & Ziva’ picks up after Ziva’s supposed death when Tony left the NCIS team to go raise their daughter. Years later, Ziva was discovered alive, leading her to complete one final mission with NCIS before she was reunited with Tony and their daughter in Paris. Since then – and where we find them in ‘NCIS: Tony & Ziva’ — Tony and Ziva have been raising their daughter, Tali, together. When Tony’s security company is attacked, they must go on the run across Europe, try to figure out who is after them and maybe even learn to trust each other again so they can finally have their unconventional happily ever after.”\n\n\tWeatherly first began playing Tony on “NCIS” when it launched in 2003, and he left as a regular cast member after Season 13 in 2016. As for de Pablo, she first appeared in Season 3 and left full time after Season 11 in 2014. \n\n\tJohn McNamara served as series showrunner and executive producer. EPs also included de Pablo, Weatherly, Laurie Lieser, Christina Strain, Shelley Meals, and Mairzee Almas. The series comes from CBS Studios.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAntonia Thomas has joined the cast of “Dig,” Peacock’s upcoming comedy series created by Amy Poehler and Mike Schur.\n\n\tAccording to the series logline, “Dig” follows “four women working at an archeological dig in Greece who are at wildly different crossroads in their lives. When the team uncovers a long-buried secret with the potential to rewrite history, they find themselves at the center of a high-stakes international conspiracy.”\n\t\n\n\tThomas will play Clare, who “oversees the dig site’s lab/museum as head preservationist.

Her other TV credits include “Suspect” on the UK’s Channel 4, Steve McQueen’s “Small Axe” on Amazon Prime Video, “Lovesick” on Netflix, “Still Up” on Apple TV, . Up next, she will appear in BBC’s “Two Weeks in August” and Britbox’s “Agatha Christie’s Tommy & Tuppence.” She is repped by Gersh, B-Side, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Lucy Popkin.\n\n\t“Dig” is executive produced by Schur for Fremulon; Kate Arend and Jordan Grief for Paper Kite; writer J.J. Philbin; director Dean Holland; Morgan Sackett, Dave Becky and David Miner for 3 Arts; and Sharon Jackson for Ocean Avenue. Kate Myers is co-executive producer.

    "body": "\n\tBowen Yang is exiting “Saturday Night Live” in the middle of his eighth season on the show. His last turn as a cast member will be this Saturday’s episode, which is being hosted by his “Wicked” co-star Ariana Grande with Cher as musical guest.\n\n\tRepresentatives for Yang and “Saturday Night Live” declined to comment.\n\n\tYang first joined “SNL” as a writer in 2018 for Season 44. He joined the cast as a featured player during Season 45, and was promoted to join the main cast beginning with Season 47. His work on the show earned him nominations for the supporting comedy actor Emmy in 2021, 2022, 2024 and 2025.\n\t\n\n\tHis exit follows the major exodus that came ahead of Season 51, which premiered on Oct. 4. Ego Nwodim, Heidi Gardner, Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, Emil Wakim and John Higgins all recently departed the late night sketch show. Higgins’ departure was announced in tandem with his fellow Please Don’t Destroy member Martin Herlihy moving to the writing staff while Ben Marshall moved to the featured cast.\n\n\n\tIt’s atypical, though not unprecedented, that Yang is leaving “SNL” before Season 51 is over. Notable midseason exits in the show’s history have included Cecily Strong, Molly Shannon, Dana Carvey and Eddie Murphy — plus Norm Macdonald, though Macdonald’s departure was due to being fired.\n\n\tBesides “SNL,” Yang is best known for the pop culture podcast “Las Culturistas,” which he cohosts with his friend and fellow comedian Matt Rogers. From 2020 to 2023, he starred in “Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens.” In addition to “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good,” Yang’s film credits include “The Wedding Banquet” (2025), “Dicks: The Musical” (2023″ and “Fire Island” (2022).\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tKevin Costner and ABC are delivering a second dose of holiday tidings with a repeat airing of the actor’s new Christmas special.\n\n\t“Kevin Costner Presents: The First Christmas” originally premiered on Dec. 9 on ABC, though it was interrupted in some parts of the country by coverage of President Trump’s rally from Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. Now, viewers have a second chance to watch the two-hour special Saturday, Dec. 20 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\n\n\n\tBilled as a family-friendly “docudrama,” Costner’s Christmas special takes viewers through the Nativity story, with the “Yellowstone” actor narrating reenactments of Mary and Joseph’s journey to the manger, interspersed with interviews with historians and Christian scholars.\n\n\tYou can watch the Kevin Costner Christmas special on TV through your local ABC affiliate. Don’t have cable? You can livestream “The First Christmas” as it airs Saturday by using a live streaming service like DirecTV or Fubo.\n\n\tDirecTV lets you watch 90+ live television channels over the internet and its channel packages include a live ABC feed. Grab a five-day free trial to DirecTV here and use it to watch “The First Christmas” online free without cable. \n\n\tYou can also try Fubo, which offers more than a hundred live TV channels as part of its packages. Fubo also has a live ABC feed, and the streamer is currently offering a seven-day free trial that you can use to livestream Costner’s Christmas special online for free. Fubo’s free trial includes free DVR so you can record the program to watch back on-demand later.\n\n\tIf you miss the re-airing Saturday, you can also watch “Kevin Costner Presents: The First Christmas” on Hulu and Disney+. You can still take advantage of the Disney+ bundle deal, which gets you both streamers for a single monthly price of $12.99/month — a 46% savings versus paying for each service individually.\n\n\n\tAccording to an ABC description, “Kevin Costner Presents: The First Christmas” explores the “extraordinary journey of Mary and Joseph as they navigate the hardships, trials and triumphs surrounding Jesus Christ’s birth, offering an inspiring way to experience the true meaning of Christmas.”\n\n\tThe new holiday special isn’t Costner’s only TV project these days: the actor has been tapped to host and executive produce a three-part docuseries titled “Yellowstone to Yosemite” for Fox Nation, set to premiere in February.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter roaming the world with Expedia, Jeff Tobler is coming home to the warm comforts of television. Variety has learned that Tobler has been tapped by Universal Television Entertainment to return to the land of the small screens and TV peaks as senior VP of awards and integrated communications.\n\n\tIt’s a homecoming of sorts for Tobler, who began his career as a coordinator at NBC Entertainment before moving on to a lengthy career at Warner Bros. Television Group. Most recently, he was VP and head of global media and talent relations, plus influencer marketing, at Expedia Group Brands — which includes Expedia, Vrbo and Hotels.com.\n\t\n\n\tAt Universal, Tobler will be tasked with coming up with campaign strategies by finding ways for divisions across the company to collaborate. He will start his new gig on Jan. 19 and report to Tracy St. Pierre, executive VP, communications, Universal Television Entertainment Group.\n\n\n\t“I’ve known Jeff for over 20 years, and from day one I’ve been inspired by his creativity, innovative approach to campaigns and the long‑standing relationships he’s built across our industry,” St. Pierre said in a memo to staff. “We started together at NBC Entertainment as coordinators before his career path took him to Warner Bros. Television, so it’s a full‑circle moment to welcome him back to the NBCU family. Culture and collaboration are core to how we work, and Jeff shares those values.  He also brings a rare blend of awards experience, a communications background, and a track record of integrated collaborative campaign storytelling.”\n\t\n\n\tBesides NBC, Warner Bros. and Expedia, Tobler’s career includes a stint as chief marketing officer at Ava DuVernay’s Array, where he handled marketing, press strategy, social and brand partnerships across Array Filmworks, Array Releasing and Array Alliance. While there, he worked on partnerships including one with Ben & Jerry’s, which led to DuVernay’s “Lights, Caramel, Action” ice cream flavor.\n\n\tHe joined Array from Warner Bros., where he was senior VP, TV publicity, communications and social media at Warner Bros. Worldwide Television Marketing. While there, he oversaw publicity and social for more than 70 scripted series, as well as relationships with key producers like Chuck Lorre, Greg Berlanti, John Wells and JJ Abrams. His credits include countless launches and awards campaigns, helping create DC FanDome and helping launch Array Crew. He also started the studios first “Social Media Code of Conduct” to protect talent and creators.\n\n\tSt. Pierre points out some of Tobler’s memorable campaigns: “From the ‘Friends’ 25th anniversary global celebration (yes, the orange couch at landmark sites including the Grand Canyon) to conceiving and producing the sold out SXSW Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon panel, and the history-making ‘The Big Bang Theory’ handprint ceremony at the TCL Chinese Theatre, which marked the first time a TV series was honored, Jeff has consistently turned shows into shared cultural events,” she wrote. “He also champions meaningful moments like Chuck Lorre’s series ‘Mom’ being included at the 2016 White House Champions of Change honors because of the show’s impact in raising awareness about substance abuse and the challenges of recovery.”\n\n\tTobler first joined Warner Bros. in 2011; before that, he was at The CW and its predecessor, The WB (which he joined in 2004; coincidentally, he hasn’t aged since then). Tobler also serves on the boards of non-profit organizations Little Free Library, which aims to expand global book access, and Array Alliance, which focuses on social justice through art. Somehow he also found time to co-found the app Social Agent.\n\n\t“Jeff is a trusted mentor and advisor to executives, talent, and colleagues from across the industry,” St. Pierre added. “In this role, Jeff will partner with me and our comms leaders to look for opportunities to collaborate across divisions and create integrated campaign strategies.  He shares our vision of creating conversation‑leading moments throughout the year for our series and elevating the profiles of our brands and our creative partners.  I look forward to his creativity and ingenuity powering our efforts across the Universal Television Entertainment portfolio while continuing to build on the culture of collaboration that makes this team special.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Episode 8 of “Pluribus,” now streaming on Apple TV. \n\n\tCarol’s 40 days and 40 nights of solitude have come to an end. And in this week’s episode of “Pluribus,” she makes the most out of her reunion with Zosia, her post-apocalypse concierge and last remaining friend. \n\n\tThe two, played by Rhea Seehorn and Karolina Wydra, face off in croquet, get a couple’s massage and gaze at the stars. Carol is enjoying herself, and it might feel like the before times, but she is still clear-eyed about who her companion is. (“It’s like playing cards with fucking Google,” she bemoans after losing to Zosia in a round of Spit.)\n\t\n\n\tThe Others — aka the 7 billion people morphed into one hive mind — make progress in winning Carol over. But they go a bit too far when they rebuild her favorite diner from scratch, flying an old waitress out from Florida for a nostalgic, coffee-pouring charade. That night, Carol begins to unravel, telling Zosia, “You are trying to distract me … It’s manipulative bullshit because you know I haven’t given up.” She adds, through tears, “Someone has to put the world right, even if it means you all leave me again.” And then, pouncing on a moment of vulnerability, Zosia leans in to kiss Carol, mirroring the initial outbreak of the mind virus and blurring the pre-established lines of consent between the Others and the Old-Schoolers, as the “Pluribus” producers call them. Carol kisses her back, hungrily, and Zosia wakes up the next morning topless in her bed.\n\n\n\tIs the kiss — the most striking act of intimacy Carol has experienced since the death of her wife — manipulative? Or is it an expression of unconditional love? What are Zosia’s intentions, besides the Others’ stated goal of doing anything to make Carol happy? \n\t\n\n\tSurely, many viewers will be having this debate, so Variety got into it with Wydra, who — with a big smile on her face — pushes back on the “M”-word and reaffirms Zosia’s unconditional love for Carol.\n\t\n\t\tAfter leaving Carol for 40 days, why do the Others fulfill her request that they return?\t\n\n\tBecause we love her. The Others truly, genuinely love all of the Old-Schoolers unconditionally. We love them equally, the same. I think we come back because we want to be there for her. We want to make her happy, and we don’t want to see her suffer. And, also, we want her to experience what we’re experiencing.\n\t\n\t\tThat is the ultimate goal, to convert her.\t\n\n\tThat is the ultimate goal, because of the biological imperative. It is very important to us that she experiences what we experience. And we believe that once she experiences it, she’ll understand why we needed to share it. I find that fascinating, and we had conversations about this on set: “Well, are they manipulative?” It depends on whose perspective you’re looking at.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s like feeding a dog a pill wrapped in salami. You know the dog needs the medication, and you are manipulating the dog in order to help it.\t\n\n\tSure, yes. I mean… yes, I agree with you.\n\t\n\t\tI can tell you don’t like the word “manipulative,” though.\t\n\n\tYes, because “manipulation” has such a negative connotation. You’re working somebody to get what you want without their awareness. It has that negative tone, and the Others don’t see it that way. When I was building the character of Zosia, the thing I had to work on most was standing by a belief so strongly that you couldn’t easily be bent to the other side. I had to create Zosia as someone very protective of that belief. What I’m trying to say is, to Zosia, it’s not manipulation. But if you ask Karolina, of course it’s manipulation.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about the kiss. This struck me as the first blatant act of manipulation. But then again, the Others sending Zosia in the first place could be considered manipulation, because of her resemblance to Raban.\t\n\n\tI hear what you’re saying, but Carol is lonely, and Raban is someone she created — someone she might find comforting. It came from her imagination. She always wanted to create this female character, and Zosia is someone she might enjoy being around because it feels familiar after losing her wife. That’s where the Others are coming from. They’re coming from a place of love for Carol, wanting her to feel good, safe, and like she has someone to ease the loneliness.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSo, why does Zosia kiss Carol at that moment, when she’s riled up? It could be read as the Others trying to distract her.\t\n\n\tOn set, we talked about this big shift that happens with Zosia in the way she behaves with Carol. It starts to feel different, like there are more colors there. You start to wonder: is there an evolution happening with the Others? Do they start to take on more individuality? You begin to see more of that — more individuality coming through.\n\t\n\t\tShe develops a sense of humor, too.\t\n\n\tThere are moments, like when we play croquet, where you see she has more banter with Carol. She jokes with her, similar to how Helen jokes with her in Episode 1 — that kind of sarcastic “oh, you poor artist” tone. That’s the first time we see Zosia being sarcastic, saying things like “you suck” and having that kind of rapport that Carol would enjoy.\n\n\tWe were talking about whether Zosia is developing a personality or whether she’s performing for Carol. And then Vince came in and brought up the kiss. We were asking, “Is Zosia actually falling in love with Carol?” And Vince said, “They’re just really nice people, and they just want to make Carol happy.”\n\t\n\t\tSo there’s no human being rising to the surface?\t\n\n\tNo. They see that Carol is struggling. You have to understand, they have the knowledge of the most emotionally intelligent person on Earth. She looks at me a certain way where I go, “I think she wants a kiss. I think this would make her happy.”\n\t\n\t\tWhy does Carol tell Zosia to stop saying “we” and start saying “I”?\t\n\n\tWell, it gives her individuality.\n\t\n\t\tBut it seems almost self-destructive for Carol to convince herself that Zosia is an individual like her.\t\n\n\tI think the isolation in Episode 7 is a huge turning point for Carol. If you’re in isolation for 40 days, your mind starts to play tricks on you. You’re not well. And that’s when she calls us back. I think Carol comes to a place of realizing, “I need somebody.” She goes to see Diabaté, and he basically doesn’t want her around. The Old-Schoolers don’t want her around. She doesn’t know anything about Manousos, and she has no idea he is coming. She’s really alone. Carol is pushed to the brink, and when I come back we have these moments together — the spa, playing cards, croquet. She wants to disassociate.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou, Karolina, have a fascinating task as an actor on this show. You have to embody a character who has enough personality to charm Carol, but you also have to not really be a person but a conduit for all human knowledge.\t\n\n\tBut Zosia is not a robot, right? She is a person that is altered, with all these things within her.\n\t\n\t\tYes, but she does not have individual thoughts and feelings. Did you receive any guidance on how to straddle that line as an actor?\t\n\n\tWalking that fine line constantly — not having too much emotion, being very careful about when emotion comes out — was key. What actually affects the Others? What touches them enough to show emotion? They have empathy, but not the empathy that I, Karolina, would have. So I had to remove those layers. I’ve been thinking about this a lot… I don’t know if I could have played this role if I wasn’t a mother. \n\t\n\t\tWhat do you mean by that?\t\n\n\tWhat I mean is: when you have a child — at least in my experience — you learn that your heart lives outside your body. You love these beings unconditionally. Your heart is constantly outside of you, you’re constantly thinking about them. I remember being in an acting class where my teacher asked, “Would you throw yourself in front of a bus for someone?” And I thought, “Yeah, I hope I would.” But I didn’t really understand what that meant until I had a child. I would throw myself in front of a bus for my child without thinking. I would do anything to save them — give my lungs away, whatever it is.\n\n\tThat unconditional love, I brought that for Carol. Zosia is like an indulgent mother with Carol, forgiving and loving her through anything and everything. I don’t know if I could have played this part if I wasn’t a mother, because I don’t think I would’ve understood the depth of what that means.\n",

    "body": "\n\t​​“What’s up, neighbors?” are Scott Evans‘ famous first words to over 200,000 of his YouTube subscribers that he welcomes into his home every other Friday on his digital talk show, “House Guest.”\n\n\tFrom political figures such as Kamala Harris to beloved entertainers like Keke Palmer, Evans has invited a bevy of celebrities and notable names for a backyard hangout filled with lively games, food, drinks and, most importantly, honest conversations.\n\t\n\n\tNow, Evans is taking his dynamic show on a multi-city tour with stops in Atlanta, New York and Chicago.\n\n\n\tTaking “House Guest” in front of a live audience lets Evans connect with his fanbase, who aren’t shy about filling his comment sections with requests for an invite to Evans’ backyard.\n\n\t“I can’t wait to pull up on all our neighbors out there! The calls, DM’s and comments made this tour happen, and we are about to get it together,” he tells Variety. “We are so thankful for the love and support for this community. We have laughed, cried, enjoyed some good eats and have lifted each other up. We have a special guest on each stop plus other surprises.”\n\n\tThe talk show host announced his newest endeavor during his latest holiday episode of “House Party,” which featured Niecy Nash-Betts, Karrueche Tran, Jay Pharoah and Kevin Fredericks (also known as KevOnStage). “House Party” is the nighttime version of the daytime talk show that invites multiple guests, extra game elements and more mature conversations that are only suitable for late-night television.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Ryan Handford\n\t\n\n\n\n\t​Evans, who is also the long-standing host of “Access Hollywood,” launched “House Guest,” in June 2024. \n\t\n\n\tTaking inspiration from other talk show hosts like Arsenio Hall, Oprah Winfrey, Ina Garten and Martha Stewart, Evans initially created “House Guest” to practice the format and create a platform centered on amplifying the voices of Black and brown entertainers who don’t receive as much recognition for their contributions to the entertainment industry.\n\n\t“We started ‘House Guest’ as a means for me to practice and take control of the narrative of what we do and create in this industry,” Evans says. “Then it became this safe place for people to come as themselves, be loved and in some ways challenged but comforted in what feels like a really kind of scary ass time.”\n\n\t​After pitching other shows that stalled with NBCUniversal, the constant rejections and uncertainty pushed him to step out on his own.\n\n\t​​“It got to a point where I started saying, ‘If you’re not interested in this, you don’t have to take a meeting. We don’t have to waste our time building meeting materials if this isn’t something you’re looking for,'” he explains. “We got tired and decided to develop and use those resources to develop something that we wanted to do — not what we thought a network would pick up.”\n\n\t​So he began throwing concepts at the wall to see what would resonate with his built-in audience, which now consists of more than 450,000 followers on Instagram and even more across his socials. From shooting digital skits and covering events to podcasting, “House Guest” eventually became the one side gig that stuck.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Ryan Handford\n\t\n\n\n\n\t​​And the show has had a lot to celebrate since its launch. Back in April, “House Guest” won a Webby Award. In October, the digital series was placed on Spotify’s RADAR Creators Global Class of 2025 and, most recently, its Favorite Video Podcast of 2025. Evans has also been featured on prominent recognition lists such as Ebony Power 100 and The Root 100 this year.\n\n\tEvans has hosted notable names like Cynthia Erivo, Regina King, Tina Knowles, Leslie Jones, Chloe Bailey and more, leveraging his pre-existing relationships to book his guests. What started out as Evans’ reaching out to talent himself has turned into a small team that handles the logistics.​\n\n\tNow, the roles have reversed, with talent inviting themselves into Evans’ home. “​It was turning into people being like, ‘When am I coming over to the house?'” he laughs. “It’s been a beautiful experience to see people rally around the show in ways where they utilize their resources.”\n\t\n\n\t​One person in particular that Evans didn’t expect to receive a phone call from, but has turned out to be his biggest interviewee to date, was the former vice president.\n\n\t“[Harris’ team] said, ‘She watches the show. She wants to come on,’” Evans recalls. “I was like, ‘What do you mean she watches the show?’ It was a bizarre experience to get that phone call that someone close to the White House wants to know if you’re available this weekend for an interview.”\n\n\t“House Guest” was Harris’ first stop on the press tour for her latest memoir, “107 Days.” The former vice president swung by Evans’ home to dive into parts of her new book, her presidential bid and what’s next for her since leaving Washington, D.C. \n\n\tAnd like many of Evans’ guests, Harris didn’t show up empty handed, arriving with a personalized candle (which Evans says he’s never burning; it’s a keepsake) and a bag of her favorite chips (nacho cheese Doritos) for Evans’ famous chip drawer.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Ryan Handford\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It was a wild experience,” he says. “When she left, I stood in the backyard thinking, ‘What is your life?’ People are seeking out my home because they believe it to be a safe place for them to tell their story, share themselves and be in community with the people who watch the show.”\n\n\tA small but mighty production comprised of a two-camera crew, “House Guest” is primarily funded by Evans. He has some help from brand sponsorships, like Ancestry and Red Bull, who recently entered the picture, but the talk show host doesn’t get caught up with production costs. He views his passion project as a current investment for his future.\n\n\t“It’s an expensive show,” he shares. “The idea now is to partner with someone to help us do more of what we want to be doing, but better and faster. And we’re not partnering with any brand for the sake of brand dollars.”\n\n\tHe added, “I’ve been very fortunate and have worked hard to be in a position to fund the show, so I don’t have to partner with anybody truly. But the people we do partner with understand what we’re doing, are proponents for it and not trying to only serve their product or their mission.”\n\n\t“House Guest” has the core elements of a talk show with special guests, various segments and lively discussions. Serving as an extension of Evans’ day job on “Access Hollywood,” which requires long hours, frequent travel and back-to-back red carpets, makes finding a balance to do both difficult, but he finds a way to make it work with his tight schedule.\n\t\n\n\t“There is something to believing and trusting that you can do it all,” he says. “It has been rewarding and challenging, but it’s the kind of challenge I’m ready for.”\n\n\tWhile many recognize him from the syndicated program on NBC, Evans is ushering a new wave of viewers with “House Guest,” which is an element that he didn’t anticipate at first and is still getting used to.\n\n\t“The initial goal was to just put it out,” he explains. “I didn’t care if people were going to respond to it because I didn’t think people were going to see it. I thought it was going to be one of those things that kind of flew under the radar.”\n\n\tHe continues, “There are shows that have been doing episodes for 10 years, and then two years ago they start to pop. I was like, ‘I have eight years, and maybe nobody ever sees this.’ Then, the first episode went viral. We weren’t going to be able to do this in private.”\n\n\tVisibility, public support and imposter syndrome are no longer fears for the host who now has hundreds of thousands of subscribers. What’s at stake is sustaining the momentum he’s built so far while simultaneously elevating his platform.\n\n\t“The fears that I have are, how many more people can we bring along on this? How much more will it take before another partner comes to help blow this thing up? What happens when we expand our universe to include more people and versions of the show?” he says.\n\n\tHowever, Evans is eager to rise to the occasion. He’s already laid the foundation for his spinoff, “House Party,” which he plans to continue to expand into the new year. \n\n\tHe’ll continue to invite heavyweights onto “House Guest,” noting a couple of his dream guest stars being Michelle Obama and Rihanna.  Also in store for the talk show includes a forthcoming cookbook and coffee table book currently in development.\n\n\t“You can have some element of that episode with you wherever you are, so you can be immersed in the experience of watching the show,” he says. “If it’s some portion of what we eat, drink or a game, we’re going to be rolling those out hopefully in 2026. We have big dreams for ‘House Party’ and ‘House Guest,’ and it’s only getting bigger.”\n\n\tAs many daytime and late-night shows decline and creator-led platforms fill in the gap, Evans is pioneering a new way to amplify multicultural voices and how celebrities connect with audiences.\n\t\n\n\t“What we’re doing is industry shifting,” he says. “I didn’t foresee becoming the example for so many people who now pitch to create their own hybrid talk-show and podcast. It’s been shocking to be counted as one of the early shifters of the industry in this way. But believe me when I say, you ain’t seen nothing yet.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Kennedy Center, which first opened its doors more than 50 years ago, on Friday got a new addition: Donald Trump‘s name, which is being added above the name of John F. Kennedy on the building’s façade in Washington, D.C.\n\n\tWorkers on Friday added Trump’s name to the center, coming after the White House claimed that the  Kennedy Center board of trustees — all selected by President Trump — voted unanimously to rename the facility “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\t\n\n\tThe homepage of the Kennedy Center’s website also was updated Friday with a new logo that says “The Trump Kennedy Center” (although the old Kennedy Center logo currently still appears across the site).\n\n\n\tAs of this writing Friday, the site still uses the center’s original name in the section that describes its history: “Welcome to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a vibrant cultural hub that connects thousands of artists with millions of people each year — in person, online, and in their home communities.”\n\n\tHere’s the updated Kennedy Center website with the new “Trump Kennedy Center” logo:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLegal experts said the name of the Kennedy Center was established by federal law, and that the organization’s board does not have the authority to make any changes to its name. Changing the name of the Kennedy Center would require an act of Congress, according to scholars. \n\n\t“There is absolutely no way they can do this legally,” David Super, Georgetown Law professor who specializes in Constitutional law and legislation, told CNN. However, he said, “the administration is not concerning itself with laws unless it has a realistic prospect of getting sued.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\n\tOn X, historian Michael Beschloss wrote Thursday that the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts “was named by Act of Congress, January 1964, signed by President Johnson.” CNN reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere quoted Bechloss’ comment and said, “Fun Constitutional fact: an Act of Congress cannot be overridden by a vote of board members.”\n\n\tWhite House communications director Steven Cheung quoted the CNN reporter’s tweet and wrote, “Fun Constitutional fact:” followed by an image of “The Trump Kennedy Center” logo.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, multiple members of the Kennedy family also objected to the center’s renaming, citing the law.\n\n\t“The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,” Joe Kennedy III, one of JFK’s grandnephews and a former U.S. representative from Massachusetts, wrote in a post on X. “It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.”\n\n\tKerry Kennedy, daughter of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, also slammed Trump’s move to add his name to the Kennedy Center. She wrote on X, “President Kennedy proudly stood for justice, peace, equality, dignity, diversity, and compassion for those who suffer. President Trump stands in opposition to these values, and his name should not be placed alongside President Kennedy’s.”\n\n\tThe controversy over the name change comes after Trump announced in February 2025, shortly after reoccupying the White House, that he was “unanimously” elected to lead the center’s board. After previous Kennedy Center president Deborah Rutter was fired, Trump appointed Richard Grenell, who was ambassador to Germany during the first Trump administration and was serving as Trump’s envoy for special missions, to take over as president of the center. \n\n\tFollowing Trump’s Kennedy Center takeover, Shonda Rhimes, the organization’s treasurer who had been appointed by President Barack Obama, immediately announced she had resigned from the board. In addition, singer Renée Fleming stepped down as artistic adviser to the center, and singer-songwriter Ben Folds exited down as artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra because of the president’s actions.\n\t\n\n\tOn Dec. 7, Trump broke with decades of tradition and hosted the 48th Kennedy Center Honors ceremony. At the event, Trump also jokingly referred to the place as “the Trump-Kennedy Center,” then, waiting a beat for laughter, said, “I mean, the ‘Kennedy Center.’ I’m sorry. This is terribly embarrassing.”\n\n\tThe John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts made its public debut on Sept. 8, 1971. President Kennedy had taken the lead to raise funds for what was originally called the National Cultural Center before it was renamed in his honor after his assassination.\n",

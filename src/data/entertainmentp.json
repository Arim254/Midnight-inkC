    "body": "\n\tMarty Mauser has lost another critical match — but this time, it was in the awards game.\n\n\tJosh Safdie’s sports dramedy “Marty Supreme” left this year’s BAFTA ceremony with an unwelcome distinction, tying the record for most losses in a single night after going 0-for-11.\n\n\tThe film entered BAFTA with formidable nomination strength and broad expectations of converting in at least a handful of categories — particularly for leading actor Timothée Chalamet, who picked up major stops this season at the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes in Jan. In one of the night’s biggest shocks, Chalamet lost to Robert Aramayo from Kirk Jones’ Tourette’s drama movie, “I Swear.” \n\t\n\n\tNow, the A24 contender was shut out across the board, joining “Women in Love” (1969) and “Finding Neverland” (2004) as the only films to go winless with 11 nominations. Notably, both of those titles still went on to win a single Oscar on their respective nights: Glenda Jackson for best actress (“Women in Love”) and Jan A.P. Kaczmarek for original score (“Finding Neverland”). The BAFTA result is especially striking given Safdie’s own dominance on the ballot; he is the year’s most-nominated individual with four nominations, spanning his roles as director, co-producer, co-writer and co-editor.\n\n\n\tDespite the BAFTA setback, “Marty Supreme” remains a formidable player in the wider awards conversation, and history offers a reminder that a rough precursor night isn’t always fatal. Another A24 title, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022), managed only one BAFTA win (film editing) before going on to take seven Oscars, including best picture, director and three acting prizes. The moving drama “Moonlight” (2016) also went without a single BAFTA win that year, losing all four of its awards, before pulling off a historic upset in best picture at the Oscars.\n\t\n\n\tStill, the optics sting with a win-less night and a record-tying losses stat, which is not the kind of headline any campaign wants in the final stretch.\n\n\tAt BAFTA, “Marty Supreme” was nominated for best film, director, leading actor (Chalamet), supporting actress (Odessa A’zion), casting, original screenplay, production design, cinematography, costume design, film editing and makeup and hairstyling. At the Oscars, the film is nominated for nine, but misses BAFTA nominations for supporting actress and makeup and hairstyling.\n\n\tFinal Oscar voting runs from Feb. 26 to March 5. The 98th Oscars will be held on March 15 on ABC, hosted by Conan O’Brien.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson won the BAFTA Film Award for best director for his sprawling and politically-charged satire “One Battle After Another,” which has long been an awards season favorite. As he accepted the award, Anderson quipped, “I feel like the prettiest girl in the room right now,” prompting laughter from the crowd.\n\n\tBut Anderson’s tone soon turned serious as he dedicated the award to the late producer, assistant director and Brit Adam Somner. “You may think that your greatest export is Alfred Hitchcock or Charlie Chaplin, but it wasn’t,” Anderson said. “To me, it was Adam Somner, who was my assistant director and producer for about 20 years. He came over to America and the line was out the door of people who wanted to work with him because he made us all better.”\n\t\n\n\tAnderson continued: “About three weeks into our film, he found out he was sick, and he made it through production. If you’ve ever gone to work before with someone who’s very ill, there’s something miraculous that makes you pay attention and reminds you the privilege of the work that we do. So thank you for sending him to me.”\n\n\n\tOne of contemporary cinema’s most acclaimed directors, the BAFTA win is Anderson’s first for best director, having previously been nominated in the same category for “We Will Be Blood” and “Licorice Pizza.” \n\n\tLoosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel “Vineland,” “One Battle After Another” — PTA’s most epic and ambitious film to date — follows a rabble of ex-revolutionaries reuniting to rescue a comrade’s daughter after an old enemy resurfaces. The ensemble cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor and breakout Chase Infiniti. \n\t\n\n\tAnderson, also behind films such as “Boogie Nights,” “Magnolia” and “The Master,” can now add another director award to an array of honors that already includes best director at the Cannes Film Festival, the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and the Silver and Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\t“One Battle After Another” went into the BAFTA Awards leading the pack with 14 nominations, just two short of the record set by “Gandhi.” For the upcoming Academy Awards, the film has 13 nominations, with hopes that Anderson will finally add a long-awaited Oscar to his collection.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrince William paid tribute to NBCUniversal chair Donna Langley as he awarded her BAFTA’s highest honor, the BAFTA Fellowship during the film awards on Sunday night, calling the British-born studio head a “shining light.”\n\n\t“The path to fellowship is an honor given in recognition of an exceptional contribution to film,” he told the audience, which included many of Langley’s colleagues and collaborators, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Renée Zellweger and Emma Stone. “And tonight’s recipient is quite simply that – exceptional.”\n\t\n\n\tHe went on to cite Langley’s “determination,” “commitment,” “transformative leadership” and “unwavering commitment to creative partnership” among other characteristics.\n\n\n\tHe also praised Langley, who was awarded one of the U.K.’s highest royal honors, a Damehood, by Queen Elizabeth II in 2020, for advocating “tireless[ly]” for British talent abroad.\n\n\t“Dame Donna’s impact at NBC Universal and on the film industry is significant,” William said. “She is a shining light to all those starting out in the creative industries, showing that anything is possible.”\n\n\tHe then introduced a VT that included tributes from many of Langley’s colleagues including Christopher Nolan, who is currently putting the finishing touches to upcoming Universal Pictures film “The Odyssey,” Steven Spielberg, Eric Fellner, Judy Craymer and Emma Thompson.\n\n\t“Her patience is kind of like the bonding agent,” Spielberg said. “It makes us all feel like, in a way, she’s our security blanket.”\n\n\tAs the audience at the Royal Festival Hall rose to give Langley a standing ovation, William’s wife Catherine, who was sitting next to the NBCUniversal chief in the front row, gave her a warm smile before Langley made her way to the stage to accept her fellowship.\n\t\n\n\t“As my career has progressed, I’ve come to believe that the most meaningful part of what we do is the people we choose to support along the way,” Langley told the audience. “The voices we encourage. And the talent we protect…long enough for them to find their feet. And the doors we remember to open.”\n\n\t“We are also facing moments of change and disruption today. And my hope is that those of us who help tell stories for a living continue to find inspiration to make popular art that carries over into people’s everyday lives – that helps us understand the world a bit better and to see each other a little more clearly…and reminds us that decency is a superpower.”\n\n\tWilliam and Catherine’s presence at the ceremony on Sunday night was a closely guarded secret, with neither BAFTA nor Kensington Palace giving any hint the couple planned to attend. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter “One Battle After Another” claimed the BAFTA for best film on Sunday night, director Paul Thomas Anderson had a simple message for critics of modern cinema.\n\n\t“Anybody that says movies aren’t any good anymore should piss right off,” Anderson, who both wrote and directed the action thriller, said to cheers and laughter. “I want to say thank you, and I know that there’s a bar somewhere. I think we should all go there. It’s been a long evening, but we have so much to celebrate.”\n\t\n\n\tAnderson ended his speech by sharing a quote from pianist, singer and activist Nina Simone that he admitted “we stole in our film.”\n\n\n\t“She says, ‘I know what freedom is, it’s no fear,'” Anderson said. “So let’s keep making things without fear. It’s a good idea. See ya at the bar!”\n\n\tAsked backstage if the world needs another revolution, Anderson replied: “Well yeah, sure, we do. We always do. We just need to conduct a revolution, hopefully without violence, and do it properly … Unfortunately, the title makes sense. It just does start to seem like one battle after another these days.”\n\n\tLoosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel “Vineland,” “One Battle After Another” follows ex-revolutionaries reuniting to rescue a comrade’s daughter after an old enemy resurfaces. The ensemble cast is stacked with award winners in Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Regina Hall plus Teyana Taylor and breakout Chase Infiniti. On Sunday, “One Battle After Another” took home the most BAFTA Awards, including best director and adapted screenplay for Anderson and best supporting actor for Penn.\n\t\n\n\tFor Anderson, one of contemporary cinema’s most critically-acclaimed directors, “One Battle After Another” marks his first major awards contender and his first time winning BAFTA’s top prize. Both “There Will Be Blood” and “Licorice Pizza” were nominated for best film but lost out. Across eight previous nominations, he’s only had one win, when “Licorice Pizza” won best original screenplay in 2022.\n\n\t“One Battle After Another,” which has 13 Oscar nominations, went into the BAFTA Film Awards leading the pack with 14 nominations, just two short of the record set by “Gandhi.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tVeteran artist manager Gary Borman has retired, he announced on Sunday, and will be shuttering the doors of his namesake company 50 years after its inception. \n\n\tHis client of 25 years, Keith Urban, will be moving to a new firm although a rep tells Variety there is no announcement to be made yet. The news was first reported by the New York Post. \n\n\tOver the years Borman Entertainment has worked closely with such artists as the Yellowjackets, the Bee Gees, James Taylor, the Violent Femmes, Dwight Yoakam, Faith Hill and along with Steve Moir, the Rolling Stones and Natalie Cole. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBorman, far left, with Urban, second from right, in 2006 (Photo by Rick Diamond/WireImage)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWireImage\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBorman said, “To say I’ve been lucky to have spent my time doing what I’ve loved, would be an understatement. I’ve worked side by side with some of the most gifted artists.  I’m grateful beyond words to all the teachers, artists, colleagues, collaborators, supporters, Lady Luck, as well as the adversaries and turbulent moments that sharpened his resolve and taught him how to manage emotion and life.”\n\n\tUrban says, “I’m so grateful to Gary (and my entire Borman Nashville family) for the most incredible and successful time together. It was extraordinary – what we were able to accomplish together – and I’ll forever be grateful for the creative and collaborative spirit we were all a part of for so long.  I wish Gary and everyone at Borman Entertainment the very best journey ahead and look forward to what the future holds for all of us.”\n\n\tBorman added, “Keith and I shared a journey not unlike brothers. The place that I have in my heart will remain warm and my mind filled with wonderful memories. I have been and will remain a fan.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety will have more on the situation as it develops.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBerlinale hit “Truly Naked” bets on intimacy, not porn.\n\n\t“Porn is very much like WWE. It’s the fantasy that pays the bills. They get in the ring, fight and bleed. But it’s all fake,” adult performer Alessa Savage tells Variety. \n\n\t“As soon as you put sex into the mix, people find it harder to understand it’s not real. What you see in porn isn’t supposed to be replicated at home. Real intimacy is supposed to feel better than it looks.”\n\t\n\n\tIn Muriel d’Ansembourg’s film, Savage plays Lizzie, another adult entertainer who frequently works with Dylan (Andrew Howard). It’s a family business: his own teenage son, Alec (Caolán O’Gorman), films and edits their content. But when Alec meets Nina (Safiya Benaddi), he starts to crave more. \n\n\n\tAs reported by Variety, “Truly Naked” has already sparked bidding wars among distributors. It’s sold by M-Appeal.\n\n\t“The reception to the film has been absolutely phenomenal. It’s the right time for it. It’s the right time for people to talk about these subjects, for boundaries to be broken and for shame to be put aside,” adds Savage. \n\n\t“Seeing people fight for this film as much as Muriel has, as much as we all have, is heartwarming and nerve-wracking. It’s really something.”\n\n\tD’Ansembourg, making her feature debut, worked with Savage on her short “Fuck-a-Fan.” \n\n\t“Quite a few [adult] actresses have made that jump, like Sasha Grey, Nina Hartley or Chloe Cherry. There were so many women on our crew, which Alessa wasn’t used to. She has this incredible range she’d never really gotten to show,” says the director, who noticed a “strange contradiction” in our culture around sexuality. \n\t\n\n\t“It’s everywhere, it’s used to sell everything, and at the same time, so much shame and judgment can be attached to it. That’s heartbreaking. Sexuality can teach us a lot about ourselves and each other.”\n\n\tIn “Truly Naked,” Dylan strives for perfection. But d’Ansembourg chose to embrace the “messiness” of love lives instead. \n\n\t“It’s precisely those real moments that I find most compelling as a filmmaker. Real intimacy is awkward and hesitant, full of small gestures and stolen glances.”\n\n\tWhile occasionally explicit, the film cares for its characters. \n\n\t“We were all taken aback – and delighted – that the audience found its humor. That was a thrill because we were expecting walk-outs,” recalls Andrew Howard.\n\n\t“People have seen it work on many different levels aside from it being a tender, intimate coming-of-age love story. As a father of a young daughter, I find it damaging the way young people are learning about sex online, which is often extreme and violent, rather than fumbling about organically, like my generation did.”\n\n\tAlec and Nina are torn between what they see on their screens and what they experience together. \n\n\t“I think people don’t necessarily struggle with sex itself anymore because we’re surrounded by it in our everyday life. People struggle with vulnerability,” notes Caolán O’Gorman.\n\n\t“For me, at its core, this film isn’t really about porn. It’s about breaking free from old patterns, from the life you’ve been handed, and from the version of yourself you’ve been performing. Alec starts the film observing life rather than living it. He is detached and hides behind a camera. By the end, he chooses something more honest.” \n\n\tWhile the team worked with intimacy coordinator Philine Janssens, their main focus was never on the physical side, but on “the emotional truth underneath,” he says. His co-star Safiya Benaddi adds: “That contrast is the absolute heartbeat of the film. You can be physically exposed without being seen at all.”\n\n\tShe says: “We wanted to show that true intimacy is often quiet and awkward, and deeply personal, whereas the explicit world is loud, choreographed and transactional. The film highlights that vulnerability is an act of bravery.”\n\t\n\n\tStill, there was no shortage of bold moments. \n\n\t“It was quite daunting having to walk out in massive heels from Alessa and a strap-on, and dangle it in front of Andrew Howard’s face! He’s a brilliant actor, and I couldn’t walk in those heels to save my life.”\n\n\tBenaddi was also surprised by the laughter in the room during the premiere.\n\n\t“It was incredible to hear the audience grasp the bizarre tension between the mundane and the explicit. There’s a certain absurdity in the contrast between the high-pressure, neon-lit world of the adult industry and the reality of a stoic, rainy British seaside town.”\n\n\tAccording to Savage, people often feel more comfortable talking about “heinous things in life” because they are more detached from them. \n\n\t“Most people haven’t murdered or even punched someone, but everyone past a certain age has had sex or wants to have sex. All of the sex we see in the media, be it a Hollywood film or porn, is highly choreographed. It’s there to elicit certain reactions. It’s not there to facilitate real intimacy.” \n\n\tThe characters in the film find it easier to be naked than to talk about their feelings – she did too. \n\n\t“People have seen my naked body online for years, in all sorts of positions. But getting the opportunity to speak to them this way feels like I’m being seen for the first time.”\n\n\tUltimately, even in a world of “commodified bodies,” the human spirit is still searching for something real, observes Benaddi.\n\n\t“We’ve become very comfortable with pornographic imagery because it’s accessible at any time. In theory, that isn’t an issue, with consenting adults creating content for pleasure. In practice, it can become a mess. As my dad likes to say: ‘All things in moderation.’ Young people need guidance on this.” \n\n\t“[My character] Nina is looking at a world that’s supposedly all about intimacy, asking why it feels so cold. By approaching the topic with curiosity instead of shame, she opens up a lighter, more honest conversation. That’s what the audience responded to. They were invited into a dialogue.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlessa Savage in ‘Truly Naked’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t© DoP Myrthe Mosterman\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tFractured, unpredictable and thrilling chaos are defining this awards season after a wild night at the 79th BAFTA Awards, with the race now barreling into the final stretch before Oscar voting opens Thursday, Feb. 26.\n\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” was the night’s dominant force, winning six BAFTAs: best film, director, adapted screenplay, supporting actor (Sean Penn), cinematography and editing.\n\n\n\tFor Oscar watchers, the technical trophies matter as much as the headline prizes. Winning for the artisans brings crucial momentum. “One Battle After Another” leaves BAFTA positioned as a below-the-line viability and still a clear best picture frontrunner. But if anyone hoped for a night of tidy answers, BAFTA offered the opposite with a loud reshuffle that may have clarified one thing and destabilized nearly everything else.\n\t\n\n\tEnter “Sinners” from Ryan Coogler. His film won three BAFTAs — original screenplay, supporting actress for Wunmi Mosaku and original score — with Coogler’s screenplay win carrying historic weight as the first Black winner in BAFTA’s original screenplay category. The moment land became a milestone, the campaign accelerated.\n\n\tThe win also sharpens the Oscar math.\n\n\tOnly one Black screenwriter has ever won for original screenplay at the Oscars (Jordan Peele for “Get Out,” 2017). Coogler’s BAFTA trophy strengthens his Oscar prospects against a crowded field. However, and just as important, “Sinners” showed more above-the-line vitality where it needed oxygen most, with Mosaku’s supporting actress win adding real heat to the campaign.\n\t\n\n\tSo if you’re keeping score — “One Battle After Another” needed to prove below-the-line love (which it did), and “Sinners” needed to prove more above-the-line love (which it did). Obviously, “One Battle After Another” taking best film and director, after sweeping major critics awards and the DGA leaves many believing it’s over. But if you do your Oscar homework, you know that’s never the case. We have the PGA Awards and the Actor Awards (formerly SAG Awards) happening this upcoming week, all amid final Oscar voting. There’s room for more shifts to happen in the coming days.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnother significant upset came later in the BAFTA evening when Timothée Chalamet lost the leading actor award to Robert Aramayo for his performance in Kirk Jones’ Tourette’s drama “I Swear.” Aramayo also won the EE Rising Star Award, the only honor voted on by the public. Interestingly, Aramayo and “I Swear” have different kinds of momentum, which are forward-looking for next year’s Oscars. The film will be eligible for the 99th Oscars ceremony, with a U.S. release later this year from Sony Pictures Classics.\n\n\tNonetheless, Chalamet arrived as the presumed frontrunner after major victories at CCAs and Globes for Josh Safdie’s sports dramedy. At this stage in the season, a loss like this cannot be read as a mere statistical blip. Rather, it can change the story voters tell themselves when they fill out their ballots. Whether it proves ultimately fatal to the campaign is unknowable. Still, it is absolutely relevant, particularly with final voting around the corner.\n\n\tBut the damage didn’t stop there. “Marty Supreme” left with an especially brutal distinction, going 0 for 11, tying the record for most losses in a single night.\n\n\tThe SAG Award may now serve as the decisive indicator. Variety has projected for weeks that Ethan Hawke could be the victor in the category for his work as Lorenz Hart in “Blue Moon.” Whoever claims that prize will likely emerge as your Oscar winner. And worth noting: no performer has ever won back-to-back SAG Awards in the same category. Chalamet, who took home the prize last year for “A Complete Unknown,” would make history if he reversed course and won.\n\n\tJessie Buckley won leading actress for “Hamnet,” which also won for outstanding British film. The result was broadly anticipated, and the reason is simple, as Buckley’s campaign has looked like the closest thing to a straight line in a season full of detours.\n\t\n\n\tThe real circus, though, is the supporting acting races. If BAFTA proved anything, it’s that both are wide open, and not in the polite, pundit-friendly way, but in the genuine chaotic manner. We’ve had three different winners — for both supporting acting races — at the Globes, CCA, and BAFTAs so far.\n\n\tThe closest occurrence of something like this happening was in 2004. Globes went to Clive Owen and Natalie Portman for “Closer” (who both missed SAG noms). CCA went to the “Sideways” duo, Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen, and SAG went to eventual Oscar winner Morgan Freeman from “Million Dollar Baby” and Cate Blanchett from “The Aviator.” That specific year, the BAFTA Awards were the final say on the season, with Owen and Blanchett taking their prizes. In the end, it was SAG that was ultimately correct with Freeman from the eventual best picture winner, and Blanchett from the presumed “runner-up.”\n\n\tEven though he’s a two-time Oscar winner for “Mystic River” (2003) and “Milk” (2008), Penn won his first-ever BAFTA for supporting actor for his villainous turn as Col. Lockjaw in “One Battle After Another,” adding his name to the already fractured leaderboard. Jacob Elordi holds the Critics Choice prize for “Frankenstein.” Stellan Skarsgård took the Golden Globe for “Sentimental Value.” Now Penn has a BAFTA. With the Actor Award still pending, this race is starting to resemble a five-sided coin flip. If Benicio del Toro takes the SAG prize, we’ll have four different winners at every televised show, which hasn’t happened since the COVID-era of 2020’s best actress race — which ended up favoring the BAFTA winner from the eventual best picture winner “Nomadland,” Frances McDormand. That leaves surprise Oscar nominee Delroy Lindo, who is still very much on the table for his work in “Sinners.” Interestingly, before 2020, another time four different winners won awards at the precursors was the 2000 season, where Frances McDormand won CCA for “Almost Famous,” before her co-star Kate Hudson took the Golden Globe, followed by SAG with Judi Dench for “Chocolat” and BAFTA for Julie Walters in “Billy Elliot.” The eventual Oscar winner was Marcia Gay Harden from “Pollock,” who, like Lindo, didn’t land any noms from any of the precursors. Could that be a sign of good things to come for Lindo?\n\t\n\n\tSkarsgård’s loss, in particular, lands with force. His turn as film director Gustav Borg in “Sentimental Value” (which won a single prize for non-English-language film) had the role and prestige that often come with supporting, even with a SAG snub under his belt. Regina King (“If Beale Street Could Talk,” 2018) is the last acting winner to do so without a win from either SAG or BAFTA (and she coincidentally didn’t have nominations at either).\n\n\tSupporting actress is no calmer. Teyana Taylor has the Golden Globe for “One Battle After Another.” Amy Madigan won Critics Choice for “Weapons” but wasn’t nominated at BAFTA. Mosaku now has a BAFTA for “Sinners.” None of it adds up to a safe consensus, and that uncertainty is the point. With SAG still to come and no obvious default choice, the industry’s own voting bloc may end up acting as the season’s final referee.\n\n\tBeyond the headline races, the craft categories offered their declarative statements. “Frankenstein” won costume design, makeup and hair, and production design, giving it a firm technical foothold as Oscar voters start locking in their preferences. “Sentimental Value” won film not in the English language, but “The Secret Agent” has Globes and CCA under its belt as well. “Mr. Nobody Against Putin” won documentary over the presumed favorite “The Perfect Neighbor.” In contrast, “Zootopia 2” won animated film, without the presence of “KPop Demon Hunters,” which wasn’t eligible to be nominated due to its release. However, EJAE still gave the film a presence just one day after it swept the Annie Awards, taking home 10 statuettes.\n\n\tHeading into the final weeks of awards season, the shape of the battlefield is clearer and messier at the same time. “One Battle After Another” looks like the best picture target everyone else has to hit. Buckley appears to be the closest thing to a near-lock in any acting race. Coogler has the wind at his back in original screenplay. And almost everything else remains in flux. The BAFTAs rarely make the Oscars simpler. This year, they’ve made them electric.\n\n\tFinal Oscar voting will take place from Feb. 26 to March 5. The 98th Oscars will be held March 15 and will air on ABC, hosted by Conan O’Brien.

    "body": "\n\tThis weekend at the global box office was the tale of two holdovers as “Wuthering Heights” waltzed to $150 million while “GOAT” hit the $100 million mark.\n\n\tDirector Emerald Fennell’s gothic romantic drama “Wuthering Heights,” which ceded the top spot in North America to “GOAT,” was No. 1 at the international box office with $26.3 million from 76 markets. In a theatrical surprise, the R-rated film has been a bigger draw overseas with ticket sales having climbed to $91.7 million to date. Top foreign territories include the United Kingdom with $22.5 million, Italy with $9.4 million and Australia with $8.3 million. So far, “Wuthering Heights” has grossed $151.7 million worldwide against an $80 million production budget.\n\t\n\n\t“GOAT” captured second place with $17 million from 51 territories, representing 70% of its overseas footprint. Sony’s original animated adventure, about an animal who aspires to be a basketball champion, has earned $44 million internationally. The U.K. is the highest-grossing market with $14.5 million, followed by Mexico with $3.4 million and France with $3 million. Along with $58 million at the domestic box office, “GOAT” has generated $102.3 million against a price tag of $80 million.\n\n\n\tElsewhere at the international box office, Amazon MGM’s heist thriller “Crime 101” added $6.2 million from 75 markets in its second weekend of release. The film, starring Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo, has stalled with $21.6 million overseas and $46.3 million worldwide. That’s a terrible result for the studio considering it spent $90 million to produce the film (and theater owners keep roughly 50% of ticket sales).\n\t\n\n\tOutside of Hollywood releases, China’s comedy “Pegasus 3” is dominating with estimates of over $200 million during the Chinese New Year, a popular time for moviegoing in the country. The film is doing especially well in Imax with $21.7 million over the weekend, the second consecutive Chinese-language hit for the company after last year’s phenomenon “Ne Zha 2.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRobert Aramayo pulled off one of the all-time BAFTA upsets on Sunday night when he beat a line-up of Hollywood all-stars — Leonardo DiCaprio, Ethan Hawke, Timothée Chalamet, Jesse Plemons and Michael B. Jordan — to take home the leading actor award for his performance as real-life Tourette syndrome campaigner John Davidson in Kirk Jones’ “I Swear.”\n\n\t“I absolutely can’t believe it, I can’t believe that I’m looking at people like you, in the same category as you, never mind that I’m stood here,” the tearful actor, who also stars as Elrond in Prime Video’s “Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,” said to his fellow nominees. “I honestly cannot believe that I have won this award. I really, really cannot. Everyone in this category blows me away.”\n\t\n\n\tAramayo went on to thank a number of people including director and writer Jones as well as Davidson, before sharing an anecdote about Hawke from his schooldays. “When I was in school, Ethan Hawke came in to speak to us at Juilliard and he gave an amazing talk on longevity as an actor, about protecting your instrument and avoiding self destructive behaviors,” the younger actor recalled. “And it had a really great impact on everyone in that room. So to be in this category with you tonight is incredible. Thank you Ethan.”\n\n\n\tStill in shock, he wrapped with: “OK I’m going to stop talking now. Thank you so so so so much.”\n\n\tEarlier in the evening Aramayo also won the EE Rising Star Award while “I Swear” casting director Lauren Evans won the casting award. Co-star Peter Mullan was nominated for supporting actor while the film was nominated for outstanding British film although it lost out in the category to “Hamnet.”\n\t\n\n\tSet in 1980s Scotland, “I Swear” follows John Davidson, a young man with severe Tourette syndrome, which can present with tics and outbursts involving cursing, as he navigates rejection from his family and society at a time when the condition was barely understood, and his eventual emergence as a national advocate for the disorder. \n\n\tDavidson was present during the first half of the BAFTA ceremony, where the audience included William and Catherine, the Prince and Princess of Wales, but after a number of involuntary outbursts he left midway through. BAFTAs host Alan Cumming apologized to anyone who was offended and thanked the audience for their understanding.\n\n\tPrior to the BAFTAs, Emma McNally, CEO of support and research charity Tourettes Action, told Variety: “Historically, portrayals of Tourette’s in the media have tended to focus on shock value or reduce the condition to a punchline. ‘I Swear’ is very different. It focuses on resilience, the challenges people face, and the everyday realities of living with Tourette’s, rather than relying on stereotypes or sensationalism. It’s such a powerful, compassionate film that has opened up meaningful conversations.”\n\n\tThe BAFTA win marks Aramayo’s first BAFTA Film Award nomination. Aramayo had already won the British Independent Film Award for best lead performance and the ALFS Breakthrough Performer of the Year at the London Critics Circle Film Awards ahead of the BAFTA ceremony.\n\n\t“I Swear” will be eligible for the Oscars next year after only getting a U.S. release recently. After premiering at TIFF last September it got a U.K. release in Oct. 2025.\n\n\tFor his BAFTA leading actor victory, Aramayo beat out Chalamet in “Marty Supreme,” DiCaprio in “One Battle After Another,” Hawke in “Blue Moon,” Jordan in “Sinners” and Plemons in “Bugonia.\n",

Tell other people about what you hear about the Epstein files and what the government is doing about it. Raise awareness.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Sources who worked with Austin at Pine Needles Lodge & Golf Club in North Carolina tell TMZ ... he became fixated on Epstein following the latest release of information tied to the files. Co-workers tell us he was deeply disturbed by what he believed was a government cover-up and often talked about powerful people \"getting away with it.\"\n      \n    \n          At the same time, Austin was outspoken about his Christian faith and political views. We're told he regularly expressed support for Trump, telling colleagues as recently as late last year he believed Trump was a strong leader.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          People close to Martin describe him as well-meaning but increasingly frustrated, particularly about the economy. We're told he often complained that young people need two jobs or roommates to afford moving out. Our sources say he still lived with his parents.\n      \n    \n          Austin also tried to start a union at work to push for higher wages, but no one signed on. Outside of his job, he was a sketch artist attempting to sell drawings of local scenery and people around town.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported ... he was shot and killed after breaching the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early Sunday. According to officials, he was observed near the north gate carrying a shotgun and a fuel can.

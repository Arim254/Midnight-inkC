    "body": "\n\tRadial Entertainment has struck a deal for the U.S. distribution rights to Conan O’Brien’s long-running TBS late-night talk show, the company revealed at Mipcom.\n\n\tThe agreement gives Radial exclusive rights across multiple digital platforms — including subscription and ad-supported streaming, transactional video, and digital networks — for all 11 seasons of “Conan,” which aired from 2010 to 2021. Jeff Peisch made the announcement on behalf of Radial Entertainment.\n\t\n\n\t“Conan O’Brien is widely regarded as one of the most original and enduring figures in American comedy,” Peisch said. “His influence has shaped modern comedy, and his work continues to resonate with audiences across generations. We are excited to continue his extraordinary late-night legacy by allowing fans to watch his decade-long series on streaming platforms.”\n\n\n\tThe talk show featured O’Brien and sidekick Andy Richter mixing comedy sketches with interviews spanning entertainment, sports, politics and culture. The series became particularly recognized for its international remote segments and won multiple Emmy Awards during its run.\n\n\tThe show later spawned “Conan Without Borders” and “Conan O’Brien Must Go,” both of which stream on HBO Max. Jeff Ross served as longtime executive producer.\n\n\tO’Brien was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in earlier this year, capping a nearly 30-year career in late-night television.\n\n\tBruce David Eisen of Eisen Law represented Radial Entertainment alongside Peisch in negotiations.\n\n\tThe newly formed Radial Entertainment, which operates the FilmRise and Shout! Studios brands and is backed by funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, boasts a library of over 70,000 movies and episodes spanning genres including true crime, reality, animation, classics and horror.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Tuesday, Oct. 14 episode of “Dancing With the Stars.”\n\n\tIt was the most emotional night yet on Season 34 of “Dancing With the Stars.” For dedication night, each of the ten remaining couples performed a number to honor someone special in their life — which meant multiple reunions during the evening. It also meant a special returning guest — former pro Kym Johnson returned to the ballroom as a guest judge.\n\t\n\n\tEarly in the night, Robert Irwin dedicated his dance to his mother, who became his rock after his father, Steve Irwin, died. The contemporary number left the entire room in tears, including judge Derek Hough who could barely get words out. Hough previously danced with Bindi Irwin.\n\n\n\tElaine Hendrix, best known for her role in “The Parent Trap,” dedicated her dance to Lisa Ann Walter, her costar from the 1998 film. Dennis Quaid, who starred in the movie with the pair, was cheering her on from the audience.\n\n\tDanielle Fishel dedicated her dance to “Boy Meets World” teacher Bill Daniels, who played Mr. Feeny to her Topanga Lawrence. In addition to Daniels, who joined Fishel and Pasha Pashkov on the ballroom floor, her costars also came to support her, including Will Friedle (Eric Matthews), Betsy Randle (Amy Matthews), William Russ (Alan Matthews), Trina McGee (Angela Moore), Bonnie Bartlett (Lila Bolander and Williams’ wife), Matthew Lawrence (Jack Hunter) and Alex Désert (Eli Williams).\n\n\tThe show ended without an elimination, surprising the cast. At the end, Dylan Efron was at the top of the leaderboard, and Andy Richter was at the bottom.\n\t\n\n\tAt the end of the night, no one was eliminated! And, for the first time ever, the show surpassed 50 million votes. \n\n\tHere’s a full list of scores from the night:\n\n\tJen Affleck and partner Jan RavnikDance: Viennese Waltz to “Rescue” by Lauren DaigleScore: 29/40\n\n\tJordan Chiles and partner Ezra SosaDance: Viennese Waltz to “Daughters” by John MayerScore: 32/40\n\n\tAlix Earle and partner Val ChmerkovskiyDance: Contemporary to “Sparks” by ColdplayScore: 35/40\n\n\tDylan Efron and partner Daniella KaragachDance: Contemporary to “Rewrite the Stars” by Zac Efron & ZendayaScore: 36/40\n\n\tDanielle Fishel and partner Pasha PashkovDance: Jive to “Boy Meets World” by Twenty Cent Crush featuring Phil RosenthalScore: 29/40\n\n\tElaine Hendrix and partner Alan BerstenDance: Foxtrot to “This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)”Score: 30/40\n\n\tScott Hoying and partner Rylee ArnoldDance: Foxtrot to “Parallel” by Scott HoyingScore: 30/40\n\n\tRobert Irwin and partner Witney CarsonDance: Contemporary to “You’ll Be In My Heart” by Phil CollinsScore: 35/40\n\n\tWhitney Leavitt and partner Mark BallasDance: Contemporary to “Heal” by Jamal RobertsScore: 33/40\n\n\tAndy Richter and partner Emma SlaterDance: Salsa to “Jump In the Line” by Harry BelafonteScore: 24/40\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Boy Meets World” cast is got back together to support Topanga.\n\n\tDuring Tuesday’s dedication night on “Dancing With the Stars,” Danielle Fishel danced to the theme song from the hit sitcom in a number honoring William Daniels, who played Mr. George Feeny.\n\n\tFishel danced a jive with her partner, Pasha Pashkov. Daniels, 98, join the duo in the routine. She received the score of a 29 of 40, receiving her first 8 of the season. \n\n\n\tMany members from the cast were also in the audience, including Will Friedle (Eric Matthews), Betsy Randle (Amy Matthews), William Russ (Alan Matthews), Trina McGee (Angela Moore), Bonnie Bartlett (Lila Bolander and Williams’ wife), and Alex Désert (Eli Williams).\n\t\n\n\n\t“The fabulous group of people who will be joining me at DWTS tomorrow for Dedication night! I feel such an overwhelming responsibility to give a full out, joyous, celebratory dance to the man who is responsible for THOUSANDS of people becoming teachers and who has helped raise multiple generations,” Fishel captioned her Instagram announcing the cast set to attend. “This dance is a dedication from me to Bill but I am representing ALL OF YOU who loved and appreciated him and his career for so many decades. Unfortunately, @rider_strong is working out of town but he will be missed.”\n\n\tShe previously opened up about the routine.\n\n\t“Saying it out loud feels crazy. But yes, we get to dance to the ‘Boy Meets World’ theme song, the one you all know and love,” she previously shared on her “Danielle With the Stars” podcast. “I’m so excited. It’s really a dedication to Bill and the role he has played in my life and the role ‘Boy Meets World’ has played in my life. I have really felt like ‘Dancing with the Stars’ has been a second act for me in my career and as a performer.”\n\t\n\n\tShe mentioned how much of an inspiration Daniels has been in her life and to many members of the TV family. She added, “To be able to say thank you to him and give him this kind of a platform for him to receive the love that he deserves is going to be very memorable. So I’m very, very excited about that. I can’t wait.”\n\n\t“Boy Meets World” aired from 1993 to 2000. The cast later reunited for a spinoff, “Girl Meets World,” which aired for three seasons on Disney Channel from 2014 to 2017.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCANNES — Robbie Brenner told Mipcom attendees that the toymaker is focused on stepping up its TV development and production now that the Mattel Studios arm has been unified under her leadership as president and chief content officer. \n\n\tBrenner spoke Tuesday with Leo Barraclough, Variety‘s international features director, in the keynote address on Day 2 of the Mipcom content market. Brenner detailed her unlikely journey from independent film producer to Mattel Studios leader. She reflected on the out of the box success of “Barbie,” which was Mattel’s first feature film effort under the new regime led by CEO Ynon Kreiz, who recruited Brenner to the toymaker in 2018 to drive the key component of his strategy to transform Mattel into a media and entertainment firm in addition to its consumer toy and game businesses.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s not very often get to go to work and dream every day,” Brenner said of her role. After joining the company she was impressed at Mattel’s culture of detail and innovation. She appreciates Mattel’s history of “having the integrity to make these toys the best they can be,” Brenner said. Her job is to “find ways to honor that and celebrate the brands do it I a way feels interesting an out of the box and unexpected.”\n\n\n\tBrenner explained to Barraclough how Mattel tries to cast the creative auspices of its projects well with distinctive writers, directors, producers and stars who have a feel for the material. Travis Knight, the writer-director steering Mattel’s second feature film release, “Masters of the Universe,” is a “fanboy” who grew up playing with the action figures and knows the mythos behind them. The live-action film starring Nicholas Galitzine, Camila Mendes and Idris Elba bows June 5, distributed by Amazon MGM Studios.\n\t\n\n\t“He knows the characters,” she said of Knight. “His attention to detail has been wonderful to watch.”\n\n\tThe same is true for Daniel Kaluuya, who is taking on a fresh take on the purple dino for A24, with Ayo Edebiri co-starring. Stunt peformer turned director Sam Hargraves is in the driver’s seat for the “Matchbox” feature in the works with John Cena and Jessica Biel. And one day before Brenner’s Mipcom appearance, her studio unveiled a pact with M. Night Shamalayan to develop a series based on the iconic  Magic 8 Ball toy.\n\n\t“Television is a big push for us – I feel good about where my team is,” Brenner said. Brenner had been the company’s head of film. She was promoted in June to oversee TV as well. She firmly believes there will be benefits to the tighter alignment. \n\n\t“Everything historically has been so separated” between film and TV at studios,” Brenner said. “Everything really is so blended today….For us to all exist under the umbrella together — we figure out what is the best past forward for each one of these brands to navigate that together as television and theatrical.”\n\n\t(Pictured: Variety’s Leo Barraclough with Mattel Studios’ Robbie Brenner at Mipcom in Cannes on Oct. 14)\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s fitting that Michael Mann should be honored at the Lumière Festival in Lyon, since the director of “Ali,” “Heat” and “The Insider” began his filmmaking career in France. After graduating from the London Film School in 1967, Mann — who grew up in Chicago and switched course from a literature degree to filmmaking after seeing Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” — was dead-set on directing dramatic features.\n\n\tIn the meantime, he found his way to Paris, documenting the student uprisings of 1968 as they happened. Mann adopted the protestors’ slogan, “Prenez une caméra et descendez dans la rue” (or “pick up a camera and take to the streets”), achieving what the American networks could not: He talked student leaders Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Alain Geismar and Alain Krivine into granting him interviews, edited into a segment called “Insurrection” and broadcast on NBC. Mann subsequently reshaped that footage into an abstract 8-minute short film (“Jaunpuri”), which screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1971.\n\t\n\n\tSkip forward 10 years, and Mann was invited to world premiere his first theatrical movie, “Thief,” in competition at Cannes — quite an honor for a helmer so early in his career. “At that time, ‘The Jericho Mile,’ which is the Movie of the Week I did before ‘Thief,’ got theatrical distribution and was playing on the Champs-Élysées down the street from ‘Thief,’” Mann explains. “It was completely bizarre, particularly in those years when you couldn’t make a movie on an iPhone, after a decade or more of trying to get a film made, to have two of them [released] at the same time.”\n\t\n\n\tHosted by Cannes chief Thierry Frémaux, the Festival Lumière will screen all 12 of Mann’s theatrical features this week, before presenting him with the Lumière Award, following a master class on Friday, Oct. 17. The retrospective will also include his pilot for the Max series “Tokyo Vice” — the apotheosis of where Mann’s elevated aesthetic and commitment to authenticity intersect — and “The Jericho Mile,” a sports movie shot inside Folsom Prison featuring real inmates as extras.\n\n\t“Human intelligence does not diminish when you confine a geographical space. If anything, the opposite happens,” says Mann, who was impressed by the prisoners’ interest in the craft. The director remembers one who asked him questions for half an hour, by the end of which he understood the principles of blocking and coverage.\n\n\tThe production arranged for several inmates to get Taft-Hartley permits, Mann explains, “which meant they got SAG minimum, on their commissary as opposed to making, you know, three cents an hour stamping license plates or something.” The one condition: There couldn’t be a race war between Folsom’s three gangs — the Black Guerrilla Family, the Bluebirds (a precursor to the white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood) and “La eMe,” Mexican Mafia — or the warden would pull the plug.\n\n\tThree minutes into the movie, a member of the Black Brotherhood tells a journalist, “Everything’s for real. That’s our motto,” and while that isn’t exactly Mann’s mantra, the sentiment certainly aligns with his commitment to authenticity.\n\n\t“The real is where I go. That’s where richness is for me: in real people, real circumstances, real trials and emotional tidal waves that happen to people,” Mann says. That applies whether he’s telling contemporary stories such as “The Jericho Mile” and “The Insider” or adapting a work of historical fiction, à la “The Last of the Mohicans.”\n\n\tFor that film — a pre-revolutionary American epic starring Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe — Mann not only insisted on period-accurate set dressing and wardrobe, but also endeavored to channel the psychology of the time: What a young woman growing up in London’s updwardly mobile Portman Square neighborhood in 1757, would have thought, what kind of music she might have listened to (the answer: Handel) and so on.\n\t\n\n\t“The Insider” was inspired by Mann’s friendship with Lowell Bergman, the “60 Minutes” producer (so ferociously embodied by Al Pacino) whose bombshell segment featuring a Big Tobacco whistle-blower spooked the upper ranks of CBS. Mann had been talking to Bergman about other projects when the network self-censored his interview with Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe in “The Insider”), giving him personal insight into a big-business scandal.\n\n\t“Whether I’m doing ‘Manhunter’ or ‘Heat 2’ or ‘The Insider,’ it’s the deep dive into real people … what it felt to be in their shoes and look through their eyes,” Mann says. “That’s what occupies me in the writing or the preparatory stage of it, and that’s where I find things that you cannot make up.”\n\n\tIn the case of “Manhunter,” Mann had been in contact with a convicted killer named Dennis Wayne Wallace, around whom he was trying to write an original screenplay, when he read Thomas Harris’ “Red Dragon.” The novel presented Mann with a plot in which to place his character, overwriting Harris’ ideas for “the Tooth Fairy” serial killer Francis Dollarhyde with details that interested Mann about Wallace, who had a fantasy relationship with a woman.\n\n\tWallace had told Mann that their love song (in the killer’s imagination, at least) was “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” which is why the director used that music over the end credits. More important still was Dollarhyde’s dark humor, also drawn from Mann’s correspondence with someone who had truly been capable of such crimes. “Just because something’s real doesn’t mean you have to use it,” Mann clarifies. The director, who defined the ultra-stylized ’80s look of “Miami Vice” and brought a similarly heightened aesthetic to “Manhunter,” famously fills entire notebooks with the research and background material that go into preparing each project.\n\n\tIn “Thief,” he cast John Santucci, the thief on whom James Caan’s title character was based, as a corrupt cop. But his commitment to authenticity went one step further: “All the props in ‘Thief’ weren’t props. They were all his burglary tools,” Mann says. The thermal lance Caan uses to penetrate the safe was Santucci’s own burning bar. Other facets, like problems the characters had with wives and kids came from Mann’s interviewing Santucci and immersing himself in the man’s life. (Mann helped him get a SAG card and made him a series regular on his series “Crime Story” in the late ’80s.)\n\t\n\n\tIn studying both criminals and law enforcement officers over the years, Mann has repeatedly been fascinated by both the complexities and contradictions in their personalities. “I’ve interacted with some spectacular people in law enforcement who do things that are quite incredible and so complicated, they could be CEOs of major Fortune 500 companies, and nobody will know because they’re taking down Khun Sa, who was responsible for producing 65% of the world’s heroin.”\n\n\tMann invites interactions with anyone who could potentially be a character, adapting their life experience into details for his movies. Perhaps the most impactful example is Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson, whose experience informed aspects of Mann’s spectacular 1995 crime film “Heat.” Adamson once told Mann about how he’d sat down to coffee with Neil McCauley, a highline professional thief he later killed in a shootout — the basis of a dramatic tête-à-tête between Pacino and Robert De Niro in what has arguably become the director’s most iconic scene.\n\n\tAccording to Mann, Adamson highly respected his quarry. “When he met him, he realized they had a kind of unique rapport. He really liked this guy, and at the same time, as he put it, he’d blow him out of his socks without thinking twice about it.” Mann appreciated that paradox and understood why McCauley might agree to meet with Adamson at the Belden Deli on Clark St. in Chicago. It was a way for both men to assess one another, since they understood — as the audience does in “Heat” — that they were on a collision course where only one would walk away alive.\n\n\tI’m partial to the terse, reality-based psychology of “The Insider” and “Thief,” and the sleek, darker-than-noir elegance of “Collateral.” Still, “Heat” is Mann’s most elaborate film — in terms of both logistics and the sheer breadth of its ensemble — and the one many consider to be his masterpiece. In making it, Mann issued a challenge to himself: Could he construct a vast panoply of three-dimensional people (where even the most minor supporting characters have fully imagined lives) and program a meticulously precise structure that brings everything to that explosive collision?\n\n\tNo wonder it’s the only sequel he intends to make. The way Mann works, his characters are so fully realized that their lives seem to continue even when the cameras aren’t rolling. It’s only a matter of time before they do on “Heat 2” (which picks up right after the original with Val Kilmer’s character, Chris Shiherlis, a role Leonardo DiCaprio has reportedly been considering). The novel’s been published, and the notebook is being prepared. Because when Mann calls “action,” he means it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKirsten Storms offered “General Hospital” fans an update on her health Monday evening, sharing that she is scheduled for a surgical coiling procedure “sometime in the next two weeks” to address a brain aneurysm that her doctors discovered in a January scan.\n\n\tIn a statement on social media, the longtime soap actress, who has been featured on “General Hospital” for 20 years, wrote that the discovery “majorly freaked” her out. She added that she “wanted to post this because even though my brain seems to be sorta lowkey rebelling against me, it does allow me to understand that we’ve all got times when things aren’t great. If we can, we will do our best to do what is best for ourselves and loved ones.” \n\t\n\n\tPer the Mayo Clinic, a coiling procedure involves “feeding a soft, flexible wire into the aneurysm via a catheter. The wire coils inside the aneurysm and seals off the aneurysm from the artery.” The surgery is done as a preventative to keep the aneurysm from rupturing. \n\n\n\tStorms also addressed a false online rumor that Storms had been hospitalized in January because she “tried to ‘unalive'” herself, when she was actually meeting with her neurosurgeon for a brain scan to monitor a cyst. “I couldn’t understand why a person would make up something that terrible, when they had no idea why I was really there,” she wrote. “There are a few really bad apples out there”\n\n\tStorms took a hiatus from “General Hospital” to move from Los Angeles to Tennessee in July, with her role of Maxie being temporarily played by Nicole Paggi.\n\n\t“Since the January scan showed a new, but *very small*, squatter (aka cyst) on my brain stem – it was clear I needed [to] change some things in my life asap,” Storms wrote in her most recent post. “For my own personal reasons, no longer living in Los Angeles was very important to me. The biggest reason for the move was [my daughter] Harper, but a lot of it was for my physical and mental health.” \n\t\n\n\tStorms previously underwent a craniotomy in 2021 for the removal of noncancerous cysts from her brain.\n\n\tStorms has since returned to “General Hospital” in pre-taped scenes, but she remains on leave from the long-running series. In prior social posts, the actress has floated that she could be “back in December, maybe November.” She first joined the soap in May 2005. \n",

    "body": "\n\tD’Angelo, who died Tuesday at the age of just 51, was indisputably a musical genius, but he didn’t leave much behind: Just three studio albums and an under-the-radar live disc over the course of two decades, and a handful of remixes and loose tracks. So a “10 greatest songs” (out of maybe 35 original compositions) seems kind of pointless — just cue up any of a dozen “greatest hits” playlists and click.\n\n\tBut his discography is deep enough to hold some buried treasure, and we’ll throw in some rarities like his live sets with Questlove — which were mostly soul covers from the ‘60s and ‘70s — and the “Soul Blends” cassette, which was the first whiff we got of “Voodoo” back in the fall of 1999 when a then-little-known New York DJ named Mark Ronson made a mixtape of several of its songs.\n\t\n\n\tScroll down as we go deep into the crates and uncover for some vintage deep cuts from one of the leading lights of R&B.\n\n\n\n\n\t“I Found My Smile Again” (1995)\n\n\tAn outtake from “Brown Sugar” and a rare unreleased D’Angelo original, this song — which premiered on the soundtrack of the 1996 blockbuster “Space Jam” film — only saw the light of day because, according to Questlove, the film’s producers blanched at the song they originally submitted: an early version of “Playa Playa,” which was finally released on “Voodoo” nearly four years later (which gives a sense of how long “Voodoo” was in the oven). The song fits in perfectly with “Brown Sugar” and would slot nicely between sides one and two.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t“Can’t Hide Love” (live 1995)\n\n\tThe “Live at the Jazz Cafe” EP was such a low-key release that many people didn’t know it existed before it was re-released in 2014. The album was originally an EP, then re-released in Japan with a bonus cut, and finally the full set, nearly 20 years after it was recorded. But this September 1995 set, captured live shortly after the release of D’Angelo’s debut, finds him in full flight as a 21-year-old, with his paramour at the time, the late Angie Stone, delivering stellar backing vocals. The album includes three covers — his take on Smokey Robinson’s “Cruisin’,” also featured on “Brown Sugar”; the Ohio Players’ “Heaven Must Be Like This,” only on the Japanese version; and finally this faithful but stunning take on Earth Wind & Fire’s classic “Can’t Hide Love.”\n\n\n\n\n\t“Heaven Must Be Like This” (live 1995)\n\n\tAnother “Jazz Café” track, this Ohio Players cover was originally relegated to the Japanese version of the EP and is curiously not available on the otherwise-full version of the album or Spotify, suggesting that D’Angelo himself was unhappy with the track. It’s hard to understand why he would be: It’s a beautifully sung version, featuring raindrop-like electric piano, a full horn section and some gorgeous backing vocals from Stone.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Me and Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine” Def Squad remix / DJ Premier remix (1996)\n\n\tThe one full collaboration between D’Angelo and the great DJ Premier, “Devil’s Pie” (originally released on the “Best Man” soundtrack two years before it appeared on “Voodoo”) was enough to have fans thirsting in vain for more. But lurking deep in the crates on vintage EMI Records 12” singles are some remixes from D’s first album, including ten different mixes of one of his all-time great love songs, “Me and Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine” (guess they had bigger budgets back then). It’s an embarrassment of riches, but the two winners are the DJ Premier remix and the even more innovative “Def Squad Remix,” featuring Erick Sermon and Redman.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Your Precious Love” with Erykah Badu (1996)\n\n\tThis cover of the 1967 Marvin Gaye-Tammi Terrell duet, featured on the “High School High” soundtrack, was recorded well before these two stellar singers became neo-soul icons. It sticks closely to the original arrangement, but the two deliver the song — a classic from the Ashford and Simpson catalog — with the reverence it deserves.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Girl You Need a Change of Mind” (1996)\n\n\tAnother cover, this one by original Temptations member Eddie Kendricks, from his second solo album, 1973’s “People… Hold on.” This is the classic-soul D’Angelo that fans jones for, complete with string stabs at the end and stellar falsetto; it’s of a piece with “Brown Sugar” but already anticipating the hard funk of “Voodoo.” From Spike Lee’s 1996 film “Get on the Bus” about a group of Black men traveling cross-country to participate in the Million Man March.\n\n\n\n\n\t“She’s Always in My Hair” (1997)\n\n\tIt’s surprising that D’Angelo didn’t record more Prince covers, given the vast influence and his reverence for the man, but it figures that when he did, he’d dig deep into the crates. This psychedelicized track — the 1985 B-side of “Raspberry Beret,” fact fans — is one of the best of Prince’s many non-LP tracks, and was often performed live during D’Angelo’s “Brothers in Arms” jams with Questlove.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Everybody Loves the Sunshine” (1999)\n\n\tThis is probably the best known song by the great jazz musician Roy Ayers (although there are many great ones). Recorded by D’Angelo with Questlove and released as the B-side of the European CD single of “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” the song is perhaps deservedly obscure , as the two are just jamming tentatively on the track. It’s not as strong as the other songs on this list (but hopefully compensated by the bonus track at the end.)\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t“Glass Mountain Trust” with Mark Ronson (2010)\n\n\tThis bizarre track from Ronson’s oddly obscure third solo album “Record Collection” may be the deepest cut here: The album doesn’t come up in Ronson’s Spotify discography (it’s credited to “Mark Ronson and the Business Intl”) and is one of the strangest songs in both of their catalogs. Led by blaring ‘80s synthesizers and a pounding beat, the song features a distorted lead vocal from D’Angelo, who accompanies himself on multitracked backing vocals with the occasional soul shriek thrown in for good measure.\n\n\n\n\n\tQuestlove and D’Angelo SuperJam (live at Bonnaroo Festival, 2012)\n\n\tThe “Brothers in Arms” played several public jams on classic R&B covers during this era, at least two of which (witnessed by this writer) were a bit disorganized and shambolic. However, for this set at Bonnaroo, they delivered the goods: With a directive not to play any D’Angelo or Roots songs, they were accompanied by a stellar hybrid band featuring virtuoso bassist Pino Palladino, Time guitarist Jesse Johnson, members of the Roots, D’Angelo’s Vanguard and even longtime Prince saxophonist Eric Leeds. The all-star group tore up covers of songs by the Funkadelic, the Ohio Players, Jimi Hendrix, Sly & the Family Stone, Prince (of course), the Time and even Led Zeppelin and the Beatles. Highlights are featured in this multi-part mini-documentary about the set.\n\n\n\n\n\tBONUS:\n\n\t“Nothing Even Matters” with Lauryn Hill (1998)\n\n\tIt’s absurd to call a song from one of the top-selling albums in history a “deep cut,” yet this soulful duet is tucked away as track 12 on “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” and is often overlooked. The two harmonize beautifully, freestyling over the song’s last couple of minutes, underpinned by D’Angelo’s unmistakable electric piano embellishments. The mutual admiration was real: Hill wrote just a few hours after his death was announced: “I regret not having more time with you. Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world… You sir, moved us, stirred us, inspired and even intimidated others to action with your genius.”\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohn Candy’s son, Chris, said during a recent event promoting the new documentary “John Candy: I Like Me” (via People) that it was “heart-wrenching” to see resurfaced press interviews in the film where journalists openly mocked Candy’s weight to his face.\n\n\t“I was kind of shocked to see how interviewers treat him,” Chris said. “That was just kind of heart-wrenching. And I also could see how he got more frustrated and he found ways to deal with that… I learned through the process of this [documentary] that he was so nervous about eating in front of people because of paparazzi. He developed a poor eating habit where he’d be like, ‘Alright, well I’m not going to eat all day. I’m going to eat at night.’”\n\t\n\n\tChris continued, “When I hear stories like that I just felt so bad for him because it’s like, ‘How cornered are you?’ And you really want in those moments, as his son or as his friend, to be able to grab him by his shoulders and say, ‘Why the fuck do you have to do this? Just who cares? Have a sandwich and get mad about it.’”\n\n\n\t“John Candy: I Like Me” hails from director Colin Hanks and producer Ryan Reynolds. The movie, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival before making its streaming debut Oct. 10 on Amazon Prime Video, contains many examples of interviewers essentially calling Candy “fat” to his face during press junkets. \n\n\t“You look at interview after interview and horrible things are being said and questions are being asked in incredibly insensitive ways,” Hanks told Variety before the film’s TIFF premiere. “It’s tough to see how uncomfortable John was in almost every clip. And he had good reason, because some of the things that people said were disgusting and would not be tolerated today.”\n\t\n\n\tReynolds revealed during a Q&A at TIFF that he personally called one of the journalists who mocked Candy‘s weight after seeing archival footage of the insulting incident while working on the documentary as a producer.\n\n\t“There was a lot of things we left out of the documentary, journalists just saying stuff. One of them I called,” Reynolds said about the journalist who was caught on camera making inflammatory comments about Candy’s weight. “I didn’t put it in the movie, but I called this journalist just to see.”\n\n\t“I wasn’t trying to shame him or teach him a lesson,” Reynolds continued. “[I told him] I took it out of the movie, but I’d put it in the movie if you wanted to talk about it, because maybe you have something to say about it, about your journey whenever it comes to something like that. We had such a thoughtful conversation about it.”\n\n\t“John Candy: I Like Me” includes interviews with dozens of the late comedian’s former co-stars, including Eugene Levy, Martin Short, Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Catherine O’Hara. The movie is now streaming on Prime Video.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaurie Metcalf’s four decades-long acting career spans comedy and drama across television, film and stage. However there’s one dream she has yet to fulfill.\n\n\t“I’ve always wanted to do a musical,” Metcalf tells me. “But my range of notes is only about seven notes. It would have to be an extremely specific part. I don’t know if that would ever be in my future, but I think it would be such a rush to be in a musical.\n\n\n\t“I’m going to start manifesting it,” she adds with a laugh.\n\t\n\n\tMetcalf is currently on Broadway in the preview run of Samuel D. Hunter’s “Little Bear Ridge Road,” a family drama about a woman (Metcalf) who reunites with her estranged nephew (Micah Stock). Opening Oct. 30 at the Booth Theatre, the play marks Metcalf’s seventh collaboration with director Joe Mantello.\n\n\t“I’m a little tired, but this is my favorite place to be,” Metcalf, who earned Tonys in 2017 and 2018 for her work in “A Doll’s House, Part 2” and “Three Tall Women,” tells me over the phone on a recent Friday afternoon. “We have two previews under our belt and I’m going in for notes this afternoon. We’re fine-tuning things. This is my happy spot.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLaurie Metcalf and Micah Stock in “Little Bear Ridge Road.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto: Julieta Cervantes\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Little Bear Ridge Road” comes on the heels of the release of “Monster: The Ed Gein Story,” the Netflix series starring Charlie Hunnam as serial killer Ed Gein’s and Metcalf as his domineering and religious fanatic mother Augusta Gein. After co-creators Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan pitched her the project, “I agreed to do it without even having seen a script,” Metcalf recalls.\n\t\n\n\tThis latest installment of Murphy’s “Monster” franchise focuses on Ed’s relationship with his mother and how her abusive actions may have contributed to his horrifying killing spree in the mid-1950s. “It’s nature versus nurture, right?” Metcalf says. “I think it’s both cases for him.”\n\n\tOne of the series’ most powerful and disturbing scenes shows Augusta scolding a grown-up Ed as he stands in front of her completely naked. “I’m sitting in that chair looking at a grown man, but I’m lecturing him like he was seven years old,” Metcalf explains. “I’m not seeing him as a grown man, but seeing him still under my care and under my sick supervision. It’s a mother-son teaching experience. It’s simplistic, but warped. But mentally, it was helpful to see him like that.”\n\n\tMetcalf gives high praise to director Max Winkler. “Despite the subject matter and the tone of the series, the shooting space was really fun,” she says. “It’s hard to picture that sort of work being fun, but it was because it was very collaborative. Max is so open to accidents that might happen in the scene. He would feed me things in between takes that we could do. Some he used, some he didn’t. I really liked working that way. The job itself was a wonderful set to be on, despite how dark it is.”\n\n\tAfter filming “Monster” and a week before heading back to Broadway, Metcalf wrapped her next television project, Dan Levy and Rachel Sennott’s eight-episode Netflix mob comedy “Big Mistakes” about two siblings (Levy and Taylor Ortega) who are caught up in organized crime. Metcalf plays their mother. \n\n\t“I read the pilot, and then I wrote my agent immediately saying, ‘100% want to do this,’” says Metcalf, who earned three Emmys for her work on “Roseanne” and another for a guest spot on “Hacks.” “I saw how unique it was for a single camera, half-hour comedy.”\n\n\tI tell Metcalf that I grew up in a mob neighborhood in Queens, NY. “You’re gonna like this,” she says. “It’s very, very funny and very unexpected. I don’t think the audience ever gets out ahead of where it’s going.”\n\n",

None of us really saw this coming.\"\n      \n\n          As you know ... Greenberg was a 27-year-old Philadelphia teacher found dead by her fiancé ... she'd been stabbed 20 times in the back of her neck and head, with a knife protruding from her chest. While her death was initially determined to be a homicide, an assistant medical examiner ruled it was suicide.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Now -- following pressure from Greenberg's family to revisit the case -- Philadelphia's Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lindsay Simon has doubled down ... completely baffling Morgan.\n      \n    \n          \"It's biomechanically implausible,\" he tells us before adding, \"There's no indication she was in some mental state where she would react in this frenzied manner.\"\n      \n    \n          Morgan -- who's worked for law enforcement in New Orleans and Atlanta -- also says at some point a neuropathologist observed the samples of Greenberg's brain stem, concluding that in that area -- where the knife had passed through -- there was no hemorrhage.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He says, \"That leads us, scientifically, to conclude that this is potentially a post-mortem injury.\"\n      \n    \n          According to Morgan, officials could stand to be more transparent regarding the case ... \"There's never been a presser where these people have been asked questions specifically about this. Explain your rationale for this, because we want to understand.\"\n      \n    \n          TMZ reached out to the Medical Examiner for an explanation on how they think Ellen could've done it herself ... so far, no word back.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

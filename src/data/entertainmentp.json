    "body": "\n\tIceland’s prominent production banner Glassriver has partnered with Italian sales company True Colours on a new Nordic psychological thriller series titled “Brkn,” about an investigation into the disappearance of a nonbinary teenager to be adapted from Jón Atli Jónasson’s novel “Brotin.”\n\n\tJón Atli Jónasson (pictured above) is a novelist, playwright and screenwriter known for co-writing 2013’s Oscar shortlisted “The Deep” and Finnish-German crime series “Arctic Circle,” among other titles. He is co-creating the high-profile “Brkn” show with theater director Thorleifur Örn Arnarsson and screenwriter, novelist and musician Margrét Örnólfsdóttir (“The Valhalla Murders,” “Trapped, Fanger”).\n\t\n\n\tThe Reykjavik-set psychological thriller turns on female and male police officers Dóra and Rado, who are investigating the disappearance of a nonbinary teenager named Morgan. Their search turns into a high-stakes case involving “a complex web of organized crime, corporate power and police corruption,” according to the synopsis. Dóra had recently returned to duty after “a traumatic incident” in which she got shot in the head while attempting to prevent her boyfriend’s suicide, the synopsis adds. Meanwhile, members of Rado’s family emerge as suspects.\n\n\n\tGlassriver has sealed a global distribution deal on “Brkn” with True Colours, which will handle the international distribution of the series that is currently in development.\n\n\tTrue Colours, which is is co-owned by Italy’s Indigo Film and Lucky Red, is branching out from feature films into the TV content space under the new management of Elliot Gustin-Hollman, formerly with Paris-based distribution powerhouse Newen Connect.\n\t\n\n\tThe “Brkn” series is the latest addition to Glassriver’s current slate comprising “Avalanche,” which is a co-production with Finland’s Whatevergroup; the recently optioned “Konráð” book series from popular Icelandic author Arnaldur Indriðason, which is being adapted for the screen; and the comedy drama “Hot Stuff,” which is a coproduction with Romania’s IDEA Film currently in production.\n\n\t“‘Brkn’ pushes the boundaries of the Nordic crime genre and represents the distinctive and original storytelling that we champion at Glassriver,” said the company’s co-owner Andri Ómarsson in a statement. “We are delighted to be partnering with True Colours, as we continue to share bold and unique stories from Iceland with the world.”\n\n\tCommented Gustin: “One year after launching our series distribution business, we are delighted to be partnering with Glassriver. This demonstrates our ability as an independent distributor to support bold, high-quality projects. ‘Brkn’ is a series with tremendous potential, and we firmly believe it will have international acclaim and success.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” is off to a roaring start at the box office, earning $39.5 million in its first full day of release. \n\n\tAnd the Disney animated sequel isn’t the only follow-up film feasting at the Thanksgiving box office. “Wicked: For Good” brought in $17.2 million, bringing its stateside gross to $194.6 million. Unsurprisingly, Universal, which brought the Broadway musical to the big screen, has said it wants to find a way to extend the franchise and make more movies about Oz. “Wicked: For Good” should add more than $90 million to its haul to push its domestic total to nearly $270 million. \n\t\n\n\t“Zootopia 2,” a buddy cop movie with anthropomorphic animals as the bickering partners, is expected to collect $125 million to $150 million over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, to take the box office crown.\n\n\n\tThat’s a massive opening, even though it will probably will fall short of the record set by 2024’s “Moana 2,” which earned $139 million over the traditional weekend and $225 million over the five days. Other  Thanksgiving all-stars include Disney’s 2019 sequel “Frozen II” ($125 million over the five days) and 2013’s “Hunger Games: Catching Fire” ($109 million over the five days). But for exhibitors, who have endured a punishing fall filled with flop films like “The Smashing Machine” and “Tron: Ares,” the arrival of another “Zootopia” and more Elphaba and Glinda finally gives them a reason to be thankful. \n\n\tThe second “Zootopia” should also dominate the international box office, earning $41.6 million to push its global total to $81.1 million. It is projected to pull in an additional $135 million to $145 million from foreign markets over its first five days of release. The film launched on Wednesday in China, where Shanghai Disneyland recently debuted a Zootopia Land, and Korea to huge results. In China, “Zootopia 2” scored the 10th highest opening day ever for a U.S. release with $33.7 million, becoming one of the few Hollywood films to resonate at the Chinese box office since COVID. Since the pandemic, the country’s local-language films have been far more popular than U.S.-backed pictures. \n\t\n\n\tDirected by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, “Zootopia 2” follows a rabbit police officer (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist fox (Jason Bateman) as they reunite to pursue a mysterious new reptilian resident (Ke Huy Quan). Variety’s chief film critic Peter Debruge praised “Zootopia 2” as a “worthy successor,” and most reviewers agreed, handing the film an impressive 94% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes. \n\n\tElsewhere, A24’s “Eternity,”  a rom-com set in the afterlife that stars Elizabeth Olsen, Miles Teller, and Callum Turner, debuted to $1.4 million from 1,348 screens, while Focus Features’ “Hamnet,” a drama about William Shakespeare dealing with personal tragedy, opened to $330,000 from 160 locations. “Hamnet” is considered to be an Oscar frontrunner, with critics lavishing praise on the work of director Chloe Zhao and stars Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal. \n\n\tTicket sales should dip on Thanksgiving day as people celebrate with their families and stream “Stranger Things,” but audiences tend to hit up the multiplex on Black Friday and through the weekend. \n",

    "body": "\n\tInternational Film Festival Rotterdam has unveiled its selection of 21 feature projects for the 43rd edition of CineMart, its co-production market, running Feb. 1 to 4, as well as 10 projects for its work-in-progress platform Darkroom.\n\n\tCommenting on the CineMart lineup, Marten Rabarts, head of IFFR Pro, said: “The urgency is palpable: from stories grappling with war and displacement to narratives exploring climate change, queerness and the struggle to define and preserve identities in turbulent times, all amongst bold cinematic creativity and forays into genres including sci-fi, horror and musical.”\n\t\n\n\tThe CineMart selection includes the comedy “The Dispute” by debut U.S. directors Andrea Ellsworth and Kasey Elise Walker, which has been acquired by Riley Keough’s Felix Culpa and Donald Glover’s Gilga for feature development. As well as directing the film, Ellsworth and Walker wrote the script, and will also co-star. Gemma Doll-Grossman is the DP.\n\n\n\tThe film follows two best friends from South Central, down on their luck and desperate for more, who take a chance encounter as an invitation to trade their dead-end lives in Los Angeles for something new. When chaos ensues during their seemingly lucrative adventure, they realize the true cost of their actions.\n\n\tEllsworth is an actress and filmmaker, who stars as Deja in “The Vince Staples Show” on Netflix. Walker is a writer-director-actress, whose directorial debut, short film “Hoop Dreams,” premiered at Tribeca Festival after winning the Soho Script Lab.\n\n\tThe project was selected for this year’s Sundance Institute Directors and Screenwriters Lab.\n\t\n\n\tAlso selected for CineMart is “Worse Together,” an exploration of trans friendship by Canadian filmmaker Luis De Filippis (“Something You Said Last Night,” IFFR Youth Jury Award, 2023).\n\n\tJapanese filmmaker Tanaka Toshihiko (“Rei,” IFFR, 2024) is also a returning IFFR award-winner, with his next film “Shumari,” which is set in Japan’s remote northern frontier.\n\n\tFurther selections from Asia include filmmaker Lê Bảo with the poetic, touching portrait “Hearing,” following his Berlinale Encounters Special Jury Award-winning “Taste” (2021); alongside Kang Bo’s horrific, fantastical vision of the forests of north eastern China in “Kingdom of the Insomniacs,” and the sci-fi queer rom-com “Noodles, Our Love Was Instant and Forever” by debut Filipino filmmaker Whammy Alcazaren (“Bold Eagle,” best international short at the Fantasia Film Festival, 2023).\n\n\tAdditional selections include the fifth feature from Spanish filmmaker Lois Patiño (“Ariel,” IFFR, 2025) titled “Adarna” and set in the Philippines, and the comedic “Portuguese Man O’ War” by Ridham Janve (“The Gold-Laden Sheep & the Sacred Mountain,” IFFR, 2018). A further colonial period piece comes from South Africa in “Pale Faces,” by debut filmmaker Chantel Clark.\n\n\tLebanese filmmakers and artists Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige present “Beirut Baby,” with their previous works including “Perfect Day” (Locarno, 2005, Fipresci Prize), “Je Veux Voir” (Cannes, 2008), and “Memory Box” (CineMart, 2016, Berlinale, 2021). Egyptian filmmaker Morad Mostafa (“Aisha Can’t Fly Away,” Un Certain Regard, Cannes, 2025) presents his second feature “Animals,” meanwhile set in Russia at war, Nicolas Graux will showcase “The Son of the Poet” (Porcupine, IFFR, 2023 co-dir. Trương Minh Quý).\n\n\tSeveral filmmakers in the selection explore the complexities of relationships and belonging through intimate personal journeys, including “Lux,” the debut from Danish filmmaker Thomas Elley (“Europa Endlos,” CPH:DOX, 2025); “When the Goats Came” from New Zealand filmmaker Arthur Elias Gay; and “After the Night, the Night,” the feature debut by Swiss-Dutch artist and filmmaker Naomi Pacifique (“Looking She Said I Forget,” Locarno, 2024).\n\t\n\n\tNew for 2026, six of the CineMart titles have been selected for the inaugural CineMart x HBF lineup – a curated strand of projects previously awarded development support by IFFR’s Hubert Bals Fund.\n\n\tThe six projects include Martika Ramirez Escobar’s “Daughters of the Sea,” which intertwines three stories; two Brazilian projects – Lillah Hallah’s surrealist satire “Golden Balls” and “Neon Phantom” by Leonardo Martinelli, a follow-up to the award-winning short of the same name; alongside Senegalese filmmaker Mamadou Dia’s latest project “Coumba,” following his HBF-backed debut, “Nafi’s Father” (IFFR, 2020), winning the Pardo d’Oro in Locarno’s Cineasti del Presente section in 2019. The love story “Birdwoman” by Indian feature debut filmmaker Lipika Singh Darail; and “Vika,” which resonates with ongoing conflicts around the world, by Tamar Shavgulidze, complete the lineup.\n\n\tDarkroom presents recently or nearly completed films to the international industry seeking gap or completion funding, sales agents and festivals with the support of expert consultancy. Each project has either an attached Rotterdam Lab graduate producer or received previous support from CineMart or the Hubert Bals Fund.\n\n\tSelections include Brazilian filmmakers Laís Santos Araújo and Pethrus Tibúrcio (“Tell Her What Happened to Me,” IFFR, 2025), who co-direct the Hubert Bals Fund-supported and CineMart-presented coming-of-age drama “Marina”; Èlia Gasull Balada and Matteo Norzi present the hybrid documentary “The Hummingbird Paints Fragrant Songs,” and Costa Rican filmmaker Neto Villalobos will bring the tropical dystopia “Amor Es El Monstruo.”\n\n\tFurther Darkroom projects include Mario Piredda returning with Sardinian road movie “Làstima,” alongside Víctor Moreno’s sci-fi “The Outside,” first presented at CineMart 2022. Two Dutch projects feature in the lineup: Mari Sanders returns to themes of disability and belonging with “Get Up Stand Up,” while Kenya-born Dutch filmmaker Amira Duynhouwer presents “Sugar.”\n\n\tRounding out the selected works are BAFTA New Talent award-nominee Joshua Loftin’s docu-fiction “LFD Hope”; Paris-based Korean artist and filmmaker Jeunghae Yim presenting “Sea, Star, Woman,” and Fil Ieropoulos’s (Avant-Drag!, IFFR 2024) experimental docu-essay “Uchronia: Parallel Histories of Queer Revolt.”\n\t\n\n\tThe IFFR Pro Awards will recognize projects from the CineMart and Darkroom selections and will be presented on the evening of Feb. 4.\n\n\tAdditionally, the festival has announced that next year’s immersive media projects will be presented under Lightroom, IFFR’s new industry platform for immersive storytelling. Lightroom brings together all XR, VR and interactive projects previously presented across CineMart and Darkroom, creating one unified space for immersive work.\n\n\tEllen Kuo, formerly of NewImages Festival and manager and curator at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, joins IFFR Pro as a consultant for Lightroom, working with IFFR’s Eva Langerak, who oversees both Art Directions and Lightroom. The selection of Lightroom projects will be announced next month.\n\n\tFull selection details below:CINEMARTAdarna, dir.

    "body": "\n\tWhen the British Independent Film Awards recently unveiled its list of 2025 nominees, there were cheers from within the U.K. industry over the number of first-time filmmakers dominating the categories. Akinola Davies Jr’s “My Father’s Shadow” and Harry Lighton’s “Pillion” — both feature debuts — led the pack of nominated films, while there was also plenty of love for actor-turned-filmmaker Harris Dickinson’s “Urchin” and Laura Carreira’s “On Falling.” \n\t\n\n\tWhichever way the trophies are handed out at the BIFAs ceremony this Sunday at London’s Roundhouse, having so many newcomers battling for the top gongs of best British independent film, best director and best screenplay fits right in the BIFA wheelhouse of supporting rising talent right at the start of their careers. \n\n\n\tBut amid the celebrations there were also murmurings of discontent on social media when it came to the lead and supporting performance categories, which have been gender-neutral starting with the 2022 awards. Of 12 slots available (six in each), women only managed to secure two spaces — Jennifer Lawrence for her lead role in “Die My Love” (amusingly the first BIFA nod for the Oscar winner and arguably one of the most famous Hollywood stars) and Maxine Peake for supporting in “I Swear.”\n\n\tThe BIFAs has often been trendsetters — or, as they often term it, “guinea pigs” — when it comes to categories. They were the first film awards in the U.K. to introduce a casting award, something later followed by the BAFTAs and — now — the Oscars. And while they can’t claim to be the first to introduce gender-neutral performance categories (although their breakthrough performance award has always been this way), its did announce its plans merely weeks before the Independent Spirit Awards said it intended to do the same. \n\t\n\n\tBut is this year’s male domination of those categories an indication that it’s a decision that needs to be reassessed? \n\n\tNot so, claim Deena Wallace and Amy Gustin, who co-head the BIFAs. In fact, they argue that the latest crop of performance nominations are a complete swing against the usual BIFA grain. \n\n\t“This is actually a massive anomaly for us,” says Gustin. “Normally it’s way the other way — and nobody bats an eyelid. Nobody says, look at these women shining through and the men not getting a look-in. But as soon as it’s the other way, the criticism comes.”\n\n\tThe stats don’t lie. Last year, for lead performance it was the exact opposite, with five women and one man. Overall, since it became gender-neutral, that category has served up 15 women nominated to five men (with all three winners women). In supporting, it’s 15 women nominated to 10 men (the category previously allowed for more nominees) — and in 2022 there was just one man among 8 women. There’s also the joint lead performance category — also added in 2022 — which this year includes four women and two men.\n\n\tIn fact, since BIFA’s 2022 gender-neutral switch, of the 67 performers nominated across lead, supporting and joint lead categories, there have been 39 women and 28 men, 58% in favour of women.\n\n\t“So actually this year is a bit correction,” says Wallace. “It gets us to closer to 50/50 over the three years. But it’s still not there yet.”\n\n\tLike all film awards bodies, the BIFAs are at the very end of the actual filmmaking process, with any notable gender skew more indicative of an industry issue or trend rather than any major fault of a voting system or category arrangement (although online critics rarely see it this way, as the BAFTAs can attest to following the #BAFTASoWhite backlash in 2020). 2025 may indeed be unusually man-heavy in terms of BIFA performance nominations, but Wallace notes that the 2025 submissions for those categories was unusually man-heavy — a figure that was “well over” 60% of the overall across lead, joint lead and supporting. \n\n\t“Who knows whether this is a trend, whether this is because there are more male led films being commissioned,” she adds. “But we are slightly able to be a canary in the coal mine for things like that. Where you have the two gender split categories, any trend like that is masked. We’ll have to wait and look back at it over a longer period, but you wouldn’t notice it if it was split.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd where many complaints about a male-skewed imbalance among nominees are often pegged to a body of voters that is overwhelmingly male, at the BIFAs — once again — it’s the opposite. “There are loads more women voting for the BIFAs than there are men,” asserts Wallace. This year, across more than 600 nominations voters, 58% percent are women, while in the performance subgroup that decides the nominees, 68% were women and non-binary. “So it’s not like there are loads of lads making all these decisions.”\n\n\tWhile there are no major tweaks to the main categories this year, there is a new addition in the form of the Cinema of the Year award, celebrating the best independent cinemas in the U.K. It’s not an award likely to be of much concern to watchers surveying the lay of the land as awards season shifts up a gear, but it’s an addition Gustin says was “massive” for the BIFAs, being their first ever public vote. \n\n\t“We just didn’t know if anyone would care or how familiar cinemas were with us,  and thought, maybe we’ll get 40 cinemas in,” she says. In the end, more than 130 applied. And when it came to the actual voting, more than 100,000 votes were submitted (putting to the test a bespoke system built by partners Print.Work).\n\n\t“But people weren’t just voting, but also leaving comments and love letters to their cinemas,” says Gustin. “We’ve been sending all the feedback back to the cinemas and they’re like ‘Oh my God, this is making me cry.’ So it’s been really nice and adorable.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tShu Qi arrived at the Singapore International Film Festival with the clarity of someone closing a long, emotionally taxing cycle. Her directorial debut “Girl” opened the festival the previous night, marking what she described as “the final stop” of a journey that has stretched from Venice to Busan and across two years of discussion. In Singapore, sitting with festival ambassador Rebecca Lim, Shu was unguarded, reflective and darkly funny about the pressures and revelations that came with stepping behind the camera for the first time.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been talking about ‘Girl’ since 2023,” she said, adding with mock-weariness that all she wants now is to “go home and sleep.” But the conversation quickly veered into what comes next. Shu openly acknowledged that she has thought about continuing the thematic arc. “I really did think about ‘Girl, Woman, Lady,’” she said. “This is something I’m planning.” By her own count, a film every 10 years would “take me into my eighties.”\n\n\n\tShe also addressed the question that has followed the film since Busan: the ending. Shu confirmed that she has considered cutting a director’s version. At Busan, she became too emotional to answer a question about it — not because she disagreed with her team, she clarified, but because she was unexpectedly moved. She explained that her original instinct was to end the story when the father character crashes his motorbike. “If there’s a chance, I might cut a director’s version,” she said.\n\n\tShu traced the film’s long development, which stretched over more than a decade. She recently rediscovered her earliest draft from 2013. “Every shot you see was something I had already gone through in my mind many times,” she said. Her years as an actor gave her a strategy when she felt overwhelmed: “I just acted the role of a director.”\n\t\n\n\tHer mentor, Hou Hsiao-hsien, was the catalyst. “Without director Hou, there would be no ‘Girl,’” she said. He asked her three separate times if she would consider directing — the third time convinced her. Shu also offered a rare update on his health: Hou is now ill and retired, with his family requesting distance and privacy, though he remains “very healthy and happy” in his daily life.\n\n\tWhen discussing the shoot, Shu spoke at length about how she built the world of late-1980s Taiwan for her actors. Young lead Bai Xiao-Ying gave up her mobile phone for three months to understand what childhood felt like in that era. For the mother role, played by 9m88, Shu recreated the textures of daily domestic life down to the switches, dish racks and the way a kettle was handled. She recalled watching 9m88 clean the entire onscreen home for a long take — a moment that made her unexpectedly tear up behind the monitor. “That was when I realised how hard being a housewife is.”\n\n\tShu’s candour extended to the hardest parts of the film: childhood trauma, cycles of violence and the inherited wounds that shape three generations – grandmother, mother and daughter. She said she only realised after completing the film that the mother, too, “was once a girl,” a shift that allowed her to understand her own parents “a little more.”\n\n\tShe also addressed how she handles scrutiny, delivering the line that drew the loudest reaction: “I ignore them. Life is your own. You make your own choices.” She reads comments, she said, but refuses to be ruled by them.\n\n\tHumor threaded through the evening. Shu described herself as “a positive person… maybe a little hyperactive,” laughed about the relief of not dieting or wearing makeup as a director, and recounted her long record of personal reinvention — running away from home as a teenager, moving alone to Hong Kong, relearning Mandarin to work in China. “If I think of something I must do, I immediately execute it,” she said.\n\n\tOne of the night’s most unexpected reveals came when Shu described scouting a bridge for the film — only to realise it was the same one she walked across in Hou Hsiao-hsien’s “Millennium Mambo.” The symmetry startled her. “It’s destiny,” she said. “A connection with director Hou.”\n\t\n\n\tAs the session closed, Lim thanked her for the courage reflected on screen. Shu, in turn, said she hopes “Girl” gives anyone living with pain the strength to move forward: “Even if life is hard now, the good days will slowly come.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTurkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan has responded to criticism regarding his participation in Iran‘s government-run Fajr Film Festival, saying that it should not be considered a show of support for the Iranian regime.\n\n\tBilge Ceylan, winner of the Cannes Palme d’Or in 2014 for “Winter Sleep” among many other accolades, came under fire earlier this week from the Iranian Independent Filmmakers Association (IIFMA) which, in an open letter, asked the prominent director to reconsider his participation in the fest being held in Iran’s southwestern city of Shiraz. Celyan is presiding over the festival’s jury.\n\t\n\n\tIIFMA — which is headed by Dubai-based dissident Iranian producer Kaveh Farnam — claimed Bilge Ceylan’s participation “effectively strengthens the images the government seeks to present of the country’s cultural situation — images that do not align with the actual experiences of those facing censorship, repression and constraint.”\n\n\n\tThe IIFMA open letter noted that recently Iranian security forces have killed hundreds of dissident protesters in various crackdowns, most notably during the nationwide “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement in 2022-2023.\n\n\t“After the widespread suppression of public protests during the ‘Woman, Life, Freedom’ movement, the Islamic Republic has tried to normalize everything by holding state-organized events and ceremonies,” IIFMA went on to point out. “Among these, the Fajr Film Festival has been one of the most important showcases for this effort, a showcase that today holds little significance for a large portion of the Iranian artistic community.”\n\t\n\n\tBilge Ceylan — whose works besides “Winter Kills” also comprise “Three Monkeys” (2008), “Once Upon a Time in Anatolia” (2011), “The Wild Pear Tree” (2018) and, more recently, “About Dry Grasses” (2023) – in a statement countered that “boycotting a festival can of course be understood as a form of resistance, yet depriving the people who live there of the films to be shown or of encounters of this kind, for any reason, feels like punishing them, and that does not seem right to me.”\n\n\tBelow is Bilge Ceylan’s full statement to Variety on the controversy.\n\n\t“The Fajr Film Festival has been around for at least 40 years. Like many filmmakers, I have come here many times. I met [Theo] Angelopoulos here, and I received an award from Béla Tarr’s jury here. Just a few months ago, I also gave a masterclass in Tehran, where I realized how valuable such encounters are for young filmmakers and film students living in Iran. I witnessed an extraordinary spark in the youth —something I have rarely seen elsewhere. Iran is a dynamic society, and it has a remarkable cinema from which I have learned a great deal. Filmmakers living in Iran — who, no matter how difficult and complicated their circumstances may be, continue trying to make films and searching for a way forward— need hope and gatherings like these even more than others. Boycotting a festival can of course be understood as a form of resistance, yet depriving the people who live there of the films to be shown or of encounters of this kind, for any reason, feels like punishing them, and that does not seem right to me. Every festival is shaped by complex political dynamics. In today’s world, there is almost no festival that exists without considerable amount of state support. But rejecting participation for political reasons feels to me like sacrificing art to politics. If we are to make festivals — and the art lovers who live there — bear the sins of governments, then very few festivals in the world would remain exempt from boycotts. Festival participation, in my view, should not be interpreted as support for governments, but a way of crossing the boundaries political regimes create between peoples and of affirming culture and art as something that stands above politics.”\n\t\n\n\tAll the best,\n\n\tNuri Bilge Ceylan\n",

    "body": "\n\tApple is hoping its feel-good holiday ad campaign — featuring a chorus of woodland creatures singing about friendship — will inspire consumers to rush out and buy a brand-new iPhone 17.\n\n\tOn Thursday, Apple released “A Critter Carol,” a 2-minute, 24-second film starring nine handmade animal puppets that was (of course!) shot entirely on the recently released iPhone 17 Pro. The ad was directed by award-winning Australian filmmaker Mark Molloy, who has previously worked on Apple commercials and made his feature directorial debut with Netflix’s “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.” (Watch the ad below or on YouTube at this link.)\n\t\n\n\tThe story begins when a hiker accidentally drops his iPhone 17 Pro in a snowy forest. The device is discovered by a group of critters — a raccoon, bear, rat, owl, deer, squirrel, rabbit, mole and deer — who film themselves on the smartphone singing “Friends,” a song originally recorded by New Zealand music-comedy duo Flight of the Conchords (who starred in an HBO original series that ran for two seasons).\n\n\n\tWhen the hiker and his partner return to the scene (using Apple’s Find My app on his Apple Watch to locate the iPhone), the animals scatter in a panic. He picks up the phone, lying in a heart-shaped arrangement of twigs — and as he the magical video recording plays, he turns a bewildered eye to the woods around him. “Hope they like it!” exclaims the mole, before being shushed by the racoon. The tagline: “Friendship Is a Gift.”\n\n\tApple’s “A Critter Carol” will roll out globally across broadcast TV, digital platforms and social media. In the U.S., a cut-down version of the spot will air on TV starting with NBC’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade coverage.\n\t\n\n\tApple also released a behind-the-scenes vignette about the production, which includes a look at the making of the puppets and their human puppeteers. “I wanted to embrace the tactile nature of puppetry,” Molloy says in the BTS video. “I was really keen to go back to craftsmanship.”\n\n\tThe tech giant’s 2025 holiday ad is deliberately analog, designed to emphasize the power and warmth of human creativity. In addition to the handmade and hand-operated puppets, for example, the typography used in the campaign was handprinted from wood blocks. Recall that Apple suffered a rare marketing misstep with last year’s “Crush!” iPad ad, which showed a massive hydraulic press literally crushing a bunch of creative and artistic objects into an ultra-thin tablet — a message some in Hollywood saw as presaging the obliteration of human creativity by technologies like generative AI.\n\n\tIn the “Critter Carol” ad, the puppets are enlisted to showcase the new iPhone 17 Pro’s advanced camera capabilities, such as 8x Zoom, Center Stage selfies (which lets you shift from portrait to landscape mode without rotating the phone) and Dual Capture (which records on front and rear cameras simultaneously). “The power of the iPhone 17 Pro allowed me to capture the story in a really immersive way,” Molloy says in the behind-the-scenes video.\n\n\tThe commercial was shot on a soundstage in Prague. The ad agency behind the spot was TBWA\\Media Arts Lab, which works exclusively with Apple. The production companies on it were Smuggler and Prague-based Unit+Sofa. Joost van Gelder served as director of photography and Andy Kelly was production designer.\n\n\tWatch Apple’s “A Critter Carol”:\n\n\n\n",

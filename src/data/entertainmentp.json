    "body": "\n\tMatthew McConaughey recently joined Woody Harrelson and Ted Danson on their “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast. During the episode, Harrelson recalled there were “so many times” he wanted to “punch” McConaughey while filming the first season of “True Detective” because he was method acting.\n\n\t“He’s method,” Harrelson said. “When we were shooting, he was Rust Cohle. There [were] so many times I wanted to punch this motherfucker in the face. I’m so pissed at him cause he’s in his character.”\n\t\n\n\tMcConaughey explained that he needed to be “stoic” between takes to stay in his character’s headspace.\n\n\n\t“We’re sitting there. We’re about to start shooting, and we were rehearsing,” McConaughey recalled. “I’m just kind of being stoic Rust Cohle. Woody goes, like, ‘Hey man, I need to talk to you about something.’ He goes, ‘The way you and I work, McConaughey, I hit you the ball, you hit back, I hit it back to you. We volley, we play. … Man, that’s us. It’s dramatic, but it’s also comedy.'”\n\n\tIn HBO’s “True Detective,” Harrelson and McConaughey played a pair of Southern investigators hunting a serial killer in the esoteric back country of Louisiana. Harrelson, at one point, thought the show was too dark and suggested to McConaughey during production that they should add in some jokes.\n\n\tHe recalled, “I remember saying to [McConaughey] before we started filming, I’m like, ‘Dude, people are gonna expect to laugh with us. We gotta throw some jokes in here.’ He’s just like, ‘Mhm.’ I’m waiting for him to say, ‘Yeah, you’re totally, no, none of that.’ He just, ‘Mhm, yeah.’”\n\t\n\n\t“True Detective” Season 1 earned 5 Emmy Awards and is still widely considered one of the best shows in HBO’s catalog. Despite the enduring popularity, Harrelson recently told “Today” that there is “no chance” of him and McConaughey returning to “True Detective.”\n\n\t“In fairness, never. No chance,” Harrelson said. “Because it turned out great. I love that it turned out the way it did, and if anything, doing another season would, I think, tarnish that.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKarine Jean-Pierre is ready to take the stage.\n\n\tThe former White House press secretary for President Joe Biden is stepping into a new kind of spotlight as the host of this year’s 17th annual African American Film Critics Awards, revealed exclusively to Variety.\n\n\tJean-Pierre, 51, joins an impressive roster of earlier AAFCA emcees, following last year’s Amber Ruffin, the comedian who led the film ceremony, and “American Idol” Season 6 winner Jordin Sparks, who hosted the organization’s 2025 television honors. The ceremony, celebrating achievements in filmmaking, will take place Feb. 8 in Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tHonorees this year include Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson and director Ryan Coogler, alongside animated feature breakout “KPop Demon Hunters.” Winners are selected by more than 100 members of the African American Film Critics Association.\n\n\n\tJean-Pierre is no stranger to making history. She served as the 35th White House press secretary from 2022 to 2025, becoming the first Black person and the first openly LGBTQ individual to hold the role. Hosting the awards marks a notable shift in trajectory for the veteran political adviser, and one she does not take lightly.\n\n\t“I don’t want it to be about me,” Jean-Pierre tells Variety. “I’m playing a tiny part here. My job is to honor, celebrate and lift the brilliant artists who are being recognized.”\n\n\tJean-Pierre has long admired AAFCA’s mission and leadership, making it “an easy yes” to accept the hosting gig. “The AAFCA Awards have spent 17 years celebrating extraordinary contributions in film, and I am just so in awe of Gil Robertson and the team,” she says. “The mission is to honor storytellers who explore the many faces of humanity through diverse perspectives. Why not help lift that up?”\n\t\n\n\tDespite being one of the most recognizable communicators in American politics, Jean-Pierre is adamant that the evening will remain focused on the artists. “One of the things I learned in the press comms world is don’t make yourself the news,” she says. “I want it to be light, enjoyable, smooth and let the stars shine.”\n\n\tWith politics touching nearly every facet of daily life, Jean-Pierre’s post-White House career has differed from her predecessors. One would have expected her to pivot into cable news or become a political pundit, a common next step for former press secretaries. When asked about whether that absence was a conscious choice, Jean-Pierre is direct, describing her career as one that has never been about following a prescribed route.\n\n\t“I’ve always seen myself as someone who does things differently,” she says. “I don’t follow a set path or look at the people before me and copy their trajectory — that’s just never been who I am. I like to do things my own way and ask myself, ‘How can I make an impact? How can I be different?’”\n\n\tAmong those she’s excited to meet are several of the night’s honorees, particularly the cast and filmmakers behind “Sinners,” which she calls “one of the most brilliant pieces of work I’ve seen in a long time.”\n\n\t“I’ve never met Michael B. Jordan,” she says with excitement. “And Ryan Coogler — just touching him would be amazing. He’s so incredibly brilliant.”\n\n\tJean-Pierre, who recently published her memoir “Independent,” says hosting aligns with a broader desire to tell stories beyond the political arena. While she plans to remain engaged in civic discourse after two decades in politics, she views this next chapter as an opportunity to expand her impact through storytelling and mentorship.\n\n\tAfter spending 20 years in politics, Jean-Pierre says her focus is now on lifting up communities she cares about. Most recently, she acquired the rights to the stories of Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne, the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps, and wants Hollywood to tell their stories.  “The women asked presidents questions and were often ignored by the boys’ club, and yet so few people know their names,” Jean-Pierre says with passion. “I recently acquired their books, and I want to help bring their stories to life.”\n\t\n\n\tIn November 2023, while still serving as press secretary, she honored their legacy by dedicating the White House lectern in their names.\n\n\tHer next career chapter, she says, will focus on telling stories that matter — potentially as a producer and writer — while continuing to mentor young people and develop new writing projects.\n\n\t“My career has always been a zigzag,” she says. “I move toward what excites me and what feels meaningful, and that’s how I want to continue doing things: my way.”\n\n\tStill, Jean-Pierre acknowledges that hosting an awards ceremony during a moment of political and cultural turbulence carries added weight.\n\n\t“We need this right now,” she asserts. “We need an opportunity and a space to celebrate ourselves — to be seen in this way, and for little boys and girls in our community to see us in this way.”\n\n\tAs conversations around diversity and inclusion remain fraught, Jean-Pierre views events like the AAFCA Awards as essential.\n\n\t“We cannot let our stories die. We must continue to be bold and tell those stories. There is real value in telling our journeys so that generations to come can see how brilliant we are.”\n\n\tGil Robertson, AAFCA president and co-founder, said he is “elated” to welcome Jean-Pierre into the organization’s family.\n\n\t“She’s current, credible and brilliant,” Robertson says. “She has a background in journalism and has occupied positions at the very center of popular events. We love her energy and her vibe, and it’s what people expect from us — smart hosts who are part of the conversation.”\n\n\tAs Jean-Pierre prepares to take the stage, her approach stays rooted in service, just as it was behind the White House podium.\n\n\t“My message is to continue to hold each other,” she says. “Telling our stories is more important now than it has ever been before.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGenre distribution label Chroma has acquired North American rights to a trio of international features including “Mash Ville,” described as a whiskey-soaked kimchi western that earned its director best director honors at the Fantasia International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe South Korean title will be Chroma’s first release from the package, dropping digitally on Jan. 23, followed by Poland’s “Dead by Dawn” and Estonia’s “The Black Hole.”\n\n\n\tDirector Wook Hwang’s “Mash Ville” is a kimchi western following nine individuals and one corpse whose conflicting objectives lead to escalating chaos in what Chroma describes as “Coen Brothers meets Tarantino.” The film earned Hwang the best director award at the Fantasia International Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tWriter-director Dawid Torrone’s “Dead by Dawn” represents a rare giallo entry from Poland, delivering theatrical horror through stylized visuals. After its world premiere at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, the feature played Morbido Fest, Screamfest and Grimmfest, earning a special mention for best cinematography at the latter.\n\n\tMoonike Siimets’ “The Black Hole” presents an absurdist, arthouse approach to sci-fi through its triptych structure following a small Estonian community dealing with extraterrestrials, a giant spider and an Austrian in breeches after a black hole materializes inside a lilac bush. Following its Fantastic Fest 2024 premiere, the film collected awards at Les Utopiales in France, the Sognielettrici Electricdreams International Film Festival in Milan, the Warsaw International Film Festival, goEast in Germany, the UnderGround Film Festival in Calgary and the European Film Festival Palić in Serbia.\n\t\n\n\tChroma negotiated the deals with The Coven for “Dead by Dawn,” EST Media for “Mash Ville” and The Reel Suspects for “The Black Hole.”\n\n\t“Part of what fuels Chroma’s passion for genre cinema is how powerfully it transcends language. These three international films grabbed us immediately – they’re gripping, entertaining, and wildly inventive in ways that will resonate instantly with genre fans, proving that the best, wildest ideas cross boundaries and cultures,” said Ahbra Perry, VP of Chroma. “A blood-curdling scream sounds the same in any language, and ‘Dead By Dawn,’ ‘The Black Hole,’ and ‘Mash Ville’ push that universality to thrilling extremes. Adding these titles to the Chroma slate reflects exactly the kind of exciting, high-impact global storytelling we’re committed to releasing in 2026.”\n\n\tLaunched in 2025, Chroma operates as a U.S.-based distribution label focused on science fiction and horror content. The company functions under Narrative Distribution, part of the Narrative portfolio of companies, delivering titles across streaming platforms, transactional storefronts, broadcast channels, DVD retailers and airlines.\n",

    "body": "\n\tValentino Garavani, the fashion designer and mogul behind the Valentino brand, died on Monday. He was 93. \n\n\tHis foundation announced the news on social media, writing: “Valentino Garavani passed away today at his Roman residence, surrounded by his loved ones.”\n\n\tThe Italian designer, known by the mononym Valentino, was born in Voghera, Italy, on May 11, 1932. After attending fashion school in Paris, he founded his company in 1960 in Rome alongside business partner Giancarlo Giammetti. He quickly gained prominence for his romantic, poppy-colored dresses, a shade that was coined “Valentino red.” With designs mixing timeless elegance and bold high-fashion, the brand soon caught the eye of several high-profile women — including Elizabeth Taylor, who donned a Valentino gown at the premiere of 1960’s “Spartacus,” and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who ordered six of his couture dresses to wear in mourning following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. Garavani then designed Kennedy’s wedding look when she married Aristotle Onassis in 1968, with the two-piece’s high neck, lace top and bold above-the-knee cut solidifying both her and Garavani as style icons.\n\t\n\n\tAs the brand grew in the ’70s and ’80s, Garavani gained further recognition in Hollywood as the favorite designer of “Dynasty” star Joan Collins, who sported the designer on red carpets and at awards shows. Over the years, Valentino has also designed custom wedding dresses for Taylor, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Courteney Cox and Nicola Peltz Beckham, and continues to be a red-carpet favorite of stars like Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Florence Pugh, Zendaya, Dakota Johnson and Elle Fanning.\n\t\n\n\tPaltrow took to Instagram Monday morning to remember the prolific designer.\n\n\t“I was so lucky to know and love Valentino-to know the real man, in private,” she wrote. “The man who was in love with beauty, his family, his muses, his friends. His dogs, his gardens, and a good Hollywood story. I loved him so much. I loved how he always pestered me to ‘at least wear a little mascara’ when I came to dinner. I loved his naughty laugh.”\n\n\tColman Domingo also paid tribute to Valentino on Instagram, writing, “Thank you Mr. Valentino for inspiring so many to be beautiful. To quote: ‘There are only three things I can do – make a dress, decorate a house, and entertain people.’ This man lived a life to make beautiful things and to make us all feel like we are living in a fantasy that becomes ones reality.” \n\n\tCindy Crawford wrote in her social media remembrance of Garavani, “I’m heartbroken to hear of Valentino Garavani’s passing. He was a true master of his craft, and I will always be grateful for the years I had the privilege of working closely with him.” \n\n\tGaravani had a relationship with cinema beyond dressing celebrities, appearing as himself in the beloved 2006 film “The Devil Wears Prada” alongside Hathaway and Meryl Streep. Following his retirement in January 2008, a feature-length documentary about his career and life, titled “Valentino: The Last Emperor,” premiered at the Venice Film Festival.\n\n\t“This was the best thing, for me to create dresses,” Garavani said in the documentary. “I am a disaster at everything else.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmanda Seyfried recently told The New Yorker that winning an Oscar is not important to her. She said that she’s “gotten this far” without an Academy Award, so “why would I need one now?”\n\n\t“Do you remember who won in the past ten years? It’s not the win that’s important. It’s the nomination,” Seyfried said. “It does thrust you forward. That’s a fact. Now, do I need one in a week or two or whenever? No, of course, I don’t. Would it be great? Of course it would, for every reason. But it isn’t necessary. Longevity in an actor’s career is designed. Longevity is about deliberate choices to make art among the big commercial things that are fun and pay.”\n\t\n\n\tSeyfried has never won an Oscar, but she scored a best supporting actress nomination in 2021 for her work in “Mank.” Her performance in December’s “The Testament of Ann Lee” earned her a best actress nomination at the Golden Globes and Critics’ Choice, possibly foreshadowing a nomination from the Academy.\n\n\n\tEven if she misses out on an Oscar nod this year, Seyfried said she has “already proven” herself and feels she is making strides toward “getting people to trust me to do hard things.”\n\n\t“We all have ebbs and flows in our careers, and how we’re perceived can change from day to day, but I’m consistent in my choices and I’m consistent in my values and my needs,” she added. “I’m also sitting pretty right now, because ‘The Housemaid’ made money. That’s not always the case. Sometimes you’re in ‘Mamma Mia!’ Sometimes, you do something like ‘Ted 2,’ or ‘A Million Ways to Die in the West,’ which were both supposed to do big box-office, and underperformed.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Katie Pavlich launches her new 10 p.m. show on NewsNation on Monday night, she will be taking on a unique competitor: the guy who gave her a start in the TV business.\n\n\tAt an earlier time, Pavlich, then working for the conservative site Townhall.com, was trying to network at an annual CPAC conference, and saw Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld and several associates.  As she moved closer to try and meet him in a crowded room, she overheard his group getting ready to leave, because it was hard to get a bartender’s attention. Pavlich saw an opportunity and vowed to get the group beers. As a result, she was invited to appear on “Red Eye,” a wee-hours program Gutfeld hosted between 2007 and 2015.\n\t\n\n\tNow she will be vying for audience at the same time Gutfeld hosts his eponymous program on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\t“I run in my own race,” says Pavlich, during a recent interview, adding: “We are going to put on the best show we can every single night.”\n\n\tPavlich’s viewership isn’t likely to match Gutfeld’s, as Fox News commands the biggest audience in cable news, but NewsNation, owned by Nexstar Meida, is working to stay competitive. The network has overhauled its nighttime lineup by moving legal analyst and former attorney Jesse Weber into its 11 p.m. slot, preceded by Pavlich’s opinion-driven 10 p.m. hour. The schedule recalibration shows News Nation offering hours that aim more squarely at viewers who identify as liberal or conservative. Chris Cuomo, who tends to win favor among the blue-state crowd but can display a maverick streak, continues to anchor at 8 p.m.\n\t\n\n\t“NewsNation is the place where all are welcome…but tested. That’s why we are growing and that is what my show is all about,” says Cuomo. “I look forward to seeing how Katie and Jesse add to the mix.” On Tuesday, Pavlich will add something significant: an interview with President Donald Trump.\n\n\tExecutives hope the new anchors can lure new crowds. While NewsNation’s viewership grew in 2025, its ratings are smaller compared to its more established rivals, which include Fox News, MS NOW and CNN. In 2025, News Nation captured an average of 108,000 viewers in primetime and 13,000 among viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most coveted by advertisers in news programming.\n\n\tCuomo and Pavlich have bona fides with specific audiences, but Weber says he wants to be a news hound.  While 11 p.m. is often seen as the end of the day “the news is not slowing down at that hour,” says Weber, during a recent interview. “Some things are just ramping up. There are breaking stories, international stories. There’s an appetite for that,” says Weber. “We want to break down the big stories of the day” and help viewers plan for the day ahead.\n\n\tWith the debut of the new nighttime lineup, NewsNation seems to be pivoting to specific viewer needs, rather than trying to deliver similar hours across the evening. Nexstar launched the network on the back of the cable network once known as WGN America, which was an outgrowth of an era when “superstations” like Ted Turner’s TBS could serve as national outlets via cable. Nexstar’s pivot makes use of newsgathering from its dozens of stations across the country and rids itself of syndicated fare that carried substantial licensing fees.\n\n\tBoth Pavlich and Weber may be not be as established as regular hosts with NewsNation’s audience, but each already has cultivated a following. Weber, who will continue to work for Law & Crime and appeared on HLN, has followed true crime and legal cases for several outlets. Pavlich had been with Fox News as a contributor for years, appearing on “The Five,” the Fox Nation streaming service and other properties.\n\n\tWeber thinks his later hour gives him license to explore. “We are going to experiment and try a few different things. We really want to be on the pulse of what people care about in social media and what people are feeling,” he says, while vowing to give viewers a chance to get all sides of a story without “gotcha moments.”\n\t\n\n\tPavlich says she is also mindful of connecting to a wider crowd. “I love America and I love my country unabashedly,” she says, but expects to present different viewpoints on the topics of the day. “We want to have civil, cordial discussion that is not boring,” she adds. “I think there is a difference between fighting and vehement disagreement.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSubject Matter, an organization that provides funds and resources to nonprofits and documentary films highlighting urgent social issues, will award $120,000 in grants at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\tRecipients include Sharon Liese’s investigative thriller “Seized,” the nonprofit organization Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Dawn Porter’s “When A Witness Recants,” and the nonprofit Gideon’s Promise, each receiving $30,000.\n\t\n\n\t“Seized” focuses on a troubling police raid in Kansas, which quickly spirals into a national story. Told through police body-cam and surveillance footage, the film will premiere on Jan. 25 at the Ray Theatre and will also be available through Sundance Film Festival’s online program, screening from Jan. 29–Feb. 1. The corresponding nonprofit grant will go to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides legal representation, support, and other legal resources at no cost to protect the rights of journalists nationwide.\n\n\n\t“When A Witness Recants” explores the false imprisonment of three innocent teenagers who were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for murder, the truth eventually revealed after 36 years. The film will premiere on Jan. 27 at the Library Center Theatre. The corresponding grant will go to Gideon’s Promise, a nonprofit aiming to transform the criminal legal system by building a movement of public defenders who provide equal justice for marginalized communities.\n\n\tSubject Matter will also host a public panel discussion at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 26 at the Box at the Ray, for a conversation exploring “what happens when the systems designed to protect us—the local police, the courts, and the law—are used to silence the truth, and how audiences can create positive community actions in response to the films.” The conversation will be moderated by Fabio Bertoni, General Counsel at The New Yorker. Subject Matter will add $100 to each audience donation made to either of the nonprofit grantees during the Sundance Film Festival, up to a total of $5,000.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMartin Bobb-Semple, the fast-rising British actor who recently nabbed a leading role in the upcoming “Tomb Raider” live-action series at Amazon MGM Studios, has signed with CAA. \n\n\tBobb-Semple was most recently seen as series regular Orlando “Lando” Johnson in “All American: Homecoming.” Starting out as a recurring character, he was upped to a series lead in season 3. Prior to that, he starred in two seasons of Peacock’s “One of Us is Lying,” and was a series lead in “Free Reign” for Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tBut the hotly-anticipated “Tomb Raider” — now in production — looks set to take the actor’s star to a new level. \n\n\n\tLed by Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, the show will see Bobb-Semple play Zip, one of Croft’s key allies and her trusted tech support and friend in a major, series-regular role. In the games, Zip works primarily from the security room in the main hall of Croft Manor, feeding Croft crucial information during her quests. \n\n\tBobb-Semple’s name was actually the first listed after Turner’s when Amazon formally announced the full cast lineup earlier this month, ahead of Jason Isaacs and Bill Paterson, also confirmed in canon roles. Other stars in the video game adaptation — created and written Phoebe Waller–Bridge, who will also serve as showrunner — include Sigourney Weaver, Celia Imrie, Jack Bannon and John Hefferman. \n\n\tBobb-Semple made his acting debut in production of “Oliver Twist” in London’s West End, before  training at the Identity School of Acting. From there, he later booked his first TV role at the BBC.\n\t\n\n\tHe will continue to be represented in the U.K. by Femi Oguns and Ikki El-Amriti at Identity Agency Group (IAG).\n",

    "body": "\n\tSinger Yulee Choi wasn’t the only one making her acting debut in the comedy “Food Truck: Stolen Love…and Moo Deng.” The viral pygmy hippo who charmed the world after she was born in 2024 also appears in a feature film for the first time in the Thai family movie.\n\n\tChoi, a Korean singer-songwriter and founder of SRP Entertainment, told the audience at a recent Variety Screening Series event that she wanted to make the jump into acting because “I love to learn.” When the producers learned she could speak Thai (she majored in Thai at university), they encouraged her to join the film. It co-stars popular Thai actor Mario Maurer along with comedian Jack Fanchan and rapper-actor Padung Songsang.\n\t\n\n\tHer song “After the Rain” is also heard in the film, and she explained in the Q&A how the song, which was released last year, ties in with “Food Truck.” \n\n\t“The ‘After the Rain’ song connects to this film and this story, and it’s very emotional,” Choi said. “The song talks about overcoming certain obstacles, like when the rain starts falling, the sky becomes clean and beautiful, so life is the same way.”\n\n\tChoi revealed that unfortunately she didn’t get to share any scenes with the young hippo. In the action comedy, she plays an actress making a movie on location who brings her son along on the shoot. When he suspects his biological father might be part of the production team, the boy stows away in the film’s catering truck and as the crew attempts to return him to his mother, they end up taking a detour to Moo Deng’s zoo — only for the petite hippo to also become a stowaway.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMoo Deng hides in a box in “Food Truck: Stolen Love…and Moo Deng.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Unfortunately, I haven’t seen the real Moo Deng in person. But seeing the film, I can feel how cute and charming Moo Deng is,” she said.\n\n\tWhen she first met up with the producers in Korea, she found the story funny and emotional, she said, “It connects a lot with my real life experiences as well.” Like the actress in the film, Choi is raising her children on her own.\n\n\t“That experience made me understand the character’s emotions and feel it more deeply,” she said.\n\n\tChoi said working with the children in the cast was a wonderful experience, since they were “so professional.” Thailand’s unpredictable weather, however, was another story, as the crew was dealing with both sudden downpours and heat.\n\n\t“So I just prayed before the shoot for, no heavy rain please today,” she laughed.\n\n\tWill Choi be returning to the screen amidst her busy music career? “I hope so!” she said. “Whenever I have an opportunity, I would love to.” \n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from Season 2 of “Landman,” now available to stream on Paramount+.\n\n\tWhen we first see Sam Elliott, he’s ",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from Season 2 of “Landman,” now available to stream on Paramount+.\n\n\tWhen we first see Sam Elliott, he’s watching the sunset, waiting to die.\n\n\tThe veteran actor joined the second season of “Landman” as T.L., the estranged father of the titular landman, Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton). In his first scene, he’s seated in the backyard of a run-down assisted living facility during the West Texas golden hour, transfixed by the sun. At that point, it’s the only thing that gets T.L. up in the morning, especially since his wife, Dorothy, is at a separate memory care facility.\n\t\n\n\tMemories are what keep Tommy and T.L. at odds, as T.L. is still in love with a vision of Dorothy that no longer exists. She spiraled into darkness after losing a child, and while T.L. left home to work in the fields and avoid his grief, young Tommy knew his mother only as a violent alcoholic.\n\n\n\tWhen Dorothy dies, Tommy’s ex-wife Angela (Ali Larter) insists that T.L. moves in to be with the newly reconciled family — and one of writer and co-creator Taylor Sheridan’s best character arcs kicks into gear. Elliott is the perfect vessel; and every line on his face evokes the bad decisions he made that Tommy still has time to avoid.\n\n\tAt 81, Elliott has entertained generations of audiences, from his barrel-chested breakout role in 1976’s “Lifeguard,” to unforgettable performances in ’90s historical blockbusters like 1993’s “Gettysburg” and “Tombstone,” as a cowboy poet in 1998’s “The Big Lebowski,” and a tearjerking, Oscar-nominated performance in 2018’s “A Star Is Born.” In “Landman,” he’s able to synthesize a lifetime of work into scene-stealing moments older actors rarely receive.\n\t\n\n\tAs the season starts, things are tough for T.L. As Elliott told me before the season began, “I spent a good part of my time in tears” on set. It was affecting to see an actor so known for his physical presence and bravado play a broken-down man. “My body is turning against me,” T.L. says in one episode, with both of the actor’s signature features — that deep voice and mustache — quavering from the realization of his age. A lifetime in the oil fields has left him weakened and wobbly, leading to embarrassing moments such as his joints seizing up or falling into the pool and not being able to get back out.\n\n\tYet the joy of seeing Angela and his granddaughter Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) making themed dinners around the house quickly warms the man, who is able to find a second chance at life through their energy. Elliott’s progression from cranky old salt to warm grandpa is gradual and profanity-filled, but he ends up being a beacon of change for Tommy, who is constantly annoyed by the problems of his fast-paced life and the somewhat frivolous problems of his ex-wife and daughter.\n\n\t“You got it all, son, but you’re too fucking stupid to see it,” T.L. tells Tommy one day over lunch at a diner in the middle of nowhere. “Or too mad, or too addicted to the fix. Whatever it is, you’re missing it.” \n\n\tNormally, Tommy would tell anyone else with advice to kick rocks, but instead, moved by his father’s candor, he steps outside to take some contemplative drags off a cigarette. Later that night, he turns over a new leaf emotionally with Angela, verbalizing that he loves her — a move that couldn’t have been done without his father.\n\n\tLuckily, things never get too mushy with T.L. When a man from his past starts talking about his just-passed wife, T.L. starts swinging until the police have to intervene. He cusses out Tommy for pulling on his mustache when he believes he passed away during his nap. And T.L. is quick to talk about how much he loves women.\n\n\tYes, “Landman” is a show unafraid to explore how horny octogenarians can be. T.L. was constantly waxing philosophically about the touch of a woman, and took no greater joy than a friendly conversation with a beautiful neighbor, or even a gentle dance with Angela at the honkey tonk. This led to one of the season’s most unexpected and touching friendships, when Tommy hired an exotic dancer named Cheyenne (Francesca Xuereb) to be T.L.’s dubiously skilled physical therapist and aquatherapy expert. The pair spent hours embracing in a pool, with Cheyenne in her barely-there bikini and T.L. floating along in jeans. Elliott’s blissed-out expression was miles away from where we met him earlier in the season, baking away in the sun.\n\t\n\n\tThis season has faced criticism from fans as prioritizing Tommy’s family drama at the expense of the oil industry gamesmanship of the first season. But during the last shot of the season — as Tommy is staring into the setting sun after making things right with Angela — he speaks to God one last time, as he’s been doing the whole episode: “No, you can’t have today, bud. Today is mine.”\n\n\tHe never would have gotten there without T.L. showing him what that sunset could bring, and only an actor like Elliott could conjure so much pathos and humor into this cowboy’s last ride.\n\n\tWatch a key scene between T.L. and Tommy below.\n\n\n\n",

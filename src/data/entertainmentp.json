    "body": "\n\tNetflix‘s “Skyscraper Live,” which is set to follow free solo climber Alex Honnold as he climbs the Taipei 101 tower in Taiwan, has been postponed because of rain — and will move to Saturday night U.S. time (Sunday morning Taiwan time) instead.:\n\n\t“Due to weather, we are unable to proceed with today’s SkyscraperLIVE event. It has been rescheduled for Saturday, January 24 at 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT,” the streamer said in a statement. “Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding.”In a story posted earlier today by Variety, Plimsoll Prods. Ltd. CEO Grant Mansfield, Plimsoll head of adventure James Smith and Netflix unscripted VP Jeff Gaspin addressed the possibility of postponement due to weather.\n\t\n\n\tThe January date for the climb was chosen because it’s dry season in Taiwan right now — although rain was still possible, and the forecast was calling for a chance of moisture the morning Honnold starts his climb. Rain was expected right as “Skyscraper Live” was expected to kick off at 9 a.m. local time. So far, the forecast for tomorrow calls for conditions to be “sunny and pleasant” in Taipei, according to Accuweather.\n\n\n\t“If it is deemed too wet, if there’s too much moisture on the building, we will probably delay to the next day, which would be a Saturday night transmission in the U.S.,” Smith had told Variety. “We could even delay another day if we needed to. Obviously Alex has to be 100% comfortable and happy in himself and in the conditions. And then our safety team likewise have to.”\n\n\tGaspin had compared the live telecast window to “launching a space shuttle. We’ll be on site for a few days after if, for some reason he doesn’t go on that day,” he said. “But after that, it’s probably a bigger reschedule. There’s only certain times of year you can actually climb the tower because it’s rainy season between April and September.”\n\n\tSaid Mansfield: “He won’t be on that building unless we’re all comfortable. But there’s been a huge amount of planning for this. He said he’s the fittest he’s ever been. He’s really been training for this. We’ve gone to Taipei in the dry season, but there’s always a risk of a bit of rain. It’s a live event and anything can happen, and we can’t control the weather.”\n\t\n\n\tHonnold has become a well-known rock climber noted for his daring “free solo” feats of ascending cliffs without the help of any ropes or safety equipment. He was the subject of the Oscar-winning doc “Free Solo,” which chronicled his climb of El Capitan’s 3,000-foot “Freerider” route in Yosemite National Park.\n\n\tThe 2-hour “Skyscraper Live” will follow Honnold as he attempts to free solo the Taipei 101, a 101-story skyscraper that is the 11th tallest building in the world (and the tallest in Taiwan) at 1,667 feet. Plimsoll Prods. Limited, a part of ITV Studios, is producing the special. Al Berman is showrunner and executive producer of “Skyscraper Live,” while Honnold, Grant Mansfield, James Smith, Alan Eyres and Jonathan Retseck are also EPs. Joe DeMaio is director.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Kennedy Center has lost another one of the few remaining stars on its 2026 schedule, as the legendary soprano Renée Fleming has dropped out of an appearance at the embattled venue previously scheduled for May.\n\n\tAlthough many of the musicians who have bowed out of appearances there have made note of the political toxicity that has made it difficult for name artists to fulfill their engagements, a notice on the Kennedy Center’s website blames her exit on an issue with her schedule\n\t\n\n\t“Renée Fleming regrets that, due to a scheduling conflict, she must withdraw from her May 2026 concerts with the NSO,” the notice reads. “A new soloist and repertoire will be announced at a later date, and the remainder of the program remains unchanged.”\n\n\n\tFleming was set to sing with the National Symphony Orchestra and conductor James Gaffigan.on May 29-30.\n\n\tFleming has a strong and recent connection to the center: She was celebrated with an award at the Kennedy Center Honors in 2023. That was prior to President Donald J. Trump taking it over as its chairman in a coup and replacing much of the board with his associates and friends at the beginning of 2025. She had previously served as “Artistic Advisor at Large,” but resigned from that role last year after the president and chair of the center were forced out.\n\n\tA representative for Fleming did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\n\tOn Jan. 16, the Martha Graham Dance Company said it was withdrawing from performing at the center in April. “The Martha Graham Dance Company regrets that, for a variety of reasons, we are unable to perform at the Kennedy Center in April,” the company said in a statement. “We hope to perform at the center in the future.”\n\t\n\n\tAmong others who have pulled out of shows since the politicized takeover are Stephen Schwartz, a production of “Hamilton,” Béla Fleck, Rhiannon Giddens, Issa Rae, Sonia De Los Santos, the Cookers, Magpie, Kristy Lee, the comedy troupe Asian AF, Balún and one of the Kennedy Center’s anchor attractions for many decades, the Washington National Opera.\n\n\tFew big-name acts remain on the schedule for the rest of this year. The list of those still scheduled is led by right-leaning comic Adam Carolla, Jeff Foxworthy, Tony Hinchcliffe and R&B singer Tyrese.\n\n\tThe center’s president, Richard Grenell, who regularly tweets his conservative positions on Twitter, has gone after other performers who have pulled out, saying they are the ones politicizing the venue.\n\n\tWhen the banjo player Fleck canceled his appearance this month, he wrote, “I have withdrawn from my upcoming performance with the NSO at The Kennedy Center. Performing there has become charged and political, at an institution where the focus should be on the music. I look forward to playing with the NSO another time in the future when we can together share and celebrate art.”\n\n\tGrenell’s heated response: “You just made it political and caved to the woke mob who wants you to perform for only Lefties.”\n\n\tIn December, when jazz musician Chuck Redd canceled a New Year’s Eve appearance, Grenell sent him a letter saying he would be sued for $1 million in damages. There has been no subsequent indication that a lawsuit will be filed against any of the artists canceling shows.\n\n\tThe board recently voted to rename the facility the Trump-Kennedy Center, although many have argued that it would take an act of Congress to rename a national presidential memorial, so many continue to refer to it as simply the Kennedy Center, given questions over the legality of the name change.\n\n\tAudiences have been down since the Trump takeover, according to data acquired by the New York Times that showed single-ticket sales down 50%, and subscription revenue for theater down 82% and dance 57% during April and May of 2024 from the previous year.\n\n\tThe center’s current president and representatives have in turn pointed to $130 million in fundraising since Trump took over, along with $257 million approved by Congress and directed by the president toward building renovations.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaura Adler, a former Casting Society administrator and casting director, died on Thursday in Los Angeles following a brief illness. She was 65 years old.\n\n\tFor 16 years, Adler worked as a casting director, and was involved with the casting for television shows including “Better Off Ted,” “Dream On,” “The Goode Family” and “American Dreams.” For the latter, Adler was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting in a Drama Series. Before becoming one herself, she assisted renowned casting directors Barbara Claman, Mark Saks and Ted Hann.\n\t\n\n\tOver more than four decades in the industry, Adler built a career in entertainment that was defined by her service, integrity and tireless advocacy; she became an original member of the steering committee to secure pension and health benefits for casting directors in 2005 and in 2014, she was hired as an administrator for the Casting Society. She held the position for a decade, serving and supporting the global casting community up until she retired from the role in 2024.  \n\n\n\tIn recognition of her tireless efforts and the impact her work had on the casting community, Adler will be receiving the Rosalie Joseph Humanitarian Award, given to those who have made outstanding contributions to humanitarian causes that have in turn supported the casting community. The award will be presented at the 41st Annual Artios Awards on Feb. 26 in Los Angeles. \n\n\tThe daughter of the late actor and director Jerry Adler, Adler was born and raised in New York City. Before transitioning into casting in 1989, she began working in television and film production in 1980. \n\t\n\n\tShe is survived by her sisters Alisa Adler, a talent agent at Paradigm; Emily Adler, a writer; Amy Adler; and nephew, Joe Adler. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChris Pine is in the dark about the future of the “Star Trek” franchise. During a Sundance interview at the Variety Studio presented by Audible, the actor was asked about Paramount’s new leadership and what they have in store for the space franchise. The answer was simple: “You probably know more than I do.”\n\n\tAs Variety reported last year, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, the duo behind the Pine-starring “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” are writing, producing and directing a new “Star Trek” film that will seek to revitalize the franchise. The new film will not be a continuation of the J.J. Abrams-led reboot of the series and won’t feature Pine, who played Captain Kirk in three “Star Trek” movies between 2009 and 2016.\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked if he had any advice for the new Paramount leadership in regards to “Star Trek,” Pine answered: “Advice? Have fun, good luck, live long and prosper.”\n\n\tPine opened the 2026 Sundance Film Festival with “Carousel,” a romance drama co-starring Jenny Slate and directed by Rachel Lambert. Pine stars in the film as a single father whose life is upended by the reemergence of his high school ex. \n\n\t“Many a male character in film and in life… there is a difficulty for men to communicate feelings with clarity. He struggles with that,” Pine said about his character, noting how Slate’s ex-girlfriend “allows him in the messiest way to confront these feelings and purge them out of the system.”\n\n\tSlate added of the film, “I was so excited by Rachel’s script for many reasons, but I think it’s a real opportunity when you get a full interiority. That makes for good drama. I started in comedy because it’s the easiest way to deal with my shadow, but not because I don’t have one. Now to sort of grow up into my adulthood as performer and to confront it straight on… I saw that opportunity in this script.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHulu has landed the rights to pioneering media executive Amy DuBois Barnett’s debut novel, “If I Ruled the World,” to adapt into a hour-long drama series.\n\n\t“If I Ruled the World” is inspired by Barnett’s experiences as the first Black woman to helm a major mainstream magazine in the U.S. Barnett served as editor-in-chief of Ebony, Teen People and Honey magazines, as well as deputy editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar.\n\n\n\tIn 2024, after a competitive auction, “If I Ruled the World” sold to Flatiron Books in a major deal. The novel, which will be published on Tuesday, is described as “a fast-paced, juicy debut that peeks behind the curtain at the cutthroat world of hip-hop music and the glamorous magazine scene in the late 1990s, written by the ultimate insider.”\n\t\n\n\tVeteran producer and top-ranking studio executive Emma Watts (at Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox) and Lee Daniels (“Empire,” “Precious,” “The Deliverance”) are producing the TV adaptation, which Watts brought to Daniels after reading the manuscript. Daniels is co-writing the pilot with Barnett.\n\n\t“If I Ruled the World” centers on Nikki Rose, a young magazine editor — and the only Black editor on staff — as she navigates the volatile intersection of hip-hop, fashion and editorial culture in the Y2K era.\n\n\t“But after being told one too many times by her boss that ‘Black girls don’t sell magazines,’ she quits to take over Sugar, a struggling hip hop music and lifestyle magazine with untapped potential,” a synopsis explains. “Thrown into an entirely new world of wealth, decadence, and debauchery, Nikki has just six months to save Sugar — and her own dreams.”\n\t\n\n\tThe story follows as Nikki works to prove she’s savvy enough to take the lead — balancing pulling all-nighters at the office with partying with New York City’s most influential bad boys.\n\n\tThere’s plenty of drama that comes with the territory, but, as the synopsis teases, “her most dangerous challenge is evading Alonzo Griffin, her very married, very powerful ex-lover and former boss, who is determined to destroy both her and Sugar.”\n\n\tBarnett will also executive produce. She is repped by Anonymous Content, Kaplan Perrone, and Park Fine & Brower.\n\n\tDaniels is repped by AA and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox, L.L.P. Watts is repped by CAA and Ziffren Brittenham LLP.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLee Daniels and Emma Watts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniels: Myles Pettengill / Watts: Fox\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCasper Kelly says his love of analyzing and dissecting pop culture started when he was very young.\n\n\t“Back in the day, they had Mad Magazine, which had movie parodies and would deconstruct the movies, even the adult movies I couldn’t watch,” Kelly says. “I remember trying to make my own fake movie parodies with comics, although I don’t really consider what I do parodies. But I like having a structure that I can break in a surprising way.”\n\t\n\n\tSome of Kelly’s boldest projects have taken well-trodden tropes and run them through a series of funhouse mirrors, until they’re jagged and nearly unrecognizable. His 2015 Adult Swim viral sensation “Too Many Cooks” mimicked the seemingly endless opening credits of sitcoms, which got more and more surreal until a madman was let loose in the meta world. His sneaky 2022 feature “Adult Swim Yule Log” was a surreal parody of slasher films, and the sequel (2024’s “Branchin’ Out”) was an outrageous take on Hallmark holiday romances. \n\n\n\tHis newest work, “Buddy,” which debuted Thursday night at Sundance as part of the Midnight program, directly takes on Barney the dinosaur, recontextualizing the much-maligned ’90s kid show as a trap for children, who are killed by the titular unicorn if they step out of line or question their reality. The tactile sets of the world inside the TV show recall kids’ fare ranging from “Pee-wee’s Playhouse” to “Dora the Explorer.” The initial idea was pitched to Kelly, but initially, he was concerned it might draw too many comparisons to recent kids’ characters-gone-psycho films.\n\n\t“It came from JD Lifshitz, one of the heads at BoulderLight Pictures, who was interested in doing some kind of horror movie in a world with a character like Barney,” Kelly says. “I felt like that territory had been trodden a bit with ‘Five Nights at Freddy’s’ or ‘The Banana Splits Movie’ or ‘Willy’s Wonderland.’ But when I hit on the idea of them being trapped in a TV show, that was interesting to me. I did an interview with SpectreVision, Elijah Wood and Daniel Noah’s production company, once, and they said, ‘Everything you’ve done has the theme of being trapped.’ It had never occurred to me, but now I keep thinking about it, and I forget about it. After the movie, I’m like, ‘Well, I’ll be damned. It’s about being trapped again.'”\n\t\n\n\tAlthough “Buddy,” which Kelly co-wrote with Jamie King, is thematically linked to his work, it definitely has the opportunity to bring in a bigger audience. Key roles are filled by stars like Keegan-Michael Key, Michael Shannon and Cristin Milioti, and while it is definitely one of the most ambitious and strange movies at Sundance, it’s easy to see it being a crowd-pleasing hit for those looking for something off the beaten path, which is new territory for a cult favorite like Kelly.\n\n\t“This movie had financiers and a lot of creative producers who want this to be a theatrical movie,” he says. “Part of their aim is steering it in a way where it has my weirdness, but also perhaps is more accessible than some of my other work meant for late night at Adult Swim. So it’s trying to keep that blend, and I think we succeeded.”\n\n\tWhile Kelly has sharpened his voice on scores of TV and film projects, he says that “Buddy” expanded his horizons and made him even more excited to tackle future projects.\n\n\t“I learned so much on this movie,” he says. “For example, our DP Zach Kuperstein, who also worked on ‘Barbarian,’ has a very interesting process for blocking scenes and doing the shot list that involves outdated software that is in danger of not being updated anymore. I feel like I got a lot better at blocking scenes, rather than just doing the normal comedy ‘over the shoulder, wide shot’ and things like that. You can keep practicing and trying to get better, but every scenario is new. But it’s so addictive, and I want to make so much stuff. I’m just so excited.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tBrendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chairman of the FCC, offered his opinion that Netflix‘s proposed $83 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros.’s studio",
    "body": "\n\tBrendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chairman of the FCC, offered his opinion that Netflix‘s proposed $83 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros.’s studios and HBO Max businesses raises “competition concerns.”\n\n\tHowever, the FCC does not have any authority to review the Netflix-WB deal. The proposed sale does not involve the transfer of broadcast licenses, which the FCC regulates; Warner Bros. Discovery doesn’t own any broadcast TV properties. Meanwhile, Netflix isn’t buying WBD’s cable television assets (which are to be spun off into a new company, Discovery Global) but even if it were the FCC does not have jurisdiction in that domain.\n\t\n\n\tCarr made the comments in an interview with Bloomberg published Friday. “What you’ve seen Netflix do as a general matter, in terms of their organic growth, is fantastic,” the FCC chair said. “There are legitimate competition concerns that I’ve seen raised about their acquisition here and just the sheer amount of scale and consolidation you can see in the streaming market.”\n\n\n\tThe Justice Department and the FTC are the U.S. government agencies that are reviewing the Netflix-WB agreement for potential antitrust issues.\n\n\tParamount Skydance, led by chairman and CEO David Ellison, has launched a hostile takeover campaign, hoping to convince Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders its $30/share bid is the better deal. Carr said in the Bloomberg interview that he doesn’t see competition concerns if Paramount Skydance were to land a deal for WBD, but he said the FCC could review that because Paramount’s bid includes funding from foreign entities. In addition to David Ellison’s father, Oracle co-founder and multibillionaire Larry Ellison (who has personally committed $40.4 billion toward the prospective deal), Paramount’s proposal is backed by the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.\n\t\n\n\tThis week, Netflix switched to an all-cash deal for the WB assets, aimed at countering Paramount’s claim to have the superior deal because it was offering all-cash vs. Netflix’s previous cash-and-stock terms. Netflix and WBD said they have each submitted Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) antitrust filings and “are engaging with competition authorities,” including the U.S. Justice Department and the European Commission. “Netflix and WBD remain committed to working closely with regulators and all stakeholders to ensure a smooth and successful transaction,” the companies said.\n\n\tAs part of promoting its rival bid, Paramount has claimed the Netflix-WB deal is subject to “severe regulatory risk because it would further entrench market concentration, in contrast to a combination with Paramount that enhances competition and strengthens the long-term prospects of the entertainment industry.” Netflix and HBO Max together would hold an estimated 43% share of global streaming subscribers, according to Paramount, “leading to higher prices for consumers, reduced compensation for content creators and talent, and significant harm to American and international theatrical exhibitors.”\n\n\tPoliticians on both sides of the aisle are wary of the power Netflix would amass with an acquisition of Warner Bros. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) called the proposed deal “an anti-monopoly nightmare.” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and WBD chief strategy office Bruce Campbell are due to testify before a Senate antitrust hearing next month. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, has said there are “a lot of antitrust red flags here” and predicted in a tweet last month: “Buckle up for an intense antitrust hearing in the Senate.”\n\n\tWith respect to antitrust questions, Netflix has framed its core competitive set as overall TV viewing (inclusive of YouTube watched on big-screen TVs) — and, more broadly, that it vies for consumers’ attention against the likes of Instagram. “We relish competition and work to earn more of consumers’ attention. Despite our success over the years, our share of TV time remains below 10% in the major markets in which we operate,” Netflix said in its Q4 2025 letter to shareholders.\n\t\n\n\tCarr, after being named FCC chairman by Trump, has actively promoted the White House’s agenda: He has claimed that the agency is not “independent” of the Trump administration.\n\n\tIn September, Carr threatened ABC and its affiliates with the prospect of FCC investigations into “news distortion” complaints unless they dropped “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”, coming after Kimmel’s on-air comments about MAGA trying to exploit the Charlie Kirk assassination to score political points. (Carr called the Kimmel remarks “some of the sickest conduct possible.”) After two major station groups — Sinclair and Nexstar — said they were preempting Kimmel’s show, ABC suspended the late-night host for nearly a week before bringing Kimmel back on the air.\n\n\tThis week, the FCC’s Media Bureau issued a warning that late-night and daytime TV shows like “The View” or “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” that air political interviews may may not be considered “bona fide” news programs — and could therefore be subject to the agency’s “equal time” rule to grant comparable airtime to opposing candidates.\n\n\t“For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as ‘bona fide news’ programs — even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes,” Carr tweeted on Jan. 21. “Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.”\n",

Harry personally handled the majority of the action stunts seen in the visually intense video -- including a gnarly staircase fall that took hours to nail ... roughly six hours and multiple takes to get right.\n      \n    \n          We’re told the shoot went down over three days -- following a full week of rehearsals -- with filming centered at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles ... famously known as the filming location of \"True Lies,\" \"Blade Runner,\" and Billie Eilish's \"Birds of a Feather\" music video.\n      \n\n          Of course, production wasn’t about to risk damaging Harry’s moneymaker. Our source says the crew built a “soft staircase” specifically for insert and close-up shots, protecting Harry’s face while he fully committed to the falls.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          In a fun behind-the-scenes twist, Harry also “pulled a Taylor Swift” on set ... meaning he never played the song during filming. According to our source, watching the finished video was actually the first time cast and crew heard the track.\n      \n    \n          As for working with the global superstar ... we’re told it was nothing short of a dream, and that Harry was a total gentleman, always on time, an absolute pleasure on set.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As we've previously reported, days before this new hit single dropped, Harry officially announced his 2026 “Together, Together” tour, with international dates and a residency run that includes 30 nights in New York City ... a move that’s already got fans scrambling for tickets.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Harry Styles\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Music Business\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Music Videos\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

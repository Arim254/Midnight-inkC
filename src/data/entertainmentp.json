    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” remained the top film in China for the Jan. 16–18 weekend, as the market continued to soften ahead of the Lunar New Year corridor.\n\n\tThe animated sequel added RMB36.2 million ($5.1 million), according to Artisan Gateway, pushing its cumulative gross to RMB4.37 billion ($615.2 million). While weekly takings dipped, the film continues to post the strongest holds in the market nearly eight weeks into release.\n\t\n\n\tMaoyan Movie’s crime thriller “The Fire Raven” stayed in second place with $5 million, lifting its total to $51.3 million. Directed and written by Sam Quah, the film stars Peng Yuchang, Alan Aruna and Chang Ning and follows the reopening of a long-dormant murder case that exposes a wider network of corruption and revenge.\n\n\n\tJames Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ranked third, earning $4.3 million. The 20th Century Studios release has now grossed $153.4 million in China. \n\n\tDebuting in fourth was Maoyan Movie’s “Take Off,” which opened with $2.8 million from its first weekend, starting its run with a $2.9 million cumulative. Directed by Song Peng Fei and based on Shuang Xuetao’s novella “The Aeronaut,” the drama stars Jiang Qiming and Li Xueqin and centers on a factory worker in Northeast China who becomes consumed by his dream of building a homemade flying machine. \n\n\tRounding out the top five was Huace Film & TV’s “Back to the Past,” which earned $2.2 million, pushing its total to $38 million. The feature film adaptation of Hong Kong broadcaster TVB’s 2001 historical sci-fi series “A Step Into the Past” is produced by Louis Koo‘s One Cool Film Production, with Koo serving as producer. The project reunites the principal cast from the original television series 24 years after it first aired. Koo stars alongside Raymond Lam, Jessica Hsuan, Sonija Kwok, Joyce Tang and Michelle Saram, all reprising their original roles. New cast members include Bai Baihe, Michael Miu and Louis Cheung. The film marks the final screen appearance of the late Dick Liu Kai-chi.\n\t\n\n\tThe weekend’s combined box office reached $24.4 million, while China’s 2026 year-to-date gross stands at $201.8 million, tracking 0.1% ahead of the same period last year.\n",

Wang produced “Are You Lonesome Tonight?,” which screened at Cannes 2021.\n\n\tAnthony Chen, who won the Cannes Camera d’Or for “Ilo Ilo,” produces Tan Ce Ding’s “Somewhere in the South” alongside Edward Lim and Yap Khai Soon.

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Junglee Pictures has tapped filmmaker Raj Kumar Gupta to helm a tentpole theatrical feature, bringing together the studio behind “Badhaai Ho” and “Raazi” with the director of the “Raid” franchise.\n\n\tGupta, whose credits include “Raid,” “Raid 2,” “No One Killed Jessica” and “Aamir,” has established himself as a filmmaker specializing in reality-based narratives with commercial appeal. His most recent film, “Raid 2,” ranks among the top 10 highest-grossing Bollywood theatrical releases of 2025.\n\t\n\n\tThe collaboration pairs Gupta’s grounded storytelling approach with Junglee Pictures’ track record of championing content-driven cinema across multiple genres. The studio launched with “Dil Dhadakne Do” before producing hits including “Badhaai Ho,” “Raazi,” “Talvar,” “Badhaai Do” and “Bareilly Ki Barfi.” Its 2025 slate included “Haq” and Malayalam-language film “Ronth,” both receiving acclaim during their theatrical and streaming releases.\n\n\n\tThe untitled project has completed its scripting phase, with casting scheduled to begin soon. The film is described as delivering an intense narrative consistent with Gupta’s directorial signature.\n\n\t“Junglee Pictures has always focused on backing distinctive, relatable stories with lasting cultural value,” said Vineet Jain, MD of The Times Group, which is Junglee’s parent outfit. “This collaboration with Raj reflects the studio’s intent to join forces with filmmakers who strengthen its slate through purposeful, impact-driven cinema, bringing quality storytelling with relevance, scale, and audience connection. This film will also be a true tentpole for Junglee – bold and impactful, rooted in realism.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve always been drawn to narratives grounded in reality that also have the ability to connect with audiences on a larger canvas,” Gupta added. “This film is conceived as a hard-hitting, immersive, engaging and entertaining theatrical experience. Junglee Pictures has a strong legacy of backing thoughtful, content-led cinema, making this collaboration feel like a natural alignment.”\n\n\tProducing partner Myra Karn added: “Junglee Pictures brings together heart, vision, and fearless storytelling. Junglee’s bold innovative approach meets Raj Kumar Gupta’s unflinching storytelling, crafting stories that questions the status quo. This collaboration is special and I am honored to be part of this dream team.”\n\n\tAdditional story details remain undisclosed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBen Affleck recently told Fox 32 Chicago that he had food poisoning while shooting his emotional goodbye scene with Bruce Willis in the 1998 disaster blockbuster “Armageddon.”\n\n\t“When we shot that scene, I had food poisoning,” Affleck said. “I wasn’t an experienced enough actor at that point to know that you can just pick up the phone and be like, ‘I’m too sick to work today.’ I’m like, ‘I better come in.’ So I went and I was literally, it’s the only time it’s ever happened in my life, vomiting between takes.”\n\t\n\n\tAffleck added with a laugh that his distressed state “probably made the scene better.”\n\n\n\tThe scene in question saw oil man A.J. Frost, played by Affleck, say goodbye to “deep core” oil driller Harry Stamper, played by Willis, as he sacrifices himself to manually detonate a bomb to destroy an asteroid on a collision course with Earth.\n\n\tDirected by Michael Bay, other cast members included Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan.\n\n\tAffleck recalled seeing Buscemi at the premiere of his new Netflix film “The Rip,” which he said flooded his mind with memories of the film.\n\n\tHe said, “I actually saw Steve Buscemi last night at the premiere for ‘The Rip,’ and we were reminiscing about that movie and thinking about how that was the weirdest, kind of wonderful, strange, otherworldly movie experience.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains plot details for “The Commander and the Grey Lady,” Season 4, Episode 2 of HBO’s “Industry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tAll is not well in the House of Muck.\n\n\tAfter underlining his credentials as a failed entrepreneur in Season 3, “Industry” creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay plunge their silver spoon-fed aristocrat Henry Muck (Kit Harington) into dramatic new lows in the second episode of Season 4. In the first few scenes alone, he’s humiliated on stage at the local election in his bid to become a Conservative Party member of parliament, then back at the vast country pile sees his relatively fresh marriage to Yasmin (Marisa Abela) loudly unravel as he lies hungover in a four-poster bed, mopes around in a silk dressing gown feeling sorry for himself, and gives up his libido in exchange for lines of coke (and much more). \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut that’s not all. At a glittering birthday party Yasmin (kitted out like Marie Antoinette) throws for Henry, he ups the drug-taking with some LSD, and then, leaving the party, embarks on a violent adventure with a visitor. At the pub, having gotten into a physical fight with one of the locals, the audience learns that the friend Henry’s with is a figment of his imagination — the ghost of his late father (a man looming large over all his growing mental health woes). Later, back at the estate, Henry tries to end it all for good in a garage (his father had also taken his own life).\n\n\n\tFor Harington, who was only brought into “Industry” in Season 3, the episode — almost entirely set on Muck’s grand estate — was the opportunity to give Henry a much more complete and complex character, warts and all, than seen before.\n\t\n\n\t“The importance of it was to see him as I had always known him, as a real and fully rounded person, not just a kind of villainous character who comes in and steals the girl, but someone who actually has a real trauma in his past — and who wants to do good at the heart of it, but is struggling,” he tells Variety. “And I thought, if we could see that see in all its ugliness, then we might empathize with him.”\n\n\tFor all the upper-class hijinks, Henry’s descent also raises the topic of male suicide, an “important subject matter that needs to be talked about,” says Harington. “No one should go through that, no matter how privileged you are, no matter how despicable a person you are.”\n\n\t“Industry” watchers will note that the episode is the show’s wildest departure from its origins yet. Season 4 in itself serves as an mini-reboot of the series, expanding the story away from its financial roots and into ambitious pastures new. But this dark tale — directed by Down and Kay — is easily the furthest its felt from Pierpoint, with the ghost element also dragging the drama into new genre realms. “A neo-Gothic period drama in a big house,” is how Kay described it to Variety.\n\n\t“One thing you know about Mickey and Konrad is that they’re not afraid to take a wild swing, and land it,” says Harington. “And I think it works, because it’s all in Henry’s mind — we’re seeing it mainly from his perspective. So it is supernatural, but Henry has just popped an acid. And we’ve also set the episode up as being very strange and odd and surreal in its placement in this house. I think they’ve done it very cleverly.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDespite having added numerous layers to Henry — who actually emerges from Episode 2 somewhat rejuvenated and with his relationship with Yasmin refreshed following a quick shag on the bonnet of his sports car — it hasn’t changed his opinion of the character.\n\n\t“You know, I still think he’s an egotistical nightmare and completely self obsessed,” he says. “But at the heart of it, I really like him.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for the premiere of “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tWesteros is not read",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for the premiere of “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tWesteros is not ready for “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.”\n\n\tThe new “Game of Thrones” prequel, which takes place about 100 years before the main series and 80 years after “House of the Dragon,” leaves the dragons and politics behind and instead focuses on one oafish knight, Peter Claffey’s Ser Duncan the Tall, aka Dunk, and his diminutive squire named Egg, played by nine-year-old Dexter Sol Ansell.\n\t\n\n\t“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” is less about Targaryens and Starks and more about Dunk’s personal journey to becoming a knight while at a tourney with some of the fiercest warriors in Westeros. It’s based “A Song of Ice and Fire” author George R. R. Martin’s novella, “The Hedge Knight,” published in 1998, and there are two more books that could form the groundworks for Season 2, which was announced ahead of the show’s premiere, and beyond. Each installment in the six-episode Season 1 is less than an hour long and packs in more jokes and cutaway gags than any single episode of “Thrones” or “House of the Dragon.” \n\n\n\tThe series starts with Dunk mourning the death of his mentor and elderly knight, Ser Arlan of Pennytree (Danny Webb). After saying his goodbyes, Dunk picks up Arlan’s sword in the shining sun and has a hero moment worthy of Jon Snow or Jaime Lannister — but then gets a queasy stomach and explosively poops behind a tree. \n\n\tGoing quickly from hero to zero, Dunk journeys to the tourney to prove himself as a real knight. Along the way, he meets a little bald boy named Egg who secretly follows him and convinces the would-be knight he should be his squire. Resigned to sleeping outside, Dunk also manages to sneak into a party held by the rowdy Ser Lyonel Baratheon (Daniel Ings) to scrape together some food and catches the eye of a cute puppeteer named Tanselle (Tanzyn Crawford).\n\t\n\n\tWith Variety, showrunner Ira Parker, who was a co-executive producer on “House of the Dragon,” breaks down the premiere, that poop joke and how much of George R. R. Martin’s unpublished source material he has access to for the show’s future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI love that this show is still set in Westeros and has a similar feel as “Game of Thrones,” but there are poop jokes and cutaway gags. How did you strike that tone?\t\n\n\tReally it all just came from Dunk’s POV. We wanted the audience to feel whatever he was feeling in that moment. One of the first jokes that we do is Dunk feeling like a hero. He picks up this sword of his old master, and he thinks, “Maybe I could be the guy. Maybe I can be a knight.” But, of course, he’s not a hero. None of us are really heroes. Then all of a sudden, he gets a stomachache and he shits because he hears that music and the call, but he’s not quite there yet. But he decides he’s gonna try and go anyway. I feel like that’s how so many decisions in my life were made, which is having these grand thoughts and dreams and then the reality of it sets in and it becomes a lot more complicated. \n\n\tDunk’s journey in Season 1 is no different than somebody going out to New York or L.A. from their little hometown, thinking “I’m gonna go and try and make it.” Then you end up taking a bus there, realizing you have nothing, spending all your money on some shitty car that breaks down all the time, and you can’t afford rent, so you’re sleeping in your car and you’re going to auditions and trying to make it work. This is the experience that a lot of people have, whether you’re going into the arts or if you’re going into anything that is highly competitive like knighting can be. Dunk finds himself at the very bottom of this. He doesn’t have the training, the name, the money, he can’t afford to fail.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI have to ask about the pooping scene with the iconic “Game of Thrones” theme song. Where did that come from?\t\n\n\tIt was written in the script very early on as the hero theme. We tried a bunch of different versions, and the one that felt the most iconic was the major theme. Because we were not going with an opening title sequence, it felt right to give everybody a little bit of a taste of it to launch into our show. It comes out of how Dunk is feeling in that moment, going from hero to the opposite of hero, as so many of us do sometimes.\n\t\n\t\tHow did that work? Is that actually Peter Claffey’s butt or did you use a fake one?\t\n\n\tA magician never gives it away. I will say that we don’t have the budget for fake anything on this show. Very, very little is done fake. We’re not crazy. It’s not a fake up there shitting on screen, that’s his butt.\n\t\n\t\tIt wouldn’t be Westeros without dragons, and even though there aren’t any real dragons left, you still have a fake one in the episode. Did you purposely want to have some sort of dragon representation in the show, and how did you make that puppet?\t\n\n\tWe were trying to figure out how to “Game of Thrones” this puppet show. The idea that these were real artisans and craftsmen, this traveling puppet show with these massive, moving puppets was very interesting to us early on. The puppet makers did a fantastic job. It felt impressive enough, and the goal was to disconcert Dunk and send him into this puppet show and for him to be just blown away and almost intimidated. He can’t escape the fact that he feels insignificant to this world where everyone’s doing these wonderful things, and he’s just wondering if he belongs there. Even the fire was done in a way that theoretically could have been done back in the 14th century. The dust that is being caught on fire is called Lycopodium, which is a dried pollen that theoretically could have actually been collected and ignited with a torch. So no special effects for us. We tried to keep it grounded.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDexter Sol Ansell was 9 years old when he filmed Season 1, as you get into Season 2 and beyond are you worried at all about him aging out of the role, like how the “Stranger Things” kids got so much older by the end of their show?\t\n\n\tDexter is going to have whatever career he decides that he wants. He’s so talented. He’s come in Season 2 like an old pro. He’s so confident, calm, and he can give you different versions now. He’s really come into himself. I think he’s the best child actor on Earth, there’s no doubt about it. The planned books that George has take Dunk and Egg through their whole lives. I’ve joked about this with HBO, to which I’ve definitely got some eye rolls, but I would love to do three, four or five seasons with Egg the boy and then come back in five or 10 years and do a few more with Egg the prince. Then come back in five or 10 years from then and do him at the end of his life — Linklater method. They go off, do whatever they want to do in between, they can have lives, then we come back and get the crew back together and we tell a little bit more of the story because I think it would be really interesting. The idea of taking two people on a journey through their lives, I haven’t seen a lot of that. But I embrace the oldening of Dexter and Egg. He’ll grow older with the character; he’s supposed to get older. Hopefully, it’s not all based on him having a cute, high voice. We understand how important that is right now, but hopefully he will develop and the characters will develop, and it will still be a lot of fun.\n\t\n\t\tHow much of George R. R. Martin’s unpublished novels do you have access to? Do you have the details of stories that he hasn’t written yet?\t\n\n\tI do. There’s a document that few people have read. He works all offline. His computer is not connected to the internet, so things have to be printed out and passed around that way. I’ve seen the plan for 12, 13, 14, 15, maybe, of these novellas. It would be fantastic, but I don’t want to get carried away here. Let’s see if people watch the show. Maybe we’re just one, one and a half, two and done and we all go home, but it’s a lot of fun to write in this world so I hope we get to do more.\n",

The show is a departure from the serious politics and dragon battles of “Game of Thrones” and “House of the Dragon” and is a more humorous, grounded story of Ser Duncan’s journey through knighthood while at a jousting tourney. He’s also joined by a bald young squire named Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell), who he meets along the way while also running into new Targaryens, Baratheons and more.\n\n\t“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” is based on a series of novellas by George R. R. Martin, the author of the “A Song of Ice and Fire” series and creator of the “Game of Thrones” world. The first novella, “The Hedge Knight,” was published in 1998 and introduced readers to Ser Duncan, aka Dunk, and Egg. Martin followed that up with “The Sworn Sword” in 2003 and “The Mystery Knight” in 2010, and he has plans for even more books in the “Dunk and Egg” series (but first he has to finish the final two books in “A Song of Ice and Fire” and the second part of “Fire & Blood,” on which “House of the Dragon” is based).\n\n\tMeet Westeros’ newest characters in “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSer Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Steffan Hill\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tYou may remember hearing vague references to the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall here and there throughout “Game of Thrones,” but when we meet him in “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” he’s still an awkward, lanky guy going by his childhood nickname, Dunk.\n\n\tDunk became Ser Duncan after being knighted by Ser Arlan of Pennytree (Danny Webb), whom he spent years traveling with — and who very few people in Westeros have ever heard of. Since no one witnessed the knighting, Dunk has a hard time getting anyone to take him seriously. Still, he aspires to greatness.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEgg (Dexter Sol Ansell)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Steffan Hill\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEgg, an adorable little bald boy, drives Dunk crazy. But he’s also his only friend. Dunk first runs into the child at an inn he sleeps at on his way to a jousting tourney. Egg immediately shows a defiant streak, sassing Dunk when he asks for help with his horse and later making fun of his clothes, truthfully telling Dunk he doesn’t look like a knight. Still, he asks Dunk to take him in as his squire, hopeful to leave the inn and see a bit more of the world. Though Dunk declines, Egg sets out on his own and essentially gives himself the squire job, building a fire and cooking dinner at Dunk’s camp before he returns for the night. And it’s Egg who tells Dunk that he ought to go by Ser Duncan to command more respect. They’re an odd pair, but they’re good for each other.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSer Arlan of Pennytree (Danny Webb)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Steffan Hill\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSer Arlan is an elderly hedge knight who was Dunk’s mentor.

Their show was called \"The single best show in Vegas\" by the Los Angeles Times, and their hit series \"Penn & Teller: Fool Us!\" -- where up-and-coming magicians try to fool the famous pair -- has been renewed for a 12th season.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The good news is, tickets are still on sale for this upcoming weekend, suggesting Penn expects a quick recovery.\n      \n    \n          Next week, they're expected in Fort Myers, Florida.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Penn Jillette\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Comedy\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                Concerts and Tours\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

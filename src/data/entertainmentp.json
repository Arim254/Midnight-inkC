    "body": "\n\t“Highguard” maker Wildlight Entertainment has laid off multiple members of its staff less than a month after the release of its debut video game.\n\n\t“Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game,” Wildlight said in a statement Wednesday. “We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.”\n\t\n\n\tThe number of staff impacted by the layoffs was not disclosed and a representative for Wildlight declined Variety‘s request for further comment.\n\n\n\tFounded by CEO Dusty Welch and game director Chad Grenier, Wildlight Entertainment is made up of roughly 100 employees, the majority of which previously worked with Grenier and Welch at Electronic Arts’ Respawn on “Apex Legends.” The indie studio was created amid the pandemic and all staffers at the company were exclusively working on PvP raid shooter “Highguard,” which launched Jan. 26 across PC, Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5.\n\n\t“Highguard” is described as having “a new competitive structure that blends siege warfare and territory control in an evolving match where power levels escalate until only one base is left standing.” \n\n\tThe game has been closely compared to the successful “Overwatch” franchise and the now-shuttered PlayStation title “Concord.” And while “Highguard” launched with a three-person-team structure, rather than the 5v5 model utilized by “Overwatch 2” and “Concord,” it quickly added the five-person-team option in response to fan demand.\n\t\n\n\t“I think we do have a very unique game that is unlike anything else out there on the market, and we’re really excited about it,” Grenier told Variety at a press preview event for “Highguard” on Jan. 22.\n\n\t“What we’re confident in is that we’re not going anywhere. We’re not going away,” Welch said at the time. “We as a team have a lot of experience in building franchises that have staying power. And this one, as Chad alluded to, we have a year’s worth of content that’s near completion that is going to engage an audience for quite a bit of time. So we’re excited to be able to bring that. We have the experience, but that said, we’re humbled, and we hope people love this — but we’re ready to engage with them.”\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tWyatt Cenac will be grabbing the mic to host the 6th annual Awards for Excellence in Audio — aka the Ambies — in Brooklyn later this month.\n\n\tThe Ambies will be presented on Monday, Feb. 23, as part of On Air Fest at the Arlo Williamsburg hotel in Brooklyn. At the awards show, Cenac, an Emmy-winning comedian, writer and producer who is a “Daily Show” alum, will be joined by Donwill, who will serve as the evening’s official house DJ.\n\t\n\n\t“Podcasting has become one of the most exciting places for ideas and storytelling,” Cenac said in a statement. “I’m looking forward to honoring the creators, keeping the energy up, and helping make the night feel as vibey and engaging as the podcasts themselves. Plus, as a New Yorker, doing this in Brooklyn just makes it hit different.”\n\n\n\tThe Ambies are presented by the Podcast Academy, an independent professional podcast organization. This year, the Ambies received more than 1,600 submissions, the most entries since the awards debuted in 2021.\n\n\tCenac created, hosted and executive produced his own late-night show for HBO, “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas,” in which he explored America’s most pressing issues.

    "body": "\n\tMark Valadez, who served as a writer-producer on “Queen of the South,” will lead “Those Little White Lines” as showrunner, a new series being developed by Brisbane’s Red Empire Productions and Organic Media Group, based in Taipei and Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe drama draws from an autobiographical novel by Kaz Piper, a former rock-era insider, centering on a woman navigating the music industry during the 1980s. The narrative employs a dual-timeline structure to chronicle her journey through a world marked by substance abuse, criminal networks and personal danger before ultimately breaking free.\n\t\n\n\t“What drew me to ‘Those Little White Lines’ is the same thing that drives all great crime stories — a protagonist who survives by learning the rules faster than the people trying to control her,” Valadez said. “Set inside the excess of the 1980s music world, this is a story about power, addiction, ambition, and reinvention. It’s visceral, dangerous, and deeply human — exactly the kind of character-first drama I love to make.”\n\n\n\tThe producers are preparing to bring the project to buyers as an Australia-U.S. co-production.\n\n\tExecutive producer Steve Chicorel noted the international nature of the collaboration. “Developing ‘Those Little White Lines’ from Australia, Taiwan and the U.S. reflects how global motion pictures now truly works — creative voices, production, and audiences moving fluidly across borders,” he said. “Australia and Asia are no longer just markets; they’re part of a global creative engine. This series speaks to that evolution while delivering a powerful, character-driven story with international reach.”\n\t\n\n\tProduction will be based in Wollongong, Australia, under the supervision of Red Empire’s Amie Casey, with filming locations serving both contemporary and period settings. The executive producer roster includes Shari Hamrick Grewal from Organic Media Group, handling U.S. production and Taiwan casting, along with author Piper.\n\n\t“This story comes from lived experience — the glamour, the danger, the cost of wanting too much freedom too young,” Piper said. “For years I was told this world was too wild, too female, too honest to adapt. Seeing it reimagined as a series with this creative team feels like reclaiming my voice and finally telling the truth behind the myth of the era.”\n\n\tOrganic Media Group, launched by actor-producer Kelly Mi Li and musician-producer Chicorel, develops scripted and unscripted programming for international buyers, with a particular emphasis on projects that bridge Asian and Western markets.\n\n\tRed Empire Productions, established by writer-producer-actor Amie Casey, focuses on internationally oriented premium drama, partnering with producers across territories to bring Australian-originated content to worldwide viewers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJustin Baldoni and Blake Lively failed to settle her sexual harassment lawsuit on Wednesday, after a daylong mediation in federal court.\n\n\tThe co-stars of “It Ends With Us” entered the New York courthouse on Friday morning and spent much of the day in separate courtrooms on the 14th floor. At the end of the day, each exited the building, passed through a throng of media and said nothing.\n\n\n\tBryan Freedman, Baldoni’s attorney, confirmed to reporters that no deal had been reached. He acknowledged that a deal could still happen, but seemed to think it was unlikely. Asked if he believed the case will go to trial, he said, “I do. We’re looking forward to it.”\n\t\n\n\tThe mediation with Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave is a routine part of federal procedure. While both sides previously had in-person sessions with Cave, there was no outward indication that either side expected the talks to go anywhere.\n\n\n\tLively has accused Baldoni of harassing her on the set of “It Ends With Us,” and of working with his publicists to orchestrate a smear campaign against her after she complained. A trial is set for May 18.\n\n\tJudge Lewis Liman is considering whether to throw out or substantially pare back Lively’s complaint ahead of trial. Baldoni’s team has argued in a summary judgment motion that the suit amounts to little more than petty grievances that fall well below the standard for harassment. \n\n\tLively’s side, meanwhile, has noted that other actors also had complaints about Baldoni’s conduct on set, and that the allegations do rise to the level to be decided by a jury.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn 2019, Maggie O’Farrell’s agent sent emailed a group of producers and filmmakers to share a manuscript of the author’s upcoming book. “Hamnet,” as the novel was titled, centered around William Shakespeare and his wife, Agnes, following the couple as they grapple with the sudden death of their 11-year-old son. Liza Marshall, a U.K. based producer, read it in a single sitting. \n\n\t“It was such an extraordinarily moving book,” Marshall says. “I had a profound reaction to it. There was an intimacy to it, and it was incredibly tragic, but also cinematic. Ultimately, it’s about the healing power of storytelling.”  \n\t\n\n\tMost of the people O’Farrell’s agent contacted passed on the project, but Marshall jumped at the chance to make her pitch. She connected with O’Farrell, who was at home in Edinburgh, over Zoom, and the two hit it off. \n\n\n\t“She’s a very generous person who realized, as she puts it, that the book is her baby and the film is like her nephew,” Marshall says. “She always knew it would be a different thing, and it was never going to be a replica of the book. It was always an adaptation.”\n\n\tSo Marshall snapped up the rights before the novel hit shelves, which turned out to be a smart business decision. When “Hamnet” was published in 2020 at the height of the pandemic, its story of love and loss resonated with people whose lives had been upended. The film adaptation was soon set up at Steven Spielberg’s Amblin, which brought in Focus Features thanks to a production deal that the companies maintain. The partners then enlisted Chloé Zhao, the Oscar-winning director behind “Nomadland,” to find a way to make a domestic tragedy set in Elizabethan England compelling for modern audiences. \n\t\n\n\t“We had confidence in Chloé,” says Kiska Higgs, Focus’ president of production and acquisitions. “She’s entrancing. And she’d gotten all this acclaim and attention for her work. She said that she was really interested in just making a film and creating a family and having an emotional transformation. That’s what she set out to do, and that’s what we’re drawn to.”\n\n\tZhao turned to O’Farrell to help her adapt the novel. The pair streamlined the storyline and made it unfold chronologically, a change from the book, which moves backwards and forwards in time. And certain characters, such as Agnes’ mother, were reduced so the story could focus more intently on how William Shakespeare and his wife process their trauma. Zhao also let her ensemble, which includes Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, shape their characters through dream workshops during which they analyzed their nocturnal imaginings. \n\n\t“A lot of dialogue came out of that, and a lot of imagery came out of that,” Higgs says. “And then Chloe and Maggie would consult and return to the authenticity of the book and the historicity of it.”\n\n\tWhen “Hamnet” opened last fall, it scored rave reviews. It also became one of the few indie productions to cross over to the mainstream. Filmed for $35 million, “Hamnet” has gone on to earn $70.6 million. It has performed particularly strongly internationally with $48.8 of its haul coming from foreign markets, outgrossing “The Favourite,” “Poor Things,” “Conclave” and “Belfast” at the same point in their life cycles. Marshall thinks that the story of one family’s grief resonates with audiences who are looking for a way to connect at a time when the world can feel polarized. \n\n\t“It gives people a real reason to go to the cinema,” she says. “People are hearing about the emotional power of the film and wanting to experience that in a darkened room with strangers. I’ve seen the film as you can imagine, many, many, times, but when I sat in the audience at its premiere, I started crying all over again. There’s this kind of collective emotional outpouring that’s happening in cinemas. People want to do that communally. That’s why Shakespeare wrote his plays.” \n\n\tThe film’s success has also spurred interest in the novel. Sales of the book are up sevenfold and the novel climbed up the best-seller list in the U.K., cresting at number two. \n\t\n\n\t“It’s really complementary,” says Higgs. “Seeing this story in a theater makes a lot of people want to return to the book or read it for the first time. It’s a virtuous cycle.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAMC Networks reported its fourth-quarter 2025 earnings Wednesday, revealing U.S. ad sales were down 10% from last year while subscribers across the company’s streaming platforms remained at the prior quarter’s 10.4 million mark.\n\n\tCurrently, AMC Networks’ streaming portfolio consists of AMC+, Acorn TV, Shudder, Sundance Now, ALLBLK, HIDIVE and the newly launched All Reality. AMC’s linear networks include AMC, BBC AMERICA (which includes U.S. distribution and sales for BBC News), IFC, SundanceTV and We TV. The company also owns film distribution labels Independent Film Company and RLJE Films (which it acquired outright in Q4), and in-house studio AMC Studios.\n\t\n\n\tFor the U.S. business, subscription revenue was $315 million for the October-December quarter. Within that, streaming revenue jumped 14% to $177 million. Domestic ad sales came in at $125 million. Revenue from content licensing and “other” categories was up 12% at $75 million.\n\n\n\tThis marks the first quarter in the history of AMC Networks where streaming represented the biggest revenue source for the company.\n\n\tLooking at AMC Networks’ international segment, subscription revenues totaled $49 million. Ad sales were $30 million, down nearly 13% year over year. Content licensing dropped 15% to $3.2 million.\n\n\tWall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 66 cents on $581.8 million in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG. AMC Networks reported adjusted EPS of 64 cents on $595 million in revenue. Revenue was down less than 1% from the comparable Q4 2024. \n\n\tFree cash flow for the quarter stood at $40.4 million.\n\t\n\n\t“AMC Networks had a successful 2025,” AMC Networks CEO Kristin Dolan said in a letter to shareholders. “Streaming is now the largest single source of revenue in our domestic segment, a significant milestone and inflection point in the ongoing transformation of our business. We delivered free cash flow well ahead of our previously increased forecast and once again achieved our financial guidance for the year. We look forward to continuing to take advantage of our independence and unique strengths as we drive the company forward during a time of change in our industry.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBig news for “Diablo II” fans: the Blizzard Entertainment game is getting its first major update in 25 years.\n\n\tTitled “Reign of the Warlock,” the DLC will feature actor Rahul Kohli (“The Haunting of Bly Manor,” “Midnight Mass,” “iZombie”) starring as the voice of the titular Warlock. Per Blizzard, “the Warlock is disciplined, ominous, and incredibly knowledgeable, lingering in the shadows for years and studying secrets mortals shouldn’t know.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to debuting in the new update for “Diablo II: Resurrected” (which is the remastered version of the original “Diablo II”), the Warlock class will arrive in the upcoming “Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred” update in April and the mobile title “Diablo Immortal” this summer.\n\n\n\tThese announcements were made by Blizzard Entertainment on Wednesday as part of a showcase teasing multiple ways the Microsoft-owned “Diablo” franchise will be marking its 30th anniversary this year leading up to more reveals at BlizzCon in September.\n\n\t“Reign of the Warlock” launches Wednesday in “Diablo II: Resurrected” across Battle.net, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch. “Diablo Immortal’s” Warlock-focused update, “Andariel Rises,” will debut this summer. \n\n\tThe “Diablo IV” update “Lord of Hatred” arrives April 28 on Battle.net, PlayStation, Xbox and Steam, and more information about how the Warlock will be worked into that DLC  will be revealed in a developer update event on March 5 at 11 a.m. PT.\n\n\t“This actually just came out of the blue,” Kohli told Variety in an interview ahead of the official announcement. “I received a text message from Rod Fergusson, who said, ‘Do you not want to do Diablo?’ And I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’ And he was like, ‘We haven’t heard back.’ I went to my team and I was like, ‘What’s going on? Diablo?’ And they basically forwarded this offer, and in the email heading it said ‘Diablo II,’ which I thought was a typo, an error. It’s probably ‘Diablo IV’ they mean.”\n\t\n\n\tKohli continued: “Because I also had worked with Rod previously on ‘Gears of War,’ I sort of assumed at some point ‘Diablo IV’ would come knocking, and it never did. So I sort of resented him for that. And then when that came through, and it was ‘Diablo II,’ obviously, I thought it was a typo. But then once I looked through the character profile, I realized, ‘Oh, this is new content for a game that came out in the year 2000.’ Obviously, it’s for the remaster, but it’s still new content for a 26-year-old game. So I was very hyped.”\n\n\tWatch the “Diablo” franchise’s cinematic trailer introducing Kohli’s Warlock character in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOne of Kal Penn‘s breakout roles was playing the character Taj Mahal Badalandabad in the 2002 comedy hit “National Lampoon’s Van Wilder.” At the end of the audition process, Penn was up against one other actor that ended up inspiring him to work hard to win the part. Penn recounted the story on the Feb. 11 episode of the podcast “Hasan Minhaj Doesn’t Know.”\n\n\t“I knew at the end, it was like, ‘All right, it’s me and another actor,'” he said. “I’m like, ‘Which brother is it?’ I’m excited that one of us is gonna get this. I open the door and it is a white dude in brownface who’s already in the waiting room. And my beef is generally not with other actors. Actors are desperate. We’ll do whatever it takes to get a part, right? But I was so fascinated. I’m like, ‘Okay, did his agent tell him to paint his face when he left? Did he do it at home or did he do it in the bathroom? If he did it at home, did it increase his chances of getting pulled over by the cops?’ All of these thoughts going through my head.”\n\t\n\n\tDespite his surprise, Penn said that he actually made small talk with the actor that day and hung out with him a few times afterward. But he also said it motivated him more than ever to get the role.\n\n\n\t“Telling it now, you’re like, ‘Oh my God, people did brownface,'” Penn said. “Like the new ‘Aladdin’ a couple of years ago had brownface with a bunch of extras, right? So it does still happen, obviously in a totally different way, but it was common enough, right? But I do remember looking at him while we’re making small talk and in my head just saying to myself, ‘He is not allowed to get that part.'”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the video podcast below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRandy Fine, a member of the Republican party who is serving as a U.S. representative for Florida’s 6th congressional district, ignited bipartisan backlash on X after he publicized a letter he sent to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr demanding “a full and immediate investigation” into Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl Halftime Show. \n\n\t“It doesn’t matter if you say it in Spanish. Encouraging children to use cocaine in a live television broadcast is a crime. It doesn’t matter who is singing,” Fine writes in the letter. “Broadcasting the F-word during the Super Bowl is illegal. Both of these things happened during Sunday’s Super Bowl broadcast… I urge the FCC to conduct a thorough investigation and to pursue the maximum penalties permitted by law. Anything less would signal that indecency is tolerated so long as it is profitable, and that it a message that cannot be allowed to stand.” \n\t\n\n\tBen Stiller was one of the most prominent Hollywood figures to mock Fine for his campaign against Bad Bunny, whose Super Bowl Halftime Show has resulted in many Republicans melting down on social media.\n\n\t“Focus of investigation: how did Bad Bunny manage to kick ass at such a high level and deliver the most watched and well produced half time show about inclusion and love ever made?” Stiller playfully replied to Fine on X. “Investigators plan to explore source of Bunny’s huge talent, off the charts charisma and an even bigger heart.”\n\n\tStiller’s response was then challenged by supporters of Fine who were similarly not fans of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance, so Stiller decided to troll them, too.\n\t\n\n\t“When you spend your entire life in the bubble of Hollywood where everything is given to you because of your family…. You become self righteous, unaware Ben Stiller,” one social media user told the comedian, who fired back: “Thanks. I live and am from New York City, and am grateful for my family and wish you all the best.”\n\n\tAnother X user informed Stiller that Bad Bunny’s show “wasn’t the most watched halftime. Kendrick [Lamar] was,” as if to imply that meant Bad Bunny shouldn’t have been the performer. Stiller responded: “Kendrick was amazing, too.”\n\n\t“All of your friends were just caught raping and eating babies. You should definitely sit this one out even if you’re right,” one user who claimed to be “a Knicks fan and longtime Ben Stiller fan” said, to which the actor replied: “Wishing you all the best. I love my friends and family (none criminals) and wish you yours only good things.”\n\n\tStiller was following in the footsteps of Andy Cohen, the host of Bravo’s nightly talk show “Watch What Happens Live” who spent a good part of the day after the Super Bowl trolling Bad Bunny haters on Threads.\n\nFocus of investigation: how did Bad Bunny manage to kick ass at such a high level and deliver the most watched and well produced half time show about inclusion and love ever made….investigators plan to explore source of Bunny’s huge talent, off the charts charisma and even…— Ben Stiller (@BenStiller) February 11, 2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks.

The note goes on, \"If they want the name of the individual involved then I want 1 Bitcoin to the following wallet. Time is more than relevant.\"\n      \n    \n          There is a legitimate bitcoin address in the note ... and it is a different address from the one in the original ransom note, received by TMZ and 2 Tucson TV news stations.\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n    \n          We have forwarded this note to the FBI.\n      \n    \n          It's unclear if the sender of this note is legit, but interestingly, 1 bitcoin is worth about $66,000 right now. You'll recall law enforcement is currently offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Nancy's kidnappers.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          This comes less than 24 hours after a flurry of activity in the case -- on Tuesday, the FBI released the first images of the armed individual who showed up on Nancy's doorstep early in the morning of Feb. 1, the day she was taken.\n      \n    \n          Then, in the evening, cops detained a person of interest ... a deliveryman who was pulled over in a Tucson suburb. After questioning him, though, law enforcement released the man, who told reporters he didn't even know who Nancy was.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Savannah Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Annie Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Camron Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie Case\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

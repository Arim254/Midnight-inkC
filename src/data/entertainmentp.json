    "body": "\n\tPatrick Dempsey paid tribute to his “Grey’s Anatomy” co-star Eric Dane, calling him “the funniest man” and “such a joy to work with” after Dane died on Feb. 19 at 53 years old.\n\n\tThe two starred on “Grey’s Anatomy” together for several season as Dr. Derek Shepherd and and Dr. Mark Sloan, aka McDreamy and McSteamy. They played rival surgeons who later became best friends and two of the biggest heartthrobs on the medical drama. \n\n\n\t“I just woke up this morning, and I was very sad to read the news,” Dempsey said on “The Chris Evans Breakfast Show” Friday morning. “It’s hard to put into words. I feel really so sad for his children. I was corresponding with him, we were texting. So I spoke to him about a week ago.”\n\t\n\n\tDempsey added, “Some friends of ours went in to see him, and he was really starting to lose his ability to speak, he was bed-ridden and it was very hard for him to swallow. The quality of his life was deteriorating so rapidly.” Dane revealed his ALS diagnosis in 2025 and had opened up about his physical challenges in recent months. Despite his diagnosis, he vowed to keep working and completed his filming on “Euphoria” Season 3, releasing on HBO in April.\n\n\t“He had a great sense of humor,” Dempsey said. “He was easy to work with, we got along instantly. First scene was him, you know, in all his glory, coming out of the bathroom with the towel on looking amazing, making you feel completely out of shape and insignificant.”\n\n\t“Grey’s Anatomy” creator Shonda Rhimes also paid tribute to Dane after his death, saying in a statement, “Eric Dane was a beloved member of the Shondaland and ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ families. He was truly a gifted actor whose portrayal of Dr. Mark Sloan left an indelible mark on the series and on audiences around the world. We are grateful for the artistry, spirit, friendship and humanity he shared with us for so many years. Our hearts are with his family, loved ones, and all who were touched by his work.”\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tVirgin Music Group, the independent-distribution and artist-services division of Universal Music Group, has announced the completion of its $775 mil",
    "body": "\n\tVirgin Music Group, the independent-distribution and artist-services division of Universal Music Group, has announced the completion of its $775 million acquisition of Downtown Music Holdings LLC, one of the largest artist-services companies in the world.\n\n\tAt the same time, Pieter van Rijn was appointed chief operating officer, having been CEO of Downtown since last year (and previously CEO of Netherlands-based distributor and services company FUGA). He will report to Virgin co-CEOs Nat Pastor and JT Myers and will continue to be based in Amsterdam.\n\t\n\n\tDowntown founder Justin Kalifowitz confirmed he is stepping away from the company he launched in 2007, via a letter on Downtown’s website. Andrew Bergman, previously chairman of Downtown, will transition into a senior advisory role.\n\n\n\tInitially established in 2007, Downtown collectively serves over 5,000 business clients and more than four million creators in 145 countries, according to the announcement. While it was formerly a major publishing company, in 2021 it sold its copyrights to Concord in a $300 million to focus on artist services, a surprise move that turned out to be prescient as more and more artists own their copyrights but lack the infrastructure to release, manufacture and promote their music — which artist service companies provide. Downtown currently has core divisions across artist & label services, distribution, and a new music publishing unit. The company’s portfolio of businesses includes FUGA, Downtown Artist & Label Services, CD Baby, Downtown Music Publishing and Songtrust.\n\t\n\n\tWhile the sale was announced in December of 2024, the European Union conducted an extensive regulatory analysis; Virgin agreed to divest the Curve platform, Downtown’s royalty and rights management subsidiary, as part of its deal. \n\n\tThe sale was strenuously opposed by Impala, the European independent music collective, arguing essentially on the grounds that Universal, already the world’s largest music company, is large enough.\n\n\tAs COO of Virgin Music Group, van Rijn will oversee global operations, tech, product and strategic integration across the combined businesses, according to the announcement.\n\n\tPastor says, “Pieter’s appointment signals our intent to bring these businesses together thoughtfully and strategically. This is about making both Virgin Music Group and Downtown even better — preserving their distinct strengths while increasing the investment, technology and global resources available to independent entrepreneurs.”\n\n\tMyers adds, “Today recognizes the extraordinary company the Downtown team has built. Justin’s pioneering spirit — and the leadership of Andrew, Pieter and colleagues worldwide — created an organization defined by its powerful belief in independent creators. We deeply respect what this team has built and are committed to backing it, protecting what makes Downtown successful, and expanding opportunities for the global independent community.”\n\n\tIn a farewell letter posted on the Downtown website, Kalifowitz — who has been pursuing other business interests since he stepped down as CEO in 2024 — wrote in part, “Our first hit was the 2007 ringtone of the year — a phrase that now feels museum-worthy. CDs were collapsing, streaming hadn’t yet found its footing, and most of the conversation centered on what was being lost. …\n\n\t“Of all the changes over the past two decades,” he continues, “the one I believe we helped shape most is mindset — that creators deserve choice, that independence can scale, that service is not a weakness but a strategy.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe first rule of Fight Club is back on the big screen — and this time, it’s in 4K.\n\n\tDavid Fincher’s 1999 cult classic will return to theaters nationwide for a one-night-only event on April 22, marking the film’s first-ever release in 4K Ultra HD. The re-release precedes a May 12 home entertainment rollout on 4K Ultra HD Steelbook and 4K Digital. It isn’t available to pre-order yet but will likely arrive on Amazon in the coming days. \n\n\n\tBased on Chuck Palahniuk’s novel of the same name, “Fight Club” stars Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter in the anarchic tale of an insomniac office worker who forms an underground fight ring with a charismatic soap salesman — only to spiral into a broader anti-consumerist movement that defined a generation of late-’90s moviegoers. When the film first hit theaters on Oct. 15, 1999, it bombed at the box office. But, in the decades since, the movie has become a defining film of the 1990s and a symbol of cinematic innovation, in terms of filmmaking technology and its exploration of sociopolitical themes. \n\n\tThe new 4K restoration promises enhanced clarity and immersive sound design, bringing renewed intensity to Fincher’s shadowy, hyper-stylized vision. Collectors can also bring the film home beginning May 12, when it arrives on 4K Ultra HD Steelbook — featuring premium packaging — as well as on 4K Digital.\n\n\t“Fight Club” is not the only one of the filmmaker’s classic works to get a second look. Last year, at the Tribeca Festival, Fincher detailed his work on a 4K remaster of his 1995 crime thriller “Se7en,” starring Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tMaison Krug is turning the 2008 vintage into a musical score. \n\n\tAt London’s Roundhouse last Tuesday, the storied Champagne house unveiled the newest installment of its “Every Note Counts” series, a multisensory collaboration between Krug cellar master Julie Cavil and composer Max Richter that pairs three 2008 cuvées with three original musical works — performed live by orchestra and followed by a dinner from Krug Ambassade Chef Adam Handling. \n\n\n\tFor Richter, best known for his genre-blurring classical compositions and film scores (most recently earning an Oscar nod for “Hamnet“) writing music inspired by champagne offered a new kind of prompt. “Every project has a starting point,” he tells Variety from a London hotel following the global reveal. “Obviously, I work mostly in concert music and records and movies. So I’m used to that as an origin. But this was a different way to begin.” \n\n\tRather than composing from a blank slate, Richter immersed himself in Krug’s world. “I spent a lot of time over in the vineyards, tasting all the different things, being in the cellars, just experiencing the whole world of Krug really,” he says. “Creativity is all about asking questions and curiosity.” \n\n\tOne of those questions was deceptively simple: What does a bubble sound like? \n\n\t“When I’m working on a project, I’m always trying to find new ways to think, new ways to look at a question,” Richter says. “I thought one of the things is like, ‘Well, what is the experience of a bubble?’ Imagine you’re a bubble. What’s going on around you?” The answer, he suggested, can be heard in rising piano motifs that mirror effervescence in the first of the three songs he composed for the series. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRose Uniacke and David Heyman at ‘Every Note Counts’ music tasting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Benett\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Daisy Edgar-Jones and Lily James at ‘Every Note Counts’ music tasting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Benett\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pierce Brosnan at ‘Every Note Counts’ music tasting \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Benett\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe three resulting compositions — “Clarity,” “Ensemble” and “Sinfonia” — correspond to Krug Clos d’Ambonnay 2008, Krug 2008 and Krug Grande Cuvée 164ème Édition, each translating the texture and structure of the wine into sound. \n\n\tFor Cavil, the collaboration felt instinctive. “Max is a Krug lover,” she said, noting that she was drawn to his fusion of the classic and modern worlds.  That balance, she adds, mirrors Krug’s own philosophy: honoring tradition while continually reinterpreting it — particularly resonant for the 2008 vintage, often described as a classical year in Champagne. “Max’s willingness to experiment, and reinterpret classical forms with subtle twists, resonates with me,” Cavil says. “The year 2008 is a classical vintage with a twist.” Founded in 1843 by Joseph Krug, the maison has long prioritized individuality of plot and the meticulous blending of reserve wines to achieve what it calls “the most generous expression of Champagne.”\n\n\tThe immersive unveiling at the Roundhouse translated that philosophy into live performance: guests experienced Richter’s three pieces in sequence, accompanied by tastings of the corresponding wines, in what Krug described in a press release as a “recomposition of the year 2008 — not as a moment frozen in time, but as one that resonates across senses.” An accompanying documentary chronicling the collaboration is also now available online here.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBeyond the brand partnership, the event arrives at a pivotal moment for Richter. The composer — known for his genre-blurring solo albums and scores for projects including “Shutter Island,” “Arrival” and “The Leftovers” — recently received his first Oscar nomination for his work on “Hamnet.”\n\n\t“You find these things out nowadays by your phone blowing up,” he says about the moment he found out about his nomination last month. “‘Hamnet’ is really beautiful. The whole thing is really special. Chloe is an amazing director, really a visionary. The cast and Jesse [Buckley] is extraordinary in it. I mean, really a performance, really special performance. So it’s a magical project, and they don’t come along very often, so it’s great to be part of it. It’s great to be able to also support the ‘Hamnet’ village, because it really is a village.”\n\n\tAmid all the noise in his life, though, “Every Note Counts” argues for intentionality —  in both music and winemaking. “It’s about elevating a simple thing,” he says. “We live in a very busy world. We’re saturated with experiences. I think a big part of being a human being today is about recovering a kind of intentionality and going deeper, rather than wider.”\n\n\n\tAt the Roundhouse, this depth came from a performance that he saw as more of “asking a question of the world,” he says. “It’s half of a conversation: What about this?”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLast year, ESPN and Major League Baseball appeared to have struck out. A decades-old alliance was torn asunder, with the Disney sports giant backing away from its long-running “Sunday Night Baseball.”\n\n\tThose Sunday games have gone to NBC, but ESPN believes it has gotten its corporate mitt on something better.\n\n\tESPN on Friday started distributing MLB.TV via the ESPN App and ESPN.com., a venture that ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro has long coveted. The pact, part of a realignment of MLB’s sports-rights relationships gives ESPN purview over thousands of games that are made available to fans outside a specific home team’s market — widely seen as some of the most passionate and enthusiastic among followers of the national pastime.\n\t\n\n\t“This allows us to provide more to baseball fans,” says Ashley O’Connor, vice president of programming and acquisitions of ESPN, during a recent interview. The new arrangement “is super serving that avid baseball fan who does watch 162 games a year, and gives them that opportunity to do it within the ESPN environment.”\n\n\tWhile ESPN will televise 30 national games each season as part of its new arrangement with the baseball league, the MLB.TV service is an add-on. Current subscribers to ESPN’s “Unlimited” tier can purchase MLB.TV for $134.99 for the 2026 season, and then renew seasonally at the then-current price. Fans without the “Unlimited” plan can purchase MLB.TV for $149.99 seasonally, with a free month of ESPN Unlimited included. Monthly subscription options are also available for $29.99, with new subscribers eligible for a free month of ESPN Unlimited.\n\t\n\n\tSubscribers will be able to watch games via the digital platforms of either ESPN or MLB, says O’Connor. \n\n\tWhatever their decision, chances are more baseball fans who aren’t as tied to ESPN will gain more familiarity with its platforms.\n\n\tESPN’s move into local and regional games comes as Major League Baseball is trying to take more control over the properties, a nod to the waning fortunes of stand-alone cable networks devoted to the telecasts of regional sports teams. MLB now controls local broadcast rights for half of its 30 teams, largely due to the deteriorating economics of Main Street Sports Group, a consortium of regional sports networks that has seen several baseball teams exit pacts. \n\n\tESPN and the league may work to develop MLB.TV over time, the executive says. “I do think that together we can continue to evolve,” she says. “MLB.TV has been around for a long time and is a great service, but I do think that with two sets of minds, we can figure out how to make it better.”\n\n\tMore is on the way. In 2027, ESPN will be able to deliver local teams to viewers in their own markets, an arrangement that is likely to grow as MLB seeks to be more involved in its teams distribution arrangements.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHulu has picked up a full-length series version of the popular web show “Childish Deano,” Variety has learned. \n\n\tThe eight-episode, half-hour comedy — now simply titled “Deano” — hails from creators Dean Thomas and David Ferrier. Both serve as writers on the series with Thomas providing the voice of Deano. Joe Brumm, the creator of the smash hit animated kids show “Bluey,” will also executive produce in what will be his first adult animated series producing credit. \n\t\n\n\tHooligan Animation will produce the show at its studios in Brisbane, Australia, with support from the Australian Federal government’s Producer Offset along with a PDV grant from the State of Queensland. Hooligan’s Greg Basser, Tracey Robertson, Ross Shuman, Nathan Mayfield, and Tracey Vieira are all executive producers on the show along with Adam Bailey for BBC Studios. BBC Studios, 20th Television Animation, and Hooligan Animation will all co-produce. BBC Studios will be the lead studio with Hulu distributing the show worldwide. \n\n\n\t“We’re so excited to bring our spicy child and his sidekick to a global audience with two of the world’s biggest story megaphones in Disney and the BBC,” Thomas and Ferrier said. “It’s so unreal we’re half expecting someone to tell us it’s a prank.”\n\n\tThe show will premiere on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ for bundle subscribers in the U.S. and on Disney+ internationally. In the UK, the series will premiere first on BBC iPlayer and BBC One, and then also stream on Disney+.\n\n\tThe official description of the show states:\n\n\t“Deano is a spirited cheeky charmer of a boy, whose tough exterior coats a real heart of gold. He is the most endearing feisty kid you will ever meet and is growing up in a ruthlessly tough neighborhood in a house that should be condemned. He has no concept that the chips are stacked against him and embraces everyone equally, from the local teenage dropouts to the town police chief. At the heart of the series is Deano’s friendship with Kit, his timid best mate from the wealthy side of town. Kit is blind to Deano’s circumstances and is drawn to his friend’s energy and fearless worldview. Together, they walk face-first into an unfiltered world that’s leaking empathy by the hour; yet somehow, Deano still shines as a beacon of irreverent optimism, a reminder of how good life can feel.” \n\t\n\n\t“’Deano’ is smart, character-driven, and wickedly irreverent — the kind of series that stays with you long after the credits roll,” said Zai Bennett, CEO and chief creative officer of BBC Studios Global Content. “As our first venture into adult animation, the project and the partnerships behind it reflect BBC Studios’ commitment to innovation and creative boldness. Alongside Hooligan and the BBC, Disney is an ideal collaborator, sharing our ambition to deliver conversation-starting storytelling worldwide.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance‘s potential deal to snap up Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety has cleared antitrust review at the U.S. Justice Department — despite the fact that David Ellison’s Paramount has repeatedly failed to secure an agreement to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD for now remains committed to its deal with Netflix. \n\n\tOn Feb. 19, 2026, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern, the 10-day statutory waiting period expired following Paramount Skydance’s certification of compliance with the DOJ’s Dec. 23, 2025 Second Request for Information under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the company said in an SEC filing Friday.\n\t\n\n\tThe expiration of the HSR waiting period “means there is no statutory impediment in the U.S. to closing Paramount’s proposed acquisition of WBD,” according to Paramount Skydance. \n\n\n\tNetflix, in response to the Paramount announcement, argued that the development does not mean Paramount’s prospective WBD takeover has received DOJ regulatory approval. “Paramount Skydance continues to mislead stockholders and distract from the facts,” Netflix chief legal officer David Hyman said in a statement. “The facts are that routine HSR milestones do not signal DOJ approval nor that any decision has been made. They have not secured approvals needed to close and they are a long way from doing so.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Paramount acknowledged in the SEC filing that it doesn’t have an agreement in place to actually buy WBD. “The completion of the Transaction remains subject to certain other conditions, including entry into a definitive merger agreement with WBD, shareholder approval and regulatory clearance in other relevant jurisdictions,” the media company said in the filing.\n\t\n\n\tOn Thursday, a group of eight U.S. Democratic senators, led by Sen. Corey Booker (D-N.J.) — concerned about “political interference” in Paramount’s pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery — sent a letter to Ellison requesting answers to questions about Paramount’s dealings with the Trump administration with respect to WBD and directing the company to preserve all records related to the matter.\n\n\tAmong other documentation, the senators said, Paramount must retain “All communications, information, and documents related to Paramount’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery and the DOJ’s Second Request for Information, including communications with President Donald Trump, members of his family, or individuals associated or affiliated with President Trump; Administration officials, including White House and DOJ political appointees; and DOJ Antitrust Division officials.”\n\n\tWBD has a definitive $83 billion agreement with Netflix to sell Warner Bros.’s studios and HBO Max to the streamer. Warner Bros. Discovery has set a March 20 special meeting of shareholders to vote on the Netflix pact.\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery has rejected Ellison’s overtures multiple times since the Paramount Skydance chairman and CEO first approached the board last September. Paramount’s interest in buying WBD triggered an M&A review in which Netflix emerged as the winning suitor.\n\n\tBut on Tuesday, WBD — with Netflix’s approval — opened a seven-day window for talks with Paramount to “seek clarity” on its “best and final offer” in its hostile takeover effort to see if Ellison and his backers will raise their bid over $30/share. The negotiating window with Paramount ends Monday, Feb. 23, and Warner Bros. Discovery is set to hold its Q4 2025 earnings call just a few days later on Feb. 26. Netflix has four days to make a counteroffer in the event Paramount puts forward a higher bid.\n\n\tFor now, WBD said it remained committed to the Netflix agreement and has recommended shareholders vote in favor of the Netflix pact at the March 20 meeting.\n\n\tSEE ALSO: Inside Warner Bros.

    "body": "\n\t“Anora” breakout Mark Eydelshteyn has landed his first English-language role since Sean Baker’s Palme d’Or- and multiple Oscar-winning film, starring alongside fast-rising actor Esther McGregor (“BabyGirl,” “The Room Next Door”) in “Becoming Capa.”\n\n\tThe film — written and directed by Charlotte Colbert (“She Will”) — has now wrapped after shooting on location in Bilbao, Madrid and Paris. \n\n\n\t“Becoming Capa” — described as a “tale of love, audacity and defiance against a world in political turmoil” — tells the story of celebrated war photographers Gerda Taro and Robert Capa. Alongside McGregor and Eydelshteyn, the cast includes Emily Carey (“Geek Girl”), William Gao (“Heartstopper”), Nabhaan Rizwan (“Kaos,” “In Camera”), Rossy de Palma (“Parallel Mothers”), Mathieu Demy (“On The Verge”), Bruno Gouery (“Emily in Paris”), with Clémence Poésy (“In Bruges,” “Tenet”) and Danny Huston (“Yellowstone”).\n\t\n\n\tNow in post-production in London, the film has brought together an impressive array of producers in Andrea Cornwell at Lobo Films (“Wicker,” Love Lies Bleeding,” “Saint Maud”); Chris Curling at Zephyr Films (“The Last Station,” “The Miracle Club,” “”Daliland”); and British filmmaking icon Jeremy Thomas at Recorded Picture Company, best known for “The Last Emperor” as well as long collaborations with directors such as David Cronenberg, Stephen Frears and Takashi Miike.\n\n\tBehind the camera, the “Becoming Capa” creative team includes Oscar-winning production designer Eugenio Caballero (“Pan’s Labyrinth,” “Roma,” “The Impossible”); director of photography Pawel Pogorzelski (“Hereditary,” “Midsommer,” “Beau is Afraid”); Oscar-winning make-up designer Stephanie Guillon (“The Substance”); and editor Sam Sneade (“I Swear,” “Sexy Beast,” “Birth”).\n\t\n\n\tCharlotte Colbert made her feature debut with the BIFA-nominated “She Will” starring Alice Krige, Malcolm McDowell and Rupert Everett, which won the Golden Leopard for best debut at Locarno. As an artist, her work has been shown in public spaces, galleries, art fairs and institutions internationally, including the V&A, Montpellier Contemporain, Frieze, Museum of Egypt in Cairo and Art Basel. This year, she is set to have new large-scale public works installed in Manhattan, New York City, Dallas and along the Grand Canal in Venice for the Art Biennale.\n\n\t“Becoming Capa” was co-produced by Morena Films in Spain and Opal Films in France.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichael Lynton, the former CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, now wishes he had thought a little more carefully before greenlighting “The Interview,” Seth Rogen‘s dark comedy about a plan to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \n\n\tLynton’s new memoir “From Mistakes to Meaning: Owning Your Past So It Doesn’t Own You,” co-written with Joshua L. Steiner, was excerpted in the Wall St. Journal Thursday, and in the book that publishes next week, the executive admits he may have made the decision too hastily. \n\t\n\n\tBut when Lynton was informed on Nov. 24, 2014 that all of Sony’s email systems were down as well as its production and financial IT systems, he had no idea that North Korea could be behind the massive tech meltdown affecting his studio. All he knew was that he, Rogen and co-chair Amy Pascal had enthusiastically decided to make a smart comedy and were planning to release it in theaters on Christmas.\n\n\n\tCausing one of the biggest upheavals in Hollywood history, the IT meltdown irreparably damaged 70% of Sony’s servers, and exposed private communications from executives and talent as well as personal information. \n\n\t“Over the next few days and weeks the situation only worsened as the hackers released stolen emails that revealed terrible judgment, confidential scripts and personal information — including my family’s,” Lynton writes in his memoir.\n\n\tAs a result of what was revealed in the emails, the studio lost relationships with important stars including Will Smith, Adam Sandler and Angelina Jolie. Lynton says he spoke to President Obama eight months after the hack, when it was clear that North Korea had hacked Sony. Obama asked Lynton, “What were you thinking when you made killing the leader of a hostile foreign nation a plot point? Of course that was a mistake.”\n\t\n\n\t“Not long after the hack, a mysterious website appeared, inviting journalists to type ‘Die Sony’ into any internet browser, where they could find tens of thousands of leaked emails. Emails in which studio executives criticized movie stars. Emails that had sensitive employment contracts. Then the hackers started releasing employee health records and Social Security numbers. They published pirated versions of upcoming movies such as ‘The Karate Kid.’ They even released the confidential script of the new James Bond movie. That’s the ultimate Hollywood sacrilege. As part of the leaked documents, my daughters’ health records flashed across the internet,” Lynton writes.\n\n\tNorth Korea threatened theaters with violence and Sony ended up pulling the theatrical release of “The Interview,” although it played in a few independent theaters. It ended up becoming the first major studio release to premiere on the internet. \n\n\tLynton concludes that some of his motivation for greenlighting the film came from a desire to be accepted and “hang as an equal with the actors.”\n\n\t“Just for a moment, I wanted to join the badass gang that made subversive movies. For a moment, I wanted to hang — as an equal — with the actors. I had grown tired of playing the responsible adult, of watching the party from the outside while I played Risk….The party got out of hand, and the company, its employees, my family and I all paid dearly,” Lynton says.\n\n\tThe former Sony boss also writes that “two other factors complicated the situation. First, Amy Pascal, my co-chairperson at Sony, and Stacey Snider, the chairwoman at Universal Studios, while friends, had a 20-year rivalry. Second, Rogen felt that he had to make each movie more and more outrageous to keep his audience engaged. So when either Stacey or Amy refused to greenlight a film because it was too offensive, the other agreed to make it. And guess what? It was inevitably a hit.”\n\n\t“Sony found itself in the difficult position of not being able to say no, and Rogen found himself in the enviable position of getting approval for almost anything that he chose to present,” adds Lynton, who greenlit the film immediately after a favorable table read of the script. \n\n\tLynton’s memoir, “From Mistakes to Meaning: Owning Your Past So It Doesn’t Own You,” publishes Feb. 24 from Avid Reader Press.\n",

    "description": "\n\tEric Dane‘s final interview before his death is now streaming on Netflix as part of the platform’s posthumous interview series “Famous Last Words,” ",
    "body": "\n\tEric Dane‘s final interview before his death is now streaming on Netflix as part of the platform’s posthumous interview series “Famous Last Words,” which “gives audiences around the world the opportunity to hear from a cultural icon after they’ve passed away.” Dane, best known for his role as Dr. Mark Sloan on “Grey’s Anatomy,” died Feb. 19, nearly 10 months after being diagnosed with ALS.\n\n\tAccording to Netflix, Dane’s interview was “conducted under an agreement that the episode would only be aired after his death.” The streamer’s “Famous Last Words” series began last fall with a posthumous interview with Dr. Jane Goodall.\n\t\n\n\tAt the end of the Netflix interview, Dane gave a direct-to-camera address to his daughters, Billie and Georgia, telling them: “These words are for you. I tried. I stumbled sometimes, but I tried. Overall we had a blast, didn’t we? I remember all the times we spent at the beach, the two of you, me and mom — in Santa Monica, Hawaii, Mexico. I see you now playing in the ocean for hours, my water babies. Those days, pun intended, were heaven. I want to tell you four things I’ve learned from this disease, and I hope you don’t just listen to me. I hope you’ll hear me.”\n\n\t“First, live now. Right now. In the present. It’s hard, but I learned to do that,” Dane says. “For years, I have been wandering around mentally and lost in my head for long chunks of time, wallowing and worrying in self-pity, shame, and doubt. I’ve replayed decisions, second-guessed myself. ‘I shouldn’t have done this. I never should’ve that.’ No more. Out of pure survival, I am forced to stay in the present. But I don’t want to be anywhere else. The past contains regrets. The future remains unknown. So you have to live now. The present is all you have. Treasure it. Cherish every moment.”\n\t\n\n\t“Second, fall in love,” Dane continues. “Not necessarily with a person, although I do recommend that as well. But fall in love with something. Find your passion, your joy. Find the thing that makes you want to get up in the morning, drives you through the entire day. I fell in love for the first time when I was about your age. I fell in love with acting. That love eventually got me through my darkest hours, my darkest days, my darkest year. I still love my work, I still look forward to it, I still want to get in front of a camera and play my part. My work doesn’t define me, but it excites me. Find something that excites you. Find your path, your purpose, your dream. Then go for it. Really go for it.”\n\n\tDane’s third lesson is to “choose your friends wisely” and his fourth is to “fight with every ounce of your being, and with dignity. When you face challenges, health or otherwise, fight. Never give up. Fight until your last breath. This disease is slowly taking my body, but it will never take my spirit.”\n\n\t“Billie and Georgia, you are my heart. You are my everything. Good night. I love you. Those are my last words,” Dane says at the conclusion of the episode.\n\n\tDane’s final interview is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

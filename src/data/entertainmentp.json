    "body": "\n\tThe BAFTA nominations offered some clarity, and enough complication, to keep this year’s Oscar race interesting.\n\n\tLeading the charge, as expected, was Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” which landed a commanding 14 nominations, falling two short of the all-time BAFTA record set by “Gandhi” (1982). The haul puts the revolutionary dramedy in line with “All Quiet on the Western Front” (2022), “The King’s Speech” (2010) and “Atonement” (2007), which all went on to win best film.\n\t\n\n\tAll five of its principal actors were also nominated, including Chase Infiniti, who missed an Oscar nomination for best actress last week.\n\n\n\tThe nominations come after the Academy Award announcement, which isn’t typical in most award seasons. BAFTA is a vital bellwether on the awards circuit.\n\n\tTypically, the BAFTAs don’t tend to “over-reward” movies. While the Oscars have awarded “Ben-Hur” (1959), “Titanic” (1997) and “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” (2003) with 11 statuettes each, George Roy Hill’s classic Western “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (1969) is the most BAFTA-awarded movie ever with nine. This may present a “spread the wealth” moment at the Feb. 22 ceremony.\n\n\tThe top five contenders for best picture are now known, shifting the focus to the context clues that could determine the ultimate victor on BAFTA, and Oscar night.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStellan Skarsgård in “Sentimental Value”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHistorically, BAFTA has shown an affection toward European storytelling, which bodes well for “Sentimental Value.” The film could mirror a similar trajectory of “The Banshees of Inisherin,” emerging as a multi-award player with potential wins in original screenplay, international feature and possibly acting trophies for both Stellan Skarsgård and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas — both of whom were notably snubbed by the Screen Actors Guild.\n\t\n\n\tAs for “Marty Supreme,” which delivered a robust showing with 11 nominations, the moment represents a critical opportunity for Timothée Chalamet to prove himself as the definitive frontrunner in the best actor race. At BAFTA, age carries less weight than it does with the Academy. This is the same voting body that awarded best actor to Jamie Bell, then just 14, for “Billy Elliot,” triumphing over Oscar nominees Tom Hanks (“Cast Away”), Geoffrey Rush (“Quills”) and eventual winner Russell Crowe (“Gladiator”).\n\n\tSome of the big shockers from BAFTA noms included “Train Dreams” missing out on an adapted screenplay nomination, which I had pegged as a potential dark horse/spoiler for the Oscar statuette, similar to when “American Fiction” (2023) picked up the prize despite there being an unstoppable front-runner in “Oppenheimer” for best picture. That leaves PTA’s film in the pole position, with the adaptation of “Hamnet” by Chloe Zhao and Maggie O’Farrell, which landed a resounding 11 noms, as an opportunity to make a case.\n\n\tAnd then there is the “Sinners” of it all.\n\n\tNabbing 13 significant nominations, the most ever for a film helmed by a Black director, “Sinners” makes the case that it’s not as weak as it was perceived to be by the international community.\n\n\tThe nominations for Michael B. Jordan and Wunmi Mosaku were expected. The omission that landed hardest, however, was Delroy Lindo’s.\n\n\tDespite earning an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor — and appearing on BAFTA’s longlist — Lindo was left out of the final BAFTA lineup. With that miss, he joins Andrea Riseborough (“To Leslie”) and Marina de Tavira (“Roma”) as the most recent performers to score Oscar bids without recognition from the Golden Globes, Critics Choice, BAFTA or SAG.\n\n\tCan Lindo still win? That depends on who wins the SAG and BAFTA awards.\n\n\tWhat once looked like a clear path for Skarsgard unraveled when he was surprisingly left off the Actor Awards nominations for “Sentimental Value.” The Critics Choice Award went to Jacob Elordi for “Frankenstein,” while the Golden Globe went to Skarsgard, which left the race fractured across precursors.\n\n\tAll eyes will be on SAG/AFTRA’s Actor Awards on March 1, the last televised awards show before final Oscar voting opens, and one which notably does not include either Skarsgard nor Lindo. If Benicio Del Toro (“One Battle After Another”) triumphs, that would complicate the race further and set the stage for an unpredictable Oscar night. In that scenario, BAFTA could ultimately become the most influential X factor.\n\t\n\n\tSince SAG began giving out prizes in 1995, only three performers have won acting Oscars without receiving a SAG nom: Marcia Gay Harden for “Pollock,” Regina King for “If Beale Street Could Talk” and Christoph Waltz for “Django Unchained.” Harden is the only one to not receive a single televised precursor, the same situation as Lindo. For the 73-year-old performer to prevail, he would need to join that tiny group.\n\n\tThe Writers Guild Awards nominations also dropped, which didn’t offer any surprises on the adapted screenplay front since all the Oscar nominees were eligible.\n\n\tHowever, in original screenplay, recent Oscar nominees “Blue Moon,” “It Was Just an Accident” and “Sentimental Value” were not eligible. That left the openings for the non-Oscar-nominated “Black Bag,” “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” and “Weapons.” Nonetheless, this is Coogler’s to lose.\n\n\tThere’s a curveball that exists this year that pundits and analysts have yet to fully consider. In a major shift for Oscar voting protocol, AMPAS now requires members to confirm they’ve watched all nominated films in a category before being allowed to vote in that race. The initiative, aimed at strengthening the integrity and credibility of the awards process, combines digital tracking through the Academy Screening Room with member-reported viewings, which builds on a structure already familiar to Academy voters.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuantrell Colbert\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis means Oscar voters will actually have to do their homework.\n\n\tAcademy sources told Variety back in April the reception from members has been overwhelmingly positive and that many had requested the change for years.\n\n\tHistorically, watching every nominated title was recommended, but not required. Now, studios may have to actually encourage members to watch other competitors’ movies to vote in any given category.\n\n\tNotably, BAFTA has similar requirements but operates on an honor system, in which members check off the films they have seen. Based on their responses, the category will be opened for final voting.\n\n\tIf an AMPAS member were to watch only the 10 best picture-nominated movies, it would open nine of the 24 categories to them — best picture, supporting actor, adapted screenplay, casting, production design, cinematography, film editing and original score. If members prioritize four more from non-best picture films — “Blue Moon” (Ethan Hawke), “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” (Rose Byrne), “Song Sung Blue” (Kate Hudson) and “Weapons” (Amy Madigan) — they will gain voting access to the three remaining acting categories.\n\t\n\n\tBeing the sole piece of recognition for your movie could put you at a significant disadvantage, or it could prove incredibly favorable. When voters take the time to watch a film like “Weapons,” they will see how brilliant Madigan’s work is and may be able to look past her surprising BAFTA snub.\n\n\tThe makeup and hairstyling category has the most sole representation among its nominees — “Kokuho,” “The Smashing Machine” and “The Ugly Stepsister.” In theory, the ultimate winner could be decided by the branch itself, making the makeup guild’s award the most vital clue this season. Other categories, such as visual effects and original song, each have two lone nominees. Could this finally help 17-time nominee Diane Warren take home her first statuette?\n\n\tThis could also affect a song like “Golden” from “KPop Demon Hunters,” which has a second nomination in animated feature, but that is a medium often underappreciated by the industry. A stellar, top-of-their-game voter (i.e., Kirsten Dunst or Carrie Coon) publicly shares that they do the work and watch most, if not all, of the nominees in a given year. But for those who do not, what will this ultimately do to the winners? Will we have sweepers like last year’s “Anora,” which won five of its six nominations? Or does this lend itself to more surprising winners at future ceremonies?\n\n\tThe best way to predict this season’s outcome may not be about statistics alone; it will be about answering the question: How does an industry voter feel about a movie or performance when they are actually watching it? That’s a good outcome in itself.\n",

Rosé)” will premiere across podcast platforms including YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts and SiriusXM on Wednesday, Jan. 28, at 5 a.m. ET/2 a.m. PT. \n\n\tIn the special, Cooper interviews Rosé in various locations across Asia — including a cafe in Seoul; at a traditional pocha lunch; in Rosé’s recording studio (reinvented as a “Call Her Daddy” set); at a karaoke stall; and in a lounge in Tokyo. Rosé, a member of Korean girl group Blackpink, was named Variety’s Global Hitmaker of the Year in 2025.\n\t\n\n\tRosé received three Grammy nominations for the 68th Annual Grammy Awards for her hit song “APT.” with Bruno Mars: record of the year, song of the year and pop duo/group performance. In addition, “F1 The Album,” featuring her song “Messy,” received a nomination for compilation soundtrack for visual media. The 2026 Grammy Awards are slated to air on CBS and Paramount+ on Sunday, Feb. 1, starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT, live from L.A.’s Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\n\tCooper’s special with Rosé is the latest “Call Her Daddy” special programming event. In November, the show produced a special episode in partnership with ABC in which Mark Ballas and Whitney Leavitt of “Dancing With the Stars” performed their final freestyle. In September, also in partnership with ABC, Taylor Frankie Paul was announced as the next star of “The Bachelorette” during an exclusive reveal on “Call Her Daddy.”\n\n\t“Call Her Daddy,” touted as the most-listened-to podcast by women, is produced by Cooper under her company’s Unwell Network banner. In 2024, she inked a three-year distribution and advertising deal with SiriusXM worth at least $100 million, replacing her previous pact with Spotify.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLayal (Lubna Azabal) seems to be on the brink of a nervous breakdown. A college professor of Arabic who just quit smoking, she has no patience, her students’ incompetence infuriates her, she tries to relax while listening to meditation programs in her car, her mother in Beirut has fallen and become bedridden. As if this wasn’t enough, her teenage son gets expelled from school for hitting another boy with a hockey stick during a match. And thus “Hot Water,” Ramzi Bashour’s sincere and offbeat comedy, sets its premise. What follows is a road movie as mother and son fight and bond and, unsurprisingly, manage to find their way back to loving and accepting each other. \n\t\n\n\tWith this film, Bashour modernizes that traditional American genre: the road movie. When Layal’s ex (Gabe Fazio) offers to house their son Daniel (Daniel Zolghadri) in Santa Cruz so that he can graduate high school, the mother and son duo gets that chance at hitting the road. And off they go from Indiana to California. While Bashour treads familiar territory, his characters are different from those who usually inhabit these kinds of movies. Besides being of different generations, Layal is a Lebanese transplant, her son is American. That culture clash is mined by “Hot Water” for both comedy and pathos. Layal and Daniel grew up in different environments and with a different set of rules and societal obligations, but that’s also what ultimately makes them understand each other. \n\n\n\tBashour is interested in small moments of interaction that may not always carry much meaning in of themselves, but cumulatively they might just lead to catharsis. Layla is wound up and always worried, Daniel is more relaxed and seems unbothered. But Layal is also sharply funny, calling Las Vegas “Like Dubai, bullshit in the middle of the desert.” Daniel shows softer sides of himself as the angry teenage facade he hides under is removed, and a warm, sensible young person is revealed. \n\t\n\n\tThe film relies on a few quirky characters that Layal and Daniel meet along the way. Sundance regular Dale Dickey appears as an earthy woman who likes to give long hugs, and soak naked in Colorado’s springs — the hot water of the title. The character is written as an eccentric but powerful bearer of wisdom. In a lesser actor’s hands it would have been just a screenplay convenience, but Dickey infuses it with enough warmth and composure to make it realistic. They also meet a drifter who needs a ride. What ensues is funny and results in him yelling at them “You are not good people.” Bashour seems to want to get to the opposite of that statement by the end of the movie. The trip is bumpy but he does arrive at a satisfying answer. \n\n\tBesides this hitchhiker, the road Layal and Daniel travel on is rather empty. There’s nary even another car on these roads other than their Subaru, as if the America they traverse has very few inhabitants. What resonates is Layal’s connection with her mother and sister back in Lebanon. Heard only as voices on the phone, they add context to the lead character that makes the audience understand her motivations and hopes for the future. The voices on the phone soothe and worry her in equal measure. The longing for her past life and the pining for a place to call home give Azabal a multitude of different emotional states to play. Coupled with her incisive humor, “Hot Water” becomes a showcase for this veteran Canadian actor who most audiences might remember from leading Denis Villeneuve’s Oscar nominated 2010 film, “Incendies.” Zolghadri’s mellower performance also resonates, even if his character is not given as much context as Azabal’s.\n\n\t“Hot Water” is carried through by Alfonso Herrera Salcedo’s command of the light and atmosphere. His camera shows not just the enormity and beauty of the American terrain, but the confused feelings Layla and Daniel are trying to hide. The film’s rhythm is languid, its emotions mostly quiet. The few outbursts from both leads only emphasize the serenity of the rest of the movie. Bashour builds the narrative little piece by little piece. He’s asking the audience to trust that this story is going somewhere special. Not all of these moments land with an emotional punch, but enough do. There are instances when the audience might get impatient or question the confessions of Layal and Daniel as contrivances. However, those who stick with this mother-son team till the end will be rewarded with emotional beats nearing catharsis.\n",

We know that our writers will benefit from his exceptional dedication to their careers.”\n\n\t+ Secretly Distribution has announced a worldwide distribution deal with Ipecac Recordings, “the independent record label that has been making people sick since 1999,” as the announcement puts it.

We are honored to be asked to join the ‘club’ and look forward to much more shared mayhem.”\n\t\n\n\t“Take a look at the Ipecac roster and you’ll see a rundown of artists who have consistently pushed at boundaries, challenged preconceptions, thrown curveballs and made us all wince, gasp, laugh and, frankly, rock in various measures,” adds Tom Davies, Director of Global Marketing & Campaigns at Secretly Distribution. “It’s been a pleasure to listen to their output for 25 years, and everyone at Secretly Distribution is beyond excited to get to work with a label whose commitment to supporting groundbreaking music matches our own. We are thrilled to collaborate with Greg, Marc and Mike to support their amazing catalog and new releases.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix is marking its 15th anniversary in Brazil with the news that it will stream Oscar-nominated “The Secret Agent” exclusively in the country. It is also opening a spacious new office in São Paulo, signaling the company’s robust commitment to the territory where it debuted its first Brazilian original, “3%,” in 2016.\n\n\t“The opening of our new São Paulo office is a natural next step in the journey our local team has built over the past 15 years alongside Brazil’s creative community,” said Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters, who flew in for the opening ceremony. “We support Brazilian films in multiple ways because we want to be the best partners and stay flexible so local producers can decide the best way to bring their projects to life,” he said. “That’s why we were so excited to partner with ‘The Secret Agent’s’ producers to help fund the film and pre-license it for Netflix in Brazil.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWagner Moura in ‘The Secret Agent’ \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeon\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The Secret Agent” garnered four Academy Awards nominations, including Best Film, Best International Film, Best Actor (Wagner Moura) and Best Casting. Moura has already won the distinction of being the first Brazilian thesp to win a Best Actor Golden Globe.\n\n\n\tLocated in São Paulo’s Pinheiros district, the new Netflix office is the first in the region to be occupied exclusively by the company, and is purpose built to support nearly 300 employees across the board. Netflix Brazil’s workforce increased 20% last year.\n\n\tAccording to the streamer, “More than 2,000 jobs were created during construction and adaptation of the building – a process that injected $25 million (R$141 million) into São Paulo’s local economy.”\n\t\n\n\tThe company has continued to ramp up production in Brazil, where it has seen viewership spike. Between July and December 2025, global viewership of Netflix’s Brazilian titles grew by 60% compared to the previous six-month period, it reported.\n\n\tOver the past three years alone, the company has partnered with more than 40 Brazilian production companies, generating 12,000 jobs through films and series released in 2025.\n\n\t“We are deeply committed to telling Brazilian stories, and in many cases, they resonate globally precisely because they address universal themes,” said Elisabetta Zenatti, VP of Content for Netflix Brazil. “Reaching this balance requires a genuine connection with audiences, strong partnerships with the country’s most creative minds, and a culture that values autonomy, experimentation and boldness.”\n\n\tThis year, Netflix is launching such Brazilian productions as “Radioactive Emergency,” a series about the radioactive accident in Goiânia in the ’80s; “Brasil 70,” a limited series about the Brazilian team that won the third soccer world championship; and “Sintonia: The Movie,” a spin-off from the five-season series.\n\n\tThe company also recently announced a varied slate of new productions, including: “The Pilgrimage,” the film adaptation from the bestselling novel; a new reality show hosted by Claudia Raia, “Sua Mãe te Conhece?” (“Does Your Mother Know You?”), where mothers and children compete for cash prizes of up to one million Reales ($193,000); and a new melodrama directed by Mauro Mendonça Filho, starring Marieta Severo, Alice Wegmann, Nanda Costa, and José de Abreu.\n\n\tOther recent partnerships with Brazilian indies include: “Vicentina Pede Desculpas”(roughly translated to “Vicentina Apologizes”), the new film by Gabriel Martins, who directed Brazil’s 2023 Oscar entry, “Mars One”; Daniel Rezende’s “The Son of a Thousand Men, “which was among the 15 pre-selected films to represent Brazil at the 2026 Oscars); Arthur Fontes’ “A Woman With No Filter,” and Marcelo Antunez’ “Zero to Hero.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNetflix co-CEO Greg Peters in São Paulo, Brazil.

    "body": "\n\tDiane Warren is sitting in her Hollywood studio wearing a High Fucking Standards long-sleeved t-shirt.\n\n\t“I have high fucking standards. I really do,” she says when asked what the meaning behind her top is.\n\n\tAnd she does. Especially when it comes to her songwriting, choosing singers — “I’m like a casting director” — and when it comes to her publishing rights.\n\n\n\tWarren founded and controls Realsongs, holding the publishing rights and many of the masters. But there are two directors whom she’d consider if they called and asked her to write a song for their movies: “Paul Thomas Anderson and Christopher Nolan.”\n\t\n\n\tThe songwriter just landed her 17th Oscar nomination for “Dear Me,” a song from her 2024 documentary “Diane Warren: Relentless.”\n\n\tIt’s an apt title because she is relentless. All awards season, Warren “campaigns.” She’s at parties, screenings, and receptions, and it pays off. She even hosts her famous New Year’s Eve party where she invites 400 of her friends. This year, the LAPD shut it down and gave her a citation for being a public nuisance, “which I’ve since framed…and I took a selfie with the cops.”\n\n\tVariety sat down with Warren to talk about “Dear Me,” her Oscar campaigning and how she feels during the ceremony.\n\t\n\t\tEvery year, you have an Oscar nomination all-night party. When did this tradition begin?\t\n\n\tI think we did it with Gaga, 10 years ago, for “Til It Happens to You.” It wasn’t a thing, we just did it. Now it’s just fun. We get pizza, and I don’t really drink, but I have a couple of glasses of red wine because I’m so nervous. Hours go by because people come over, and the sane ones go home, and some come back. It’s a bunch of my core friends, we wait up and literally count down the fucking seconds. You have to wait for the commercial on top of it. I always say this, “I’ve already won whatever happens.” That’s such a big win to be among five songs. Anybody that gets nominated has already won.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWho gets invited to your Oscar viewing party?\t\n\n\tA bunch of my friends. Mainly some of my old friends, some I’ve known since kindergarten, and some are newer friends. The cool thing is it’s a lot of people rooting for me. I’m like the team that has been losing for decades. It would be fun to really win; that would be the icing on the vegan cake.\n\t\n\t\tWell, let’s talk about “Dear Me.” This comes from the documentary about your life. How special was it to hear your name?\t\n\n\tAnytime I write a song for a movie, I give my all, and I try to write the best song I can. This is special. It was challenging, first of all, for me to sit down and them to film me. Of course, I was going to write a song for this movie, and when I write, I’m just trying to tie it all emotionally together or basically write the song I want to hear. For this, I went back to my mom and dad’s house, and I’m sitting in the bathroom, and working on the song there. I was writing a song to that young girl in her teenie room, and felt alone and bullied. I didn’t feel understood or seen. I guess I was a little on the spectrum, or whatever. But kids tend to be really cruel. When I was 11, I picked up a guitar and started writing. So, this was a really personal song to that young girl. The weirdly beautiful thing is that this song cuts across all age groups and all people. These kids came to sing in my studio, and they were crying and they said, “No, this song makes me feel less alone.”\n\t\n\t\tYou said you didn’t feel seen. You’re Diane Warren. When did you finally feel seen?\t\n\n\tIt’s weird because I still feel like that kid in a lot of ways. In my mind, I’m a million miles from that, but I still am that. I work really hard, and I’m always writing. and I’m never satisfied. I always feel like I haven’t made it yet. “When have I felt seen?” Well, I feel seen when my songs are heard.\n\t\n\t\tWhat made Kesha the right person to sing the song, given that it’s a letter to your younger self?\t\n\n\tI only wanted Kesha. I always say that I’m a casting director. A song and an artist, that’s another character, that’s part of that movie. I’ve known Kesha for years, and I know she’s had a hard life. I always knew when I was writing the song that it had to be Kesha because she could sing the absolute shit out of it, and it would be authentic. I felt like this song would resonate with her, and it did.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGoing back to the campaigning, I see you at every party. I saw you back in October at the Middleburg Film Festival. When does the campaigning begin for you?\t\n\n\tI’m such a loner, I sit in a room by myself, and I’m writing. What I love about awards season is that you get to go out and you see people that you haven’t seen. Something like Middleburg is when the season’s starting. And I love it. It’s just a lot of fun. I love to go to screenings and see people.\n\t\n\t\tHow many parties do you go to in a night?\t\n\n\tOne night I went to four events. I’m out there representing my work. Whatever I can do to do that, I do in as fun a way as possible.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re doing this from October through the shortlist through nominations?\t\n\n\tIt’s nothing that other people don’t do, right? Everybody’s going to the festivals. Some have more fun, and some don’t. I like to do it.\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s shortlist day like for you, because we don’t know that until around 11 a.m in the morning?\t\n\n\tI’m nervous for that too. There are always surprises of things that don’t get on or that do get on. So, I’m like, “Okay, got to get to that 15.” I have my lucky clothes I wear for all these things.\n\t\n\t\tSo you have RealSongs Publishing. Is there a director or directors who, if they approached you, would you want to write for?\t\n\n\tI’d love to do a song for Paul Thomas Anderson or Chris Nolan. I just love writing songs for movies. I’m open. So call me.\n\t\n\t\tThe industry can be tough, and people say, “Oh, I don’t know that documentary” or “I’ve never heard that song?”\t\n\n\tI didn’t realize how many people have seen this documentary. It got nominated for a Grammy and it wasn’t because I worked it. I didn’t do anything, I didn’t even post about my documentary for the Grammys. I think the fact that it was early on the site, because it was on the site when there was only 10 movies on the portal. I think that helped. And over the holidays, everybody started calling me and telling me how much they love the documentary. I think artists can also relate, but I’m surprised that it’s been seen as much as it has.\n\t\n\t\tTake me inside the Oscar ceremony. When we get to that category of original song, how are you feeling?\t\n\n\tIt’s fucking nerve-wracking no matter what. There was one time I thought I was going to win, and that was with my song, “Til It Happens to You.” I don’t expect to win, so I just go there, but you never know. And wouldn’t it be weird if it were this song? It would be the craziest, most unlikely thing. So wouldn’t that be crazy in the coolest way?\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAre you going to write a speech?\t\n\n\tEven in the least likely situations, I write something down, I think I probably won’t be conscious, if it actually happened, I would probably faint on the way up there. It would just be such a beautiful full circle thing. The little train that could, just up against these giant corporations. So yes, I will write a speech. And who knows?\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "description": "\n\tIt began with a cold call email pitch to Pamela Anderson’s publicist.\n\n\tJulia Nottingham — the founder of Dorothy St. Pictures — claims she’ll never",
    "body": "\n\tIt began with a cold call email pitch to Pamela Anderson’s publicist.\n\n\tJulia Nottingham — the founder of Dorothy St. Pictures — claims she’ll never “spill” her secrets about what exactly was written, but admits a huge amount of care and attention went into the message. “We really poured over exactly what we should say and how to get their attention,” she says.\n\n\tWhatever was said in the email, it worked.\n\n\n\t“Pamela, A Love Story,” directed by Ryan White with Nottingham exec producing for Dorothy St, saw the former “Baywatch” star take viewers on a deeply personal and extensively archived tour of her 50+ years, recounting the highs and lows of a life spent in the public eye with a disarming frankness. It launched in 2023 on Netflix to critical acclaim.\n\t\n\n\tThe same year as Pamela came the doc series “Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story” on Disney+, about the famed footballer’s wife whose Instagram sleughing became one of the U.K.’s biggest tabloid stories. Then in 2025, it was turn of another, even more famous WAG, Victoria Beckham, for a Netflix series in which she charted her bumpy journey from Spice Girl to fashion designer.\n\n\tNow, it’s Courtney Love who’s getting the doc treatment from Nottingham and Dorothy St.\n\n\tDirected by Edward Lovelace and James Hall, “Antiheroine,” premiering Jan 27 in Sundance, follows the 1990s rock icon — now living in London — as she unapologetically tells her story, warts and all, for the very first time.\n\n\tNottingham says she’s been “endlessly fascinated” by women such as Love, Anderson, Rooney and Beckham, personalities who may all seem very different on paper but have each seen much of their lives play out in the media, under the glare of a largely unkind and judgmental spotlight. As she notes, they each have been “interpreted in a very specific way.”\n\t\n\n\tDorothy St., which only launched 8 years ago and saw Elisabeth Murdoch’s Sister take a majority stake in 2025, makes other high-profile documentaries, most notably “The Greatest Night in Pop” about the making of charity single “We Are the World” in 1985. But thanks to its growing array of female-fronted bio docs, the company has built a reputation for earning the trust of its subjects and, says Nottingham, understanding the “responsibility” involved when it comes to telling their stories.\n\t\n\t\tI understand “Antiheroine” is your sixth film in Sundance?\t\n\n\tYeah, it’s wild. It’s my 10 year Sundance anniversary. My first film was a really special one in 2016 called “All These Sleepless Nights.” I just love that film. And the universe is really doing its thing because the director Michał [Marczak] has this year got his second film at the festival, which has been 10 years in the making. I can’t wait to see it.\n\t\n\t\tHow did “Antiheroine” come about? Did you approach Courtney or vice-versa? \t\n\n\tFirst of all, I think when a film has finished and you know how powerful it is, you realize just what a privilege it is to have been able to make these films. But for Pamela, I was lucky enough for her publicist to respond to my cold call email. And with Courtney, without spilling my state secrets about how I get access, I do just send cold emails. And I’m just very honest about my fascination with these individuals that I think have been kind of interpreted in a in a very specific way. I remember Hole and I always seem to remember Courtney through the POV of Kurt. I think that’s why I was so curious. So I found out who her manager was and sent an email.\n\n\tOne of the things I always say — and I really stick by this — is that my job isn’t to make people like our subjects or dislike our subjects. My job is to make people understand them. So I love that line in the film when Courtney says, “I know when something’s right, I don’t always know when something’s wrong.” And you are just like, OK, I understand.\n\t\n\t\tDid you know she was living in London when you first made the approach?\t\n\n\tNo I didn’t. I met her manager in LA for the first time in January 2022. So it’s been a really long time! That’s the other thing, you’re in it for the long game – often many month and many years. And then when I found out she’d moved to London that, for me, was the moment I thought it was going to make sense. She was a 15 minute bus ride from the office With Pamela, she was living in Vancouver Island. But also, London has given her so much, it’s a safe place for her. I think she’s said publicly how much of an Anglophile she is.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Pamela doc came first, but then there’s been Colleen Rooney and Victoria Beckham and now Courtney. In just a few short years, you’ve become known for these docs about women who aren’t simply high-profile, but who’ve seen their lives play out in the public eye and have often been maligned in the media. Was this something you set out to do? Or was Pamela the catalyst?\t\n\n\tIt was just always this curiosity. I grew up reading Heat magazine and then would read Hello when I was in the dentist. I just had so many questions, really, and especially with the women who I’ve grown up with — the Pamelas, the Victorias. I was endless fascinated by these women and the stories that were portrayed in the media. I know lots of women and we’re complicated and we’re multifaceted and we have good days and we have bad days. But why does there seem to be one narrative that is, most of the time, tearing them down. I won’t share it with you, but I have a list of women I’m just endlessly fascinated by. But also men as well. Everyone’s stories are quite interesting and complicated.\n\t\n\t\tWhen it comes to the responsibility of handling these stories, do you take what you did with Pamela to other potential subjects as part of the pitch? Is that your approach?\t\n\n\tActually, one of the big things is: are they ready? Because we can’t do our job unless they’re ready to do it, to be authentic and honest. Anyone can have a documentary made about them, but is it going to be compelling and powerful, and is there a real reason why now. We are really strict with ourselves at Dorothy St, because we do get a lot of kind of incoming. But it’s like, ‘Are you actually ready to say, really, what’s on your mind, and why now?’ You’ve got to be ready.\n\t\n\t\tMost of your other docs have gone straight to streamers, but you’re taking “Antiheroine” to Sundance to sell. Is that a first for you?\t\n\n\tYeah, it is. There are many reasons for that. I have built this relationship with Sister, who became an investor and then put that into a majority ownership. And they and I started having conversations about the market and the challenge of the margin business. Streaming economics are really tough for production companies. But as Sister have the passion and available capital to finance docs, they actually financed “Antiheroine,” which is great but also quite a responsibility on my shoulders. Because I want to make sure they see a return. But I’m really excited about taking it to Sundance and the buyers watching it and I’m keeping my fingers crossed that they haven’t spent all their money.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIs this model of Sister financing your projects one you hope to keep going?\t\n\n\tI really hope so. We are definitely circling more projects, which is really exciting. I think this won’t be the last doc that Sister finance. As I’ve got my confidence as a producer in the market, the fact that we can partner with Sister — it makes so much sense.\n\t\n\t\tYou produced last year’s Victoria Beckham doc series. Given the explosive recent statements from Brooklyn Beckham about his relationship with his family, none of which was discussed in the series, do you think it has underlined concerns about docs that have been exec produced by their subjects?\t\n\n\tI don’t think [Victoria] is credited as an exec producer, but yes, it was a co-production with Studio 99 [David Beckham’s company]. But when we gave the pitch, it was really focused on her as a businesswoman and what she had achieved and wants to achieve. There was no focus on any of the children and their narratives. But in that series she really did talk about things that she had never spoken about.\n\t\n\t\tI know you said you wouldn’t tell me, but can you offer any clues as to who’s on your list of other subjects you’d like to give the documentary treatment? How long is this list?\t\n\n\tThere are lots of female actors on it and female sports stars. I did say one name in a panel, so it’s public, but I absolutely love tennis and — if she’s reading this — I would love to make a film with Monica Seles. I think what she achieved in tennis was so amazing and what she went through was incredibly intense.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“I miss the old Kanye,” Kanye West once said. \n\n\tWith a 44-second track released almost exactly a decade ago, the hip-hop artist now known as Ye made it clear he was in on the joke. In “I Love Kanye,” he parroted his own critics, rapping: “I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye … I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye.” The song was an indictment of you, the listener, for holding onto the era of pink polo shirts and chipmunk soul samples, refusing to let your favorite artist evolve.\n\t\n\n\tBut since 2016, the song has become a dark, twisted, self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\n\tYe went from the globally celebrated, singular artistic talent who redefined hip-hop to a conspiracy-peddling schmuck who sold swastika T-shirts, surrounded himself with neo-Nazis and released “Heil Hitler,” a song that was banned from streaming services but became catnip for extremist provocateurs. He had also suggested slavery was a “choice” and donned a shirt with the white supremacist slogan “White Lives Matter.” It was devastating to watch the man who famously proclaimed on live TV that “George Bush doesn’t care about Black people” transform into an icon of the alt-right.\n\n\tNever mind the fact that as Ye plummeted into a downward spiral, so too did the quality of his music. Growing up, “The College Dropout” and “Graduation” were like gospel to me. I tend to separate the art from the artist, but I can’t pretend “Donda 2” is the second coming of “Yeezus.”\n\n\tSo, the thing is, I do miss the old Kanye. And I miss the artist who was, in 2016, considered the new Kanye.\n\t\n\n\tOn Monday, Ye took out an ad in The Wall Street Journal to issue a lengthy apology for some of his antisemitic behavior in early 2025. In the statement, he attributed his actions to a four-month manic episode caused by untreated brain damage and mental illness, and he promised to be “committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change.”\n\n\t“I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state,” Ye wrote. “It does not excuse what I did though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people.” He also apologized to the Black community, writing, “I am so sorry to have let you down.” (Unmentioned were the still-pending lawsuits from his former employees alleging sexual harassment and discrimination.)\n\n\tThe following day, Vanity Fair published an interview with Ye in which he further atoned for his “horrible statements” and said he is working toward finding the right treatment so he can “continue down this positive course.”\n\n\tVanity Fair notes in the interview that Ye responded to its questions via email. This is blatantly obvious, as the Q&A is not reflective of how Ye talks or has ever talked. His answers appear to be carefully crafted by public relations experts; one response about “losing your grip entirely” is lifted nearly verbatim from his apology letter. Regardless, the fact that the artist — or his advisors — decided to engage with journalists in the first place signals … something.\n\n\tTake Ye at his word, if you’d like: He experienced an extended bout of mania caused by lingering brain damage and bipolar disorder and “lost touch with reality.” He hit “rock bottom,” and with the help of “medication, therapy, exercise, and clean living” he has achieved a “much-needed clarity.” Ye has previously spoken about his struggles with mental illness, but never with such vulnerability. Mr. West woke up and disavowed the disgusting things he said. He’s ready to make amends.\n\n\tOr, take the cynical route. Ye, conveniently, is releasing his new album “Bully” on Friday. (Allegedly — any fan of Ye knows to believe it when they see it.) And that album begs promoting. Plus, this isn’t the first time Ye has apologized for his antisemitic rants. In December 2023, he issued a statement in Hebrew that said, “I deeply regret any pain I may have caused” after declaring he would go “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.” That was a few months after he was dropped by CAA and dumped by Adidas — yes, a company founded by literal Nazis — amid a larger corporate fallout. The apology was also, notably, two months before the release of his 2024 album “Vultures 1.” A year after that, he rescinded the apology and wrote on X, “I AM A NAZI.” His rhetoric coincided with an alarming escalation of antisemitism in the U.S. and abroad. \n\t\n\n\tFor Ye’s sake, I sincerely hope he is on the road to rehabilitation. Skepticism aside, this apology does feel weightier than any of his prior displays of penitence. And as Ye pointed out to Vanity Fair, he doesn’t need mainstream acceptance to sell records. “Vultures 1” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the wake of his anti-Jewish outbursts and poorly received walkback. The sequel, “Vultures 2,” hit No. 2 despite lacking a discernible hit. (Imagine how long he could top the charts with an actually good album!)\n\n\tYe said his apology isn’t motivated by “reviving my commerciality” but rather “because these remorseful feelings were so heavy on my heart and weighing on my spirit.” Still, one should consider the venues he selected to kick off this apology tour. \n\n\tWhy take out a paid ad in The Wall Street Journal rather than pen an op-ed? Surely, plenty of publications would have salivated at the web traffic promised by a Kanye West byline. Or, he could have simply posted the statement to social media, like his last mea culpa. And why recruit Vanity Fair for a Q&A written in PR-speak rather than upload a video speaking off the cuff, which would undoubtedly feel more authentic for an artist famous for his erratic spontaneity?\n\n\tLegacy media brings name-brand legitimacy, which is something Ye has not been able to access for years now. It’s true that everything gets flattened and stripped of origin in the plains of social media. But who is he trying to reach with a print ad in the Wall Street Journal if not C-suite executives and investors? And with Vanity Fair, might he be targeting a largely female, tastemaker class? If nothing else, his recent moves indicate a desire to reach those who cast him away — and perhaps those with the boardroom influence and cultural currency to help bring him back.\n\n\tBut back to what? What kind of career does Ye think is possible now? Maybe he plans to return to the stage for his first real tour in 10 years and needs to woo a promoter — a tall task considering his pattern of canceling live performances. Maybe he’s hoping to be re-embraced by the corporate world, which would require a lot more than a week of “My bad, guys.” Maybe he’s ready to release great music again. (I believe he flexed that potential on the little-known 2024 track “No Face.”) Or maybe he’s planning to go away for a while and pick up the pieces of his life. One can only hope his pursuit of self-betterment outlives his next album’s promotional cycle. \n\t\n\n\tMany people will continue to shun Ye, and they will be more than justified in refusing to forgive a celebrity who vilified a minority for years. Still, others will accept his apology, taking his calculated media blitz as an opportunity to welcome him back into their lives. Can you blame them? They miss the old Kanye.\n\n\tTo me, what his apology signals more than anything is an admission that Kanye misses him, too.\n",

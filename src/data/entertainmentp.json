    "body": "\n\tPakistani superstar Farhan Saeed will drop his first solo album this month, marking a significant milestone two decades into his career. Saeed, the former lead vocalist of Pakistani band Jal, has built a following across South Asia by excelling in both television dramas and music. He will release “Khat” through Warner Music and Silent Roar’s global distribution network.\n\n\tThe lead single and title track arrives Nov. 14, kicking off a staggered rollout with new songs dropping each month. The album features 10 tracks performed in the Urdu and Punjabi languages.\n\t\n\n\t“Music has always been something I’ve lived,” Saeed said. “I’ve been fortunate that audiences have always understood and connected with how I express myself through my songs. This album is inspired by my fans and their constant love. It’s a letter — a khat — from my heart to theirs.”\n\n\n\tFour tracks will get the music video treatment, with Saeed tapping a different filmmaker for each clip to bring varied creative perspectives to the visuals.\n\n\tOn the acting front, Saeed has feature film “Luv Di Saun” in the pipeline, continuing his parallel track as a screen performer alongside his music career.\n\n\tThe album represents a new creative chapter for Saeed, drawing on his established fanbase while positioning him for broader international reach through Warner’s distribution muscle. The project stays anchored in his linguistic roots while aiming to connect with listeners beyond regional boundaries.\n\n\tBy spacing out the releases monthly rather than dropping the full album at once, Saeed’s team is betting on sustained attention for individual tracks in an increasingly crowded music streaming landscape.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters: A Sing-Along Event” struck a chord with Korean audiences, opening in fourth place with $323,000 from 39,000 admissions across 143 screens.\n\n\tAt No. 1, South Korean road-trip comedy “The First Ride” debuted atop the Korean box office with $1.56 million from 230,810 admissions and a commanding 28.8% market share, according to KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council. Directed by Nam Dae-joong (“The Great Battle”), the film follows a group of childhood friends whose long-awaited trip to Thailand quickly spirals into chaotic mishaps. The ensemble cast includes Kang Ha-neul, Cha Eun-woo, Kim Young-kwang, Kang Young-suk and Han Seon-hwa.

    "body": "\n\tToho has officially revealed the title of its next “Godzilla” feature: “Godzilla -0.0” (Godzilla Minus Zero). The announcement was made at the annual Godzilla Fest in Tokyo and confirmed via Toho’s official X account.\n\n\tThe film will once again be written, directed and supervised for VFX by Yamazaki Takashi, with VFX work by Shirogumi and production handled by Toho Studios and Robot, the same team behind 2023’s “Godzilla Minus One.” Toho Co., Ltd. will produce and distribute.\n\t\n\n\tA new “Godzilla” film was teased almost exactly a year ago. \n\n\n\tYamazaki’s “Godzilla Minus One” became a landmark hit for the franchise. Released in Japan in November 2023, it grossed more than JPY7.65 billion ($50 million) locally, making it the top-earning live-action Japanese Godzilla film in history. In North America, it earned $56 million, making it the highest grossing Japanese-language live-action film of all time. The film later made history at the 96th Academy Awards, where it won the Oscar for best visual effects — the first “Godzilla” film ever nominated for an Academy Award and the first Japanese feature to win in that category.\n\n\tThe franchise began in 1954 with Ishirō Honda’s “Godzilla,” a grim allegory for nuclear devastation that introduced audiences to the radioactive reptile who would become Japan’s most enduring pop-culture export. Since then, Toho has produced 33 live-action “Godzilla” films across multiple eras — the Showa, Heisei, Millennium, and now Reiwa — while American studios have released five additional titles, including Legendary’s MonsterVerse.\n\t\n\n\tSet in Japan after World War II, “Godzilla Minus One” starred Kamiki Ryunosuke as Shikishima Koichi, a former kamikaze pilot who survives an almost fatal encounter with Godzilla and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. When the massive beast reappears years later, a group of soldiers and veterans must band together to defeat the monster before it can destroy Japan. The cast also includes Hamabe Minami, Yamada Yuki, Aoki Munetaka, Yoshioka Hidetaka, Ando Sakura, and Sasaki Kuranosuke.\n\n\tWith “Godzilla -0.0,” Toho appears to be signaling a continuation of Yamazaki’s “Minus” saga while teasing a thematic reset implied by the “Zero” in its title. No plot or release date has yet been announced, but anticipation is running high for the next stomping move of the King of the Monsters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSeven years after its launch, Taiwan-based Each Other Films is stepping into an expanded phase of international production, with co-founder and head producer Jacqueline W. Liu and co-founder and CEO Tiffany Yu-Chia Chen unveiling a diverse lineup that stretches from documentary to big-budget action.\n\n\tThe quartet of projects represents a widening scope for the Taipei company, which has steadily built credentials through festival selections, streaming deals and local box office success since 2017.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the newly revealed titles is a documentary about drag performer Pangina Heals, a figure who bridges Taiwanese and Thai cultures. The film, titled “Heals,” represents the company’s initial move into factual storytelling through international partnership, working alongside Thailand’s N8 and World of Wonder.\n\n\n\tFiction projects include Henry Tsai’s first directorial effort, “Spent Bullets,” adapted from short stories by Taiwan writer Terao Tetsuya. Production will span multiple cities including Silicon Valley, Las Vegas and Taipei. The film has secured spots at both Golden Horse Film Project Promotion and Taiwan Creative Content Fest 2025.\n\n\tThe company is also returning to a proven property with a fresh chapter in its hit “The Accidental Influencer” franchise. Centered on the character Red, “The Accidental Influencer: Love Me If You Dare” will launch next January on both GTV and Netflix, bringing back the series with additional cast members and storylines focused on contemporary relationships.\n\n\tPerhaps the most ambitious entry is “The Odd Three: Madam Tiger,” which director Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu (whose credits include “Little Big Women” and Tokyo-bowing “Double Happiness”) is developing as a large-scale adventure that reinterprets traditional folklore through a modern lens. The project is being positioned as a potential launching point for additional character-driven stories across the region.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve always believed that a story rooted in a specific place, language, or authentic human connections can still move people everywhere,” said Liu. “That’s the power of cinema — it turns the personal into the universal. As we enter this next phase, I’m excited to expand what that means, especially across genre, scale, and collaboration.”\n\n\t“Building a production company means knowing where you want to go, and choosing the right stories and people to take you there,” added Chen. “We’ve spent the past seven years building trust — with creators, with partners, and with each other. Now, we’re ready to scale. The future of Asian storytelling is global, and we’re here to be part of that shift.”\n\n\tThe company’s previous work includes the 2020 theatrical release “Little Big Women,” which topped the Taiwan box office that year and earned recognition at the Golden Horse Awards before landing on Netflix. More recently, “The Accidental Influencer” became an HBO Asia original in 2024, while “Dreams in Nightmares” played Berlin’s Panorama section this year. “Penguin Girl” opened last year’s Kaohsiung Film Festival.\n\n\tOperating under a mission statement emphasizing female perspectives and universal connection, Each Other Films continues developing its pipeline while pursuing additional partnerships across borders.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo new releases led the China box office over the weekend of Oct. 31–Nov. 2, according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tMaoyan Movie’s “Her Turn” topped the chart with RMB35.5 million ($5 million) in its opening two-day frame. Directed by Cheng Yanan, the thriller stars Li Gengxi, Deng Jiajia, Liu Yitie, Huang Xiaoming and Yue Jiayi. The story follows a partially paralysed woman who returns to her family’s remote mansion, uncovering long-buried secrets and a revenge plot years in the making. \n\t\n\n\tIn second place, Studio Khara’s Japanese import “Evangelion: 3.0+1.0” (2021) grossed $4.1 million. The concluding chapter of Hideaki Anno’s long-running “Rebuild of Evangelion” film series continues to draw global fandom attention. The anime epic follows teenage pilot Shinji Ikari as he battles to save humanity from annihilation while confronting guilt and existential despair. \n\n\n\tPMF Pictures’ “Row to Win” ranked third with $3.2 million, bringing its cumulative total to $56.8 million. The comedy-drama directed by Ma Lin and starring Huang Bo, Fan Chengcheng, Yin Tao and Li Jiaqi, follows a coastal-town family – led by a once-tough patriarch – who rally together in hard times and push for a comeback. \n\n\tChina Film Group’s patriotic epic “The Volunteers: Peace at Last” earned $1.3 million for a running total of $87.3 million. The film, which commemorates the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army entering the Korean War, stars Wu Jing and Zhang Ziyi and marks the third chapter in Chen Kaige’s “The Volunteers” trilogy.\n\n\tRounding out the top five, Changying Film Group’s supernatural thriller “Evil Unbound” took $900,000 and now stands at $272.4 million. Zhao Linshan’s film, which dramatizes the atrocities of Japan’s Unit 731 during World War II, stars Jiang Wu, Wang Zhiwen and Li Naiwen. \n\t\n\n\tChina’s total weekend box office reached $21 million – a marginal improvement over last week – pushing 2025’s cumulative gross to $6.29 billion, up 16.1% year-on-year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRevered Indian actor Naseeruddin Shah (“Monsoon Wedding”) has joined the Oscar-qualifying documentary “Far From Home” as executive producer, marking his first foray into the documentary space in this capacity.\n\n\tThe short doc, currently campaigning for best documentary short at the Academy Awards, chronicles the plight of Afghan refugees in India through the story of Samira Faizi, who fled to the country in 2021 following the Taliban‘s takeover of Afghanistan.\n\t\n\n\t“The film showcases her struggle in setting up base in India, whose political environment has changed and is no longer welcome for refugees. The film sheds light on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), that excludes Muslim refugees from a pathway towards citizenship and its impact on Afghan refugees, who have no country to go back to,” according to the film’s synopsis. \n\n\n\t“I’ve always believed the most important function of cinema is to act as a record of its times,” Shah said. “Since it is the only medium that can do that I consider documentaries to be of more value for posterity than features.”\n\n\t“Refugee rights is a tricky topic in India and given the current political scenario, refugees are scared to talk or come forth in public,” said Kumar, a former journalist. “I am proud of Samira for her bravery in telling her story and bringing awareness across the world about the situation of Afghan refugees in India.”\n\n\t“When one thinks of refugees, they usually visualize them on a boat going to Europe or on the US-Mexico border. But rarely do we talk about refugees who are in parts of the world where there is no framework to integrate them,” she added.\n\t\n\n\tEmmy-winning producer Brent E. Huffman produces the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting-funded project, which was a Japan Prize finalist and runner-up for best short documentary at the Chicago South Asian Film Festival.\n\n\t“Far From Home” has made the rounds at multiple festivals, including the Oscar-qualifying American Documentary and Animation Film Festival and Tasveer Film Festival. The doc’s awards campaign includes several upcoming screenings across the U.S. \n",

    "body": "\n\tFans will be seeing more of Ariana Grande on the big screen next year. \n\n\tGrande took to Instagram on Friday to announce that she has wrapped filming on the upcoming fourth installment in the “Meet the Parents” franchise, titled “Focker In-Law.”\n\n\t“These past few months have been so, so unimaginably special,” she wrote in the caption. “I love my Fockers, and I love my Byrnes… so, so very much. I will miss this bunch terribly. See you next November!” \n\t\n\n\tGrande’s Instagram post also featured a carousel of behind-the-scenes photos from set, including her hugging Ben Stiller, who returns as Greg Focker, alongside another photo of her locking arms with Beanie Feldstein.\n\n\n\n\tThe fourth edition of the long-running 2000 comedy film series is set to hit theaters on Nov. 25, 2026. \n\n\tStiller, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson are returning for “Focker In-Law” with Skyler Gisondo also joining the cast. \n\n\tJohn Hamburg, who wrote the first three films, directed and wrote the screenplay for the new installment.\n\n\tWhile the plot details remain under wraps, Stiller teased the fourquel during a 25th anniversary screening of “Meet the Parents” at this year’s Tribeca Festival.\n\n\t“What spurred the idea is that I’m the age that Bob was when we did the first movie,” Stiller said. “It felt like a mirror to the first film, where one of my kids is thinking about introducing his person to the family.”\n\n\tThe first film, which centered on Greg Fockner (Ben Stiller) enduring many awkward encounters while trying to impress his girlfriend’s parents before proposing, became a blockbuster hit, grossing $330 million worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tIts success led to the 2004 comedy spawning into two more successful sequels: 2004’s “Meet the Fockers” (which introduced Greg’s parents, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) and 2010’s “Little Fockers.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump had kind words for Skydance’s takeover of Paramount and Bari Weiss’ appointment at CBS News during his first sit-down interview with “60 Minutes” in five years.\n\n\tCBS News on Sunday released a transcript of the full 90-minute session with Norah O’Donnell, CBS News’ senior correspondent and a contributor to “60 Minutes.” The conversation touched on a host of topics, from international politics to ICE raids in the U.S. to the economy and healthcare police to the federal government shutdown. The interview was recorded Oct. 31 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Highlights from the interview aired Sunday on “60 Minutes.” \n\t\n\n\tThe session also marks the first time Trump has returned to CBS News for an interview since the network’s parent company reached at $16 million settlement in a lawsuit that Trump filed against the venerable news magazine. CBS’ previous owner, Paramount Communications, wrote the check under pressure as it sought to close the $8 billion Skydance Media transaction. Trump’s baseless claims that “60 Minutes” doctored then-candidate Kamala Harris’ responses in a manner that damaged Trump would have been easily beaten on the legal merits in court, legal experts agree, but the previous Paramount ownership regime buckled under extraordinary pressure brought by President Trump and FCC chairman Brendan Carr. \n\n\n\t” ’60 Minutes’ paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not– you have a great– I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, who’s the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great– from what I know,” Trump said, referring to the appointment last month of Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person. But ’60 Minutes’ was forced to pay me– a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news. And I think that it’s happening. I see …I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press,” Trump said.\n\n\tO’Donnell also questioned Trump about the conflicts of his role as Commander in Chief and his family investments and marketing of Trump-branded crypto currencies.\n\n\t“I wanna make crypto great for America. That’s the only thing. I don’t wanna have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto,” Trump said. “Because in crypto it’s a kind of an industry where basically you’re going to have number one and you’re not gonna have a number two. And right now we’re number one by a long shot. I wanna keep it that way. The same way we’re number one with AI, we’re number one with crypto. And I wanna keep it that way.” \n\n\tAsked point-blank about the Trump family crypto activity, Trump was dismissive. “I can’t say, because– I can’t say– I’m not concerned. I don’t– I’d rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, “Can I ask another question?” And I said, yeah. This is the question–.”\n\n\tMuch of the interview was devoted to O’Donnell’s questions about the president’s views on geopolitical hot spots and challenges the U.S. faces in dealing with Russia, China, Israel, Venezuela and other unpredictable situations.\n\n\tWhen it came to discussing economic issues at home, Trump brought his usual bravado and side-stepped O’Donnell’s efforts to press him on any specifics.\n\n\t“We’re doing very well. By the way, the stock market just hit — perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. It’s hit an all-time high 48 times during the course of my — nine-month period. But just yesterday, the stock market hit an all-time high. We’re doing really well, and everybody knows it,” Trump said.\n\t\n\n\tHe blamed his White House predecessors Joe Biden and Barack Obama for myriad problems including the continuing high price of groceries.\n\n\t“It was a dead country, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. We have the strongest stock market, we have everybody wants to come in. A year ago we were a dead country. Right now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. And I did that in nine months. And it’s only gonna get better,” Trump said.\n\n\tO’Donnell pressed Trump on the issue of Justice Department’s recent indictments of Trump’s political foes, including New York state Attorney General Leticia James and former FBI chief James Comey.\n\n\t“I think I’ve been very mild-mannered. You’re looking at a man who was indicted many times, and I had to beat the rap,” Trump told O’Donnell.\n\n\tOn the subject of the brutal ICE raids in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities that have shocked the nation, including some prominent Trump supporters, the president was unbowed.\n\n\t“I think they haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said. O’Donnell asked explicitly if he approved of violent actions taken by heavily masked law enforcement officials in workplaces, schools and courthouses. Trump left no question of where he stands. “Because you have to get the people out,” he said.\n\n\tOn the state of the government shutdown, now heading into its 33rd day, Trump said Republicans “keep voting” despite the fact that House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House in recess for most of the shutdown to date.\n\n\t“What we’re doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they’ve never had this. This has happened like 18 times before,” Trump said. “The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, ‘Give us an extension, we’ll work it out.’ They’ve lost their way. They’ve become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, ‘Let’s vote.’ “\n\n\tOn the subject of the ceasefire in Gaza that Trump helped bring about last month, he disputed O’Donnell’s suggestion that the situation is “fragile.” He threatened to use force against Hamas terrorists if need be.\n\t\n\n\t“Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don’t behave. They know that. If they don’t behave, they’re going to be taken out immediately,” Trump said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatthew Lillard surprised fans during Cinespia’s “Scream” Halloween party screening on Friday night, and while talking to the crowd, he shared an emboldened message to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\t“Fuck ICE,” Lillard said. “In this time, in this city, we need to lead with love. Do not forget that shit in this moment. Not to be political, but to be political as shit.”\n\n\tHe also encouraged fans to vote for Prop 50, which allows California to redraw its congressional districts to combat redistricting in Texas.\n\t\n\n\t“Yes to 50. You have to vote. If you don’t vote, we are going down. So it’s on us. And if you don’t like that, I’m so not sorry,” he added.\n\n\tLillard stars in “Scream” as Stu Macher, who makes up the two-man killing team in Wes Craven’s 1996 horror masterpiece along with Skeet Ulrich’s Billy Loomis. Lillard is set to return for “Scream 7” alongside fellow original cast members Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox.\n\n\tEver since Donald Trump took office, ICE has remained top of mind for many in the U.S., and Hollywood is no exception. In early October, Jeff Bridges appeared as his iconic “Big Lebowski” character, The Dude, on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to proclaim, “Let’s get ICE off our streets and into our beverages, man.”\n\n\tLate-night satires like “South Park” and “Saturday Night Live” have also taken plenty of jabs at ICE. For example, the cold open on the Oct. 8 episode of “SNL” featured host Amy Poehler and Tina Fey as United States Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, respectively. During the sketch, Fey’s noem gave some context on how they hire people for ICE: “How did I find them? By running ads like this: Do you need a job now? Yeah. Are you a big, tough guy? Yeah. Tough enough for the army or police? No. Do you take supplements that you bought at a gas station? Daily. Do you like to use zip ties because people in your life don’t trust you with keys? You know it. Suck on some of these, big boy. Welcome to ICE.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore Chloe Zhao and Kore-eda Hirokazu sat down for their Tokyo International Film Festival conversation, they had each been crying over the other’s work.\n\n\tKore-eda watched Zhao’s “Hamnet” in a small screening room with just one other person, grateful no one else was there to see his tears. “I couldn’t stop crying,” the Japanese auteur admitted, moved by the film’s exploration of why creators tell stories and the communal act of experiencing tragedy together.\n\t\n\n\tThat morning of their conversation, Zhao had risen at 4 a.m., jet-lagged, to watch Kore-eda’s 1998 masterpiece “After Life.” She was crying for an hour while her makeup team worked on her before the event. “I said to Kore-eda-san, I feel like ‘Hamnet’ and ‘After Life’ are very much the same film,” Zhao told the TIFF Lounge audience. “Because it is about how when we see our lives, whether it’s joyful or painful, mirrored back to us, it gives these experiences meaning and makes the human experience a little less difficult.”\n\n\n\tThe mutual admiration set the tone for an intimate conversation between two auteurs who share more than they might have expected. The discussion took place as Zhao’s latest feature prepared to close the festival, while Kore-eda is currently in production on his new film “Sheep In The Box,” starring Ayase Haruka and comedian Daigo.\n\n\tThe emotional connection revealed a striking similarity in how both directors approach their work: neither knows how their films will end when they begin shooting.\n\n\t“When I go in to make a film, I never know how it’s going to end,” Zhao explained. “I will write it on the page so it reads nice, so it gets greenlit and gets money to make a film. But I know deep inside – and often my lead actors know – that it’s not there.”\n\t\n\n\tThis creative philosophy nearly proved disastrous on “Hamnet.” Four days before production wrapped, only two people at the Globe Theatre knew there was no working ending to the film: Zhao and her lead actress, Jessie Buckley.\n\n\t“I filmed the ending that was on the script,” Zhao recalled. “I looked at it and said, ‘This doesn’t work. We don’t have a film.'” She remembered Buckley’s reaction: “Jessie’s looking at me like, ‘This is it? I went through all of this and this is the ending?'”\n\n\tThe breakthrough came the following morning during a car ride through rainy London. Buckley sent Zhao Max Richter’s “On the Nature of Daylight” – the haunting track that appeared in “Arrival” and other films. “That song has a very special ability to harmonize your whole body to the world around you,” Zhao said. “You suddenly feel like one with everything.”\n\n\tWhile listening to the song, Zhao found herself reaching for the rain outside the car window. “I wanted to reach nature so that I can no longer be afraid of losing my love, because if we’re all one, then you can’t lose love. It just transforms into something else.” In that moment of personal grief and creative desperation, the film’s true ending revealed itself.\n\n\t“I always wait for the ending to show up, which is very stressful because you’re always this little bit from not having a film,” Zhao admitted. “But that’s how life is.”\n\n\tKore-eda expressed understanding, revealing his own unconventional process. He creates storyboards but abandons them once on set. “I’m always looking about two weeks ahead,” he said through translation. “I look at the schedule to see which actors will be on set, and I think about what I can do. I actually write and rewrite the script on set in that space. The staff are probably nervous, but what emerges this way rarely feels wrong.”\n\n\tZhao drew a distinction between her latest work and her previous films. “‘Hamnet’ is about the internal landscape, as opposed to ‘Nomadland,’ which is about the external landscape,” she explained.\n\n\tWorking with cinematographer Lukasz Żal for the first time, Zhao shifted from the wide-open horizons of her earlier American films to something more contained. “In my previous films, I was in my 30s and very much about chasing as many horizons as possible. So it wass about going wide. With ‘Hamnet,’ I was interested in how can we confine everything into one frame, one stage, one room, so that the water can go deeper.”\n\t\n\n\tThis theatrical approach led Zhao to ask Kore-eda about his own precisely composed frames, which often recall stage backdrops. The Japanese director explained that he exchanges few words with his cinematographer on set, preferring to explore each other’s intentions through the camera itself. “It’s very enjoyable,” he said. “If I just followed the storyboard, it would just be about consuming a tight schedule.”\n\n\tWhen asked why she works in fiction rather than documentary, Zhao offered a surprising answer about courage – or her lack of it. “I think when you’re making a documentary, you’re saying, ‘This is me and this is the subject,'” she explained, citing Werner Herzog’s “Into the Abyss” as an example of fearless documentary filmmaking. “I haven’t found that courage in my 30s to do that work.”\n\n\tBut there was another reason, rooted in representation and dignity. Zhao spoke about marginalized communities in America – people on reservations or living in vans – who are often documented with rough digital cameras under unflattering lights, studied as social issues rather than human beings.\n\n\t“If you are with them in their lifestyle, you are exposed to the most beautiful landscape of America,” Zhao said. “And cinema’s cinematic treatments, these painterly images, are usually – because of circumstances of history – preserved for certain demographic people.”\n\n\tWorking with her cinematographer, Zhao insisted on capturing these faces with the same cinematic treatment as any Hollywood star, shooting at the golden hour. “The quality of lighting makes us feel like we’re one with light. And that kind of sunset and sunrise, these people who aren’t in big cities, or have the privilege many of us do, are actually experiencing on a daily basis.”\n\n\t“Sometimes poetry can capture truth better than facts can,” Zhao concluded. “It is an emotional truth, not just fact.”\n\n\tZhao found unexpected freedom in her outsider status. “I only saw two and a half westerns when I made my own westerns,” she laughed. “I didn’t have the burdens on my shoulders as Americans do about making a Western. And when I made this Shakespeare, I don’t know Shakespeare very well, so I don’t have the burden as a British person. Everything about Shakespeare is so sacred. I just do whatever I want.”\n\t\n\n\tThis cavalier approach masks an earlier struggle. When Zhao first came to America for school, her insecurity about language was so profound that she gave up on storytelling and studied politics instead. “I didn’t think I could tell stories. How can I do it if I don’t speak a language?”\n\n\tBut her favorite films had lots of silence. “There’s a language of how your face moves and how your body moves,” she realized. “And if you don’t speak the language, you actually develop an extra sensitivity to nonverbal interactions.” What was once a challenge became an advantage.\n\n\tBefore the conversation, Zhao had watched Kore-eda’s 1998 masterpiece “After Life” – a film about newly deceased people who must choose one memory to take into eternity while workers in a way station create film recreations of those memories.\n\n\t“I was crying for an hour,” Zhao confessed, explaining how the film resonated with her work on “Hamnet,” which deals with how Shakespeare and his wife processed the death of their son. “When we see our lives, whether it’s joyful or painful, mirrored back to us, it gives these experiences meaning and makes the human experience a little less difficult.”\n\n\tShe identified with the characters in “After Life” who choose not to select a memory, instead staying in limbo to help others. “My favorite memories in my life are actually while making belief, while making fantasies that are not real, for other people’s memories,” Zhao said. “When you see ‘Hamnet,’ you’ll see that Shakespeare is also a man who has a lot of trouble connecting and communicating in real life. But when he’s on his stage, he can connect with everything. So there’s a bittersweetness to many of us who chose to be storytellers.”\n\n\tKore-eda, who made “After Life” in his 20s, acknowledged this tension still exists for him in his 60s. “I want to keep making work without becoming cynical about that feeling,” he said.\n\n\tZhao praised Kore-eda’s films for their focus on mundane details – laundry, cooking, daily routines – that create a meditative rhythm before emotional tsunamis arrive. “A lot of times cinema skips past the 80% in between, showing only the highs and the super lows,” Zhao observed. “But you invite us into the comfort of these daily rituals. And through that, it goes and it pushes us off. It’s like some kind of ritual and the piece comes in a loop. And then when it hits you, it’s in the body.”\n\t\n\n\tKore-eda modestly accepted the compliment, saying he hopes to build stories from small emotional fluctuations in daily life, though he’s unsure how well he succeeds.\n\n\tThe conversation also touched on practical matters. Kore-eda shoots for roughly two months and tries to finish before dinner when children are on set, adhering to improved labor rules in Japanese production. He also edits at night during production, sometimes sending footage to his team for feedback the next day – a practice that elicits nervous anticipation from his crew.\n\n\tZhao, by contrast, needs eight hours of sleep and doesn’t touch the edit during production. “I’m so easily influenced by everyone around me,” she explained. “If I edit something early on and it hasn’t quite worked, it might change how I want to do things.” “Hamnet” shot from late July through September.\n\n\tWhen asked about the tension between communal theatrical experiences and streaming platforms, both directors acknowledged the paradox. Kore-eda said he still can’t separate the act of watching a film with someone in the dark from what cinema means to him. “That’s why we need film festivals – so that experience doesn’t cease to exist.”\n\n\tZhao agreed about the importance of communal viewing – it’s central to “Hamnet’s” themes – but also celebrated how technology has democratized access. “Because of iPhones and technology, ‘Songs My Brothers Taught Me’ could be watched by a teenager in South Dakota on the Lakota reservation. I think that is an incredible thing.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, Zhao said she believes stories choose filmmakers, not the other way around. “When the conduit, the lightning conductor is ready, it will come.”\n\n\tShe has noticed patterns: her first three films explored identity, home and belonging, while “Eternals” and “Hamnet” deal with oneness and dissolving the illusion of separation. “I think that’s what I’m looking for – how do we dissolve the illusion of separation that we feel with each other, and feel that kind of oneness that you feel in the moment you are born or when you’re in nature.”\n\n\t“I believe in the power of threes,” she added. “Since I made two about that, I think there’s a third one. I just don’t know what it is.”\n\n\tAs for Kore-eda, he continues production on “Sheep In The Box,” maintaining the work-life balance that isn’t really a balance at all. “I’ve become someone who’s always working, and that’s not unpleasant for me,” he admitted. But he wants younger filmmakers to know they don’t have to be 60-year-old workaholics to make films. “If they think filmmaking might be fun even when choosing it as work, that would be good.”\n",

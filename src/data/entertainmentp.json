    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains mild spoilers from Season 2, Episode 2 of “Landman,” “Sins of the Father,” which premiered Sunday, Nov. 23, on Paramount+.\n\n\tSam Elliott is the ultimate cowboy actor, so it’s no surprise he linked up with Taylor Sheridan and became a fixture in his constellation of shows. He first starred in a “Yellowstone” prequel, “1883,” and is now starring as T.L. Norris, the father of Billy Bob Thornton’s main character, Tommy, on the second season of “Landman.”\n\t\n\n\tAudiences first meet T.L. in more of an emotional state than the stoic actor often portrays, as he receives news that his wife has died at a memory care facility. Meanwhile, T.L. is at a separate facility, his body broken down from a life in the oil fields, and he seems to exist only to see the West Texas sunset every day.\n\n\n\tWhen asked how he was able to conjure up such intense emotion on the show, Elliott said it was a naturalistic process.\n\n\t“It’s just on the page,” he said. “I had time to think about it. I just wanted to be open to whatever comes my way. When you have that kind of material, you don’t look at a piece of material, or at least I don’t look at a piece of material, and say, ‘I’d really love to cry here,’ or, ‘Really love to make the audience cry,’ or whatever. It just has to come naturally. One of the great gifts about Taylor’s material is that it just allows that kind of emotion to flow. I spent a good part of my time in tears this entire season, so it wasn’t something I expected, but it’s just something that happened.”\n\n\tFurthermore, Elliott said he feels a deep connection to Sheridan’s storytelling that extends to the quiet life he lives with his wife, actor Katharine Ross, and their daughter, Cleo.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve spent a good portion of my life growing up in the outdoors, and there’s something about Taylor’s material that I feel like it hinges on that in some respect. That really speaks deeply to me,” Elliott said. “It’s this man connected to the ground, what comes up out of the ground. It’s certainly not like ‘1883’ where we’re out in the elements and all that all the time, but there’s something about what I value personally. It’s like where I live. I live on the western end of Malibu. I’ve been there for 50 years with my wife and daughter. That takes me away from LA completely, and it’s a choice I’ve made. It’s probably not the smartest choice in terms of pursuing a career in the movie business.\n\n\t“I’m in the elements, and that’s the life that I chose, that Katharine and I and Cleo, all three of us, embrace,” he continued. “There’s something about this guy sitting in a wheelchair at 81 or 82 years old, however old he is, watching the sun go down. I mean, I don’t know how much more to say about it than that. There’s a reason for that. He’s drawn to that, and he talks about it in Episode 2, the light and the dust and the heat and the lack of moisture and the things we hate about that country. It hates us all day, and then it gives us this sunset. Those elements speak very, very strongly to me.”\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJacqueline Bisset had “mixed feelings” when presented a Torino Film Festival lifetime achievement honor for a simple reason: “I have not finished my career!”\n\n\tEven so, she gladly embraced Torino’s invitation to champion the films closest to her heart — many small, independent titles that never found distribution in Italy. “They may not be widely known, but they show an actor’s craft at its best,” Bisset said, noting that she has often been “judged, to some degree, by my earlier work, where the film roles were not great.” \n\t\n\n\tShe brought that same candor and enthusiasm to a Sunday press conference, happily sharing anecdotes about her iconic screen partners, while reserving her most generous praise for lesser-known collaborators. \n\n\n\tOf Paul Newman, she spoke affectionately of “a truly kind man” who was “shy and terrible at telling jokes because he couldn’t keep a straight face — he would start laughing before getting to the punchline.” Of Mickey Rourke, she admitted, “I had a little fear of him because he creates a kind of frenzy; it just builds around him. He’s there, quietly talking, and all around is chaos.” \n\n\tAnd of Kelly Blatz, her co-star in 2022’s “Loren & Rose,” she beamed: “He gave me so much life because he really listened, staying patient through all my long monologues and lines. That’s a real gift, because acting is all about exchange. If you pay particular attention, you can almost force the other actor to be more real — all by simply listening properly.”\n\n\t“Silence is necessary, and men love to talk about themselves,” she added wryly, noting that this advice, passed down from her parents, has served her well “in life and in cinema.” \n\t\n\n\tBisset also offered a more practical tip: abandon the saltshaker. “If you don’t want to age or swell like alcoholics, don’t use salt,” she said. “You will discover the true sensitivity of taste in food. It’s fantastic, and it took me some time to learn this — but in Italy, it’s hopeless; nobody listens.” \n\n\tFood could also become political — a lesson made clear during the shooting of 1974’s “Murder on the Orient Express.” \n\n\t“The production asked if we were willing to go against the union and shorten the lunch break from one hour to half an hour. I did not accept, because lunchtime was the highlight of the day — when we could sit and listen to Lauren Bacall — and they were asking us to break the rules. Vanessa Redgrave, who was fantastic, wonderful, and a born fighter, said, ‘We must not accept, we must not give in.’” \n\n\tWhen it came time to vote, Vanessa led the charge. “I raised my hand and voted, only to realize that no one else did. We completely lost. But Vanessa, truly passionate both as a woman and as an actress, said, ‘That was the only moment of courage in that film.’”\n\n\tThe cookhouse, meanwhile, has become an outlet for Bisset’s self-confessed autocratic instincts. \n\n\t“I have a great visual sense and I am very efficient, so I would be a fantastic director,” she explained. “I’m also very organized, I don’t like receiving help, and I prefer to have my own kingdom entirely to myself. So it’s better that I do it at home, not on a set. \n\n\t“I wouldn’t behave very well,” she continued. “I would certainly have problems with personal interaction — loving the wrong person, wanting to please one person and not another. I might become a monster. So I limit myself to doing my job as an actress, staying in front of the camera. And people don’t enter my kitchen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is flying high at the box office.\n\n\tThe movie musical has collected $150 million in North America and $76 million overseas for a dazzling $226 million global tally. It’s a boon for theaters since attendance has been seriously lagging since the summer. It’s also a major win for Universal, which took a bold bet in splitting the popular stage show into two parts, both of which needed to become major blockbusters to justify the expensive gamble. “Wicked” became a four-quadrant hit with $758 million globally, setting the stage for the second film to achieve juggernaut status as well. \n\t\n\n\tJon M. Chu directed the PG-rated “Wicked: For Good,” which sees the return of Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh and Jonathan Bailey. The second half picks up as Elphaba is branded the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda has become a public figure who’s tasked with spreading good. Since the story overlaps with “The Wizard of Oz,” a number of familiar faces, including Dorothy Gale, the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, make appearances down the Yellow Brick Road. Audiences seem to be “obsessulated” with “Wicked: For Good,” which earned the same “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls as the first. Positive word-of-mouth will be helpful for staying power over the holiday season.\n\n\n\tHere are all the records from opening weekend:\n\t\n\t\tGlobal\t\n\n\nBiggest global opening for a Broadway musical adaptation of all-time ahead of “Wicked” ($164.2 million)\nFourth-best Hollywood debut of 2025 behind Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” remake ($341 million), “Jurassic World Rebirth” ($322 million) and “A Minecraft Movie” ($313 million) and ahead of “Superman” ($220 million) and “The Fantastic Four” ($218 million)\nFifth-largest start for a musical of all-time behind 2019’s “The Lion King” remake ($433 million), “Moana 2” ($389 million), “Frozen 2” ($358.4 million) and 2017’s “Beauty and the Beast” remake ($357 million) and ahead of the “Aladdin” remake ($212 million)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDomestic\t\n\n\nBiggest domestic debut for a stage-to-screen adaptation above 2024’s “Wicked” ($112.5 million)\nSecond-highest grossing opening weekend of 2025, ahead of “Lilo & Stitch” ($146 million) and behind “A Minecraft Movie” ($162 million)\nSecond-largest start for Universal Pictures behind only 2015’s “Jurassic World” ($208.8 million)\nSecond-highest debut prior to Thanksgiving after “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” ($158 million)\nThird-best launch for any musical behind 2019’s “The Lion King” ($191 million) and 2017’s “Beauty and The Beast” ($174 million)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tInternational\t\n\n\nBiggest international for a Broadway adaptation above 2024’s “Wicked” ($50 million)\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Glover, on Saturday, opened up to fans as to why he canceled his 2024 New World Tour.\n\n\tGlover, who performs under the stage name Childish Gambino, told fans during a performance at Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw that it was a stroke that forced him to end his globe-spanning tour after just 18 shows.\n\n\t“I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana, and I did the show anyway. I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke,'” Glover explained, per clips shared on social media. “And the first thing I thought was like, ‘Oh, here I am still copying Jamie Foxx.’ That’s really like the second thing. The first thing was like, ‘I’m letting everybody down.'”\n\t\n\n\tGlover added that not long after the stroke, he had another serious health scare when doctors discovered an irregularity in his heart.\n\n\n\t“They found a hole in my heart,” Glover said. “So I had this surgery, and then I had to have another surgery.”\n\n\tHe continued, “They say everybody has two lives, and the second life starts when you realize you have one. You should be living your life how you want. If we have to do this again, it can only get better.”\n\n\tBack in 2024, Glover released a since-deleted statement on X explaining his reason for canceling in more vague terms, sharing that he had an “ailment” that required “more tests” and a surgery.\n\n\t“I want nothing more than to bring this show to the fans and perform,” he wrote at the time. “Until then, thanks for love, privacy, and support.”\n",

Chu’s movie musical.\n\n\tGrande posted a series of unseen moments while on set, including her arriving at her trailer, transforming into Glinda and examining her pink gowns.\n\t\n\n\t“Thank you, my sweet Glinda, for everything,” Grande wrote on Instagram. “I will love you always … ‘Wicked: For Good’ is out now.”\n\n\n\n\tErivo celebrated her character Elphaba in a lengthy Instagram post, which also featured a series of behind-the-scenes moments. She shared images of her soaring on Elphaba’s broomstick, walking down the yellow brick road, standing outside her trailer and posing with many of her co-stars.\n\n\t“I could write you an essay, a poem, Shakespearean prose, to describe what this journey has meant to me, what lessons this time has taught me, bought me,” Erivo captioned her post. “I could try to give a metric to the love I have felt and experienced. I could give a number to the stories I have heard. The truth is the numbers are too small and the words are not enough. So I’ll simply say this.”\n\n\tShe continued, “Take my hand and walk with me to the end of this road paved with gold, and hopefully, the things that I’ve found might find you too. Thank you for letting me be your Elphaba. All my love, C.”\n\t\n\n\n\tIn addition to their shared posts, the official “Wicked” account also paid tribute to Glinda and Elphaba by sharing a video montage of Grande and Erivo hugging and dancing while on the set of “Wicked: For Good” with the caption, “A friendship that changed us for good.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tUdo Kier, a German actor and cult icon who collaborated with everyone from Andy Warhol to Lars von Trier to Madonna, died on Sunday morning, according to his partner, artist Delbert McBride. He was 81. \n\n\tAmong the more than 200 films in his expansive body of work, Kier’s breakout collaborations with Warhol are among his most celebrated. Kier starred in the titular roles in both 1973’s “Flesh for Frankenstein” and 1974’s “Blood for Dracula.” Both directed by Paul Morrissey and produced by Warhol, the films are subversive, sultry reimaginings of the classic Hollywood monsters, with Kier bringing a haunting yet comically inept spin on the title characters. \n\t\n\n\tThat pair of films made Kier famous, and he spent the next two decades working through Europe and collaborating with legendary writer-director Rainer Werner Fassbinder on films like “The Stationmaster’s Wife,” “The Third Generation” and “Lili Marleen.” Then, at the Berlin Film Festival, Kier met future two-time Oscar-nominated director Gus Van Sant, who Kier credits with securing him an American work permit and a SAG card.\n\n\n\tIn 1991, Van Sant widely introduced Kier to American audiences with his coming-of-age drama “My Own Private Idaho,” loosely based on Shakespeare’s “Henry IV.” Kier appeared in a supporting role alongside stars River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. \n\n\tAround the same time, Kier began his lifelong collaboration with von Trier. Starting in the late ’80s with “Epidemic,” Kier appeared in the 1991 film “Europa” before appearing in several episodes of von Trier’s long-running horror-thriller series “The Kingdom” through the ’90s and aughts. Their other film collaborations include “Breaking the Waves,” “Dancer in the Dark,” “Dogville,” “Melancholia” and “Nymphomaniac: Vol. II.” \n\t\n\n\tThe ’90s also saw Kier in several supporting roles in major Hollywood productions, such as “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,” “Armageddon” and “Blade.” Most recently, Kier appeared in Kleber Mendonça Filho awards darling “The Secret Agent.” The film earned star Wanger Moura the honor for best actor at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWork stunk on the Anthony Bourdain biopic — and Antonio Banderas relished the experience. \n\n\t“We spent a month and a half filming in Cape Cod and Newport, constantly surrounded by the smell of fish,” he laughed. “Every time I came back to the hotel, I had to shower because I absolutely reeked — I was cleaning fish every single day!” \n\n\tSpeaking at the Torino Film Festival, Banderas shed new light on the Matt Johnson-directed, A24-produced “Tony,” which reimagines the chef-turned-globetrotter as an aimless young man. \n\t\n\n\t“After finishing university, [Bourdain] originally wanted to become a writer,” Banderas said. “But almost immediately, he began struggling with depression and drug addiction, so the film explores the very difficult early years of his life.” \n\n\n\tBanderas plays a Brazilian-born restaurateur who takes the young Tony — played by “The Holdovers” breakout Dominic Sessa — under his wing. “Through this relationship, Tony begins to truly learn how to cook,” he said. “So the film is not just about cuisine or culinary techniques; it’s about his life, his identity, and his way of being — shaped by this unique mentor.” \n\n\tWhile the real Bourdain began as a dishwasher at a restaurant run by Provincetown mainstay Ciro Cozzi, Banderas’ mentor is more of a composite character. He described the part as “a man from Brazil who works in the United States and has travelled the world.” \n\n\t“My character studied at the finest institutions, graduating from the best gastronomy schools, yet he always remained an outsider,” Banderas added. “He created his own restaurant outside the traditional world of elite chefs, developing his own dishes with ingredients accessible to ordinary communities — simple food for everyday people.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBanderas and Torino artistic director Giulio Base \n\t\n\n\n\n\tIndeed, Banderas placed great emphasis on mentors while in Turin to accept a lifetime achievement award — even describing his own career as the product of serendipitous encounters.\n\n\t“I am a theater actor,” he explained. “Cinema came by chance, thanks to Pedro Almodóvar — a ‘chance’ that led to 130 films, but still, it was chance. Theater was my first love, and for the past seven or eight years, I’ve returned to my home in Malaga and to my true home on the stage. My life has changed, and now I am finally doing what my life’s project was always meant to be.”\n\n\tActor Paul Newman — the subject of a 24-film retrospective at this year’s Torino Film Festival, and whose piercing blue eyes stare out from the festival poster — was another formative figure in Banderas’ life.\n\n\t“I worked for a year in New York doing a musical,” Banderas recalled. “One day I was on stage, singing, and at a certain point I saw Paul Newman with those eyes staring at me. I froze completely — it was incredibly powerful. We made a couple of films together, and I worked with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in ‘Philadelphia.’ He liked me, so we often went out to dinner in New York. He had this quirky habit: he would always ask for a very specific beer and tell the waiter, ‘In exactly 2 minutes and 45 seconds, please bring me another!’ I still think about that.”\n",

    "description": "\n\t“Wicked,” the stage musical, took its first bow 22 years ago. The novel it’s based on, “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,”",
    "body": "\n\t“Wicked,” the stage musical, took its first bow 22 years ago. The novel it’s based on, “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,” was published in 1995. All of that happened well before the #MeToo revolution. Yet in the years since that revolution kicked off (you can date it to the week of October 2017 when the Harvey Weinstein story broke), one of the many forms that the new feminist consciousness took was to seize upon stories of women from the past and “reframe” them, only now with a more enlightened understanding of everything those women accomplished (and the odds they were up against).\n\t\n\n\tWe might be talking about a rocket scientist like Dana Ulery, a politician like Shirley Chisholm, or Britney Spears. And “Wicked,” with an impish defiance that anticipated the #MeToo project of reconfiguring the sins of history, dared to place the Wicked Witch of the West in that hallowed company. It said: She has been misjudged, misunderstood, misportrayed. As a stage musical, and as a lavish two-part Hollywood movie, culminating in the newly released “Wicked: For Good,” that fuses confectionary psychedelic imagery with enough sisterly conflict and transcendence to make a lot of us swoon, “Wicked” presents itself as the backstory of “The Wizard of Oz.” But it also seems to be challenging “The Wizard of Oz,” peering at it from a 21st-century vantage point of feminine struggle and liberation. \n\n\n\tThere’s a reason that “The Wizard of Oz” is uniquely suited to that reverse-angle treatment. Certainly, it’s one of the most transporting movies ever made. Yet what is it about “The Wizard of Oz” that speaks to us with such mythological timelessness? We tend to think of it in terms of the film’s eye-popping imagery (no sci-fi movie, and no CGI, can match the cockeyed splendor of how the land of Oz looks), its etched-in-time performances, the barely suppressed freakishness of it all, the whole MGM-on-mushrooms backlot dream atmosphere, not to mention the singular incandescence of “Over the Rainbow.”\n\t\n\n\tBeneath its candified surface, though, what remains haunting about “The Wizard of Oz” is that the film unveils a surreal cosmology of topsy-turvy gender-role reversals. Simply put, it’s Hollywood’s first vision of the patriarchy…that dares to imagine a world after the patriarchy. And that’s why in “Wicked,” “The Wizard of Oz” proves to be so ripe for “reframing.” It’s a movie that reframes society — and reframes itself — even as you’re watching it.\n\n\tIn black-and-white dustbowl Kansas, the quintessence of the “ordinary” old America, Judy Garland’s pigtailed Dorothy lives on a farm with her Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, surrounded by eccentrics like the mean Miss Gulch and the quackish Professor Marvel. But when she lands in Oz, what she discovers isn’t just a land of chattery Munchkins and acid-head Technicolor décor. She discovers…a radically different power structure.\n\n\tTwo women loom large, like good and evil goddesses: Billie Burke’s aristocratic Glinda, arriving inside a giant soap bubble, and Margaret Hamilton’s hypnotically seething Wicked Witch of the West, one of the three or four ripest images of evil a Hollywood movie ever gave us. (What are the others? Offhand, I’d say Mr. Potter in “It’s a Wonderful Life” and Darth Vader.) These women rule the roost, setting the tone for what “The Wizard of Oz,” beneath its glowing colors and fairy-tale story, really is: Hollywood’s first radical vision of matriarchy.\n\n\tAnd here’s the sleight-of-hand trick of it all. The land of Oz doesn’t present itself as a matriarchy. The most powerful figure in the kingdom is a man: the Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Everyone drops his name in awed tones. The regal Glinda defers to him. Even the imperious Wicked Witch is intimidated by his power. So the land of Oz, in form, is a traditional patriarchy.\n\n\tExcept that it’s not. Because what we finally learn is that “the Wizard of Oz” doesn’t exist. That looming patriarchal monarch is an illusion, a hologram glimpsed through smoke and fire. Glinda and the Wicked Witch of the West really are the two most powerful figures in Oz. And as you look more closely at Margaret Hamilton’s extraordinary performance as the Wicked Witch, another level of this phantasmagorical landscape clicks into place, a kind of submerged reverie of identity.\n\t\n\n\tWhat is it about the Wicked Witch that’s so uniquely scary and mesmerizing? It’s that Hamilton invests her with a look and energy that fuses the masculine and the feminine. The movie is telling us, in a nightmare way, what is going to frighten people about matriarchy: the primal anxiety that women will subsume and replace men. That fear asserts itself in the homicidal gaze of Hamilton’s presence. The Wicked Witch’s dream mission is to murder femininity (“My pretty!”).\n\n\tBut this, in fact, is a perversion of what true matriarchy is. The more enlightened version is the one presented by Dorothy and her three friends: the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, all visions of men who have had their power taken away. Yet their love for Dorothy is real; that’s what their power becomes — the desire to transcend their goofball selves by protecting her.\n\n\tWhat this all adds up to is that “The Wizard of Oz,” in the guise of a 1930s Hollywood kitsch fantasy musical, is really presenting us with a hallucinatory, time-tripping vision of a future that is female — one where the old patriarchal rulers, like the Wizard, are façades waiting to be torn down, where the passion of women (good and evil) exerts far greater power, and where ordinary dudes, trying to make themselves better (by improving their brains, hearts, and valor), exist to serve and defend the transcendently soulful teenage heroine who has landed in their midst. In the end, of course, she does go back to Kansas. But by then she’s ready to rule.          \n",

    "body": "\n\tShaboozey and Stephen Wilson Jr. chose the CMA Awards telecast for the live television premiere performance of their theme for the Stephen King adaptation “The Long Walk.” Titled “Took a Walk,” the duet aims to let viewers down easy from the brutal dystopia they’ve just been witness to, and to suggest, in ballad form, that there may yet be unity at the end of the road, as unlikely as that seems right now… er, in the movie.\n\n\tIn a visit to the Variety CMA Awards Interview Lounge — presented by Duke Cannon at Anzie Blue — the two talked about how the collaboration came to be. \n\t\n\n\t“To be honest, how it came about for me was, they used  one of my songs in the trailer, ‘Last of My Kind,’” explains Shaboozey. “I’m very particular… (but) I love a lot of Midwest, Middle America textures… and it was a Stephen King movie. And like Stephen (Wilson) here, I’m also like a huge Stephen King fan as well — ‘Christine,’ ‘Salem’s Lot,’ ‘The Shining, the list can keep going. So I was really like, this is a dream come true, just having a song in the trailer.\n\n\n\t“And then I hit up my team and I was like, ‘Hey, is there any more opportunity to create for this movie?’ The team reached out to the studio and the studio’s like, ‘Hey, we need an end credit song.’  I just got to got to cooking. They showed me a preview, I checked it out, and I was like really moved by it, and then I wrote the song that day. Immediately after watching the movie, I got some members from my band together and we came up with some chords, picked up our guitars and started writing. \n\n\t“And then, Stephen, everyone in my band is a huge fan of you. Like  they would rather play for you than play for me, truthfully,” laughs the “Tipsy” singer. “It’s all right, but they love him so much… I sent him a text, and it just made sense, man; it came from my gut. I didn’t think of anybody else. … He just jumped on it and did his thing. Man, you make me look like a bad-ass.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tWilson refers to it as a “full circle” experience, the circle beginning with his obsession with all things King.\n\n\tThe Big Loud-signed singer-songwriter says that he and Shaboozey “met a couple years ago, actually at a CMA after party. It was right before he like started taking off. I was just about to put out a record and he stopped me — I think he had heard a song or two of mine — and was like, ‘You’re a bad dude.’ And I was like, ‘You’re a bad dude.’ … And then sure enough, two years later, you know, he asked me to be a part of this song. \n\n\t“What’s wild is, I started singing this song called ‘Stand By Me’ because of the movie called ‘Stand By Me,’ based off the Stephen King novella called ‘The Body.’ It’s haunted me my whole life, that song, and I sang it in this dude’s basement and it blew up online. AA big reason why I have a career is because of that song ‘Stand By Me’ and because of Stephen King.” Notably, Wilson’s solo-acoustic rendition of that song, which he performed on the CMAs in addition to the Shaboozey collaboration, was considered by many to be the highlight of Wednesday’s telecast. \n\n\t“Then in the midst of all the craziness of that year, this dude hits me up and says, ‘Yo, I got this song that I want you to be a part of for this Stephen King movie called “The Long Walk.”‘ And they’d teed it up. I mean, they had this incredible verse and chorus and all I could do was screw it up. So I really went into songwriter mode and tried to, I don’t know, just support this in any way possible, not knowing where it was gonna go. I wrote the verse and they loved it. Two days later I sang it. Two weeks later we heard it on a trailer. \n\n\t“And here we are singing it at the CMAs. I’m singing ‘Stand by Me,’ and I’m singing ‘Took a Walk,’ both from a Stephen King movie. My name’s Stephen with a PH. I ain’t no King… It’s just a weird full circle thing. I couldn’t have planned this if I tried. It is a God thing.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStephen Wilson Jr. and Shaboozey in the Variety CMA Awards Lounge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSays Shaboozey, “It’s funny, how he has this whole lore behind it. When I met him, the first thing I said to him was, ‘Has anybody told you you look like Stephen King?’  … Everything he put on the track is just, you did us all proud, man. Honestly, thank you.”\n\t\n\n\tThey worry about giving away spoilers in talking about the way the song succeeds the ending of the film, although the movie has had its run in theaters, so much of the potential audience has seen it. (Mild spoiler alert…)\n\n\t“I also like the way the story ends with two characters, with the duality of the two. I think that’s a beautiful thing… there’s two singers and it ends with two walkers … I think that was just meant to be, whether we meant for it to be or not.”\n\n\tThe journey metaphors come easily. “I’m just walking the walk. He and I both are. And when he and I met each other, it was at the beginning of our walk — at least the busy part of our walk. But when we were singing that during rehearsal, there’s a line in the chorus: ‘I know you’re tired. Hell, so am I, we can’t take the same road again…’ And I think, looking at each other now, singing that line, it comes with a beautiful sting that rings a little bit more true. And I’m grateful to be on that road… especially with you, dude.”\n\n\n\n\n\tShaboozey talked about the tour he recently wrapped up: “I had this concept for doing this tour called the Great American Road Show for a couple years now. I kind of was just talking about how I felt like America has gotten so far from the idea of what it was originally — people coming here looking for a new life to settle in and just be free to practice and worship and live culturally the way they they choose to, as long as it’s not infringing on other people’s rights. So I just wanted people to know that I’m here with them as well, and we just all want for the same thing… to be respectful of each other and embracing other cultures.”\n\n\tSpeaking of the movie, Wilson says “the attempt here is to level the playing field and just remind everybody that we’re all just trying to survive and we all just want the best for one another. A hundred percent trying to live the best life we can because it’s really such a precious thing. Life is so fragile and humanity in itself is fragile, and we need to cherish and protect our civilization and not take it for granted.”\n\n\n\n\n\tWilson talked about his just-released single, “Gary,” off a planned 2026 sophomore album. “I had this epiphany a little over a year ago that there ain’t a lot of boys named Gary anymore. And where I come from, the Garys just know how to fix things. They don’t know why. They just do. And, I think we’re gonna need our Garys, because tech is great and all, but at the end of the day, septic tanks ain’t going nowhere, and we’re gonna need a Gary to show up. … I’d like to celebrate some people that usually are never celebrated. And I think Gary might be one of them, or at least the metaphorical Garys that we’re gonna need that make the world go round and keep our trucks running and keep the tires full of air and keep the plumbing working and, and pretty much all the stuff that nobody really wants to talk about… that keep the world going around.”\n\t\n\n\tShaboozey was more mum when asked about the seemingly likely prospect of a 2026 album.\n\n\tHe’s “just working, honestly,” he said. “I just wanna keep telling my story, and telling stories. I’m a huge storyteller and world builder. So I can’t really speak too much on it, but I’m really excited for anything for what’s coming in 2026. It’s gonna be really, really, really awesome.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStephen Wilson Jr. and Shaboozey at the Variety CMA Awards Interview Lounge presented by Duke Cannon at Anzie Blue on November 18, 2025 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBoth artists were put up in the best new artist category at the CMAs. Ultimately, the prize went to Zach Top. But the competition was anything but cut-throat, as far as these two were concerned.\n\n\t“Being nominated is a huge win for me,” said Wilson. “I’ve never been a cool kid, so I feel like the nerdy kid in the ’90s movie that they nominate as prom king, just so they can make fun of him.”\n\n\t“Don’t be Carrie in there, man,” said Shaboozey. “Don’t rise up and bring down Bridgestone Arena on top of us.”\n",

Now that the Season 2 plot threads have been teased, let’s jump into the second episode.\n\t\n\n\nRight off the bat: Are these the craziest lyrics we’ve ever heard from a song on a Taylor Sheridan show? “If there ever come a time I got rabies / You’re high on my bitin’ list.” Tyler Childers is great, but this took me by surprise!\nWhy is Cooper so shaken up? He effectively won the lottery, and his dad is the titular landman. Ask for some help with paperwork and you’re set, dude.\nAlso, I get Ariana (Paulina Chavez) being triggered, but it’s only been a few days of a life-changing week for your partner that will benefit you, too. Just roll with it…he’ll be OK!\nWait, she’s breaking up with him over this? This communication blip is such a solvable problem! All of Ariana’s points are valid, but solutions could be ironed out in 45 minutes or so, especially now that they have money.\nOK, now that both T.L. (Sam Elliott) and Tommy have talked trash about the now-departed matriarch of their family, I’m dying to know what she actually did to fall out with them.\nLove Tommy arguing with the radio DJs as if they’re sitting in his truck with him.\nAlso, it’s amazing that Tommy’s phone lights up with a picture of Angela mid-screaming and a spooky ringtone every time she calls.\nUh oh, this missing $400 million is going to be an issue. Too bad the only person who knows where it is, Monty (Jon Hamm), is dead.\nRebecca (Kayla Wallace) putting Nate (Colm Feore) in his place felt great. Shut up, nerd — she can negotiate a contract to drill on the damn moon!\nAngela getting Nate’s name wrong several times is a great gag. To be fair, he does look like a Neil!\nCooper is maybe the dumbest person on the planet. I understand wanting to control your legacy, but HIS DAD IS THE LANDMAN! Have him look at the contract!\nWow! Who knew that Tommy would have pretty good advice about Ariana’s situation and how Cooper should listen to her?\nWould love a spinoff of the tipsy, farty horndogs at the old folks home.\nWhen it comes to Angela and Ainsley vs. the THHSC, I’m firmly Team Norris. They were hanging out with the elderly…that’s a nice thing!\nIf I ever need a lawyer, please let them be as ruthless as Rebecca.\nAs expected, it seems like the skeletons in Monty’s closet will haunt everyone this season.\nIs there any situation in which Sheriff Walt (Mark Collie) wouldn’t just do what Tommy told him to do over FaceTime?\n“Oh, that was just me purging my grief” was an excellently delivered deadpan from Thornton.\nAnother heartbreaking performance from Elliott. Calling it now: Give him some awards attention!\n“I wasn’t raised to father a son.” Damn, Tommy is getting introspective!\nWow, Tommy’s upbringing was a nightmare.\nCooper’s moment telling Tommy he loved him and his best was good enough… instant tears! A great emotional beat.

Moments later, she shouted, \"How dare you treat me this way!\" and demanded a gate agent be fired even calling for someone to \"come and get [her] fired.\"\n      \n\n          At one point, the flier paced back and forth, shouting, \"Who are you? Why is our plane late? Why are we not boarding?\" before threatening to sue the employee. Witnesses say she was denied boarding because the flight was already full.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          \"You tell me I cannot board now? Because I questioned why it is late?!\" she yelled, throwing her hands in the air as the crowd looked on.\n      \n    \n          The meltdown reportedly dragged on for nearly 30 minutes before airport security arrived and escorted her out.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TikTok\n              \n                          \n                Viral\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

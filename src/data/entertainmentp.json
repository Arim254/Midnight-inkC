    "body": "\n\tWithin the last handful of years, animation has earned a new level of respect. So many animated films check all of the boxes, from good story, good voice casting, they look beautiful, there’s a message behind them. They make you laugh, cry and, frequently, make you sing along. But there is one other noticeable similarity — it’s women executives in leadership positions who are pushing these animated juggernauts forward.\n\n\t“Whether we’re talking about live action or animation, I think there’s a reason that there are so many successful female executives and there are a lot of successful female producers,” says Kristine Belson, president, features & series, Sony Pictures Animation. She adds that progress is happening — but it’s not happening fast enough. “In certain areas of animation filmmaking, women are well-represented. But I’m not as encouraged as I’d like to be. There’s still a very big discrepancy between how many female directors are working today versus male directors in animation. And until that shift happens, and there are as many women directors as male directors, well, the job’s not done. … Listen, progress is happening for sure, but it’s not happening fast enough.”\n\t\n\n\tNotes Ramsey Naito, president, Paramount Animation: “Women are bringing fresh perspectives, a collaborative approach and a focus on inclusion, which helps bring teams together and strengthens company culture,” adding that at Paramount and Nickelodeon, they’re also focused on mentorship and retention. “It’s not just about getting women in the door — it’s about building a clear career path to grow into leadership roles with support every step of the way. It’s important for us to make sure women have every opportunity to grow and lead.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year, animated feature Oscar contenders such as “KPop Demon Hunters” (co-directed by Maggie Kang, the film is from Netflix, whose animation division is run by Hannah Minghella),  “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” (Maïlys Vallade) and “Elio” (Madeline Sharafian and Domee Shi) all have female co-directors.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTwo female directors were behind “Elio.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMindy Johnson, CalArts professor and author of the upcoming book “The Only Woman Animator,” says that women have always “been in the room” and contributed more to the medium than people thought or were given credit for. “It wasn’t just faceless, nameless women who traced and colored in animation cels, producing the brilliant artistry we see on screen. But out of that exceptional, extraordinary work, a range of trailblazing women emerged and have always been there from the very beginning,” Johnson says. “We’ve failed as a society, as a culture, as an industry to tell their stories. We’ve all missed out collectively on the other half of our collective animated experience. We have a lot of catching up to do, and we’re getting there today.”\n\n\tThat renaissance of the medium that began in the 1990s through the 2000s, when we had Ariel singing “Part of Your World” in “The Little Mermaid” and other animated heroines like Belle (“Beauty and the Beast”), Jasmine (“Aladdin”), along with “Pocahontas” and “Mulan.” Johnson says, “We have a generation growing up falling in love with animation and then saying, ‘Hey, I wanna do that!’ We noticed a trend with young women about 20, 25 years ago where new programs were just beginning for animation in campuses and schools. CalArts has always been there and is still the creme de la creme. There was a rising trend, and now every major campus, every minor campus, has animation programs.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Bad Guys 2” is from woman-led DreamWorks Animation.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJohnson says the huge gender disparity of some 10 to 15 years ago has “shifted. We’re closer to parity. I think we’re still under in a lot of ways, but the industry is undergoing some kind of rumblings and shifts at the moment. … I just beam seeing the presence of women and their voices, their ideas, their characters. We’ve got women finally telling their stories without having to be the only woman in the room. They’re in a more supported and recognized place.”\n\t\n\n\tHolly Edwards, president of Skydance Animation notes, “It’s fantastic that the animation industry is now led by so many incredible women. There has certainly been a shift over the years with many more women in leadership roles, both creatively leading projects as well as in decision-making positions. I feel very lucky to have had incredible female mentors and colleagues throughout my career and know that environments thrive when they include people from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. It truly makes a huge difference for the better for the stories we’re telling.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Little Amélie or the Character of Rain,” co-directed by Maïlys Vallade, is one of the animated features vying for an Oscar nomination.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCommenting on animation still not being taken as seriously as live action features, DreamWorks Animation president Margie Cohn pauses and says, almost reluctantly, “I think — and this is going to be incredibly unpopular — but a lot of people pigeonhole animation as kids’ programming, and maybe they feel that’s a safe place for women to be. And then we surprise them with how large our skill set is … we can actually manage successfully and be competitive with the men.”\n\n\tBut the business of making an animated film is a long, complex process, typically taking four to seven years from concept to completion. “Yes, there have been movements towards promoting women into more leadership positions, but the thing with animation is, it just takes so long to create these that even though we’re making steps now and strides, we’re not gonna see that for a few years,” Kang points out. “There’s already kind of this desire to promote women in leadership positions, and there have been kind of active initiatives to do that. I do think what we’re still lacking is the right training and mentorship. I’d like to see more of that. And I’d like to try to contribute as much as I can.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDreamWorks Animation, led by Margie Cohn, released “Dog Man” earlier this year.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut the goal is to create a quality feature with great storytelling that will appeal to all age groups. “You can make movies that are entertaining and funny, or you could make things that will live with a person from childhood through adulthood, where they can watch it over and over and over again, and different things come out in the storytelling and they understand it in a different way,” Cohn says.\n\t\n\n\tBelson adds: “These movies, they can be entertaining for 5-year-olds, but also deeply engaging for adults. I want to keep seeing movies that engage me. I just want to be surprised, and I want to laugh, and I want to be deeply moved. I think that’s what we all want. I want to see animation keep evolving and get the respect that it deserves. It gets it in the marketplace — we get great box office results — but I would like animation to continue to get recognized in our industry and with the Academy for being the incredible creative achievements that they are.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMädchen Amick is pulling double duty on “Brilliant Minds,” with Amick set to both guest star in an episode and direct another. \n\n\tVariety has learned exclusively that Amick will direct episode 7 of the NBC medical drama’s second season, which will air on Nov. 3.  She will then guest star in episode 9, “The Fire Fighter,” which airs Nov. 24. \n\n\tAs previously announced, Eric Dane will guest star in the same episode as a firefighter with ALS. Amick will play Alicia Ramati, who is described as “a strong-willed woman who wears her emotions on her sleeve, especially when it comes to her firefighting ex-husband, Matthew (Dane). She’s not afraid to state her opinion and care for the ones she loves.” \n\t\n\n\tAmick is known for her starring roles in shows like “Twin Peaks,” also later appearing in the Showtime revival. She also previously starred in the hit CW series “Riverdale,” on which she made her television directorial debut by helming multiple episodes. Other notable roles include “American Horror Story,” “Damages,” “Californication,” “Gossip Girl,” and “ER.” Her feature directorial debut, “Fractured,” was released in August. \n\n\n\tAmick is repped by Gersh and KW Entertainment. \n\n\t“Brilliant Minds” Season 2 premiered on Sept. 22. The series is inspired by author and physician Oliver Sacks. The cast includes Zachary Quinto, Tamberla Perry, Ashleigh LaThrop, Alex MacNicoll, Aury Krebs, Spence Moore II, Teddy Sears, Donna Murphy, John Clarence Stewart, Brian Altemus and Al Calderon.\n\n\tMichael Grassi serves as writer and executive producer. Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Leigh London Redman, Lee Toland Krieger, DeMane Davis, Jasmine Russ, Henrik Bastin, Jonathan Cavendish, Andy Serkis and Shefali Malhoutra also executive produce. The series is produced by Berlanti Productions, Fabel Entertainment, The Imaginarium, Grassi Productions and Tavala in association with Warner Bros. Television and Universal Television.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo years after Matthew Perry’s sudden death, his sister Caitlin Morrison still hears his voice as she goes about her daily life. “I feel him around a lot and I can hear the things that he would say in response to the things that are going on as if he’s actually here saying them. Maybe he is. I don’t know. Who knows? Maybe ghosts are real,” she says with a laugh and then offers up a Chandler Bing-esque quip. “We’ll make some pottery together.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the days after the “Friends” icon died from an accidental ketamine overdose at the age of 54, Morrison channeled her grief into purpose, founding the Matthew Perry House in his hometown Ottawa. The nonprofit’s mission is to lessen the social and economic impact of addiction by funding emerging research and providing post-treatment support to people living with substance use disorders. \n\n\n\t“I’ve had this whole career in nonprofits and charities,” she explains. “It was a very natural thing for my mind to do after he died — to try to work what I knew how to do into bringing some kind of meaning and purpose to this horrible, horrible thing that shouldn’t have happened.”\n\n\n\tThe group is building the first facility in Ottawa and plans to replicate the blueprint in cities throughout Canada. The first one will be connected to a larger community center so that even people who are not in-patient will be able to access health care, mental health care, career counseling, financial planning management and family therapy services to help rebuild relationships frayed by addiction.\n\n\tAs Morrison delved into substance abuse research, she reached a key conclusion about the relapse phenomenon. “Everybody said, ‘We can get help for a month. If we’re lucky, three to six months.’ And that’s wonderful, but it’s not enough,” she explains. “The brain takes more time than that to heal.”\n\t\n\n\tShe points to a telling statistic: 85% of people relapse within a year of treatment. But after three years, that number flips, and 85% will maintain their recovery for the rest of their lives.\n\n\tThat insight shaped the Matthew Perry House model. “Nobody is ever asked to walk out the door until they feel they have everything they need,” she says. “The average stay will be about three years.” The Ottawa center will include health care, career counseling, trauma therapy, art and music programs, and family counseling. “It’s like, let’s make every piece of your life as wonderful as humanly possible.”\n\n\tThe group’s work is separate but complements the Matthew Perry Foundation, an L.A.-based organization spearheaded by the actor’s publicist, Lisa Kasteller. In September, the Matthew Perry Foundation held a summit on addiction and recovery titled “Breaking Barriers & Building Pathways for Change” at CAA.\n\n\tMorrison says her brother’s foundation in the U.S. continues to do important long-term work, but “we’re building something that’s going to help people immediately — and I think we’re going to change the face of what treatment looks like for everyone.”\n\n\tWith that, she makes her pitch to the entertainment community that became Perry’s surrogate family after he enjoyed his first successes as a teen: “To any Hollywood people who might be listening: if this is an area of interest for you, the Matthew Perry House is the place to support. I feel like I can ethically say that because I don’t actually get paid.”\n\n\tAs Oct. 28 approached this year, Morrison tried to balance reflection with progress. “It’s just always going to be a day with a little bit of darkness on it,” she says. “But maybe that’s wrong — because on his birthday this year, I realized I was actually more OK that day than usual. Those days like October 28th don’t actually make it harder. They’re the days where it’s allowed to be really hard. They’re permission to cry publicly in an embarrassing way.”\n\n\tHer humor, like her brother’s, is never far away. “The defensive mechanism funny answer is he ruined Halloween for me, so thanks,” she quips. “The serious answer is… it’s just a day with a little bit of a darkness on it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe soon-to-be-privately-held Electronic Arts saw its sales fall 13% year over year during the July-September quarter, according to the video game giant’s latest earnings results.\n\n\tAlong with the issuing of the financial details Tuesday, the maker of “Madden NFL,” “Battlefield,” “The Sims” and “Apex Legends” said it will forgo its usual quarterly Q&A call between analysts and EA leadership and will no longer be issuing forward-looking financial guidance. \n\t\n\n\tThe choice is attributed to EA’s pending $55 billion deal to be taken private by investors including the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners and Silver Lake Group, which was announced Sept. 29 and is on track to be completed by next spring, subject to closing conditions.\n\n\n\tAlong with its latest hit release, “Battlefield 6,” EA’s current catalog of titles includes “EA Sports FC” (rebranded from “FIFA”), “Apex Legends,” “The Sims,” “EA Sports,” “Skate,” “Madden NFL,” “EA Sports College Football,” “Need for Speed,” “Dragon Age,” “Titanfall,” “Plants vs. Zombies” and “EA Sports F1,” among others.\n\n\tAccording to EA, wins from the latest quarter, which marked EA’s second quarter of its fiscal 2026, included: “Madden NFL 26” fueling year-over-year net bookings growth, “Apex Legends” returning to double digit sales growth, and an increase in “EA Sports FC 26 HD” net bookings compared to last year’s title, “after adjusting for differences in deluxe edition content timing.”\n\n\tWall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 35 cents on $1.87 billion in revenue for the quarter, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG. EA reported non-GAAP diluted EPS of 54 cents on $1.82 billion in net bookings ($1.84 billion in revenue). \n\t\n\n\tThat net bookings figure was down 13% from the $2.1 billion in net bookings EA posted from July-September 2024, which EA attributes to especially strong sales for “College Football 25” at that time. \n\n\tEA had itself projected net bookings between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the latest quarter, and diluted EPS between 29 cents and 46 cents. Net income for the quarter stood at $137 million, overshooting EA’s projection between $73 million and $117 million.\n\n\t“Across our broad portfolio — from ‘EA Sports’ to ‘Battlefield,’ ‘The Sims,’ and ‘skate.’ — our teams continue to create high-quality experiences that connect and inspire players around the world,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson said in a letter to shareholders accompanying the results. “The creativity, passion, and innovation of our teams are at the heart of everything we do.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix‘s new Italian original “The Monster of Florence” is making a killing, hitting the No. 1 spot globally on the streaming giant.\n\n\tThe serial killer series, directed by genre specialist Stefano Sollima, rose to the top of Netflix’s non-English-language shows chart with 9.6 million views during the week of Oct. 20-26, according to Netflix figures.\n\n\tDuring the same period, “Nobody Wants This” Season 2 topped Netflix’s English shows chart, but with 8.6 million views, making the Italian “Monster” the streamer’s overall No. 1 TV show last week.\n\t\n\n\t“The Monster of Florence,” which launched on Oct. 22, rose to No. 1 in 44 territories on Netflix around the world and made the top 10 in 85 countries, according to Netflix figures covering the Oct. 20-26 period.\n\n\n\tThe true crime show’s title is the moniker given to the alleged serial killer, who committed eight double murders over the course of 17 years from the late 1960s to the mid-’80s, preying on couples parked in cars in secluded places around Florence. “The Monster of Florence” always used the same weapon: a .22 caliber Beretta.\n\n\tThese unsolved serial murders have captivated Italians for decades. Now, they are captivating the world.\n\n\tThe four-episode limited series, which was shot largely on location in Florence and its surroundings, reunites Sollima with writer Leonardo Fasoli and ace Italian cinematographer Paolo Carnera, both of whom Sollima worked with on “Gomorrah” and cocaine trafficking drama “ZeroZeroZero.”\n\n\t“We congratulate Stefano Sollima, Leonardo Fasoli and our incredibly talented partners at AlterEgo, along with our colleagues at The Apartment, and thank the Netflix team for their unwavering support,” said Andrea Scrosati, Fremantle’s group COO and CEO of continental Europe, in a statement.\n\t\n\n\t“The global success of ‘The Monster of Florence’ on Netflix underlines the power and reach of great storytelling no matter where it emanates from,” Scrosati added.\n\n\t“The Monster of Florence” is produced by The Apartment, a Fremantle company, and Sollima’s AlterEgo shingle. The producers are Lorenzo Mieli, Stefano Sollima and Gina Gardini.\n\n\tEach of the show’s four episodes tells the story of a man who, at one point in time, investigators believed was the killer.\n\n\tSollima — who besides the “Gomorrah” and “ZeroZeroZero” series also helmed Hollywood movies such as “Sicario: Day of the Soldado” and “Without Remorse” — spent more than a year researching the killings. He chose to follow several investigative strands in the cold case, starting with the one known as the “Sardinian lead,” spawned by a Sardinian couple living in Tuscany with infidelity issues.\n\n\t“Describing the suspects individually allowed us to investigate monstrosity in a broader sense — not just the alleged Monster of Florence, but the monstrosity that some of these characters displayed in their intimate relationships, family relationships and friendships,” the director told Variety in September at the Venice Film Festival, where “Monster of Florence” premiered.\n\n\t“So suddenly, we realized that the story was becoming much broader and centered not so much on the hunt for the Monster of Florence, but rather an investigation of man and how he is a bearer of evil.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJamie Lloyd had tried once before to lure Nicole Scherzinger to the stage. Several years ago, the renegade British theater director pursued the former Pussycat Dolls frontwoman to star in “Evita,” but the collaboration didn’t work out for scheduling reasons. “I had committed to something else,” she says. Still, Scherzinger was fascinated with the way the enfant terrible’s brain worked and his ability to attract a new generation of theatergoers to London’s once-stodgy West End. So when Lloyd came calling again and asked for a meeting in London, she quickly agreed. Then came his offer: playing Norma Desmond in a revival of “Sunset Boulevard.” \n\t\n\n\tScherzinger’s only familiarity with the material was Billy Wilder’s 1950 film, which starred Gloria Swanson as a faded beauty of the silent era hell-bent on a return to relevance.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSami Drasin for Variety Magazine\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I was taken aback. I was like, ‘Wow. This is what you got me out here for. This is your big idea,’” Scherzinger recalls. “I was thinking, ‘I’m still Queen Pussycat Doll, and you’re already making me an old has-been movie star. That’s the role that you see for me?’ He said, ‘Please, just read the script.’”\n\n\tAnd so she did. As she flipped through the pages, she began to see in Norma a version of herself. Scherzinger had been a chart-topper in the aughts, but hadn’t achieved solo success, and her all-girl act yielded to the Katys, Rihannas and Gagas of the next decade. \n\n\t“I definitely had my time in the limelight like her, and the industry moves on without you,” she explains. “On a personal level, I really related to Norma’s struggle with loneliness and abandonment and feeling misunderstood and unseen — feeling very small and pathetic, even.”\n\t\n\n\tOn a warm, breezy day, Scherzinger is sitting in a sun-drenched office in her home in Portugal, a notepad filled with chicken-scratched ideas never far from reach. It’s the same room where she did many of her initial Zoom calls with Lloyd as they fleshed out their vision for the homicidal heroine.\n\n\t“I would always say, ‘Jamie, I need people to fall in love with Norma. If they don’t fall in love with her, she’s doomed from the beginning,’” she remembers.\n\n\tIt’s hard to square the idea of an “unseen” woman with the figure before me. Even dressed down in a minimalist white button-down blouse, vintage Levi’s and pearl earrings, Scherzinger exudes the kind of glamour visible from outer space. It would also be impossible to ignore the economic bang “Sunset Blvd.” made after opening in London’s West End in September 2023, before its triumphant Broadway run at the St. James Theatre the following year. The revival also became a Broadway cash cow, culminating with a $2.48 million haul in its final week in July. The final show alone brought in $514,515, marking the highest-grossing single performance ever at the St. James. \n\n\tRosie O’Donnell, a lifelong Broadway fanatic who in her days hosting a talk show was considered among theater’s biggest boosters, was not familiar with the Pussycat Dolls when she arrived at the St. James while “Sunset Blvd.” was in previews.  \n\n\t“I was in shock and thought, ‘How is it that I don’t know this woman, who’s as beautiful as any human you’ve ever seen, moves with the grace of Gwen Verdon and sings like the best Broadway stars we’ve ever known?’” O’Donnell says. “I could not believe it. I went backstage, and I started crying. It was like finding Streisand, all of a sudden, at the height of Streisand’s career.”\n\n\tWhen she won this year’s Tony Award for best actress in a musical — only the fifth time a woman has pulled off the feat for a Broadway debut, the most recent being Catherine Zeta-Jones for “A Little Night Music” in 2010 — there was no mistaking that Scherzinger was very much seen. Now, at 47, she is finally ready for her close-up.\n\n\n\tNothing has ever come easy for Scherzinger. She was born in Honolulu to an unwed and impoverished teen mother, who herself was one of 10 children. Mother and daughter left for the mainland with Scherzinger’s maternal grandparents — Tutu and Papa, she calls them — and headed to Kentucky, where, as a toddler of Hawaiian, Filipino and Ukrainian descent, Scherzinger didn’t look like the other kids. Mom worked multiple jobs while Papa, a Marine, and Tutu helped raise the little girl, instilling a deep faith in her that remains a bedrock to this day.\n\n\t“My papa started out as an atheist, and then he would go on to be a priest and then a bishop, and now he’s an archbishop for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church,” says Scherzinger, a gold Orthodox crucifix peeking from behind her open collar. “My tutu’s mother had 22 pregnancies — four miscarriages and 18 children — living in a little three-bedroom house and having no money but a strong faith. That’s the blood that I am.”\n\t\n\n\tEven her distinctive German last name — courtesy of her mother’s new husband, Gary Scherzinger — stood out. (Gary adopted her when she was 5 and is the man she calls her father to this day.) But her mom, who encouraged her to study musical theater at Ohio’s Wright State University, was her inspiration.\n\n\t“My mother is my everything,” she says. “She sacrificed everything for me, and she worked very, very, very hard and is a very selfless woman, as all the women are in my family. They’re just silent warriors.”\n\n\tMom also pushed for Scherzinger to audition for a new reality series on The WB called “Popstars USA.” Season 1, which aired in 2001, featured Scherzinger as a member of the newly minted Eden’s Crush. It was the height of the girl group gold rush, following the success of Destiny’s Child and the Spice Girls. Eden Crush’s first single, “Get Over Yourself,” hit the Top 10, and they toured with ’N Sync. Then, like a lost plotline from “Girls5eva,” their label crashed into bankruptcy and the women went their separate ways. In Scherzinger’s case, that meant joining a new group, the Pussycat Dolls, as lead singer. (The Dolls had been an established burlesque troop since the 1990s but pivoted to music in 2003.) Despite just two LPs over seven years, the group sold more than 10 million albums thanks to catchy hits like “Don’t Cha” and the “Slumdog Millionaire” tie-in “Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny).”\n\n\tSongwriter Diane Warren, who first collaborated with Scherzinger during her Pussycat Dolls days, says she stands alongside the great divas.\n\n\t“I love that the world is seeing what I saw from the beginning, because she is a fucking great singer, but oh, my God, a fucking great actress too,” Warren says. “She has the ability to hit the notes, but that’s not always what makes someone great. They also have to make you feel what they’re singing while they’re hitting the notes. And she does that, and that’s a rare quality.”\n\n\tEven at the height of Scherzinger’s pop-star success, Warren glimpsed shades of Norma when the pair worked together on “Until U Love U” from the 2008 album “Doll Domination,” a song about the struggle for self-acceptance.\n\t\n\n\t“I look over, and she’s crying,” Warren says. “I go, ‘Nicole, why are you crying?’ She goes, ‘I don’t think I’m beautiful.’ I go, ‘Are you fucking kidding me?’ That was such a moment. Here’s somebody who is one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen in my entire life thinking that. That memory never left me.”\n\n\tBut the music industry can be particularly cruel to sexy women, their shelf life being brief. And by 2011, girl groups were passé. As Scherzinger’s achievements were met with a yawn, she would soon face rejection with two solo albums that failed to chart. Over the ensuing years, there were highs, like voicing the protagonist’s mother in Disney’s 2016 animated hit “Moana” and a West End starring role in “Cats.” But other work signaled journeyman status at best, like serving as a judge on “The Masked Singer.” Having experienced mega-success in her 20s, she never honed the necessary skills to handle failure.\n\n\t“When you’re so young, you don’t realize it at the time, but that time of growth is taken from you. I wonder about that with Britney Spears. That time was stripped from her. Is there a part of you that is stunted, and you’re not able to grow?” Scherzinger asks softly. “She’s definitely found herself in very co-dependent, needy relationships, and I have as well. And feeling desperate. I’ve felt that way in relationships as well.”\n\n\tThe romance wreckage included a 2015 breakup with Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, after eight years together, and a 2018 split from Bulgarian tennis star Grigor Dimitrov, whom she dated for three years.\n\n\tBut the professional and personal heartbreak primed her for something far more profound. As she and Lloyd brainstormed Norma over Zoom, she began to feel something special coalescing. \n\n\t“Now if people would like it, I had no idea,” she says with a laugh.\n\n\tFor many in the St. James audience on opening night, Scherzinger was nothing short of transcendent.\n\n\t“I almost lost a kidney. I was like, what the holy fuck is happening on that stage right now? It was intense. It was just beautiful. It was one of those times where the character and the actor merged at exactly the right moment in time,” says acting coach Leigh Kilton-Smith, who has worked with Sam Rockwell and Casey Affleck as well as Scherzinger off and on since the actress was 19. “It was almost a religious experience. Not to get too hyperbolic about it, but it was.”\n\n\tLloyd’s direction, with its provocative use of camera close-ups on her face and crazy blood-soaked ending, made Scherzinger’s performance all the more mesmerizing.\n\t\n\n\tLaverne Cox, who also was there opening night, felt that same presence of the divine as Scherzinger brought Andrew Lloyd Webber’s swelling “With One Look” and “As If We Never Said Goodbye” to life. Cox returned to the St. James altar two more times, and is brought to tears as she recalls a particular moment that occurred during an April performance. \n\n\t“I headed backstage to say hello to Nicole, and she’s in the corner with Glenn Close, and they’re huddled chatting for about 20 minutes,” she says. (Close was the original actress to tackle Norma on Broadway.) “And everyone is still, standing around, waiting. And it was such a beautiful moment seeing them together. It felt very intimate. Dame Glenn Close was sort of passing a torch.”\n\n\tScherzinger remembers that interaction vividly. “She said this was arguably one of the greatest roles ever written. And it really tests your mettle, as she knows. I was nervous, but then I mustered up the courage to ask her to sign my album. And guess what she wrote on it?” she says, pausing for effect. “‘To my soulmate. Love, Glenn.’” The self-described people-pleaser is beaming as she draws on the memory. “I couldn’t believe it. Like, how cool is that?”\n\n\tStill, Broadway can be unwelcoming. And Scherzinger’s outspoken faith makes her something of an outlier in an industry that balks at too much Jesus talk, especially when that talk becomes entwined with Trump messaging. She learned that when she commented on a Russell Brand Instagram post the day after the 2024 election in which the actor dons a red hat with the slogan “Make Jesus First Again.” Scherzinger replied, “Where do I get this hat?!” with prayer hands and red heart emojis. She deleted the comment and apologized for the unintended Trump association, noting: “Many of the marginalized communities feeling hurt and concerned by the results of the presidential election are people I care about most. I stand with them, as I always have throughout my life and career. If you know me, you know that.” But she isn’t sorry for the Jesus endorsement and notes that she’s not alone in her devotion.\n\n\t“I have a wonderful church that I go to in Hollywood. Most of my friends in Hollywood are Christians. I think Christianity does get a bad rap, but I think that’s why, if you’re a true Christian, you have to lead by example and be the light,” she says.\n\t\n\n\tMore than 400 “Sunset Blvd.” performances later, the Nicole Scherzinger resurrection is complete. The moment arrived around the same time a small wave of actresses long defined — and dismissed — as sex symbols earned raves for once-in-a-career roles: Demi Moore in “The Substance” and Pamela Anderson in “The Last Showgirl.”  For Scherzinger, the film offers are now rolling in: The CAA-repped actress is first tackling the Rebel Wilson-directed musical comedy “Girl Group” in London, followed by an indie movie that will shoot in New York. She also recently returned to the studio with Warren to record new material that Warren predicts “is gonna be epic.” \n\n\tOn the nesting front, she’s building a home in Hawaii that she will share with her fiancé, former Scottish rugby star Thom Evans, close to where her mother, father, Tutu and Papa all live. She and Evans met in 2019 and became engaged in 2023, a year before her Broadway debut. If there’s any downtime, the couple will curl up and watch Netflix’s “Love on the Spectrum,” her favorite show. Her new life is the culmination of a metamorphosis that has been both soul-crushing and cathartic.\n\n\t“You’re forced to shed old skins and say, ‘I can’t make an excuse anymore. I can’t be a victim anymore. I can’t be afraid anymore,’” she says. “It’s just liberating to take those chains off.”\n\n\t\n\t\tCharity Spotlight: Special Olympics\t\n\n\tOver her 15 years of work with the Special Olympics, Nicole Scherzinger has formed a close relationship with disability rights activist and film producer Timothy Shriver. The actress got involved with the organization to advocate for people like her 46-year-old aunt with Down syndrome. Shriver framed her aunt’s condition in a way that made sense to Scherzinger.\n\n\t“Tim wouldn’t call it ‘disability.’ He would call it ‘super abilities,’” she says. “People who are special needs are superheroes because they don’t have the cynicism that we have. They see the world in a different, more beautiful way that hopefully would rub off on us to be able to see the world with more hope.”\n\n\tThe Special Olympics was founded in 1968 by Shriver’s mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, with the mission of transforming the lives of the millions of people with intellectual disabilities “both on and off the playing field.” In 2013, Scherzinger was named an ambassador. In that role, she has held court at the White House with President Obama and performed the national anthem at the A Capitol Fourth concert in 2015. She also hit those same iconic notes at the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics World Summer Games in Los Angeles that same year and co-wrote and performed the song “Victorious” with close friend Jonas Myrin for the closing ceremony of the 2019 Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\tThe organization enjoys support from the likes of Chris Pratt, Charles Melton and Shriver’s sister, Maria. But Scherzinger would like to see so much more. “Hollywood is all about inclusivity. So my pitch would be ‘You’re fucking missing out if you’re not on this train,’” Scherzinger says. “They help us get back to the simplicity, the honesty. The world would be a better place if we just spoke like this to one another — just direct and in a loving way.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tStyling: Michael Philouze; Hair: Dimitris Giannetos/Opus Beauty; Makeup: Rokael/OPUS Beauty/Rokael Beauty; Fashion Credits: Dress: Vintage Gucci/Paume Los Angeles; Shoes: Christian Louboutin; Jewelry: Marli New York\t\n",

However, the series still saw a 17% decrease from the viewership it achieved with its Season 1 premiere last year, which debuted with 10.3 million views in the same amount of time.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Chad Powers” episode 6, titled “6th Quarter,” now streaming on Hulu.\n\n\tGlen Powell and Michael Waldron’s journey to create the college football comedy “Chad Powers” — about a disgraced former star quarterback who hatches an insane plan to get a second chance on the gridiron — started like all great Hollywood bromances.\n\n\t“On Raya,” Powell deadpans, breaking in as series co-creator Waldron begins to tell the story of how he first met the actor. (OK, they didn’t actually swipe right on the dating app, but Powell and Waldron’s first bro-date was indeed virtual.)\n\t\n\n\tIn 2021, their agents at CAA set up a general meeting over Zoom, much like this conversation with Variety. At the time, Waldron — who created Marvel’s “Loki” and the wrestling drama “Heels,” and is an alum of the Emmy-winning animated series “Rick and Morty” — was in London working on “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.” Meanwhile, Powell was about to break into the big leagues with a standout performance in “Top Gun: Maverick.” But even their reps couldn’t have predicted the two would have such natural chemistry.\n\n\tPowell and Waldron clicked over their taste in movies; “Armageddon” was the first title they discussed, and the disaster flick gets a major reference in the “Chad Powers” pilot. The duo also bonded over being Southern guys turned L.A. transplants who “live and die” by their favorite college football programs. Waldron is an alum of the University of Georgia and a massive Bulldogs fan, while Powell is working his way toward a degree at the University of Texas and is a fixture on the Longhorns’ sideline next to Matthew McConaughey.\n\t\n\n\t“From the moment that Waldron and I met, it was like the best first date of all time, where you sit there and you’re like, ‘I could spend all day with this dude,’” Powell recalls. “It’s a really rare thing in Hollywood to find someone who is playing at the level that [Waldron] is, and a genuine college football fan who sees the blind spots in terms of sports stories.”\n\n\tThere were no concrete plans to work together, but the two stayed in touch. “We always knew if the right thing came along, we’d want to jump on it,” Waldron adds.\n\n\tFirst down came when CAA flagged that Omaha Productions, the company led by NFL Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, was interested in adapting a sketch from the show “Eli’s Places” into a larger project. Of course, Powell and Waldron were already familiar with the viral clip — where Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning goes undercover at walk-on tryouts for the Penn State football team disguised as a quirky, yet supremely talented rookie named Chad Powers.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeyton Manning, Glen Powell and Michael Waldron at the “Chad Powers” premiere, held at the Rose Bowl.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I don’t think anybody else in the agency raised their hands, and both of our eyes lit up,” Powell says, his peepers widening for dramatic effect. “I called Michael, and we just riffed on it.”\n\n\tThe ideas bounced back and forth on that phoner ultimately became the bones of the show.\n\n\t“Give Glen all the credit, because in our first conversation, I was like, ‘Well, you couldn’t actually do “Mrs. Doubtfire.”’ Waldron says. “Like, you couldn’t do a show where the guy puts a mask on. And Glen just said, ‘Yeah. But what if you did?’ I was like, ‘Oh, he’s insane. And that is the show.’ Because it’s such an impossible thing to pull off, [but] what if you did actually try to?!”\n\n\tIndeed, the premise of “Chad Powers” is far-out. But it’s so offbeat that there’s room to get creative with the play calls.\n\n\tThe pilot opens with Powell’s character, arrogant college quarterback Russ Holliday, leading his Oregon Ducks team in the National Championship game against Georgia at the Rose Bowl. Just when it seems like Holliday’s miraculous play will win the game, he makes a devastating mistake and drops the ball before crossing the goal line — giving Georgia the win. Then, Holliday makes matters worse by getting into a fight with a fan on the sidelines. Eight years later, the disgraced quarterback hatches a plan to reclaim his former glory by donning a prosthetic mask, mustache and wig to try out for a struggling football team, the fictional South Georgia Catfish, under a new, less-toxic identity: “Chad Powers.”\n\t\n\n\tAs “Chad,” Holliday lands a spot on the Catfish team. But his ruse isn’t easy to pull off: In the cold open of the second episode, a fly creeps inside Chad’s prosthetic face and he panics, trying claw the insect out. It’s the type of hyper-specific and slightly deranged humor that makes “Chad Powers” stand out from your typical sports comedy. \n\n\tBut it also works as a metaphor for the series itself, with pathos layered underneath the surface of the macho premise — if you’re willing to scratch a little deeper.\n\n\t“We got really excited as we explored the idea of a broken guy who had been a jerk and had made a mistake and became a pariah — which I think happens over and over again in this modern, very online age — [and] if, by wearing a mask and playing a better person, that he could accidentally become a good guy,” Waldron says of the profundity they discovered in the zany plot.\n\n\t“I’m always drawn to these stories about identity and people wrestling with who they are versus who they want to be,” Waldron continues. “And the fact that we could tell a story with this much depth, and in such a funny way, is only possible because Glen was like, ‘Let me take such a crazy leap with this performance.’”\n\n\tPowell accepts the compliment, admitting that he was “terrified” to dive into the performance for a variety of reasons. “But like all great things, it was a bit of a Hail Mary pass,” he says. “Every character in this show is at a point in their life where they’re willing to throw a Hail Mary pass. Waldron and I were willing to throw that pass, too.”\n\n\tThe duo co-wrote the pilot episode of “Chad Powers,” first texting back and forth while they worked on their other blockbuster projects to build the protagonist’s character arc. That included building Chad’s relationships to his new coaches and teammates (Steve Zahn, Quentin Plair and Clayne Crawford), his unlikely love interest Coach Ricky (Perry Mattfeld), his father (Toby Huss) and his lone accomplice, the Deuxmoi-obsessed team mascot (Frankie A. Rodriguez). \n\n\tAs the two pop culture junkies riffed, inspirations like “Armageddon,” “Bull Durham,” “Mrs. Doubtfire” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “2 Fast 2 Furious” and “Mulan” all ended up weaving their way into the fabric of “Chad Powers.”\n\t\n\n\t“It’s so nice to have a collaborative partner that you just are in awe of their brain and what they bring to the table,” Powell says. “And it’s not just a cheap joke; it’s a joke that’s rooted in reality. The one buy-in you get from the show is a man wearing a mask. Everything else has to feel grounded in real scenarios and real stakes, and that’s what we were navigating at every turn. The announcers, the stadiums, the way people move through that world and the way coordinators talk to each other has to be bulletproof, so you buy into everything around this wild conceit.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGlen Powell and Michael Waldron on the set of “Chad Powers.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn keeping with the authenticity, the Catfish team opponents are real college football squads: the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) Rebels (Eli Manning’s alma mater; Manning also makes a cameo on the sidelines), the University of Tennessee Volunteers (Peyton Manning’s college team) and the Georgia Bulldogs. The Dawgs loomed large over “Chad Powers’” six-episode stretch — which was somewhat of a meta experience for the duo, since Georgia and Texas were major rivals during the 2024-25 season, too. In fact, Waldron’s Bulldogs beat Powell’s beloved Longhorns twice. (“What is this? A fucking ambush?” Powell cries, feigning dismay when I mention how life imitated art.)\n\n\tThe “Chad Powers” team shot the season finale during halftime of a sold-out game in Athens, Ga., last October and asked the 92,000-strong crowd to boo Powell as the Catfish run onto the field to face their in-state rival at Sanford Stadium.\n\n\t“Not to say that they wouldn’t have booed me anyway, but we did ask them to boo,” Powell clarifies, laughing. “We had done rehearsals, knowing that the stadium was going to be really loud,” he continues, remembering how it felt to hear the roaring crowd. “But when I went out there, to literally have an entire stadium booing you, I got off the field and I told Waldron, ‘I don’t know if I’ve ever been so ready to run through a wall in my life. Like, that was crazy!’”\n\n\tThat electricity was exactly what Powell and Waldron aimed to capture, and the experience mimicked how Powell felt working on “Top Gun: Maverick,” which filmed aboard active aircraft carriers.\n\t\n\n\t“That’s why ‘Top Gun’ feels authentic,” he explains. “We didn’t want this show to just be a half-hour football comedy. We wanted this thing to have scope and scale and the energy of college football, which is easier said than done.”\n\n\tIt was a tricky shot to begin with, given the charged atmosphere, and the Atlanta-based crew had just six minutes to shoot the sequence on the field.\n\n\t“This was my directorial debut, and I thought, ‘Well, let’s make it easy,” Waldron cracks. “It’s the season finale, and we wanted to end it with a bang. We had the opportunity to do it, and by that point, I believed in my team of like-minded psychopaths to pull it off.”\n\n\tIn order to make it work, Waldron and his crew — including director of photography Mark Schwartzbard and first A.D. Kris Krengel — were disguised as coaches on the sideline. The team utilized a flag system to communicate amid the crowd noise.\n\n\t“We basically had two bites of the apple, and our steadicam op [Joseph B. Hernandez] is going to get this great orbiting shot of Glen and Perry,” Waldron explains. “And at the last minute, I [told Perry,] ‘You know what’d be really cool is if you tossed him the ball.’ So suddenly, the degree of difficulty for Perry and Glen gets 5,000 times harder.”\n\n\tThankfully, Powell and Mattfeld are pros, nailing the pitch and catch on both takes.\n\n\t“I don’t know if I’ll ever have a better day in my career,” Waldron says, sounding equal parts relieved and proud. “But that represents the entire experience of filming the show. Everybody pulling together to do something that should be impossible but turns out to be so much fun and really beautiful.”\n\n\tThe series’ six-episode run ends with plenty more of Chad’s story to tell — Will the underdog Fish beat the big Dawgs? Will Chad’s identity stay secret now that Coach Ricky knows the truth, too? Will Danny ever be featured on Deuxmoi? Powell and Waldron have ideas for a second season when Hulu officially renews the show.\n\n\t“It’s a make-or-break thing for me that the University of Texas be included,” Powell says. “I told Waldron, ‘If I have to support the UGA football program and not the University of Texas one more time, I’m gonna break.”\n\t\n\n\tWaldron chimes in: “On my Season 2 whiteboard, on one of the episode blocks, I just have ‘Texas’ written.”\n\n\tUntil then,  the pair seem quite satisfied with what they made of this massive opportunity.\n\n\t“The reason I do this is because I couldn’t play,” Waldron says, something he realized while filming. “That was such a career highlight, and to get to do it with a friend at the top of his game, who loves this stuff as much as I do, it’s a dream. I mean, this is the dream job of all dream jobs.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGlen Powell in “Chad Powers.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n",

Your turn is coming! 🥰\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    Fans took this as Luiz alluding to the lovebirds possibly becoming a family of 3 soon, and they were right.Reps for the couple could not be reached for comment.\n\n          Alba, who is Portuguese, first met Chris in Europe and, according to People, friends called it \"love at first sight.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported back in May, Chris put his Hollywood Hills mansion on the market for $7 million. A source told us he was ditching the beautiful pad to move closer to family back east.\n      \n    \n          Now, that fam's expanded ... congrats to the happy couple!\n      \n      ",

Well, it can be yours!\n      \n    \n          The seller, Daniel Shoneye, tells TMZ, the piece of 2007 history is going up for auction. He has listed the vest with Julien's auction with a starting bid of $250, but don't expect it to stay that low-priced for long. Daniel told us despite the auction house's estimate of $1k-$2k he's expecting it to go in the $15k-$20k range.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to Daniel, the jacket is a one-of-a-kind hand-sewn vest with rabbit fur that \"cannot be replicated\" and was custom-made via Ivan Kane Enterprises.\n      \n\n          According to Daniel, it originally came from a Burlesque show and was also worn by Pamela Anderson. He's had it for over 15 years, and also has Britney's shirt from her \"Oops I Did It Again\" music video in his possession ... along with her \"Crazy\" vid waitress outfit.\n      \n    \n          Those 2 items are not for sale, though.\n      \n    \n          The vest is from a pivotal time in Britney's career. In her memoir, \"The Woman In Me,\" she says the video was basically done on a whim.\n      \n    \n          She wrote, \"I started doing videos on the street myself. I would go into bars with a friend, and the friend would just bring a camera, that's how we shot 'Gimme More.'\"\n      \n    \n          The live auction is going down December 3rd at the Peninsula Beverly Hills and online.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Britney Spears\n              \n                          \n                Pamela Anderson\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                Fashion\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

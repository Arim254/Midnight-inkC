He pleaded not guilty. Ashley, 37, was found dead in their Ohio home in the 900 block of Cunningham Court in Tipp City, early on the morning of Monday, Feb. 16, according to local outlets. Caleb called 911 around 2:30 a.m. and said that someone had broken into their home and shot Ashley, who was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the Dayton Daily News, Caleb told police that he didn’t see anybody in his home, but his garage door was open. Police reportedly found a side door to the garage that was open and that there was fridge was in front of the door that would’ve needed to be pushed to open it. Caleb was booked into the Miami County Jail on Thursday.\n\n\n\t“The Tipp City Police Department appreciates the community’s patience and support while this collaborative investigative team worked diligently on this complex case. We also extend our sincere appreciation to the many agencies that have assisted — and continue to assist — in this investigation involving a tragic loss of life,” Tipp City Police Chief Greg Adkins said Thursday.\n\n\tIn 2013, Caleb said in his “Road to Hollywood” interview on “American Idol” that he was a music pastor and that his wife encouraged him to audition for the singing competition show. “I absolutely love the lord and I love my wife more than anything,” he said in his interview. “She is very, very pretty. I love her. I’m just a normal person who absolutely loves to sing more than anything in the world.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tSir Elton John didn’t just write the music for “The Devil Wears Prada” — he popped in at the Broadway Across America’s Biennial Theatrical Conference to sell it himself.\n\n\tThe closed-to-press gathering, held Feb. 9-11 at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, gives producers, presenters and booking agents from across North America an early look at shows bound for Broadway and the road. About 250 attendees made the trip, with director Jon M. Chu delivering the opening keynote.\n\t\n\n\tJohn Legend was also on hand to showcase “Imitation of Life,” for which he composed the score (book by Lynn Nottage), and original members of TLC turned out for “CrazySexyCool.” Other projects in the mix included Sara Bareilles’s new musical “The Interestings,” Gloria and Emily Estefan’s “Basura,” “10 Things I Hate About You” (score by Carly Rae Jepsen and Ethan Gruska), “Crazy Rich Asians” (directed by Chu) and “Practical Magic,” scored by Norah Jones, among others.\n\n\n\t“At its heart, theater has always been about people coming together in the same room,” said John Gore, CEO of The John Gore Organization. “When producers, presenters, and artists meet face to face — trading ideas, strengthening relationships, sparking new connections — we’re living out the very thing that makes live performance so powerful and impossible to replicate.”\n\n\tLauren Reid, president of BAA, struck a similarly optimistic note. “This conference always offers a glimpse at the future of Broadway, and as anyone in attendance this year can attest, the future is bright,” she said. “The generosity and collaborative spirit I witnessed left me tremendously excited about what’s ahead for our industry.”\n\t\n\n\tDirectors Michael Arden, Liesl Tommy, Michael Greif and Christopher Ashley were among the creative contingent in attendance, alongside Robert Wankel, chairman and CEO of the Shubert Organization; Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization; Nicole Kastrinos, producer at Lincoln Center Theatre and Lori Hotz, North American CEO of ATG.\n\n\tThe conference has a track record of attracting big names — past editions have drawn the likes of Alicia Keys for “Hells Kitchen”, members of the Goo Goo Dolls and the Avett Brothers, among others.\n\n\tVariety has exclusive photos from the conference, taken by photographer Sergio Villarini.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSergio Villarini\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSergio Villarini\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSergio Villarini\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSergio Villarini\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSergio Villarini\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSergio Villarini\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe definitive biography of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr’s mythologized relationship is back on bestseller lists following FX’s new series “Love Story.” The Ryan Murphy-produced show, which premiered last week, is inspired by the Elizabeth Beller book, which came out in 2024. \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNO. 1 BESTSELLER\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOnce Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe book traces Bessette’s life from her upbringing in New York and Connecticut to her early ambitions: she graduated from Boston University in 1988 and worked her way up at Calvin Klein, from retail associate to executive in VIP sales and publicity. To build this portrait, Beller interviewed a wide range of individuals who knew Bessette before she entered the Kennedy limelight — including family members, childhood friends, roommates, teachers and professional colleagues. The book also weaves in perspectives from people who witnessed her relationship with JFK Jr. and contextualizes how that partnership reshaped her life.\n\n\n\tA major theme of the biography, like the inspired series, is how relentless media scrutiny affected Bessette. Once she began dating Kennedy — a man perceived by many as “America’s prince” — paparazzi and tabloids pounced. Beller details how the press often mischaracterized her as aloof, cold, or superficial, and in some cases even blamed her for personal tragedies.\n\n\tTo illustrate her humanity, the biography includes intimate stories that humanize Bessette: friends recall her infectious laugh, her quick wit, and her capacity for real warmth long before the spotlight found her. There are recollections of early work life in fashion, moments with friends and family, and reflections on how her love with JFK Jr. evolved in private even as it became a media spectacle.\n\n\n\tStream “Love Story” on Hulu below, and purchase the book on which it’s inspired here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMia Challis has joined the CBS multi-cam comedy pilot “Regency,” Variety has learned. \n\n\tChallis joins previously announced cast member Rhys Darby in the pilot, which originally ordered back in December. The official logline describes it as “a historical spin on the classic multi-cam family sitcom, centered around the upper-middle class Tillbrooks as they navigate life, love, and scandal in 19th Century England.”\n\n\n\tChallis will play Wilhelmina Tillbrook, who is said to be “the Tillbrook’s youngest daughter. Wilhelmina is endearing but awkward. Stubbornly innocent and often misunderstood, Wilhelmina would rather climb trees than attend tea parties.” \n\t\n\n\tChallis is best known for her stint on the popular Netflix series “Outer Banks,” playing the role of Ruthie. She has also appeared on shows like “FBI: International” and “Clickbait,” while her film credits include “Diabolic” and “The Disinvited.”\n\n\tShe is repped by 42, Stewart Talent, and Moore Creative Artists in Australia. \n\n\tTara Hernandez is the writer and executive producer behind “Regency.” Warner Bros. Television is the studio.\n\n\t“Regency” is currently one of just two pilots that CBS has in contention for next season. The other is the vampire comedy “Eternally Yours,” which hails from “Ghosts” co-showrunners Joe Port and Joe Wiseman. The broadcaster has already given out series order for the 2026-2027 season, however. Already on deck is the legal drama “Cupertino” from Robert and Michelle King, as well as “Einstein” starring “Criminal Minds” alum Matthew Gray Gubler. CBS has also already renewed 10 shows for next season, including “Elsbeth” and “Georgie and Mandy’s First Marriage.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tLiza Minnelli lashes out at the Oscars in her new memoir, “Kids, Wait Till You Hear This!” The “Cabaret” icon presented the Academy Award for best picture alongside Lady Gaga at the 2022 Oscars, but Minnelli appeared somewhat disoriented on stage and stumbled over her words. Gaga notably comforted Minnelli in the moment by telling her, “I got you.” \n\n\tMinnelli was in a wheelchair at the time, which she alleges in her book was mandated by the Academy. She had expected to be seated in a director’s chair where she could more easily see the teleprompter but plans changed at the last minute. The Academy reportedly pivoted to a wheelchair to prioritize Minnelli’s safety.\n\t\n\n\t“I was inexplicably ordered — not even asked — to sit in a wheelchair or not appear at all,” Minnelli writes. “I was told it was because of my age, and for safety reasons, because I might slip out of the director’s chair, which was bullshit. I will not be treated this way, I said. I was heartbroken. I was much lower down than I would have been in the director’s chair. Now I couldn’t easily read the teleprompter above me.”\n\n\n\t“How would you feel if you were wheeled out, against your will, to perform in front of a live audience, and unable to see clearly?” Minelli continues. “So when I stumbled over a few words, Gaga, who was at my side, didn’t miss a beat to play the kindhearted hero for all the world to see. ‘I got you,’ she said, leaning down over me.”\n\n\tVariety has reached out to representatives for the Academy for comment.\n\n\tMinnelli notes in her memoir that Gaga came to her dressing room when she heard about Minnelli’s distress over being put in a wheelchair. Gaga asked, “Are you okay?”\n\t\n\n\t“I looked at her and said simply, ‘I’m a big fan,'” Minnelli writes. “I learned this lesson years ago from Mama and Papa. At a moment of high stress, you stay gracious. The winner for best picture that year was ‘CODA.’ I loved the irony of the title for me. Writing my memoir would be my coda, my truth. There’s always a rainbow — if you know where to look for it.”\n\n\tMinnelli’s “Kids, Wait Till You Hear This!” publishes on March 10.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile Anna Sawai has been busy conquering TV and film, the Emmy-winning “Shōgun” star first got her start in show business as a member of the J-pop band FAKY. Now, Sawai is going back to her musical roots in the role of Yoko Ono in Sam Mendes’ forthcoming “Beatles” biopics. \n\n\t“It was my dream to tell her story and I didn’t think it would come this quick,” Sawai told Variety at the Los Angeles premiere of Apple TV’s “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” Season 2 on Thursday night. “There’s a version of her I feel people still don’t understand. And in this film, I think we’re going to be able to tell that side of the story.” \n\t\n\n\tTo prepare, Sawai has been busy reading everything she can about the artist and musician. “So much reading, oh my gosh,” she said. “So many books, so many videos, so many articles…She has so much artwork that also shows her personality.” \n\n\n\tWhile on set in London, Sawai teases it’s been fun to hear the cast — Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Harris Dickinson as John Lennon, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison and Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr — play the iconic band’s music. “They’re not even looking at the sheet music anymore. They can just play it off and sing it, and it really sounds like the Beatles to me. It feels surreal.” \n\n\tThe four biopics will release simultaneously in theaters on April 7, 2028. \n\n\tIn the meantime, audiences can catch Sawai as Cate Randa in “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” Season 2, which premieres on Apple TV on Feb. 27. While Season 1 followed two siblings as they uncovered their family’s connection to Monarch, a secret organization dedicated to monitoring monsters, the second season picks up as the fate of the organization hangs in the balance: a new titan has arisen from the sea, endangering the world. \n\t\n\n\tSawai teases that fans will get to see Cate “find her new purpose and find meaning in the family legacy.” “Instead of running away, she’s going to start chasing,” she said. \n\n\tAs for what she’s most excited about, the answer is straightforward: the new monsters. “They have their own story,” said Sawai. “We’ve been able to relate with the human story, but I think maybe some people might actually relate to the monster story.” \n\n\t“Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” Season 2 also includes cast members Kiersey Clemons, Mari Yamamoto, Joe Tippett, Ren Watabe, Kurt Russell, Wyatt Russell, Anders Holm, Takehiro Hira and new addition Curtiss Cook. \n\n\tSee more photos from the “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” Season 2 premiere below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKurt Russell and Wyatt Russell \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmber Midthunder and Tory Tunnell \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnna Sawai, Kiersey Clemons and Mari Yamamoto \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKurt Russell, Lawrence Trilling and Joe Tippett \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat does it take to drain a person of their humanity? According to Iwasaki Yusuke, a convenience store uniform and a morning meeting ritual will do it. That unsettling observation is the foundation of “AnyMart,” his Berlinale Forum debut feature — and one that carries the weight of personal experience. Iwasaki watched it happen to his own father, a lively town liquor store owner who became, in his son’s telling, “inorganic and lacking humanity” after taking over a convenience store.\n\t\n\n\tSometani Shota stars as Sakai, a convenience store clerk who clocks in, recites the employee pledges, restocks the shelves, and feels nothing — until new recruit Ogawa (Erika Karata) arrives as one of several anomalies that send the store’s standardized operations spiraling toward bloody ends. \n\n\n\tFusing Aki Kaurismäki-esque deadpan with Kurosawa Kiyoshi-inflected slow-burn horror, the film follows Iwasaki’s short “Void,” which played International Film Festival Rotterdam’s Tiger Competition in 2024 and featured in anthology chiller “NN4444,” the first title from Nothing New — the fledgling company led by producer Hayashi Kentaro that executive produced “AnyMart” and handles international sales beginning at EFM. Nishimura Masahiko also stars; Tohokushinska Film Corporation produces.\n\n\tVariety spoke with Iwasaki ahead of the world premiere:\n\n\tThis film has a remarkable acuity in how it captures the absurdity of working retail — in the alternatingly cramped and empty spaces the workers occupy; the ritualistic tasks they’re forced to complete; and the rules and regulations they must rigidly follow. Are you drawing from personal experience of working retail?\n\t\n\n\tIwasaki Yusuke: My father was a convenience store owner, so convenience stores were both very familiar to me and at the same time rather suspicious. When I visited his workplace in my childhood, there would be many adults following strict rules. While they would talk to me normally, by wearing uniforms and going through these rituals of morning meetings, any kind of person would have their individuality stripped away and become part of the store. I found that interesting. My father was no exception to this rule. He had originally been a lively, friendly town liquor store owner, but after starting the convenience store, I felt he transformed into something somewhat inorganic and lacking humanity – although not to the extent of the store owner in this film. Witnessing that transformation was a formative experience for me, so I decided to create a work with a convenience store as the central motif. By the way, if I were to work part-time in retail, I would probably go crazy in two or three days, unable to endure the strict rules.\n\n\tConvenience stores exist everywhere as if replicated; they’re always open; and they operate normally at any time. That’s peculiar, and I think there’s a creepiness to it that’s unique to Japan. Above all, the contrast between the information overload and brightness inside the store and the extreme lack of human heart within it was striking to me. Employees and customers exchange many words, but none of them bring out emotions – these are inorganic exchanges. Both those who come to shop and those who work there have stopped being human.\n\n\tWere you looking to speak to a universal experience of working in retail spaces with this film, or were you looking to speak specifically to the experience of existing within a convenience store?\n\n\tSince my father ran a convenience store, I did want to specifically make it a convenience store story. There’s another episode I experienced, as a consumer. One day, while busy with work, I entered a convenience store without thinking to grab a light meal, picked up a chicken salad, and felt horror at myself mindlessly devouring it with an expressionless face. I didn’t actually want to eat chicken salad. I picked it up thoughtlessly because it was there, because it was efficient. I became anxious that I might be more dominated by efficiency, convenience, and systems than I thought, and I decided to make a film about this lack of feeling alive.\n\t\n\n\tAt the heart of this film is a push and pull between the individual and the collective; what is morally right and what is deemed socially ‘correct’. In this sense, the film and its setting are a distinctly Japanese microcosm. Tell me about mapping these ideas to this setting and these characters.\n\n\tLiving according to social rules and systems is easy, but it’s an endless living hell. If the owner of the store is the embodiment of the system, having mostly killed his emotions, then at the opposite end is Ogawa, who lives by morality and her own sense of righteousness. However, deviants like Ogawa, the Quiche shop owner, and the cross-dressing man who visits the store are not respected in modern Japan – they either conform to the system or perish. It’s very painful, but it’s a fact, so I made their fates in the film reflect that.\n\n\tAnd the protagonist Sakai (“Sakai” means “boundary”) is an example of neither of these positions – he simply exists. Rather than struggling between the two positions, he is simply an observing lump of meat, i.e. a chilled chicken salad. I think most modern Japanese people are like Sakai, including myself.\n\n\tSometani Shota is well-known for his trademark dispassionate and vacant facial expression — he has a distinctive face, and he suits this film well. This starts out as a fairly archetypal performance from him, but you allow him to grow it into something much more emotionally rich and nuanced. Did you consider other actors for the role of Sakai, or was it always going to be Sometani?\n\n\tI’ve loved Sometani as an actor for a long time, and he was the first person who came to mind. Sakai is a difficult role. Rather than being a protagonist, he’s an observer. He rarely takes action, and must express emotions only through subtle facial expressions. The eloquence of his expressions, his nihilistic appearance, and explosive emotional power – I’m convinced that no one but Sometani could have played Sakai.\n\n\tThe film’s tricky tonal balance is striking, shifting from a satirical comedy to psychological horror with weight and impact to it. Could you elaborate on that balance, and on your use of quick cuts to disturbing imagery?\n\n\tAt first, I intended to make a more consistent, evil horror film. However, I wanted to depict the reality of the convenience store situation more vividly, and I wanted to depict Sakai’s inner self in more detail. As a result, comedic scenes naturally increased, and it transformed the film into a unique fusion where laughter and fear exist in close proximity. The disturbing images that increase in the second half of the film represent the blurring of the boundary between life and death. There are many remnants of the horror development I had originally conceived, and I kept them because they were interesting. It was originally supposed to be a story with more ghosts and such, but the real-world system the film presents was horror enough.\n\t\n\n\tSound design was evidently a clear focus of yours with this film.\n\n\tSince the boundary between where you should laugh and where you should feel fear is ambiguous in this work, the sound design had an important role in clarifying that. Since it’s not a typical horror film story, I incorporated a dark digital ambience that you don’t usually hear in films. Pas Tasta, who handled the score, are an amazing music group comprised of people with various musical backgrounds. I definitely want people to listen to them.\n\n\tDoes your day-to-day life on set sometimes sink into similar patterns to the workplace patterns of the film, or is filmmaking a workspace where you feel you can escape from that monotonous drudgery?\n\n\tIn my regular work as a director of commercials, I only accept projects that are interesting and exciting, precisely to avoid falling into such routines. For now, it’s stimulating and fun, but when I’m writing storyboards at night, there are certainly moments when the thought “Wait, does this continue infinitely!?” suddenly crosses my mind. But filmmaking is more stimulating and more difficult than other work – it’s a precious thing that pulls me up from such complacency. It is really difficult though [laughs].\n\n\tWhat filmmakers inspire your approach and style? I thought of Kurosawa Kiyoshi and Hong Sang-soo, equally some American television dark comedies.\n\n\tI absolutely love Kurosawa Kiyoshi, and I’ve been greatly influenced by him. The conversation scenes inside the store may have been influenced by Aki Kaurismäki. I’ve recently gotten into Hong Sang-soo, and he’s become a director that I love.\n\n\tYou’re a first-time feature filmmaker. What was your pathway into filmmaking?\n\n\tAround the time that I had solidified my style as a TV commercial director and became able to choose my work, I was approached by my old friend Hayashi Kentaro, the representative of Nothing New. I’m a person like Sakai who can’t do anything on my own, so thanks to his enthusiastic invitation, I was able to tackle filmmaking. I rewrote the plot two or three times due to budget and content interest. With the keyword “convenience store” as a prompt, “AnyMart” was born fairly quickly, and we started moving toward production.\n\n\tWhat goals do you have as you move forward in your career? Are you working on any further projects currently?\n\t\n\n\tAs a director of commercials, I have a strong desire first and foremost to make Japan’s empty advertising industry more interesting. I came into this industry longing for the interesting and stylish ads of the 1980s. In regards to feature films, I have a feature horror film in the planning stage. Since “AnyMart” turned out to be a comedy-like work, I’m aiming this time to make a truly scary horror that makes your hair stand on end.\n\n\tIn one scene, a character says that “you’ve got to do what you love as your job, because we all die someday.” Are you fulfilling that sentiment for yourself by filmmaking? Is this what you love most?\n\n\tIn advertising production, I certainly feel that way. What I create is important to me, but what I love most is collaborating happily with beloved colleagues and talent, and I can currently achieve that in my position as a director of commercials. In filmmaking however, there are many painful and difficult things, mainly in the scriptwriting stage, and I still feel like a baby. I hope I can enjoy filmmaking going forward with the same fun and lightness as I do advertising production.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor four decades, Jesse Malin was the music mayor of New York’s East Village. Beginning in the early ‘80s with his teenaged hardcore band Heart Attack through his years with the rock band D-Generation, his solo career and his Coney Island High nightclub, he was never a superstar but was a well-known, well-connected and tireless booster for the city’s rock scene.\n\n\tAll that changed in 2023, when — at a party he’d organized as a memorial to his longtime friend and bandmate, Howie Pyro — he was suddenly felled by a rare spinal stroke that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Months of recovery, rehabilitation and depression ensued, but his friends rallied — a tribute album and concert last year featured Bruce Springsteen, Lucinda Williams, Bleachers, Billie Joe Amstrong, and Elvis Costello, among others — and in recent months, he’s returned to performing and has even recovered at least some ability to walk.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s certainly not your average storyline for an Off-Broadway show, but remarkably, “Silver Manhattan” succeeds on virtually every level: It’s not a conventional musical, but more of a live memoir punctuated with songs from all across Malin’s career — a kind of East Village, punk rock version of “Springsteen on Broadway,” but with a tragic setback that gives the story its triumphant arc of resiliency, against the backdrop of the city and the scene he loves so much.\n\n\n\tWisely, the show, which opened at the 100-seat Bowery Palace this week after workshopping at the Gramercy Theatre, is not a full autobiography — it moves back and forth between his childhood in Queens and his coming of age on the New York hardcore scene, and his stroke and long recovery; the intervening 40 years are glossed over quickly. Malin’s cowriter Lauren Ludwig and director Ellie Heyman clearly saw the core of his story lay in those two eras: one of which balances his childhood, his parents’ divorce and his mother’s death from cancer with the youthful exuberance of his early years as a musician; and the other his horror and depression following his stroke, the difficulty of his recovery and search for a cure, and ultimately the return of his spirit and strength. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s not an easy story to tell without self-pity or over-sentimentality, but Malin pulls it off, in an endearing, New Yawk-accented speaking and singing voice that bears such a strong Iggy Pop influence that it’s probably part of his DNA. He sets up the tragedy of his situation by recounting in detail his busy last normal day, finishing with the statement, “I love walking in New York”; he later points up the uniqueness of his comeback by saying, “One thing I’ve never seen is someone fronting a rock band in a wheelchair.”\n\n\tThe key moments of the show are punctuated with his songs — one of which he actually wrote as a 13-year-old — as well as a cover of the Rolling Stones’ “Sway” (“Did you ever wake up to find/ A day that broke up your mind/ Destroyed your notion of circular time” — yes, he did). Malin’s ace five-piece band is on point throughout the entire show, with each member doing brief double-duty as characters in the narrative.\n\n\tWe won’t spoil the show’s beginning — which has a very imaginative answer to the obvious question of how the disabled Malin will get to the stage of the densely packed theater — but we will spoil the ending: After spending nearly the entire almost-two-hour performance in a wheelchair, Malin braces himself with a microphone stand and lifts himself slowly to his feet, then moves to a walker and crosses the stage, walks upstairs and finishes the show from the rear of the theater. \n\n\tIt’s a sobering but triumphant moment that shows not only how challenging his recovery has been, but also inspires empathy and a cautious gratitude: It’s hard not to imagine suddenly no longer being able to do something you’ve likely done every day since your first birthday, something that’s vital yet probably also taken for granted.\n\n\tIt also makes you wonder if, in similar circumstances, you’d have the courage, strength and confidence to return to your former life as much as humanly possible — and “Silver Manhattan,” not to mention the vinyl and merch for sale at the back of the room (and the memoir due in April), illustrate vividly just how active Malin’s career is, despite the devastating setback, and embody the line from the show that summarizes its theme: “Survival is a creative act.”\n\t\n\n\t“Silver Manhattan” will play five nights a week beginning February 18 through March 29, 2026 at the Bowery Palace in New York City with an opening set for Wednesday, March 4.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFans tuning in to Hilary Duff’s new album “Luck… or Something” quickly speculated that the track “We Don’t Talk” was about her strained relationship with her sister Haylie. Duff confirmed that the song is indeed about their estrangement, stating that it’s “the most lonely part of my existence.”\n\n\t“It’s definitely about my sister, and just absolutely the most lonely part of my existence is not having my sister in my life at the moment,” she said during an interview with CBS Mornings’ Anthony Mason. “And really struggled with thinking about including that on the record. But it’s funny, as a person that exists in the world without my other half, so many people are having that experience and a lot of conversations with people are like, yeah, me too.”\n\t\n\n\tOn “We Don’t Talk,” Duff sings about how she’s “not sure when it happened” or “what it was about,” referring to their rift. “If it’s ’cause you’re jealous, God knows I would sell it all then break you off the bigger half,” sings Duff of Haylie, who also has had a career as a musician.\n\n\n\tDuff looked visibly upset as she discussed her sister and explained why she decided to include the song on the album. “I think because it’s my truth and like I said, so many people are having this experience,” she said. “It’s hard because I am me and people know everything about my life since I was a child, and I didn’t necessarily choose that part, but it’s my reality and so it was honestly healing to say. It’s hard to watch your life unfold on the internet sometimes with talking heads on TikTok speculating this, that and the other. Sometimes they’re wrong and sometimes they’re right and all of that is just a crazy thing to process. I think I just try to less and less let that noise seep in but obviously it’s there.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked if she hopes Haylie hears “We Don’t Talk,” Duff said, “I don’t think that would help… I don’t know if she’ll hear it. I don’t know how she’ll react to it. But it is a really personal part of my life that doesn’t get to stay personal, so I might as well say how it is for me as an experience. And that’s all I’m trying to do. I’m not trying to say anything bad, it’s literally just my experience. And that’s really all I feel like sharing.”\n\nHilary Duff opens up to @AnthonyMasonCBS about her relationship with her sister, Haylie: “Absolutely the most lonely part of my existence is not having my sister in my life at the moment.”She shares why she chose to include the song, “We Don’t Talk,” on her new album, \"luck…… pic.twitter.com/TchpCTd58L— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) February 20, 2026\n\n",

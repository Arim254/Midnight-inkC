    "body": "\n\tIt’s time to start running up that hill again. But since it’s been more than three years since “Stranger Things” aired its fourth season finale, the trek might be a little rough for those who haven’t re-binged the Duffer brothers’ hit Netflix series before it debuts Volume I of the fifth and final season Nov. 26 at 5pm PT.\n\n\tSince carving out a 2-hour, 21-minute window to re-watch the “Stranger Things” Season 4 finale before you carve the bird on Thanksgiving Day isn’t a possibility for everyone, Variety has a character-by-character recap of where everyone in Hawkins circa 1986 left off ahead of Season 5. So see below for where Eleven and the gang were at the end of “Stranger Things” Season 4, before we return to the Upside Down this Thanksgiving.\n\t\n\n\tEleven\n\n\n\tShe’s back in Hawkins — actually, everyone is now. At the end of Season 5, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) is with Mike, Will, Joyce, Hopper, Nancy and Jonathan in a field in Hawkins, watching as the Upside Down seeps up into the Indiana town. Ash-like material darkens the air, coming out of the giant cracks in the world Vecna ripped open by using the lives of four people, including the now-comatose Max, to open four gates from the Upside Down.\n\n\tEleven has discovered that Vecna is also Henry Creel and One (the first subject of Dr. Brenner’s). Eleven has also learned that she is responsible for pushing him into the Upside Down, when she rejected his offer to transform the world together, essentially creating Vecna, the evil she and her friends have been fighting.\n\n\tShe tried to save Max from Vecna through dream walking into Max’s brain, but managed only to bring Max back to life after she technically died for long enough for the fourth gate into the Upside Down to open.\n\t\n\n\tVecna/Henry Creel/One\n\n\tVecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) once wanted to join forces with Eleven, back when he was One/Henry Creel, to reshape the world into his own twisted vision. After Eleven unintentionally threw him into the Upside Down and made him into his current form, Vecna began to seek out ways to reach the outside world and control kids in Hawkins — like Will and Max.\n\n\tThough Eleven tried to take him out during her dream-walking in Max’s mind, and Steve, Nancy and Robin blasted him with shotguns and torched his body in the Upside Down, Will can feel his presence and knows he’s not dead.\n\n\tMike Wheeler\n\n\tMike (Finn Wolfhard) is back in Hawkins, and back on good terms with his girlfriend, El. With Will’s help, Mike supported Eleven through her dream-walking battle with Vecna in Max’s mind. However, Mike is unaware that Will has feelings for him, and is suffering in silence over this unrequited love, all as the Upside Down enters Hawkins.\n\n\tWill Byers\n\n\tWill (Noah Schnapp) feels Vecna’s presence in the final moments of “Stranger Things 4,” confirming that he has not been killed and that Will’s connection to the Upside Down is still intact. Will worked with Mike, Jonathan and Argyle to get Eleven access to Max’s mind via dream-walking so El could try to save Max and everyone else from Vecna from afar.\n\n\tDespite his romantic feelings for Mike, Will encouraged Mike to offer his love and support to El to help her try to defeat Vecna. After spending Season 4 living with his brother Jonathan, his mom Joyce and El in California, he and the rest of his family have now returned to Hawkins to help in the fight.\n\n\tLucas Sinclair\n\n\tLucas (Caleb McLaughlin) had spent the season trying to save Max from Vecna and repair their romantic relationship after she became depressed following her stepbrother Billy’s death. Lucas stayed with her while Vecna entered her mind and tried to bring her back with the trigger of her favorite song, Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill,” but her heart stopped. Max was revived by Eleven through dream-walking, but the damage was done, and Max is now in a coma in the hospital with Lucas staying close by her side.\n\n\tDustin Henderson\n\n\tDustin (Gaten Matarazzo) watched Eddie Munson die after they valiantly fought off a mess of Demobats in the Upside Down to give Steve, Nancy and Robin coverage while they went to attack Vecna. As a result, everyone else was able to safely return home, and Dustin told the story of Eddie’s heroism to Eddie’s uncle, knowing the rest of the town still thinks Eddie is a villain and responsible for several deaths in Hawkins.\n\t\n\n\tMax Mayfield\n\n\tCurrently comatose in the hospital. All Max’s (Sadie Sink) bones were broken by Vecna, and she was dead for a full minute before being brought back to life via dream-walking by Eleven. Lucas is by her side in the hospital, hoping she pulls through and wakes up, though the doctors say she may never come out of her coma.\n\n\tSteve Harrington\n\n\tSteve (Joe Keery) survived the fight against Vecna alongside Nancy and Robin in the Creel House in the Upside Down. He’s returned with the gang to Hawkins, but they have no idea where Vecna has gone to after they couldn’t find the body.\n\n\tNancy Wheeler\n\n\tNancy (Natalia Dyer) fought Vecna, shooting him, along with Steve and Robin, who managed to torch him with fire and send him flying through the attic window of the Creel House in the Upside Down. However, his body was missing before they could confirm his death. At one point during a trance, Nancy walked through Vecna’s memories and learned his backstory as the troubled Henry Creel.\n\n\tJonathan Byers\n\n\tJonathan (Charlie Heaton) returned to Hawkins alongside Will, Mike and Eleven. He’s spent time consoling his brother, Will, who is clearly heartbroken over his unrequited feelings for Mike. When Jonathan and girlfriend Nancy are reunited, he makes a crack about Nancy’s ex, Steve, and Nancy refutes it. Before the Upside Down begins to creep into Hawkins, Jonathan asks Nancy if things are OK between them in their romantic relationship, and she responds with an unconvincing yes.\n\n\tRobin Buckley\n\n\tRobin (Maya Hawke) survived the Vecna battle with Nancy and Steve in the Upside Down. Upon returning to the now-in-shambles Hawkins, she finds a silver lining: her crush, Vickie, is potentially returning her affections.\n\n\tJim Hopper\n\n\tHopper (David Harbour) is back from his hostage situation in Soviet Russia, and reunited with Eleven, thanks to a rescue mission led by Joyce. While in the U.S.S.R., he fought off a Demogorgon in hopes of weakening the overall power of the Upside Down to help out the kids back home.\n\n\tJoyce Byers\n\n\tJoyce (Winona Ryder) returned Hopper safe and sound to the mess that is Hawkins. They were even talking about finally making it to their date at Enzo’s — though that’s likely going to be difficult with the giant cracks in the world.\n\t\n\n\tErica Sinclair\n\n\tErica (Priah Ferguson) was at the Creel House in the Rightside Up when Vecna took over Max, and she called the ambulance for Lucas to get Max help after Vecna broke all the bones in her body. Erica is with the rest of the crew in Hawkins as the Upside Down seeps into the world.\n\n\tThe Wheelers\n\n\tThe other members of Mike and Nancy’s family — mom Karen (Cara Buono), dad Ted (Joe Chrest) and little sister Holly (played in Season 5 by Nell Fisher) — were all at home when the ground cracked open. Young Holly is seemingly able to notice what is going on more so than her parents, and appears to perceive the impact the unseen Vecna is having on their world.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe National Film Development Corporation’s Screenwriters Lab at the WAVES Film Bazaar has established itself as a crucial launching pad for independent Indian filmmakers, providing rare development support in a market where such resources remain scarce.\n\n\tThe lab, which develops eight projects annually, offers writers an intensive four-to-six-month mentorship with international script consultants, filling what filmmaker and lab mentor Bikas Mishra describes as a critical gap in the Indian film ecosystem.\n\t\n\n\t“There is no other development support, definitely in India, mostly not in South Asia,” said Mishra, whose film “Chauranga” was developed through the program. “Independent filmmakers, they are expected to go with a fully developed script to a producer and pitch it. But this crucial phase of the journey of a story, where it develops from a story to a screenplay, there is neither financial support nor expert support.”\n\n\n\tThe program has produced notable successes including “The Lunchbox” and Ajit Pal Singh’s “Fire in the Mountains,” which premiered at Sundance. More recently, Diwa Shah’s project “Kyab” secured a spot in the Cannes La Résidence program, where she spent six months in Paris before winning the pitching forum at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\tScript consultant Claire Dobbin, who has worked with the lab for several years, emphasized the program’s unique position within India’s film industry infrastructure. “People recognize that the screenwriters Lab is a key development program,” Dobbin said. \n\n\tThe lab attracts projects from across India’s regions, deliberately seeking voices beyond traditional urban film centers. Participants work one-on-one with expert mentors drawn from international development programs. The lab’s framework was established by Marten Rabarts, who previously headed Binger Film Lab.\n\t\n\n\tUpon completing the program, filmmakers pitch their projects to international collaborators, producers, festivals and funding bodies at Film Bazaar. Mishra secured coin from the Gothenburg Film Festival’s development fund for “Chauranga,” marking the first funding for his project.\n\n\t“That meant a lot. That’s the first money that flew into the ‘Chauranga’ projects account,” Mishra said.\n\n\tDobbin noted the program’s evolution over recent years, with stronger projects entering the pipeline as understanding of development processes grows within the industry. “Initially, because there’s not a huge history of development in industry, the projects, many of them were not of a sufficiently high standard,” she said. “But we are now attracting compelling projects and actually compelling filmmakers with strong projects.”\n\n\tThe lab includes three sessions over its duration, featuring lectures on screenplay craft alongside individual mentorship. Topics range from technical aspects like opening sequences to broader questions about when established screenwriting conventions should be challenged.\n\n\tDobbin contrasted the lab’s approach with mainstream Bollywood production, which she suggested suffers from an echo chamber effect. “You don’t make the future by looking at the past. You make the future by coming up with new ideas,” she said. “The world was completely thunderstruck by ‘All We Imagine As Light,’ because it was the most powerful, poetic, imaginative world.”\n\n\tThis year’s mentors include Dobbin, New Zealand-based Christina Andreef and Indian filmmaker Umesh Kulkarni, with each writer receiving guidance from one or two mentors throughout the program.\n\n\tThe lab’s focus on distinctive regional voices positions it as what Dobbin called “a diamond in the NFDC crown,” preparing filmmakers for international markets while helping them develop their unique artistic perspectives.\n\n\t“What these filmmakers are developing here is their voice,” Dobbin said. “Nothing is more important than the filmmaker’s voice.”\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa. \n",

What ETM-LA is doing is making that happen for so many who might never get the chance to experience the beauty and power of music,” said Warren.\n\t\n\n\tSonic Fuel Studios Co-Founder and composer Christopher Lennertz shared, “The mission of ensuring every child has access to quality music education at an early age is so vitally important.”\n\n\tHonorary chair members for the event include John Debney, Randy Jackson, Mike Knobloch, Rickey Minor, Lionel Richie, Randy Spendlove, Nia Vardalos, Paul Williams, and Renée Zellweger.\n\t\n\t\tTitle and Release Date Revealed for Adam Shankman’s RuPaul-Starring Film\t\n\n\tBleecker Street, Universal Pictures Content Group and World of Wonder have revealed the title and release date for Adam Shankman’s next film, starring RuPaul Charles. The film will be titled “Stop! That! Train!” and Bleecker Street will release it in theaters on May 29, 2026.\n\n\tThe campy action comedy follows two train stewardesses who upgrade their shifts from the Stank Rail to the luxurious Glamazonian Express. When a “Stormaganza” threatens to derail the train, the duo must team up with the snooty first-class attendants to save the passengers aboard the wild ride.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to RuPaul playing President Gagwell, the film is filled with familiar faces from “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” Series favorites Ginger Minj and Jujubee play the main duo and are joined by Brooke Lynn Hytes, Latrice Royale, Marcia Marcia Marcia, Monét X Change and Symone in supporting roles.\n\n\t“Stop! That! Train!” was written by Connor Wright and Christina Friel and produced by Shankman and RuPaul alongside Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato and Tom Campbell.\n\t\n\t\tMonday, November 24\t\n\t\n\t\tStudiocanal Launches New Label ‘Studiocanal on Stage’\t\n\n\tFollowing the West End opening of “The Producers” and with “Paddington the Musical” in previews, Studiocanal has announced the launch of “Studiocanal on Stage.” The new label is focused on the development, production and distribution of stage productions of the company’s film catalogue, as well as translating projects from stage to screen.\n\n\t“Studiocanal on Stage strengthens our strategy to develop and extend our IP across multiple formats,” said Anna Marsh, CEO of Studiocanal and Chief Content Officer of Canal+, in a statement. “Alongside Studiocanal Stories and Sixth Dimension, this new label gives us a clear framework to grow our catalogue and bring our stories to new audiences.”\n\n\t“The Producers” was adapted from the Studiocanal library film and is a revival of Mel Brooks’ musical, which won 12 Tony Awards, including best musical. The show runs through Sept. 2026. “Paddington” is adapted from Michael Bond’s beloved book series and the award-winning Studiocanal films, which have earned more than $700 million at the global box office. The musical production opens on Nov. 30 and is booked through May 2026.\n\n\tPrevious Studiocanal library films that have been adapted for the stage include “The Graduate,” “Evil Dead,” “The Ladykillers,” “Billy Elliot” and “The Third Man” (co-licensed with the estate of Graham Greene).\n\n\tOther productions set to debut this year include “Restless Natives,” “Summer Holiday” and “A Boy Called Christmas.” In development is “Kind Hearts and Coronets,” which inspired the upcoming film “How to Make a Killing.” Glen Powell and Margaret Qualley star in the movie, which opens in theaters next year via A24 in the U.S. Other titles include “The Belles of St. Trinians” and “The Proud Valley.”\n\t\n\n\tAlternatively, Studiocanal is also focused on bringing adaptations from stage to screen; the company is currently shooting the Danny Boyle-directed adaptation of James Graham’s “Ink” and is in post-production on “Pressure,” directed by Anthony Maras and based on David Haig’s critically acclaimed play.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMacaulay Culkin said during a recent stop on his “A Nostalgic Night with Macaulay Culkin” tour that he “wouldn’t be completely allergic” to returning as Kevin McCallister in a “Home Alone” sequel. Although he added, “It would have to be just right.” Fortunately, Culkin already has a pitch for a sequel that he would be interested in doing.\n\n\t“I kind of had this idea,” Culkin said. “I’m either a widower or a divorcee. I’m raising a kid and all that stuff. I’m working really hard and I’m not really paying enough attention and the kid is kind of getting miffed at me and then I get locked out. [Kevin’s son] won’t let me in… and he’s the one setting traps for me.”\n\t\n\n\tCulkin’s “Home Alone” sequel idea is to more or less replace the robbers with Kevin McCallister, as he battles his own son to reenter their home during the holidays. The actor said “the house is some sort of metaphor for our relationship” and his character has to “get let back into son’s heart’ kind of deal. That’s the closest elevator pitch that I have. I’m not completely allergic to it, the right thing.”\n\n\n\tThe “Home Alone” franchise turned Culkin into one of the most popular Hollywood child stars of the 1990s when the first movie became a box office blockbuster with $476 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1990. He returned for the 1992 sequel “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.” Culkin’s director, Chris Columbus, made headlines in August when he told Entertainment Tonight that a new “Home Alone” movie should never be made.\n\n\t“I think ‘Home Alone’ really exists as, not at this timepiece, but it was this very special moment, and you can’t really recapture that,” Columbus said. “I think it’s a mistake to try to go back and recapture something we did 35 years ago. I think it should be left alone.”\n\t\n\n\tBoth Culkin and Columbus did not participate in “Home Alone 3,” the largely forgotten 1997 installment. A fourth movie was released directly to television in 2002. Disney attempted to reboot the franchise in 2021 with the Disney+ exclusive movie “Home Sweet Home Alone,” starring young “Jojo Rabbit” breakout Archie Yates. Reviews were not kind to the remake, perhaps proving Columbus’ point right.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAriana Grande appeared on the “Shut Up Evan” podcast for a spoiler interview about “Wicked: For Good” and revealed that “certain people” wanted to cut the shot of a door separating Elphaba and Glinda after they say their final goodbyes. The two characters break down in tears on opposite sides of the door. The image has since become a fan favorite on social media and is widely being praised as one of director Jon M. Chu’s most inspired directorial choices.\n\t\n\n\t“It was a really heavy day. There was actually a conversation about… certain people wanted to cut that shot,” Grande said. “Jon was like, ‘This is the movie. There is no question about it.’ I was so grateful for how fiercely he advocated for those honest moments. It’s one of the most beautiful and connected moments in both of the movies. I’m so grateful that it’s there. It’s tough. It was very hard emotionally.”\n\n\n\tChu previously told Variety that the door scene was not in the original script for the movie and was added after he spotted Erivo and Grande improvising a goodbye between their characters during the film’s rehearsal process. The two actors placed their hands against an imaginary door and Chu said he “started to weep.” \n\n\n\t“It was in rehearsals that we found it,” Chu said. “Cynthia grabs her and says, ‘Come here.’ And I’m like, where are they going? And they go to this corner, and she puts her in a box or a closet.”\n\n\tThe shot of the door splitting the characters comes right after Glinda tells Elphaba she loves them, which Chu also had to fight to keep in the movie since there is apparently a rule in the Oz franchise that characters do not express such a thought.\n\t\n\n\t“You’re not allowed to say ‘I love you’ in Oz,” Chu told Variety. “No God, no okay, no I love you… [but Ariana saying it] was so human. It crossed over a boundary of Oz into our world.” \n\n\tWatch Grande’s full interview on the “Shut Up Evan” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNitesh Tiwari said his upcoming “Ramayana,” described as India’s most expensive film, is being built to deliver a level of visual scale and craftsmanship that can stand alongside the world’s top VFX productions, telling a WAVES Film Bazaar audience that the epic demands “something visually so stunning that it becomes a benchmark for the whole world.” \n\n\tSpeaking about a five-year process of virtual production, motion capture and world-building with Prime Focus, Tiwari detailed the ambition and pressure behind reimagining the mythological saga while fellow filmmakers Prasanth Varma and Ashwin Kumar stressed that technology must serve story, not drive it.\n\t\n\n\tThe directors, in the forefront of India’s visual-effects boom, joined moderator Rajiv Chilaka of Green Gold Animation to discuss how technology is reshaping Indian cinema. They drew on their specific experiences with films in a conversation that explored India’s expanding creative capabilities, cutting-edge technologies, and the growing demand for high-quality VFX across films, streaming, and animation.\n\n\n\tNitesh Tiwari spoke on the ambition of “Ramayana,” and about the scale and responsibility of imagining the epic tale into a VFX film. “Ramayana” deserves to be told in the grandeur it deserves… something visually so stunning that it becomes a benchmark for the whole world,” he said. Working with one of the world’s leading VFX studios (Prime Focus) has been “scary, liberating, and mind-numbing all at the same time,” he said.\n\n\tHe described a five-year journey of learning and adapting to virtual production, motion capture, and world-building. “It took me two years to come to terms with the fact that I was making such a big film… Today I’m very comfortable, but it wasn’t easy, and we are still one year away from the release of the first part,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tPrasanth Varma, whose Telugu-language superhero film “HanuMan” became a pan-India hit, emphasised that technology alone cannot drive success. “Films work because of stories. All other crafts, including VFX, help in telling that story in a grand way.”\n\n\tSelf-taught in VFX, editing, and cinematography, Varma, who is working on “Jai Hanuman” revealed his practical approach. “Either you give the artist a lot of time or you have a lot of money… We didn’t have money, but we had time.”\n\n\tAshwin Kumar spoke about his breakout animated hit “Mahavatar Narsimha” and about building films from sheer determination. As he moves to his next project, “Mahavatar Parshuram,” the second in the “Mahavatar” animated cinematic universe, Kumar said AI is a useful catalyst to get to a final outcome faster. Kumar believes the next five years will redefine filmmaking: “We are at the cusp and in five years, there will probably be an AI film that will make you cry.”\n\n\tOn the topic of animated films, Tiwari said it was on his “bucket list to do an animation film based on Indian locations, Indian characters and story but for the world.”\n\n\tThe discussion emphasised how innovation, talent, and ambition are propelling India forward in visual effects and redefining cinematic possibilities adding that VFX and technology cannot be the starting point for the idea, but can be enablers of the idea.\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa. \n",

    "body": "\n\tOver the last decade, Ryan O’Dowd has written some of the biggest live moments on television — including those from the past seven years of “Dick Clark’s Rockin’ New Year’s Eve With Ryan Seacrest” and awards shows like the CMAs, the Billboard Music Awards and the Emmys. And he’s always loved the rush of live TV.\n\n\t“I love the immediacy of it,” O’Dowd, president of unscripted at BBC Studios, says. “I loved, as a writer, the ability to have something happen, to react to it, to think of what we could do that would entertain and engage literally within three minutes coming out of a commercial break. We’d come up with the idea to pitch it to the host, have them be behind it, get it into the teleprompter, and have 40,000 people in an arena see it three minutes later.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year, the idea that “live TV is back” is bigger than ever, and he sees that every single week. Serving as an executive producer on “Dancing With the Stars,” the largest live entertainment television show of the year, O’Dowd has a front seat to the massive ratings, the millions of votes coming in between 8 and 10 p.m. Eastern every Tuesday night and, more than ever, the engagement on social media.\n\n\n\t“Within the last few years in particular, with TikTok, that has become an engagement unlike anything I had ever seen,” says O’Dowd, who is keeping an eye on that engagement during every live show from inside the studio, and watches people join the official “Dancing” account’s TikTok Lives during commercial breaks.\n\n\t“It’s just an amazing continuation. It’s a whole separate vehicle that, luckily, our pro dancers and the celebrities on the show have embraced, and they’ve seen the power of being able to tell their story and connect comedically with their audience,” he says. “Going into this season, Andy Richter didn’t have much of a social media presence, to be honest, or he wasn’t very active on social media. And then within a few weeks, he saw the power of being able to engage and leverage a devout following. The more he put out, the more he got back in terms of fandom. Next thing you know, you have a fan base with a name ‘The Fandies,’ and Johnny Knoxville was coming to support him in a bedazzled ‘Vote for Andy’ shirt that he bedazzled.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRyan O’Dowd, BBC Studios; Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAt the time of publishing, Richter has more than 122K followers and 968K likes on TikTok, and he’s on the lower end of the spectrum: His partner, Emma Slater, hit 1 million Instagram followers ahead of the finale. The most popular cast member on social media is Robert Irwin, with 9.7 million TikTok followers and nearly 9 million on Instagram.\n\n\tOne Instagram account, Pop Culture Data, is followed by multiple execs who work on the show and tracks the contestant and pro follower counts by week, with Irwin at the top each time. (After week one, his combined Instagram and TikTok growth was +343,220. Danielle Fishel, Whitney Leavitt, Alix Earle and pro Daniella Karagach gained spots in the top five in the weeks that followed.)\n\n\t“TikTok has been a great vehicle for the show, and it serves the show, and the show serves TikTok. It’s become a symbiotic relationship, that everybody wins,” O’Dowd says. Luckily, there’s an excellent social media team in place — even though the pros and celebrities seemingly need much help in that arena. “Their talents go beyond what they’re seeing on the dance floor. They come in every week, embracing it, asking, ‘What are the videos and the content that we can put out that will tease what we’re doing this week, that will engage an audience?’ The best example is what Daniella and Dylan did with the air walk. They’re very smart, and it’s going to start a conversation. It’s a viral moment that people are gonna be talking about. I have seen 100 different videos of couples this past week recreating that. It’s just the gift that keeps on giving, where they’re able to choreograph something that gets people talking and then doing user-generated content that then keeps us in the zeitgeist 24/7.”\n\n\tIt helps, O’Dowd notes, that there’s a “healthy competition” among the entire cast. “When you get those viral moments, all of them go back to the drawing board, wanting to choreograph and create their own viral moment.”\n\n\tAs always, with more viewers — Prince week became the most-watched semifinals in seven years — comes more opinions. This season, Carrie Ann Inaba has been getting the brunt of the negative feedback for her judging. Elsewhere, contestants and pros alike have spoken up about online bullying that comes along with being on a competition show.\n\t\n\n\t“To Carrie Ann’s credit, there are times that she’s the last to speak. She has plenty of positive things to say, but she’s looking at the totality of X number of seconds allotted to the judges, and if Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough have already touched on the positive attributes of the dance they just saw, and she knows that there is one slight misstep, she’s going to — for the good of the show — talk about that,” says O’Dowd. “Everything can’t always be positive across the board. Part of what viewers, I think, want is the ability to understand what each of these dancers needs to do to get better.”\n\n\tPlus the pros, celebrities and audiences appreciate real feedback, he says — and don’t want to hear only praise week after week. “It diminishes the moments when someone is truly deserving of emphatic praise across the board. So you need a diversity of opinion. You need to point out when something is great and conversely, when something could be better.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlfonso Ribeiro, Julianne Hough, Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSemifinals saw the most shocking elimination of the season, with Whitney Leavitt being eliminated despite being one of the best celebrity dancers in the group. But, people aren’t just voting on the merits of the dancing, O’Dowd says as a reminder. On Season 3 of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,” which premiered on Nov. 13, Leavitt admitted she only came back to the Hulu show for a shot at “Dancing With the Stars” — and some viewers didn’t like that type of honesty.\n\n\t“Obviously, she has ‘Secret Lives of Mormon Wives‘ that just came out that previous week on Hulu. And I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t think that played a role,” he says. “Our job is to really just give her a platform and an opportunity to display her dance to the best of her abilities, and to allow her to reach an audience that can vote based on what they’ve seen that night.\n\n\t“She was clear with her intention,” O’Dowd continues. “We should be celebrating someone who’s been very clear with what their intentions and motivations are, and who has, in some ways, realized the dream that she had and the goal that she had. So why see it for anything other than her just chasing her dream — which is something we all should aspire to?”\n\n\tAfter such a successful season, the pressure is on for Season 35 next fall, and the conversations around casting have already begun with Deena Katz, who’s been part of the show since day one.\n\t\n\n\t“She is always two steps ahead in terms of people who we not even know today. She has a finger on the pulse, knowing that, come September of next year, these people are going to be big, which is exactly what you did with Robert Irwin,” says O’Dowd. “There’s an admitted pressure to match, if not exceed, the type of cast that we’ve delivered this season. We all have already begun speaking about who those names are and what we can do. We’ve also, very deliberately, held a couple spots until the last few weeks, to be able to book somebody that nobody really knew prior to that exact moment, and to be able to be nimble and act immediately.”\n\n\tThe casting process will likely be a bit different next year, since Season 34 has become such a juggernaut, and has changed the perception of the show.\n\n\t“Many years ago, when we were in a bit of a lull, it wasn’t as sexy of a proposition to come on ‘Dancing.’ There was this notion that it’s kind of the last chapter of your career. What I’m personally very proud of is that now we’ve built the brand to be a place where this can be a launching pad for so many new opportunities post-‘Dancing,'” says O’Dowd. “I can’t tell you how many talent on the show this season whose reps have said to ABC they are blown away by the amount of opportunities that have presented themselves.”\n\n\tSo, what will change going forward? When Tom Bergeron came back into the ballroom, he mentioned that he’d like to see the return of the results show; “Dancing With the Stars” previously aired two nights a week, one night for dances, the second for the elimination.\n\n\t“My personal opinion is, while there is one school of thought that when you’re at the height of the brand, you should chase more hours, that actually, you’d be sacrificing the longevity of the series, and you would be diminishing the value of the main show,” O’Dowd says. “I think why we’re getting the viewership and the engagement that we’re getting right now is that on every Tuesday night, from 8-10, you’re going to see multiple performances, you’re able to engage live on social media, and at the conclusion of that two hours, you’re gonna get to see someone, based on the performances you just witnessed, go home. There’s a resolution to everything that just happened in that given episode.”\n\t\n\n\tBut there’s still an opportunity for more. “I think what we would prefer to do is to find ‘Dancing With the Stars’-adjacent vehicles to harness the leverage, the interest in the brand, but not diminish the main show. I really believe that the main show being a two-hour show — we get a beginning, middle and end and a resolution — is why we have the engagement that we do.”\n\n\tFrom 2006 to 2018, “Dancing” aired two seasons a year — one in the fall, one in the spring. But O’Dowd feels similarly skeptical about the possibility of bringing back a second cycle. “I think the build-up and the intrigue of who we’re gonna cast on the show leading into the fall is so much more heightened when you’ve had a bit of a breathing room,” he says. “I think a second cycle, which we’ve done before, you’re chasing a short-term gain at the expense of the longevity of the series.”\n\n\tPlus, the “DWTS: Live” tour runs from January to May, giving fans a way to stay in the “Dancing With the Stars” bubble. Not only are fans around the country able to have meet-and-greets with the professional dancers and celebrities, but the word continues to spread on social media from the tour.\n\n\t“We joke about how 10 years ago, we had to make sure the tour was safe for walkers. Now, we have college students lining up — thousands of them buying merch,” he says. “We have the tour buses come out, and hundreds of people are lining up outside the barricades of people wanting to get a photo with our pros before the tour bus takes off for the next city.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrevious champions Rumer Willis and Kaitlyn Bristowe returned for the 20th anniversary show.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOf course, another way to expand the popularity of “DWTS” would be to do an all-stars season, especially because many viewers feel that some runner-ups and third-place celebs should have won the mirrorball.\n\n\t“We’ve talked about it; we’ll continue to talk about it. We’re not closing the door on it,” he says. “The allure of the show is, who are the people we’re going to cast that you’ve never seen before? We had an element of it in the 20th birthday episode, of course, where we brought back previous winners, and that was great. But I think the beauty of the show is getting to see new people each and every cycle, some of whom you may never have even heard of prior.”\n\t\n\n\tO’Dowd and BBC Studios: Los Angeles produce a great deal of television, working with top talent — from Joel McHale on “1% Club” and Jany Lynch on “Celebrity Weakest Lunch.” They’ve created “Life Before Zero” for Nat Geo and “Outlast” for Netflix,” and are bringing back “Ladies of London” to Bravo.\n\n\t“I’m proud of what we’ve been able to do to grow the business to a place where we’re having a show in pretty much every genre within unscripted, and that breadth allows us to do much more,” O’Dowd says.\n\n\tAnd the success of “Dancing With the Stars” has only taught him how to succeed further in every genre.\n\n\t“Creating shows that bring people together has never been more important. What we’ve always strived to do, but are making even more conservative efforts to do as a result of this season of ‘Dancing,’ is to create shows that are part of the conversation, that engage an audience on social media and get people talking — that allows for a younger audience without alienating a core older audience, if it’s pre-existing format,” O’Dowd says. “But I think the biggest thing is that live TV community has never been stronger and it’s about doing things that bring people together.”\n\n\tThe finale of “Dancing With the Stars” airs Tuesday, Nov. 25 at 8 p.m. ET. on ABC and Disney+. It will stream the next day on Hulu.\n",

    "description": "\n\tA maxim from Italian composer Ennio Morricone — “Music must be able to say what words can’t” — was a working thesis at Cam Sugar‘s inaugural SLAM – ",
    "body": "\n\tA maxim from Italian composer Ennio Morricone — “Music must be able to say what words can’t” — was a working thesis at Cam Sugar‘s inaugural SLAM – Sounds Like a Movie festival this month in Milan.\n\n\tThe new international festival, a collaboration between CAM Sugar and Triennale Milano, packed more than 30 events into the design museum’s galleries and performance spaces Nov. 14–16, drawing around 100 artists for screenings, talks, listening sessions, live gigs and DJ sets. Organizers have already committed to a second edition in 2026.\n\t\n\n\tFor CAM Sugar, which celebrates the 65th anniversary of its catalogue this year, SLAM served as a way to boasts its vast library of more than 2,500 Italian and French film scores — from “La Dolce Vita” and “8½” to “Il Postino.” “The main quest in my job is letting the archive talk by itself,” says Andrea Fabrizi, CAM Sugar’s global archive and restoration lead, who curated several of the weekend’s most popular listening sessions. His programming leaned on a triptych of listening sessions, DJ sets and talks, a format he says lets audiences “have a complete view on that specific historic moment through the music” while hearing how it still vibrates in the present.\n\n\n\tCam Sugar’s archives continue to fuel new work by filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese and Wes Anderson, and to be sampled by artists ranging from Drake to Tyler, the Creator. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblacc.o\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblacc.o\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFabrizi describes the archive as a kind of “reading room before the room even exists,” where certain cues are built to fire directly at the body — “kinetic charge, rhythm, the way the arrangement breaks” — while others are psychological, designed for “a quiet space” and close listening. That split, he says, dictates whether a piece belongs on a dance floor, in a concentrated listening session or, ideally, both. Sometimes the magic is in the contrast: dropping something fragile “in the middle of a groove and watching people believe in it.”\n\t\n\n\tHe points to Piero Piccioni’s score for “Il Caso Mattei,” which was screened over the weekend, as the sort of deep cut the archive is built to surface. The music, he argues, quietly rewrote the rules of film scoring in the early ’70s — a blend of jazz intuition, political tension and near-spiritual minimalism whose grooves producers today would call experimental. \n\n\tSLAM’s first edition leaned heavily into Morricone’s legacy, including an exclusive preview of previously unreleased recordings from “Il Clan dei Siciliani” in a dedicated listening session, ahead of their December release on triple vinyl and double CD. The program also featured a tribute concert by longtime collaborator Enrico Pieranunzi and talks contextualizing the Maestro’s influence across contemporary cinema and sampling culture.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblacc.o\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tOn the French side of the archive, A&R and restoration lead Stéphane Lerouge spotlighted the diversity of CAM Sugar’s holdings — from avant-garde experimental and pop to South American-inflected grooves. His passion project this year is the resurrection of “La Scoumoune,” a cult thriller score by François de Roubaix. Lerouge’s team located and digitized the original studio masters, allowing them to release, for the first time, an extended definitive version of the music, complete with de Roubaix’s own notes about his overdubbing process.\n\n\tFor Lerouge, that recovery work underlines the universality of film music. He recalls Morricone telling him he never bothered learning foreign languages because “music language is universal,” a sentiment borne out by the cult followings these scores maintain in Japan and the U.S. decades after their initial releases.\n\n\tThat universality was a recurring theme in SLAM’s marquee talks with working supervisors and composers. Mary Ramos, Quentin Tarantino’s longtime music supervisor, tell Variety her process often begins with what she calls a “yes-and playlist,” a collaborative back-and-forth with directors to calibrate what a film should sound like and, just as importantly, what it shouldn’t.\n\n\tRamos’ long collaboration with Tarantino supplied some of SLAM’s juiciest anecdotes, including persuading the director, for “Django Unchained,” to commission new songs for the first time. She also recalled building that soundtrack around the twin themes of love and revenge, coaching John Legend to send Tarantino a cassette and handwritten letter and engineering a rare hybrid of James Brown’s “The Payback” with unreleased Tupac vocals, a cue that ended up scoring the film’s bloodiest shoot-out.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tIf the festival leaned heavily into analog, it didn’t ignore the digital elephant in the room. Lerouge cautioned against directors’ over-reliance on temp playlists in the edit bay, calling it “a limitation in terms of imagination” that can box composers into copy-paste work. His plea to filmmakers was simple: trust composers, especially younger ones, the way Italian producers once trusted Morricone, Nino Rota and their peers to invent something new.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Nicolas Winding Refn, another panelist, argued for embracing technology while interrogating its economics. A self-described “big advocate” for tech, the director sees AI as just another tool in a creative ecosystem where data already shapes much of mainstream content. The real danger, he suggested, lies less in whether AI can write a decent score and more in the inequality that follows when “technology diminishes human hands,” hollowing out the financial ecosystem that supports working artists.\n\n\tAs Lerouge put it, summing up the festival’s purpose as the lights went down: “A composer is an artist reacting to the work of another artist — and no machine can replace that human spark.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tAt a glance, T-Street Productions doesn’t look like much — a quiet, repurposed West Los Angeles building that once housed a music supply store. But ",
    "body": "\n\tAt a glance, T-Street Productions doesn’t look like much — a quiet, repurposed West Los Angeles building that once housed a music supply store. But within its walls, a small collective of fiercely loyal creatives is doing something increasingly rare in Hollywood: They’re betting on storytelling for storytelling’s sake.\n\n\tFounded by director Rian Johnson and producer Ram Bergman, T-Street is not your typical film company. It has no corporate parent, no studio first-look deal and no brand-building ambitions beyond making original films that connect with audiences. It’s a creative sanctuary designed by and for filmmakers — where risk isn’t avoided, it’s encouraged.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve never had a plan to grow for growth’s sake,” Bergman tells Variety. “We’re not trying to flip this into a studio deal or sell it off. It’s about supporting filmmakers. That’s it.”\n\n\n\tThat ethos has yielded everything from the Oscar-winning “American Fiction” (2023) to the wildly successful “Knives Out” franchise, the third installment of which, “Wake Up Dead Man,” debuts in theaters this week. \n\n\tBut the real story of T-Street is not only the films but also the people who make them.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLong before “Knives Out” became a pop culture phenomenon, Johnson and Bergman were already shaping their careers around artistic control by self-financing films. It was a practice that began as a necessity with Johnson’s debut, “Brick” (2005), and later evolved into a principle.\n\n\t“People told us not to put our own money in,” Bergman says. “But if we’re not willing to bet on ourselves, why should anyone else?”\n\t\n\n\tThat mindset birthed T-Street in the shadow of “Knives Out.” The first film was made independently and sold after completion. It was a gamble that paid off. The two-picture sequel deal with Netflix was wildly lucrative, bringing in an astounding $450 million. But that deal is now up, and the rights remain with Johnson and Bergman. “It’s still our franchise,” Bergman notes.\n\n\tJohnson is just as uncompromising, declaring no other person will write or direct a “Knives Out” movie. “I don’t see it as IP,” he says. “Each ‘Knives Out’ film is something I want to make. If that stops being the case, we won’t do another one.”\n\n\tThat protective stance extends to the franchise’s very DNA. Johnson has made clear he doesn’t want returning characters beyond Benoit Blanc, ruling out any “Avengers”-style ensemble reunion that fans would expect (and some previous cast members, such as Kate Hudson, had advocated for). “I love the fact that each one of these is entirely its own case, entirely its own mystery,” Johnson asserts. “I love actors, I want to keep working with new actors, too. At this point, I like the idea of having a new group of folks each time.” It’s a philosophy that keeps each film fresh while also ensuring Johnson remains the sole creative architect.\n\n\tAnd while “Wake Up Dead Man” marks the final installment of that deal, Johnson says the future of the Benoit Blanc mysteries remains unwritten — and entirely up to them. “We both feel energized coming out of this one,” Johnson says with confidence. “Whenever I get the next idea, we’ll go from there.”\n\n\tJohnson is currently writing an original movie, which they hope to begin shooting in 2026.\n\n\tThe idea for the Benoit Blanc character had been percolating in Johnson’s mind for years. Bergman revealed that Johnson first mentioned the murder mystery concept to his wife, Karina Longworth, on their first date — a full decade before “Knives Out” came to fruition. By early 2017, as the massive “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” production wound down and the team shrank from thousands to just a handful, Johnson began writing what would become the first film in the franchise.\n\n\tWhile “Knives Out” flourished on the big screen, Johnson and Bergman also ventured into television with the killer-of-the-week thriller “Poker Face,” starring Natasha Lyonne as a casino worker with an uncanny ability to detect lies. The series, which aired on Peacock, earned critical acclaim and a couple of Emmy nominations. However, despite its critical and devoted fanbase success, Peacock canceled the show after two seasons. Johnson and producer MRC are shopping around a new iteration of “Poker Face” with Peter Dinklage taking over for Lyonne in the lead role.\n\t\n\n\tT-Street’s reputation for secrecy means that Hollywood rumor mills often work overtime. When the buzz is fairly “silent,” that can breed speculation, usually, wildly off-base. Before “Wake Up Dead Man” was unveiled at Toronto, rumors began circulating that it was “awful,” leaving some of us wondering if Johnson was going to step into his first major critical bomb. That didn’t happen. In fact, the film currently sits at a robust 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. The team is unfazed by any online chatter and prefers to let the work speak for itself once it reaches audiences.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf T-Street is the machine, the engine is its producers: Nikos Karamigios, Ben LeClair, Leopold Hughes and Katie McNeill. Each one, handpicked and battle-tested, runs point on the company’s tightly curated slate.\n\n\tEach of T-Street’s four lead producers arrived via different paths, but they share a creative shorthand that comes not just from years of working together but from a shared sense of purpose.\n\n\tLeClair, the company’s most senior member, started in a consultative capacity, helping Bergman and Johnson formalize a vision that would prioritize “quality and originality” over scale. “They didn’t want a traditional company,” he recalls. “We spent a long time discussing what it could be — and more importantly, what it shouldn’t be.”\n\n\tHughes, who began as an assistant on “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” describes his induction into the fold as “almost accidental.” After several years supporting Johnson through postproduction, he was asked to stay. “There was never a grand plan,” he says. “Just a consistent belief in doing the work, and doing it well.”\n\n\tMcNeill, the newest addition, arrived during the industry’s recent strikes. After previously bringing a project to T-Street for potential financing, she reached out to reconnect — only to find herself interviewing mid-conversation. “It was a little surreal,” she shares. “Ben started introducing me to everyone and talking about the ethos of the company. Eventually, I had to ask — ‘Wait, is this a job interview?'”\n\n\tAt a time when “producer” can be a murky title — a bargaining chip as often as a job description — the T-Street quartet maintains a refreshingly unglamorous perspective.\n\n\t“There’s no part of the movie we’re not involved in,” McNeill says. “You’re there in development, you’re there in prep, you’re on set, you’re in post, you’re helping with awards strategy. A real producer never says, ‘That’s not my job.'”\n\t\n\n\tKaramigios adds, “It’s a fill-in-the-gaps role. You’re the one making sure the organism functions — keeping things on track when others can’t or won’t.”\n\n\tThe team doesn’t “assign” films in the usual sense. Instead, producers organically claim projects based on relationships and instincts. “It’s all about trust,” LeClair shares. “If one of us is passionate about a project or a person, we all back it. That’s the model.”\n\n\tFor all the talk of creative control, what defines T-Street is its intense commitment to filmmaker support.\n\n\tBergman says the Hollywood moviemaking system can be fragmented and is broken: “One person develops the film, another runs production. Filmmakers feel abandoned. We wanted to change that.”\n\n\tThat shift is tangible, as seen with directors like Cord Jefferson (“American Fiction”) and Chloe Domont (“Fair Play”), who received full-spectrum producing support — from preproduction through release and awards strategy. “Those successes aren’t ours,” Bergman asserts. “They belong to our producers and the filmmakers. We just gave them the room.”\n\n\tMost T-Street films are cut in-house, with directors cycling through the space daily. “It’s part school, part studio, part clubhouse,” says Karamigios. “And the filmmakers feel that.”\n\n\tThe company has no mandate to adapt IP or chase market trends. Instead, they reverse-engineer the process: Find a voice worth investing in, then build a project around that.\n\n\t“We don’t go out looking for superhero scripts,” Johnson says. “We look for weird, honest people who have something to say. If that resonates with a big audience? Great. If not? At least we didn’t make something soulless.”\n\n\t“Wake Up Dead Man” is no exception. While audiences will come for the return of Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc, Johnson insists the thrill is still in discovery. “It’s not about milking a franchise,” he says. “It’s about making something good again. The rest is noise.”\n\n\tBoth previous “Knives Out” films received Producers Guild of America nominations for best picture, while Johnson earned Oscar noms for original screenplay with the first film and adapted screenplay for “Glass Onion.”\n\n\tFor a company so defined by its restraint, making only a handful of projects per year, its impact has been outsized.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve learned we can make a living making the movies we want to make,” Bergman says. “And that’s everything. We own our schedule. We own our office. We even own the building. That freedom is the real product here.”\n\n\tThat sense of autonomy — and camaraderie — is something Johnson doesn’t take for granted.\n\n\t“To have a partner you can 100% trust, that’s rare,” he said, nodding to Bergman. “It’s the biggest blessing in this business.”\n\n\t“Wake Up Dead Man” opens in theaters on Nov. 26 and debuts on the Netflix platform on Dec. 12.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Los Angeles Police Department confirmed Tuesday they are investigating a trip singer D4vd took to the Santa Barbara area sometime during the spring of 2025 following the disappearance of Celeste Rivas Hernandez. \n\n\tThe teenage victim was most recently reported missing in April 2024 from Lake Elsinore, Calif., about 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Her deceased body was found Sept. 8 inside the trunk of a Tesla. She had been there “for an extended period of time,” the medical examiner’s office previously said.\n\t\n\n\tThe LAPD said in a statement they intended to “dispel some information” as stories from TMZ and other local news channels began circulating online this week. TMZ reported Rivas’ body was partially frozen when it was examined, but the LAPD disputed she was not frozen when she was discovered. LAPD additionally noted she had not been decapitated, as one rumor suggested.\n\n\n\tAs for the alleged trip Burke took, “we have evidence that D4vd travelled to the Santa Barbara area… The reason for that trip is still under investigation and we’ve drawn no conclusions at this point about the relevance of the trip to this case.”\n\n\tOn Nov. 25, the medical examiner’s office said the Los Angeles police blocked the county coroner’s office from releasing details about the death of the teen girl. \n\n\t“As far as the court order, the LAPD sought to seal the records of the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s investigation into Celeste Rivas’ death,” they said. “That order was sought only to ensure detectives from Robbery-Homicide Division learned of important information surrounding her death before the media and the public. The order was not sought to undermine transparency.”\n",

He returned the next morning and sexually assaulted her before burying her body again.\n      \n\n          In a video confession to police, Ali noted that \"if I didn’t commit to being a monster, then she would have died for no reason.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Ali shares some things in common with Dahmer, who killed many of his male victims to have sex with their corpses.

    "body": "\n\tThe cast of “Grey’s Anatomy” is speaking out following the death of Eric Dane. The actor, who appeared as Dr. Mark Sloane for 145 episodes of the ABC medical drama, died on Feb. 19 after a battle with ALS.\n\n\t“Eric was a light. You’d see it effortlessly shine from him on the set of Grey’s as well as when he was with Rebecca and the girls. During filming, he’d get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you! You will be missed,” Kim Raver, who portrays Dr. Teddy Altman on “Grey’s,” posted via Instagram. “My love and thoughts go out to Rebecca and their girls. We love you.”\n\t\n\n\tLongtime executive producer Krista Vernoff shared screenshots of a text conversation with Dane in 2021 when he returned to the show for a cameo, nine years after his exit.\n\n\n\t“I called Eric and he answered immediately. I said will you come back? I know it’s a pandemic and shooting is a nightmare but we’re gonna do it on the beach and keep our social distance because the world needs joy and Mark and Lexie are joy. He said where and when,” she captioned the post. “When I came to set that day, he said, we’re breaking the rules and hugging now right? The thing I will remember most about Eric Dane are his hugs. The best hugs. Oh my friend. I wish you peace.”\n\n\tDane, whose character was known as “McSteamy,” joined “Grey’s Anatomy” in Season 2 as a guest star. However, the audience quickly fell in love with the character, and he returned in Season 3 as a series regular. He made his final appearance in the second episode of Season 9, when Mark died after being taken off life support following a plane crash. Creator Shonda Rhimes has often said that the character was one of her favorites to write. He appeared in a 2021 episode, as part of Meredith’s dream sequence.\n\t\n\n\t“We are deeply saddened by the loss of Eric Dane,” ABC and 20th Television said in a statement. “His remarkable talent and unforgettable presence on ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ left a lasting impact on audiences around the world, and his courage and grace during his battle with ALS inspired so many. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and colleagues, as well as the many fans whose lives were touched by his work.”\n\n\tIn April 2025, only 11 months before his death, Dane announced he had been diagnosed with ALS.\n\n\tLast month, during the ALS Network Champions for Cures & Care Gala, Pompeo revealed in a pre-recorded video that she texted Dane immediately after learning of his diagnosis. “As soon as I heard about his diagnosis, I texted him, and I said, ‘I’m here if you want to speak.’ And my phone rang 30 seconds later,” she said at the time.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnimation suits Las Vegas. From “CSI” to “Hacks,” Sin City has no shortage of representations on television. But the Netflix comedy “Strip Law” — created by Cullen Crawford, an alum of the satirical site ClickHole as well as “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” — has an advantage in capturing the spirit of its setting. Thanks to the magic of its medium, “Strip Law” can craft a fictional version of Vegas that’s almost as absurd as the actual place: a city where magicians and animals have an annual cage match, beret-wearing comedian George Wallace is the mayor and a law firm’s clients can include an Austin Powers impersonator on trial for puking on an infant.\n\t\n\n\tSaid law firm is owned by Lincoln Gumb (Adam Scott), a straitlaced attorney who’s inherited the business from his late mother. Lincoln is a good lawyer, yet lacks the showmanship necessary to win over the jaded, capricious local jury pool: “You’re a Vegas lawyer, but you think you’re better than Vegas,” he’s told in the premiere. So Lincoln joins forces with magician Sheila Flambé (Janelle James), a “human highlight reel” who takes on the title of creative director to give Lincoln’s work a desperately needed dose of razzle-dazzle. Lincoln can file a brief, but only Sheila is willing to electrocute herself in court to prove that heaven isn’t real. (“Strip Law” does provide context for this unorthodox tactic, but it also doesn’t need much.)\n\n\n\tLincoln’s other employees — surly teenage niece Irene (Shannon Gisela), who acts as in-house investigator, and aging fixer Glem Blorchman (Stephen Root) — assist in these efforts, but like the old cliché about “Sex and the City,” the real main character of “Strip Law” is Las Vegas itself. Crawford and his writers cram in sight gags to build an exaggerated, if clearly affectionate, sense of place. The opening credits, which boast that the show was “proudly made by real, non-computer human beings,” speed past various storefronts on the titular iconic street. The signs vary episode to episode, but include “Circumcision by Elvis,” the “Mafia Goons Hall of Fame” and a “Sexxxual Grocery Store.” \n\t\n\n\tThe joke density of “Strip Law,” so rare on TV these days, makes it enormously likeable. So do the vocal performances: Scott is perfectly typecast as the downtrodden straight man who his new partner diagnoses with “a terminal case of Pete Buttigieg energy,” while Sheila is even more of a flamboyant wild card than James’ breakout character Principal Ava on “Abbott Elementary.” A meta streak gently pokes fun at the legal procedural genre “Strip Law” toys with the conventions of — “We just have to cut to the last part of these weekly cases where we do something inventive but kind of stupid and then win!” — while a willingness to experiment with the visuals leads to sequences in the style of anime or even live action, including cameos from a couple recognizable comedians.\n\n\tBut there’s also a deftly cultivated backstory that gives Lincoln’s arc some emotional stakes on top of its entertainment value. Along with her partner Steve Nichols (Keith David), Lincoln’s late mom was a great Vegas lawyer. (Credit to the writers of their firm’s jingle: “Nichols and gum, they’re two things in your pocket…” has been stuck in my head for days.) She was also, we come to realize, a subpar parent, and Lincoln’s attempts to both live up to and overcome her legacy reflect his complicated relationship with his hometown. Vegas can do a number on visitors, let alone a local — but “Strip Law” has a fondness for vintage flair and showmanship that proves infectious. Where else could your virtual reality HR training avatar be a composite of every member of the Rat Pack?\n\n\tAll 10 episodes of “Strip Law” are now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Hong Kong International Film Festival Society will present four projects selected through new partnerships with Jakarta Film Week, JAFF Market and the Japan Creator Support Fund at the upcoming HKIFF Industry Project Market.\n\n\tThe development-stage titles – Loeloe Hendra Komara’s “A Life Full of Holes,” Najam Yardo’s “PingPong,” Kusano Natsuka’s “Unknown Face” and the stop-motion animation “Hidari” from Kawamura Masashi and Ogawa Iku – join 42 previously announced in-development and work-in-progress projects for the 24th Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum. The market runs March 17-19 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre alongside FilMart, now in its 30th edition.\n\t\n\n\tHKIFF Industry is expanding its Jakarta Film Week partnership to include JAFF Market, supporting Indonesia’s film sector with backing from the country’s Ministry of Culture through its National Talent Management programme.\n\n\n\t“The ongoing collaboration with HKIFF Industry plays a crucial role in creating a sustainable platform for the development and networking of Indonesian talents and projects within the Asian and international film circuits,” said Vivian Idris, promoter of National Talent Management for Film.\n\n\tTwo Indonesian projects comprise the Jakarta Film Week & JAFF Market section. Komara’s “A Life Full of Holes” follows a 17-year-old girl who dreams of becoming a content creator while caring for her young siblings after her mother leaves to work overseas as a migrant worker. Komara’s “Tale of the Land” screened at Busan in 2024. Indra Yudhitya Irawan, Komara and Kuek Shee Heng produce the Indonesia-Taiwan co-production for Onomastika Films and Aview Images.\n\t\n\n\tYardo directs “PingPong,” inspired by the filmmaker’s personal experiences and following a disgraced Olympian banned from table tennis who is forced underground to earn a living from the sport while struggling to care for her senile father and navigating a strained relationship with her son. Hannan Cinthya produces for Arungi Films.\n\n\tHKIFF Industry’s separate collaboration with the Japan Creator Support Fund introduces the Film Frontier section, highlighting Japanese filmmakers seeking international co-production and collaboration opportunities.\n\n\t“We are thrilled to launch Film Frontier in partnership with HKIFF Industry. We hope to connect our next-generation filmmakers with international partners who can help bring their unique visions to life,” said Ikeda Kaori, managing director of UniJapan.\n\n\tThe inaugural Film Frontier selection features two projects. “Hidari,” a stop-motion animation from directors Kawamura and Ogawa, is inspired by the legend of Hidari Jingorō and set in a wood-punk vision of Edo-period Japan. The tale of vengeance, political conspiracy and legacy follows the sculptor battling mechanical soldiers and confronting his past. Matsumoto Noriko produces for Dwarf Studios.\n\n\tKusano directs “Unknown Face,” exploring the relationship of a bisexual woman and her partner who develop an intimacy with a stranger until a sudden shift in their dynamics forces them to wear strange, illegible faces resembling traditional Noh masks. Kusano’s “Domains” screened at Rotterdam in 2018. Miyoshi Gohey, Anocha Suwichakornpong and Paul Mori produce for Matataki Films GK.\n\n\tAll shortlisted projects will compete for cash and in-kind prizes across 17 categories, including development and post-production gap financing, equipment, filming and post-production services. The 24 award winners represent a total value of $360,000.\n\n\tThree sponsors are presenting awards for the first time. Kantana Holdings will offer three in-kind awards for digital intermediate post-production ($25,000), sound post-production ($25,000) and virtual production ($87,500). Phenom Films will support one project with in-kind post-production services valued at $38,500.\n\n\tSensitive skincare brand Cetaphil is collaborating to promote creative voices through the HAF Goes to Cannes program, supporting selected filmmakers as they showcase their work internationally.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMelissa Barrera is heading to Broadway.\n\n\tVariety has learned exclusively that the “Scream” and “In the Heights” star will make her Broadway debut in the campy spoof “Titanique,” stepping into the role of Rose for the musical’s upcoming Main Stem bow at the St. James Theatre in New York.\n\n\tThe award-winning comedy reimagines James Cameron’s 1997 blockbuster “Titanic” through the perspective and song catalog of Céline Dion.\n\n\n\tBarrera takes on the role of Rose DeWitt Bukater, immortalized on screen by Kate Winslet, in a spoof that asks what “really happened to Jack and Rose on that fateful night,” all filtered through Dion’s biggest hits. The musical features songs including “My Heart Will Go On,” “Because You Loved Me,” “All by Myself” and “To Love You More,” woven into a comedic retelling that leans into broad humor and theatrical absurdity.\n\t\n\n\tMarla Mindelle, the show’s co-creator, will reprise her role as Céline Dion. She co-wrote “Titanique” with Tye Blue and Constantine Rousouli. Also joining the Broadway company is four-time Emmy winner and Tony Award nominee Jim Parsons, who will play Rose’s mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, a role originated by Frances Fisher in the film. Grammy nominee Deborah Cox will play Unsinkable Molly Brown, portrayed by Kathy Bates in the film.\n\n\t“Titanique” first opened off-Broadway in June 2022 at the Asylum Theatre, then transferred to the Daryl Roth Theatre, where it ran for three years, closing in June 2025. During its off-Broadway run, the production expanded internationally with engagements in Sydney, London, Chicago and Paris.\n\t\n\n\tWith Barrera at the helm as Rose, the splashy send-up is poised to bring powerhouse vocals. Her most recent credits include Netflix’s “Your Monster.”\n\n\tSome of Barrera’s other recent credits include the Peacock television series “The Copenhagen Test” with Simu Liu. Her upcoming projects include roles in Renny Harlin’s action thriller “Black Tides” and the film adaptation of “The Collaboration,” directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah and starring Jeremy Pope and Paul Bettany.\n\n\tThe production will debut on Broadway this spring for a 16-week limited engagement. Previews begin March 26, with an official opening set for April 12. The production will conclude on July 12.\n\n\tBarrera is repped by IAG, imPRint and Range. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Euphoria” creator Sam Levinson is paying tribute to Eric Dane, who played Cal Jacobs on the HBO Max show. Dane died Thursday.\n\n\t“I’m heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend Eric. Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric’s family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing,” Levinson said in a statement to Variety.\n\n\tDane went public with his ALS diagnosis just last year.\n\n\n\tHBOMax said on Instagram, “We are deeply saddened by the news of Eric Dane’s passing. He was incredibly talented and HBO was fortunate to have worked with him on three seasons of Euphoria. Our thoughts are with his loved ones during this difficult time.”\n\t\n\n\tDane told Variety last year, “I’ve always had a profound respect for the craft of acting, but I never considered myself an artist. I could never admit it, until I started making ‘Euphoria.’ That’s when I gave myself the allowance to feel like I was an artist.”\n\n\tAbout working with Levinson, Dane said, “I just have so much trust in Sam Levinson that I don’t really need to know what’s happening. On the day, he can just tell me what to do and where to go, and I’m good with it.”\n\n\tKnown for his role as “McSteamy” on “Grey’s Anatomy,” Dane went on to play the complicated father of Jacob Elordi’s character on “Euphoria.” Over the years, the California native also appeared on “Gideon’s Crossing,” “Charmed” and “The Last Ship” and in films including “Marley and Me,” “Valentine’s Day” and “X-Men: The Last Stand.”\n\n\tLast year, he also appeared on Amazon Prime’s “Countdown” as a special agent.\n\t\n\n\tDane advocated for support for ALS through I Am ALS and told the Washington Post, “Not to be overly morbid,” he said. “but you know, if I’m going out, I’m gonna go out helping somebody.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAll3Media International has revealed that IDTV’s global format hit “The Traitors” has now been commissioned in 40 territories, with Indonesia becoming the latest market to adapt the psychological reality competition.\n\n\tThe Indonesian version will be produced by Falcon, the leading local film production and distribution company founded in 2010 by H.B. Naveen, with production slated for 2026. The series will bow on Falcon’s streaming platform as a 10-episode celebrity edition.\n\t\n\n\tThere are also new European adaptations, with versions heading to Slovakia and Estonia. Serbia’s PRVA TV has commissioned a local adaptation to be produced by Rainmaker, while Malta will receive a celebrity edition produced by Greatt for Television Malta. The latest orders follow recent commissions in Turkey, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, with an Indian version on Prime Video quickly picked up for a second season after a strong debut.\n\n\n\tThe format’s reach extends well beyond production. The “Traitors” brand has spread across six continents, with a London-based live experience currently running and a stage production confirmed for 2027. A consumer products rollout is also underway, encompassing tabletop games and a mobile game in development.\n\n\tThe ratings performance has been equally striking. The celebrity edition’s finale pulled in 15 million viewers on the BBC – marking it the top-rated broadcast of the year in the U.K. – with the series averaging 12.4 million viewers, a figure 249% above the slot average, and a 54.7% share that represented a 146% improvement on the slot norm. A second season has been commissioned. In Czech Republic, streaming platform Prima+ clocked 200 million video views last year – almost double the prior year’s figure — with “Zrádci,” the local adaptation, drawing the platform’s highest viewership; episodes from its second season were also simultaneously screened across 66 cinemas nationwide. In the U.S., Season 4 opened on Peacock to the franchise’s strongest debut to date, accumulating 3.2 billion minutes viewed within less than a month of its premiere.\n\t\n\n\tThe series has also carved out a formidable awards track record, taking home eight Emmy Awards – including Outstanding Reality Competition and Outstanding Host for a Reality or Competition Program for Alan Cumming for the U.S. Season 3 in 2025 – alongside two BAFTAs, two RTS Awards, five Asian Academy Creative Awards, a Rose d’Or and a Producers Guild Award.\n\n\t“‘The Traitors’ can only be described as a phenomenon,” said Louise Pedersen, CEO of All3Media International. “The global scale of the show and the passion of fans around the world is a testament to the originality and adaptability of the format and the skill of all of our local production partners. Reaching 40 territories at the start of 2026 is a significant milestone and we’re delighted that ‘The Traitors’ mix of intrigue, deception and drama will be delighting even more viewers around the world.”\n\n\tMichel Nillesen, managing director at IDTV, added: “Forty territories, and the game is only just beginning. This milestone underlines the global power of the format. ‘The Traitors’ proves that trust and betrayal resonate everywhere. We’re incredibly proud of this achievement and excited to continue expanding the brand internationally.”\n\n\tOriginally created and developed by IDTV in cooperation with RTL Creative Unit, “The Traitors” first aired on RTL 4 in the Netherlands in 2021 under the Dutch title “De Verraders.” The format brings together contestants in an elaborate setting where a concealed group of “Traitors” covertly plot to eliminate their fellow players, the “Faithful,” who must in turn expose and remove the Traitors in order to claim the prize money.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLike many TV watchers, I first took notice of Eric Dane on “Grey’s Anatomy.” His Dr. Mark Sloan — “McSteamy,” in the show’s parlance — was a gleeful agent of chaos, remixing the show’s existing couplings, thanks in large part to Dane’s smoldering charisma, wielded to great effect.\n\n\tDane, who died on Feb. 19 after a much-publicized diagnosis of ALS, was a magnetic figure. But in the years after his time on “Grey’s” ended (he left the show in 2012), Dane also became a more interesting actor, thanks in large part to one dynamite role. The kids of “Euphoria” get all the attention, but it was Dane’s pained performance as a man fighting against his every impulse that lent that show’s first two seasons genuine ballast. Without Dane’s performance as Cal Jacobs, a closeted dad whose desires have become an all-consuming enemy, neither Jacob Elordi (playing Cal’s son) nor Hunter Schafer (playing a high-school girl caught up in an unhealthy relationship with Cal) would have nearly as much to play. \n\t\n\n\tBut his performance on “Euphoria” is brilliant on its own terms. As Cal, Dane could barely express what he truly wanted: What came so easily to the sexually fluent McSteamy at the anything-goes Seattle Grace Hospital was suddenly bound up and hidden when he had to play chaperone to the teens at Euphoria High. That we who’d seen “Grey’s” knew how readily Dane could play friendly and funny and sexy only made the triumph of Dane’s frigidity on “Euphoria” more apparent. Here, he was a man so uncomfortable in his own skin that he demanded to elicit that discomfort in others. His son, as well as Jules, a trans teen who’d been intrigued by his admittedly inappropriate entreaties, recoiled at his touch. And why wouldn’t they? Cal — taciturn, and yet quick to startling waves of anger — seemed like the kind of man who’d blanch at his own reflection. \n\t\n\n\tBack in Season 2, before Dane’s health took a turn, I recall thinking to myself that the mere fact of this performer taking this role was quite daring. Yes, actors need to work, and this was a job with HBO, but there’d been no guarantee that “Euphoria” would perform quite like it did (coming to dominate culture every Sunday night during its run), and, well — he’d been McSteamy! Wouldn’t other roles like that, leading-man parts with a twist, appeal more? Instead, Dane leaned into a part that got its own standout episode, one in which we saw a flashback to Cal’s past exploring his sexuality with men before seeing present-tense Cal, drunk and despondent, excoriate his family before literally pissing on the floor as he walks out on them. \n\n\t“Euphoria” gets a lot of heat for being over-the-top, but, within its loopy creative universe, the performances must be carefully calibrated so as to keep the whole thing from crashing down. And Dane did just that; he returns for the upcoming Season 3, and I have every belief his performance will be a highlight. \n\n\tI’d assumed it was the Shonda Rhimes training that kept his “Euphoria” performance coherent, but, when I interviewed Dane last year, he told me there was something else at work, too: a new willingness to be freewheeling and to take risks. “I’ve always had a profound respect for the craft of acting, but I never considered myself an artist,” he said. “I could never admit it, until I started making ‘Euphoria.’ That’s when I gave myself the allowance to feel like I was an artist.”\n\n\tAnd it was art he made: Dane brought to life someone pushing so hard against walls that cannot come down in his understanding of his sexuality that the effort had to break something. In this same interview, I had felt obliged to ask Dane (delicately, to the point of awkwardness) about his living with ALS. The diagnosis had been announced months prior, and Dane was now promoting the Amazon series “Countdown,” on which he played a supporting role, but the news hung in the air. “I really don’t want to talk about it,” he said. “I made the announcement. That’s what’s going on with me; it’s very personal to me.”\n\n\tFair enough. But, attempting to move on from a head-on discussion of the private matter of health, I wondered: What work did Dane envision doing going forward? “I am ready and willing to do just about anything, but I have limitations that I understand will preclude me from playing certain roles,” he said. “I’m working on ‘Euphoria.’ I finished ‘Countdown.’ As far as that goes, I’m pretty capable.”\n\t\n\n\tThe clock is cruel; an actor who will live forever in youth as a hunky surgeon is gone before his time. But the passage of time is the whole point of his final major performance, too. Cal Jacobs let his life slip away from him piece by piece until he realized, all at once, that it was gone. The cordial, insightful Eric Dane who, even when sick, raved in our interview about his younger colleagues and told me that he’d come to realize that how one conducts oneself on a set — and off it — is the measure of a performer? I met him only briefly, but I don’t think he made the same mistake. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe movies we call faith-based often take the form of disaster porn. It only makes sense. These movies, framed as tests of faith, are built around a literalization of the spirit of Job and Jesus — the Biblical figures who found transcendence by facing the worst that life could dish out. (That’s how a lot of us find our faith.)\n\n\t“I Can Only Imagine,” the 2018 Christian rock drama that was framed as a biopic of Bart Millard (John Michael Finley), the lead singer of MercyMe, may have been a feel-good parable pegged to one of the biggest Christian pop hits of all time (the title song, which was released in 2001). But it was all about overcoming the darkness — in this case, the fact that Bart was drowning in daddy issues, with a father, played by Dennis Quaid (who lent a veteran great actor’s force to the movie), with violent abusive ways that shadowed Bart. How do you find your faith when your father has taught you to hate yourself? That’s the dilemma “I Can Only Imagine” tapped into, though of course it was also a sentimental disease-of-the-week movie in which the bad dad sees the error of his ways, and the kid becomes a whopping success. In faith-based cinema, the miracles never cease.\n\t\n\n\tIf you’re wondering why it took eight years to make “I Can Only Imagine 2,” the answer is: It wasn’t until 2017 that MercyMe released a song, “Even If,” that was even half a big as “I Can Only Imagine” (the movie involves the writing of that song). Nevertheless, with Bart’s daddy war behind him, you wonder what the directors, Andrew Erwin and Brent McCorkle, are going to come up with for drama. The addictive temptations of fame? Nope. Bart, still played by John Michael Finley, is now a devoted family man, shaggier and a bit bulkier than before (which makes him seem all the more like the G-rated Eddie Vedder of power-chord Biblical uplift). But the movie opens with the discovery that his young son, Sam, has type 1 diabetes; this means that the kid is going to have a life of insulin shots and general caution. Okay, we think, and that means…?\n\t\n\n\tIt means that 10 years later, Bart is moody, addled, struggling to write another hit song, staring at his notebook as he waits for the inspiration to strike. And it means that Sam (Sammy Dell), now a surly teenager, balks at how his dad is always pestering him to measure his insulin levels and take his shots on time. They fight about it; it’s starting to toxify their relationship. “Dreams don’t pay the bills,” says a voice on the soundtrack, and we recognize it as Dennis Quaid’s Arthur, dispensing that don’t-follow-your-bliss advice that made Bart’s youth such a joy.\n\n\tSo when the moment arrives for Bart to go on the road again, piling onto the MercyMe tour bus, an idea comes to the fore: What if Sam went on tour with them? “I’m worried it might break him,” says Bart. His wife, Shannon (Sophie Skelton), replies, “Or he just might fix you.” Spoiler alert! \n\n\t“I Can Only Imagine” had a clean dramatic line of despair and redemption, and that’s why it worked as a movie (and made $83 million domestic). Yet even if you go into “I Can Only Imagine 2” feeling immersed in the Bart Millard saga, the new movie is a bit of an odd duck, like a faith-based drama on tranquilizers, because it keeps tossing out conflicts that aren’t all that major (or convincing). The tension between Bart and Sam is on a low enough simmer that any parent will recognize it, but we also can’t help but notice the following: that Sam is an aspiring musician, so it would be the most natural thing in the world for his benevolent Christian-family-man rock-star dad to, you know, pick up a guitar and play with him. But no! Bart has to learn the lesson that he’s been ignoring his son’s dream, just like his dad did. It’s a bit of “Cat’s in the Cradle,” though fuzzier and less biting.\n\n\tAnd then there’s Tim Timmons (Milo Ventimiglia). He’s the singer-songwriter who’s been chosen to be MercyMe’s opening act, and he’s an irascible contradiction: a bearded folk-rock hipster who specializes in busting people’s chops, yet he’s also the most pious person on the tour bus, devoted to his book on the history of hymns. When he asks Sam to be his guitar tech, we wonder if he’s going to emerge as a rival father figure for Bart. But no. He’s just on hand to give Bart some badly needed pep talks about what faith really means — which is being grateful for each and  every day, and doing so by finding the beauty in it. (He draws a “tattooed” cross on his wrist each day to remind himself.) Ventimiglia is such an appealing actor that I was touched by this lesson, even as I snapped back to the gauzy feeling that I was being given a fortune cookie dressed up as Sunday school.\n\t\n\n\tJohn Michael Finley play Bart as a surly good man in a funk. You could say that he has privileged problems, and the film never strains to make it look otherwise. That’s what’s mildly genuine about it; it’s not overinflating Bart’s crisis of faith into a melodramatic big deal. But I also think that could limit the audience for “I Can Only Imagine 2.” On the tour bus, Bart and his buddies, like the band manager, Brick (Trace Adkins), who’s like an aging biker with the voice of Sam Elliott, engage in a form of badinage that I would characterize as bro Christianity. They’re devout, but they’re just dudes. And that’s kind of the point. “I Can Only Imagine 2” isn’t really caught in some Christian niche. It’s as universal a warm bath as a Hallmark Channel movie, leaving it to you to decide if that’s what Jesus had in mind.\n",

Margarita tells us Quinton knew that was a possibility -- because she says he knew her estranged husband refuses to sign the divorce papers.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          We broke the story ...

    "body": "\n\t“The Copenhagen Test” is an espionage thriller that turns on loyalty, revenge and integrity. The Peacock series follows Alexander Hale (Simu Liu), an intelligence analyst with The Orphanage, an organization that serves as a watchman for the United States intelligence communities. Founded by the clandestine St. George (Kathleen Chalfant) and with Peter Moira (Brian d’Arcy James) at the helm, The Orphanage has never been compromised. When Alexander is promoted to field work, however, things take a shocking, perilous turn. “The Copenhagen Test” has a great deal of potential, but its overly complicated plot, crammed with too many characters, leads nowhere.\n\t\n\n\tThree years after his last in-field mission as a special forces soldier, Alexander feels stunted in his current role at The Orphanage. Though his personal life is looking up — he recently started dating a woman named Michelle (Melissa Barrera) — his career has gone stale. Disillusioned with his position as an analyst, Alexander interviews for a more expansive role in a newly formed operation, putting him and his work rival, Edmond Cobb (Mark O’Brien), in competition.\n\n\n\tBut Alexander isn’t exactly honest about his health: He’s secretly suffering from migraines and panic attacks, mitigated only by the pills his ex-fiancée, Dr. Rachel Kasperian (Hannah Cruz), covertly gives him. What’s more, the last three assets he was assigned to track have been exposed, prompting a review of all analysts at the organization.\n\n\tStill, following the guidance of his mentor, Victor Simonek (Saul Rubine), Alexander lands the promotion. On the heels of that, he discovers his brain has been hacked for months, thus the headaches: A new technology has given the hacker unprecedented access to everything he sees and hears. Horrified that he might be seen as disloyal, he comes clean to Moira, who, along with St. George, decides to use this knowledge to their advantage and smoke out the perpetrator. The pair enlist Samantha Parker (Sinclair Daniel) to act as Alexander’s handler, documenting and anticipating his every mood.\n\t\n\n\tDespite the intriguing premise, “The Copenhagen Test” never fulfills its promise. What should be a gripping thriller centered on new, uncharted technology and questionable loyalties degenerates into a jumbled mess. The eight-episode first season is so overstuffed that audiences likely won’t be able to follow all the threads, which barely come together in the end. From the sprawling cast of characters to the various missions and timelines, there is too much to wade through. Forming a genuine connection to Alexander, or feeling sympathy for him, is a stretch because the character remains wooden, never fully realized. Moreover, when the villain and their motivations are finally revealed, the discovery feels neither revelatory nor meaningful.\n\n\t“The Copenhagen Test” presents plenty of compelling plot points. In addition to uncovering who hacked Alexander and why, there is also the history of the previously “unhackable” Orphanage, as well as commentary on xenophobia, racism and birthright citizenship and the question of who is “allowed” to be an authentic American. Yet, because creator Thomas and his writers’ room take viewers on such a dull and unwieldy mission, the show loses momentum and interest as it muddles its way to the climax.\n\n\tUltimately, the Peacock show may have a stellar cast and a solid concept, but the execution falls flat. The pacing is overlong, removing much of the tension and excitement that make thrillers so fascinating to watch. A tighter episode count and a streamlined timeline likely would have improved the series’ structure. However, amid so much other programming in the thriller genre, “The Copenhagen Test” isn’t clever enough to stand out.\n\n\tAll eight episodes of “The Copenhagen Test” premiere Dec. 27 on Peacock.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron revealed to Entertainment Weekly that he will hold a press conference to reveal the plot details of “Avatar 4″ and “Avatar 5” if the franchise ends after “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” the third movie in the franchise that is currently playing in theaters. The Oscar-winning director has been vocal on the “Fire and Ash” press tour that the future of the “Avatar” franchise depends on the third movie being a financial success. Cameron is prepared to end the series if it’s not. \n\t\n\n\t“I don’t know if the saga goes beyond this point. I hope it does,” Cameron told EW. “But, you know, we prove that business case every time we go out… If we don’t get to make 4 and 5, for whatever reason, I’ll hold a press conference and I’ll tell you what we were gonna do. How’s that?”\n\n\n\tCameron said his other option is to novelize his scripts for “Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5,” adding: “There’s so much culture and backstory and lateral detail in these characters that’s been worked out. I’d love to do something that’s at that level of granular detail.”\n\n\tDuring an interview with Variety, Cameron said “we’re getting ahead of ourselves” when asked about “Avatar 4” because “we’ve got to make some money with this one. Every time we go out, we have to prove this crazy business case yet again. The world has changed. We all know the stats, where theatrical is. It’s been a bad year. It’s starting to perk up a little bit with a couple of recent releases: ‘Wicked: For Good’ has done well, and ‘Zootopia 2’ is doing well. So, we’ll see.”\n\n\tIt appears Cameron might not need to hold a press tour to reveal the final two “Avatar” movies because “Fire and Ash” is performing quite well at the box office. The movie crossed the $500 million mark at the worldwide box office after one week in theaters and is expected to have strong holds into the new year. The previous two “Avatar” movies both cleared the $2 billion mark worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tJon Landau, the franchise’s late producer, let it slip to Gizmodo in 2022 that “Avatar 5” brings the Na’vi characters to Earth, adding: “And we go to it to open people’s eyes, open Neytiri’s eyes, to what exists on Earth.”\n\n\tCameron has left it up in the air whether or not he will direct the next two “Avatar” movies himself. He told Empire in 2022 that helming the franchise is “all-consuming” and he might want to “pass the baton” to another director starting with “Avatar 4.” But he recently said before “Fire and Ash’s” release that “there’s no reason not to” direct the next sequel himself.\n\n\t“I’m healthy, I’m good to go. I’m not going to rule it out,” Cameron added. “I mean, I’ve got to make it in a vigorous way, to handle the kind of volume and energy of the work for another six or seven years. You know what I mean? I might not be able to do that… [but] if I can, I’ll just do it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains details about Episode 6 of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” has everything a primetime drama could ask for – very hot men, romance and, of course, sex. But what really sold star Hudson Williams on the series was the quiet yet heavy scene in the Season 1 finale that shows Shane’s mother (Christina Chang) asking her son for forgiveness for not allowing him to feel safe enough to come out to her sooner as gay.\n\t\n\n\t“That scene was the scene that ruined me the most when I read the script,” Williams tells me. “It was the scene that I was like, ‘If I don’t get to play Shane Hollander.’ It’s also a scene that’s not in the book, but to me it is the quintessential wrap-up scene to that arc for him and his mom. Period.”\n\n\n\tFor those who may not already know, “Heated Rivalry” is Jacob Tierney’s six-episode adaptation of Rachel Reid’s queer hockey romance novel series “Game Changers.” The show, acquired for U.S. distribution by HBO Max from Canadian streamer Crave, follows Shane Hollander and Ilya Rosanov (Connor Storrie), two superstar hockey players who fall in love as they navigate a secret years-long affair. The show has been greenlit for a second season.\n\n\tThe mother-and-son scene filmed over two days. “The first time we couldn’t get through it because it started raining,” Hudson recalls. “And then we came back the next day to shoot it, Jacob goes, ‘I rewrote it.’ So Christina and I are in the little makeup room of this little cottage, memorizing the scene, and it was so beautiful. It made so much sense. It stands on the right side of what I think a parent should be because there are outdated notions. There are old school ways of parenting that maybe we can leave in the past…As someone who thinks of raising their kids in the future and wanting to be a father, this is the environment you have to foster.”\n\t\n\n\tWe truly don’t know until we see her accept him if she is going to accept him or reject him. Will she be like, “You’ve just ruined your career?” But in the end, she’s talking about how this could be good for endorsement deals.\n\n\tShane gets a release to a degree, but I’m not sure it’s a full one. I think there’s still a degree to Shane where it’s like, a part of me wanted a bigger release. I remember leaving and going, “I wish I could pour myself into it and completely get vulnerable.” As an actor, that’s never really been that hard for me. I was retroactively trying to figure out why am I not fully able to get this. But then, I was like, “Oh, it’s Shane who isn’t able to get that fully.” It’s a little bit of a release he gets but even still, he’s avoiding her a little bit. He can’t look her in the eyes and feel completely like he’s lived to all the standards of what he thinks this unwritten idea of what a man is between them.\n\n\tI love that Ilya was the first to say, “I love you.” He said it in the Russian monologue, but that doesn’t count for Shane because he didn’t know what Ilya was saying.\n\n\tThe motherfucker beat me.\n\n\tWere you surprised he said it first?\n\n\tYeah, but even though Shane doesn’t say it first, he says all these things that are, if they’re not love, what the fuck are they? You know, “Let’s start a foundation.” He’s staying up in the middle of the night plotting their way. When Ilya says, “You think that far ahead, Hollander?” “I do about this.” Hollander is not a planner. He’s a diligent worker. He’s someone who is routine — dial in, show up in the game today, show up in practice right now. Forget in five years. Be the best hockey player now. It’s out of character to let this game plan run so far ahead. But it is because he loves Ilya so dearly. So I think he, even though he didn’t say it first, he made that cottage a home for Ilya to be able to say it.\n\n\tI thought the cottage was going to be, excuse my French, a fuck fest. But this was more about the emotional journey and being a couple.\n\n\tJacob Tierney recently said it — it’s boyfriend.\n\n\tBut then there’s the blowjob scene. That was comedy.\n\n\tThat was improv.\n\n\tWhat?\n\n\tYeah, to a degree. Connor and I were kind of goofing off in the makeup trailer, which was a cottage that was a two-minute drive away from that cottage, getting ready. I was preparing my monologue the whole morning. I’m prepping it, working it. Then Connor, being the great scene partner he is, he was like, “I’ll be here doing this.” Then he did something and we were hitting each other, goofing off. Then he’s hitting me, hitting me and he did this slap. I was filming myself on my phone doing this. I was like, “Do that again.” I couldn’t hold in my laughter because it was so brilliant. It’s so funny, and it makes sense for where they’re at in the story. I remember showing that to the intimacy coordinator. She was cackling. She’s like, “You have to do that.” Then Jacob was like, “Go for it. Go crazy.” The first take was the first time I broke broke because Connor is taking all the liberties. I am shoving him. I’m slapping him back. I’m putting the phone away to get in the gasps and moans. I’m so happy with how that scene turned out.\n\t\n\n\tShane and Ilya are finally comfortable with each other enough for that. They’ve let their guards down.\n\n\tI heard Jacob say earlier today, “That’s boyfriends.” You don’t get the blow job on the phone from your fuck buddy or your friends with benefits. You get that when you’re in a relationship. In Episodes 1 and 2, it’s lust — it’s charged and fast. But now we have humor and levity within the sex.\n\n\tWhat was it like filming in the cottage for the first time?\n\n\tIt’s when sentiment of the show really matched the sentiment of where we are in filming. That was the last two days of shooting. The last scene we shot was Ilya talking about his mom when he’s on my lap. I remember the first time we walked through there, I was like, “Damn right, Mr. Real Estate! This is a pretty nice cottage.” That was finally where Shane can be as boring as he wants and as fun as he wants. He gets to be everything. They have those two weeks.\n\n\tAnd then you literally ride off into the sunset.\n\n\tIt’s still bittersweet. A lot of people have said that’s a very happy ending, but I’m like, “This isn’t a straight story.” This is not the happy ending because they’re still in the closet. They’re not coming out to Reebok, they’re not coming out to anyone. They got caught. It looks more like forgiveness than pride. That’s where they’re at. Forgiveness implies there’s something that was wrongfully done.\n\n\tThere’s shame around being caught. Just the word “caught” implies something to be ashamed about.\n\n\tAnd they were just kissing. They’re not fucking butt naked on the countertop.\n\n\tDo you have any plans to leave the internet?\n\n\tI have been periodically leaving the internet. I touch into the internet. I try to stay gone, but very luckily, it’s been pretty warm. The hateful comments are easy to disregard to a degree because they’re coming from such vile places of bias or they’re just obnoxious. It’s closer to trolling than it is criticism.\n\n\tAlso, “Heated Rivalry” is not reality. It’s like a good rom-com where we get to fantasize about love and romance.\n\n\tIt’s optimistic.\n\n\tIt’s OK to be optimistic. So many people just want to be negative.\n\n\tEven queer storytellers sometimes want to double down on pessimism. I think the reason why our show is doing so well is it doesn’t want to reinforce the worst fears.\n\t\n\n\tDo you like tuna melts?\n\n\tI do, but I don’t eat carbs or cheese. But as a treat, I’ll take a tuna melt with a nice brioche.\n\n\tThis Q&A has been edited and condensed.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSigourney Weaver recently told The New York Times that she once stood up to James Cameron during their first movie together, 1986’s “Aliens.” The science-fiction action movie marked Weaver’s return as Ellen Ripley after the success of Ridley Scott’s “Alien.” Cameron was new to the franchise and was butting heads on set with a young female actor who was struggling with some of the props.\n\n\t“I sort of trundled up to him and I said, ‘You know, when you yell at an actor, you yell at all of us, so understand that what she was doing actually was very hard. Maybe shoot something else while she gets used to doing this stuff the way you want it,’” Weaver remembered. \n\t\n\n\tCameron took her advice, she added. Weaver said: “He’s a good guy. I really do think Jim has mellowed.”\n\n\tThe actor also remembered getting dinner with Cameron after the two wrapped production on “Aliens” and “he hadn’t been like that directing. He was wildly funny, witty. I can understand why that guy couldn’t come out during ‘Aliens,’ because that was a tough shoot, especially for him. Let’s put it this way: I’m glad I wasn’t shooting ‘The Abyss’ with him.”\n\n\tWeaver is referring to Cameron’s 1989 thriller starring Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The film’s production was fraught, to say the least, with the cast and crew’s health and safety constantly in jeopardy. As recounted by SyFy: “Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on set, and Harris admitted he broke into a fit of sobbing while driving home one day because of the stress. At one point, a lightning storm ripped a hole in the black tarp covering the tank, and since repairing it took too much time and production was already running over, they started shooting at night. Too much exposure to chlorine burned divers’ skin and turned their hair white.”\n\t\n\n\t“We were guinea pigs, in a way,” Harris once told Entertainment Weekly. “Jim wasn’t quite sure how this was all gonna go down… [in the drowning scene I was] screaming at her to come back and wake up, and I was slapping her across the face and I see that they’ve run out of film in the camera — there’s a light on the camera — and nobody had said anything. And Mary Elizabeth stood up and said, ‘We are not animals!” and walked off the set. They were going to let me just keep slapping her around!”\n\n\tWhatever Cameron was like on past sets did not deter Weaver from reuniting with him on the “Avatar” franchise. She’s starred in all three “Avatar” movies so far. Her co-star Stephen Lang told The Times that “a part of Jim that has leavened and lightened much over the years,” adding: “I think he embarked upon a course of self-improvement, and I don’t say that this is actually necessarily a conscious thing that he did; I just think that he’s kind of geared that way.”\n\n\t“Marinating, maybe, is a good term, right?” Cameron himself told the publication. “It’s not like I was a screamer all day long. But every once in a while. Everybody’s entitled to a bad day. If you’re not doing the job, then get out of my way.”\n\n\tCameron’s latest, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” is now playing in theaters nationwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmbassador Richard Grenell, the Trump-appointed president of the Kennedy Center, said the organization will seek $1 million in damages from noted jazz musician Chuck Redd after Redd abruptly canceled this year’s free Christmas Eve concert in protest of the center’s renaming to “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\n\tIn the letter sent Dec. 26 to Redd, first reported by the AP, Grenell wrote: “Your decision to withdraw at the last moment — explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure — is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution.”\n\t\n\n\t“This is your official notice that we will seek $1 million in damages from you for this political stunt,” Grenell wrote.\n\n\n\tIn a post on X Friday night about his legal threat to Redd, Grenell said, “The left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts. But we will not let them cancel shows without consequences. The Arts are for everyone — and the Left is mad about it.”\n\n\tRedd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\tRedd had led the annual Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center since 2006. On Wednesday, he told the AP that he nixed this year’s event after Trump’s name was added to the organization’s building and website. “When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd said, per the AP.\n\n\tWorkers on Dec. 19 added Trump’s name to the center, coming one day after the White House claimed that the Kennedy Center board of trustees — handpicked by President Trump — voted unanimously to rename the facility the “Trump Kennedy Center.”\n\t\n\n\tLegal experts say the renaming of the center is illegal, because a 1964 federal law established its name as “The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts” after the slain president and explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from adding any other name to the building’s exterior. On Monday (Dec. 22), U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) sued Trump and the Kennedy Center’s board seeking to force the removal of Trump’s name from the organization, saying an act of Congress is required to change its name.\n\n\tThe free Dec. 24 concert at the Kennedy Center had been scheduled to take place Tuesday at 12 p.m. at the center’s Millennium Stage. “Join in our annual Christmas Eve Jazz Jam for an evening of music that’ll fill you with holiday cheer,” the cultural center had said in promoting the event.\n\n\tRedd, 67, is “well known internationally as a performer on drums and vibraphone” and is featured on more than 80 recordings, according to his website. The musician began recording and touring at the age of 21 when he joined the Charlie Byrd Trio. He also became a member of the Great Guitars (Barney Kessel, Byrd and Herb Ellis) and served as artist-in-residence at the Smithsonian Jazz Café in Washington, D.C., from 2004-08. Redd also was a member of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra for 15 years.\n\n\tAfter Trump took office for a second term in February 2025, Kennedy Center president Deborah Rutter was fired. Trump then appointed Grenell, who was ambassador to Germany during the first Trump administration and had served as Trump’s envoy for special missions. Trump also ousted Democratic board members of the Kennedy Center and replaced them with his own allies.\n\n\tTrump had criticized the Kennedy Center for curating woke programming. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA — ONLY THE BEST,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in announcing Grenell’s appointment. At the Kennedy Center’s opening night of “Les Misérables” in June, four drag queens attended the performance and were seated below the presidential box, CNN reported.\n\n\tSeparately Friday, Trump posted images on Truth Social of “potential marble armrests” for seats at the Kennedy Center. “Unlike anything ever done or seen before!” the president wrote.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 5, Volume 2 of “Stranger Things, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tOnce more unto the breach, “Stranger Things” viewers.\n\n\tIn the last episode of Volume 2 of the fifth and final season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” the whole Hawkins gang is setting out on a mission to destroy Vecna once and for all by venturing into the Abyss — a world connected to ours via a wormhole we know as the Upside Down.\n\t\n\n\tThroughout Episodes 5, 6 and 7 — which comprise Volume 2 — creators Matt and Ross Duffer gave us more “Stranger Things” lore than ever before, and set up the stakes for the upcoming series finale, dropping at 5 p.m PT on Dec. 31.\n\n\n\tThey revealed Henry’s powers were spread to Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and her Hawkins Lab siblings through blood transfusions on pregnant mothers, and that the military tried use Kali’s (Linnea Berthelsen) blood to restart the experiment — but would much prefer El’s blood, which is why they’ve been hunting for her.\n\n\tThey showed a young Henry Creel stumble down a mine shaft in the desert of Nevada, a scene viewers who have seen Broadway play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” will recognize as the day Henry somehow entered Dimension X, left with some newfound powers and was fundamentally changed into the evil person we know today. He meets an injured man protecting a briefcase holding something valuable enough to shoot Henry in the hand to try to protect it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoah Schnapp as Will Byers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere was Will’s (Noah Schnapp) emotional coming out scene, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Nancy’s (Natalia Dyer) cathartic breakup scene, Max’s (Sadie Sink) epic return to the world of the living and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and so much more.\n\t\n\n\tHere to break it all down for Variety — and tease where things will go in the “Stranger Things” series finale —  is executive producer Shawn Levy, who directed Episode 6 and co-directed Episode 7 alongside the Duffer brothers.\n\t\n\t\tWe now know Eleven is the most successful of Brenner’s experiments because she tolerated the blood transfusion from Henry the best. And this means that even if the team kills Vecna, this cycle is not over, because the military wants to use El to make more kids like her. Kali tells El they should kill themselves to end it. Can you talk about creating those life and death stakes for Eleven going into the series finale?\t\n\n\tWell, first of all, that was incredibly concisely summarized. \n\t\n\t\tThank you. \t\n\n\tI hope that if anyone ever asks me to summarize the plot revelations of Volume 2, I can just remember your words, because they were incredibly succinct. I mean, to your point, these are profound existential questions being asked in Volume 2. And this deep questioning of, what is sacrifice? What is a worthy sacrifice? And how do you put the needs of the many in front of the needs of oneself? These are age-old existential questions, and I am really excited for fans to see our show wrestle with them. \n\n\tWe hopefully do it in ways that are emotional and still entertaining. But when you have characters like Holly and El questioning profound life and death values, like the ones they wrestle with in Volume 2, those scenes need to be handled with care. They need to be written with nuance, and they then need to be performed and directed with sensitivity to the weight of the issues being grappled with.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSadie Sink as Max Mayfield in Season 4 of “Stranger Things.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat did you want to show with the scene where Max and Holly (Nell Fisher) say goodbye in Vecna’s mind in Episode 6? How did you work through what real-world Max would look like, and what she could feasibly do to help now that she’s back?\t\n\n\tThe end of Episode 6, that was a really memorable day because I was given the privilege of directing a scene that required both actresses to deliver big time and with tremendous emotional weight. The writing was excellent. The actors, Nell and Sadie, stepped up so impressively, but it had this added layer of meaning for Sadie and I, because Episode 6 of Season 5 is in some ways an echo of our “Dear Billy” episode [Episode 4, Season 4] that Sadie and I are sort of connected for life in from Season 4. A similar red void, a similar epic run using both real speed and slow motion, and set against, no coincidence here, a new orchestration of “Running Up That Hill.”\n\t\n\n\tIt’s certainly a sequence that I’ll cherish forever, because it served as a bookend to “Dear Billy” in many ways, and it allowed Sadie and I to revisit that sequence from the end of “Dear Billy” that we will carry with us forever. Because even if we wanted to leave it behind, audiences around the world remind us of that sequence pretty much every day of our lives. So the design of this abstract red void with these extraordinary, odd, otherworldly structures, but with a glimpse of the world that is on the other side, the aspirational yearning that Max has carried with her is manifested. And when she looks through that cloudy portal and sees herself with Lucas next to her, still holding vigil, it was such an emotion premise for a scene, and I think it’s clear that it resonated emotionally for Sadie and all of us who were part of that sequence.\n\n\tOne day I’ll never forget filming Season 5 was that first scene after Max comes back to life when she is on that table in that laundry room. And it took, like, one take for her and Caleb to deliver some of their most beautiful work in any season. Many of us were teary as we watched these beautiful actors do such great work. I think that Max’s superpower, having returned to life, to the world, is that, as I think we say in the show, she’s been on the other side. She has, in some ways, mapped the target, and can therefore be an essential ally in strategizing how we go at that target, how we go after Vecna.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNatalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCan you talk about the choice to have Nancy and Jonathan’s relationship, which was built on a deep trauma bond, end by them having a new deeply traumatic shared experience that caused them to be honest?\t\n\n\tI love that the Duffers and the writers named the fact on camera, in character, they named the fact that the Nancy-Jonathan connection has been rooted in shared trauma. So I like that there’s an awareness, not only in the writing of the show, but in the characters. And we always knew that this was going to be the watershed “Jancy” scene that was almost a decade in the making, and it’s a long scene. It’s incredibly rich in its writing, and it’s acting, and Natalia and Charlie prepared for months for that scene. And I think in acknowledging the shared trauma in their history, Jonathan and Nancy are able to be honest about their past and clear-eyed in assessing their present and would-be future.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s it like to direct the revelations about what Vecna actually going to do, turn the world into the Upside Down? Is Vecna just a nihilist?\t\n\n\tWell, for one thing, I would say that for those of us, and anyone who has seen “The First Shadow” on stage, that “Stranger Things” play fills in a lot of blanks about Henry Creel’s backstory. And for me personally, knowing that I was going to be directing Jamie as Henry/One/Vecna in our final season, the stage play gave me a much deeper empathy for Vecna, and it gave me an understanding of the wounds he carries, where they came from, and how formative they were in his youth. \n\n\tSo yes, current day Vecna seems to be just straight up nihilistic, but the world has hurt him so much that now he just wants to hurt it back.\n\t\n\t\tDirecting Noah Schnapp in Will’s coming out scene in Episode 7, did you have any specific discussions about preferences in what Will would do and how others would react — even subtle details?\t\n\n\tCertainly that’s a question worth asking the Duffers. So Matt, Ross and I all chatted and worked with Noah well in advance of shooting that scene. And I personally ran through the scene with Noah and talked through it and the evolution of Will’s sharing in it. Bear in mind that Noah, quite famously and quite publicly, brings personal experience to that scene. So we came with a lot of instincts about how to approach it. And between Matt and Ross and I, and with the benefit of exceptional writing by the Duffers, it was about calibrating the feeling and calibrating how emotional Will gets at what stage of the scene. \n\n\tAnd as far as all of the listeners, all of those reaction shots that for me personally, as just a viewer, those are what really break me. Those cutaways to Jonathan to Robin to Max to Mike, those are just authentic reactions of Noah’s castmates and friends as their buddy gave a powerhouse performance in an all-timer of a scene. What you see on screen is what went down on that set, and it’s just authentic and honest and required very little prep or discussion.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMatt Duffer, Ted Sarandos, Ross Duffer, Shawn Levy and Bela Bajaria attend “Stranger Things” Season 5 World Premiere at TCL Chinese 6 Theatres on November 6, 2025 in Hollywood, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Getty Images for Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your final day on set like?\t\n\n\tLike for everyone, the last day was an emotional day. The two moments I will personally never forget are the very small, intimate read through of the final episode. It was literally the cast and maybe a half-dozen other people that were allowed in that room. I was lucky enough to be one of them — because I’ve walked the long road over a decade with the show — that day. And the way those actors, and particularly those young actors, came undone emotionally as we read it, is something so beautiful. I’ll never forget it.\n\t\n\n\tAnd then on my very last day, I went to the Wheeler basement, and it was empty. No one was shooting there, and I sat on those stairs, and I sat on that couch, and I just steeped myself in 10 years of memories, 10 years of this challenge, and above all, 10 years of this privilege of being a part of this show as both an executive producer and frequent director. It’s changed me forever, and I sat there in the quiet of that iconic basement feeling very grateful.\n\t\n\t\tThe man with briefcase that Henry meets in that mine shaft in the Nevada desert. What’s in that briefcase, Shawn? Is there more to the Henry/Dimension X story of how Henry got his powers that day in the desert than was shown in “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” that’s coming in the finale?\t\n\n\tYes. Hard, yes. Emphatic, “yes,” he said, as he nodded his head vigorously.\n\t\n\t\tIs the Abyss, the other world where Henry is — which is connected to Earth via the Upside Down/wormhole — also Dimension X, the place he originally entered when he first got his powers in the desert as a child?\t\n\n\tThat is a really great question you should ask the Duffers. And you can tell them that I believe I am correct in saying, no. It’s the Abyss, and I believe the Abyss is not Dimension X. Ask the Duffers, and I can’t wait to read your article, so I can finally understand the answer.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 2 Spoilers• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 1 Spoilers• Our 13 Burning Questions Ahead of the Series Finale• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff• Linda Hamilton on Being Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Biggest Fan’• Shawn Levy on ‘Sticking the Landing’ for Season 5• David Harbour on How ‘Stranger Things’ Has Changed Him\n",

    "description": "\n\tTyler Perry has been sued over allegations of sexual assault brought by a new accuser, an actor who appeared in the 2016 movie “Boo! A Madea Hallowe",
    "body": "\n\tTyler Perry has been sued over allegations of sexual assault brought by a new accuser, an actor who appeared in the 2016 movie “Boo! A Madea Halloween.”\n\n\tIn a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Mario Rodriguez alleges that Perry assaulted him on multiple occasions over several years at Perry’s Los Angeles home. According to the complaint, Perry allegedly made unwanted sexual advances toward Rodriguez, including a 2018 incident in which Perry “tightly hugged” him and “grabbed his penis.”\n\t\n\n\tRodriguez, who played “Frat Guy #10” in Perry’s “Boo! A Madea Halloween,” is suing for sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He is also bringing a claim against Lionsgate, distributor of “Boo! A Madea Halloween,” for allegedly ignoring Perry’s actions. Rodriguez is seeking at least $77 million. \n\n\n\tThe complaint describes an incident that allegedly occurred in Perry’s home screening room a few months after they met in 2015. “Mr. Perry then put his hand on Mr. Rodriguez’s leg and began rubbing his inner thigh right next to his penis. Mr. Perry told Mr. Rodriguez ‘It’s ok,’ while he continued to rub his thigh.” \n\n\tRodriguez alleges that the two broke off contact in 2019 but that Perry would periodically reach out to him after that. The complaint states that Rodriguez was motivated to bring his claim against Perry after reading reports about Derek Dixon’s lawsuit earlier this year.\n\n\tIn response to Rodriguez’s suit, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Perry, said in a statement shared with Variety, “Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab.” \n\t\n\n\tSpiro was referring to another lawsuit against Perry filed in June. Dixon, an actor who appeared on Perry’s BET series “The Oval,” accused the filmmaker of sexual harassment and assault.\n\n\tDixon, who appeared in 85 episodes of the drama show, alleged that while staying at the entertainment mogul’s guesthouse in June 2021, Perry grabbed his buttocks while intoxicated. The lawsuit also cited alleged text messages in which Perry is said to have made repeated sexual comments and advances over several years. Dixon is seeking at least $260 million in punitive damages.\n\n\tJonathan Delshad, a Los Angeles-based attorney who represents Rodriguez and Dixon, pointed to numerous text messages allegedly exchanged between Rodriguez and Perry that bolster his client’s claims.\n\n\t“Mr. Rodriguez is looking forward to his day in court and holding Mr. Perry accountable for his actions.  We do hope a jury awards enough money to make Perry regret his actions,” Delshad said. “Unfortunately, statements like those made by Perry’s attorneys do nothing but enable Mr. Perry to continue to victimize people like Mr. Rodriguez. My client looks forward to a jury’s determination of what happened.”\n\n\t“Mr. Rodriguez realized that Mr. Perry was continuing to use his power and influence to sexually assault hopeful actors and, with the voice of others, decided that it was time to tell his story, to obtain justice, and to finally stop Mr. Perry,” the new complaint states. “When Perry became aware that Rodriguez was going to file this action, Perry once again reached out to Rodriguez by text, telling Rodriguez that Perry did so much to help Rodriguez and was that Perry was feeling betrayed by Rodriguez.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is towering over the domestic box office during the first weekend of the new year.\n\n\tJames Cameron’s Na’vi adventure has collected $40 million from 3,825 North American theaters in its third weekend of release, declining 35% from the busy post-Christmas frame. Those ticket sales are pushing the third “Avatar” past $300 million domestically and $1 billion globally after just 18 days in theaters. “Fire and Ash” has crossed the coveted billion-dollar benchmark slower than 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which took 14 days, and original “Avatar,” which took 17 days. Now it’s a matter of where “Avatar: Fire and Ash” will top out at the box office — and whether the third installment has the stamina to surpass $2 billion like its predecessors.\n\t\n\n\tSince January is often glacial in terms of movie theater attendance, Hollywood studios barely release anything new around the dawn of the new year. That means holdover business from Thanksgiving and Christmas, such as “Zootopia 2,” “The Housemaid” and “Marty Supreme,” were behind “Avatar: Fire and Ash” on North American charts.\n\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” remained a force at No. 2 with $19 million from 3,285 venues, marking a minimal 4% drop from the previous weekend. After six weekends of release, the beloved animated sequel has grossed a mighty $363 million domestically and $1.588 billion globally. “Zootopia 2” recently outperformed “Frozen 2” ($1.45 billion) to become Walt Disney Animation’s highest-grossing movie of all time. That means the announcement of a third trip to the animal-filled metropolis can’t be too far off.\n\t\n\n\tLionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid” rose to No. 3 with $15.2 million from 3,070 screens, a barely-there 1% dip from the prior weekend. The R-rated film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has earned an impressive $75.7 million in North America and $133 million worldwide against a $35 million budget.\n\n\tFourth place went to A24’s “Marty Supreme” with $12.5 million from 2,887 locations, declining just 30% from the post-Christmas frame. So far, the Timothee Chalamet-led ping-pong dramedy has generated $56 million in North America, a great result for the original arthouse release. With those ticket sales, “Marty Supreme” has outgrossed the director Josh Safdie’s prior film “Uncut Gems” ($50 million globally) and ranks among A24’s biggest movies of all time. “Marty Supreme” cost $70 million to produce, making it the most expensive film to date for A24, so it’ll needs to remain a draw into the new year to justify its budget.\n\n\tSony’s action comedy “Anaconda” remained in fifth place with $10 million from 3,509 theaters, a drop of 31% from the prior weekend. After two weekends of release, the meta reboot of 1997’s “Anaconda, this one starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, has grossed $45.8 million in North America and $88 million globally against a $45 million production budget.\n\n\tAnother Christmas release, the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue,” slid to the No. 8 spot with $5.87 million from 2,705 venues, a scant 17% drop. So far the tear-jerker, led by Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson as performers in a Neil Diamond cover band, has grossed $25 million domestically and $30 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.\n\n\tAlthough the year is very young, 2026 is already pacing ahead of 2025 by roughly 30%, according to Comscore. Last year’s revenues hit $8.9 billion across 12 months, a modest 1.5% increase from 2024 though just short of the $9 billion that analysts had expected the industry to generate. As Hollywood prepares to unveil major blockbusters — including “Avengers: Doomsday,” “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” and “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” — will this year’s grosses manage to surpass the elusive $9 billion mark?\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Palm Springs International Film Awards gala delivered its annual blend of star wattage and Oscar-season momentum on Saturday evening, with candid speeches, emotional reveals and a last-minute reshuffling prompted by an absent honoree.\n\n\tOne of the night’s most buzzy moments came from Miley Cyrus, who accepted the Outstanding Artistic Achievement Award for the original song “Dream as One” from James Cameron’s blockbuster “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Presented by one of the film’s stars, Jack Champion, Cyrus spoke openly about reinvention, and her desire for Oscar recognition.\n\t\n\n\t“Reinvention is something I continuously strive for in my music,” she said, drawing loud applause as she acknowledged her ambitions beyond the recording studio.\n\n\n\tThe evening had an interesting blend of standout moments. One belonged to Timothée Chalamet, who was a constant presence throughout the ceremony and earned the Spotlight Award for his performance as table tennis phenom Marty Mauser in A24’s “Marty Supreme.” Introduced earlier in the night by host Nischelle Turner, Chalamet later took the stage, after being presented by director and co-writer Josh Safdie, reflecting on the privilege of working at this stage of his career.\n\n\t“Every day, to wake up in good health and have the opportunity to create things for the world is truly a gift,” Chalamet said. His girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, watched from his table, cheering him on.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTimothée Chalamet with his award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival Film Awards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAlso among the night’s emotional high points was Ethan Hawke, who received the Career Achievement Award, presented by Mahershala Ali, and delivered a rousing speech recalling his early friendship with River Phoenix. The rapturous applause underscored Hawke’s enduring stature, arriving the same day he won best actor from the National Society of Film Critics for “Blue Moon.”\n\t\n\n\tA thunderous response also greeted Jane Fonda, who presented the Vanguard Award to Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet.” Leading actress Jessie Buckley thanked Fonda for her activism, visibly moved by the moment.\n\n\tDirector Guillermo del Toro brought the room to near tears when he revealed during his acceptance speech that his older brother had recently died. “I have learned that when you receive love, it’s what keeps us alive,” he said.\n\n\tThe evening’s biggest logistical surprise involved Leonardo DiCaprio, who was slated to receive the Desert Palm Achievement Award for “One Battle After Another” but was unable to travel from St. Barts due to air restrictions following the U.S. operation in Venezuela. Originally planned as the night’s closing honor, his presentation was moved to the middle of the ceremony, with co-stars Teyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti accepting on his behalf.\n\n\t“Movies are still meant to be experienced together in a theater,” DiCaprio said in a pre-recorded message. “Right now, that belief matters more than ever.”\n\n\tHe continued, “Original films are harder to make and harder to protect, but movies still matter. Not content — but cinema. Stories made by people are meant to be shared in a dark room in a communal experience.”\n\n\tAmanda Seyfried, also honored with the Desert Palm Achievement Award, followed DiCaprio’s remarks and credited him with inspiring her own path into acting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmanda Seyfried with her award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival Film Awards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMichael B. Jordan, presented by Colman Domingo for his performance in “Sinners,” acknowledged a medical emergency that was taking place in the lobby, saying he was praying for an attendee who was quietly taken to an ambulance by paramedics during the ceremony.\n\n\t“Jay Kelly” star Adam Sandler, who received the Chairman’s Award, delivered the night’s most entertaining and hilarious speech, joking about how his life would be if he hadn’t made it as an actor: an electrical contractor, like his Dad.\n\n\tThe night closed with Kate Hudson, who received the Icon Award for “Song Sung Blue.” Introduced by director Rob Marshall (who worked with her on the musical “Nine”), Hudson capped an evening that doubled as both celebration and campaign launchpad.\n\t\n\n\tThe Palm Springs International Film Festival runs Jan. 2–12, showcasing 168 films from 72 countries, including 53 premieres and 44 submissions for the Academy Award for international feature.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is blazing past $1 billion at the global box office after 18 days of release. Those ticket sales include $306 million domestically and $777.1 million internationally for a grand total of $1.083 billion.\n\n\tThe third installment has surpassed the billion-dollar benchmark a bit slower than its predecessor, 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which joined the $1 billion club after a brisk 14 days, and 2009’s “Avatar,” which achieved the benchmark after 17 days. Of course, those films remained major draws on the big screen — topping the box office for seven consecutive weekends — and eventually became two of the biggest movies in history. The original earned $2.9 billion while the sequel generated $2.3 billion.\n\t\n\n\tWhether “Avatar 3” has the staying power to surpass $2 billion in worldwide revenues remains a question mark. Reaching the coveted milestone will rely heavily on international audiences, which powered the first two films to stratospheric heights. The first “Avatar” earned a mammoth $2.1 billion from just overseas markets, while the sequel generated a massive $1.65 billion from foreign territories.\n\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is Disney’s third release of 2025 to cross the $1 billion mark, following “Lilo & Stitch” and “Zootopia 2.” (For context, none of its rivals have fielded a single billion-dollar film since 2023.) These movies are helping to cap off a banner year for the studio, which has generated more than $6.58 billion in global revenues across 16 films. Disney is the biggest studio in terms of marketshare, having outgrossed its rivals by at least $2 billion at the box office. \n\t\n\n\t“Fire and Ash” centers on Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their family as they take on a new fiery foe. James Cameron, the only director in history with three $2 billion blockbusters to his name (“Titanic” is the third), had planned a total of five films in the otherworldly series, set on the alien moon of Pandora. However he has since joked that he’ll hold a press conference to determine whether he’ll move ahead with “Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5” — or if the franchise will conclude with the third adventure.\n\n\t“We’re getting ahead of ourselves [with ‘Avatar 4’] because, first of all, we’ve got to make some money with this one,” Cameron told Variety ahead of opening weekend for “Fire and Ash.” “Every time we go out, we have to prove this crazy business-case yet again.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAdam Sandler delivered one of the most memorable moments of the Palm Springs International Film Awards gala on Saturday night, turning a heartfelt honor into a full-blown comedy set while accepting the Chairman’s Award.\n\n\tPresented by his “Jay Kelly” co-star Laura Dern, Sandler took the stage and quickly veered into a wildly funny alternate-history monologue, imagining what his life might have looked like had his acting career stalled after college.\n\t\n\n\t“When I graduated college, I got a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and my father told me he was very proud of me and I should try it out for one year,” Sandler recalled. “He said, ‘See if you get something going. If it doesn’t work out after one year, you’ll come work for me.’ My dad was an electrical contractor. I didn’t know very much about electricity or contracting.”\n\n\n\tFrom there, Sandler riffed on a fictional future spent wiring fuse boxes instead of movie sets, joking that he’d still be married to his wife, Jackie, but living in a much smaller house with “about 10 less bathrooms and a few less statues of me.”\n\n\tHe added that he’d “probably know how to charge my own phone” and would still get stopped on the street. “Not because of the fame factor, but because they’ve never seen anybody with that much scoliosis.”\n\n\tThe bit escalated as Sandler roped his longtime friend Rob Schneider into the fantasy, joking that Schneider would “work with me on every electrical contracting project I ever had to do.”\n\n\tAmid the laughs, Sandler repeatedly returned to gratitude, crediting the unlikely run that followed that pivotal first year out of college. “I’ve been acting a very long time,” he said. “I can’t thank you all enough for letting me have this career that I’ve been lucky enough to have.”\n\t\n\n\tHe singled out “Jay Kelly” his recent creative high point, praising the cast and director Noah Baumbach for pushing him to do some of his best work. \n\n\t“I didn’t want to let him down. I didn’t want to let down any of my castmates. I didn’t want to let down my family. I didn’t want to let myself down,” Sandler said sincerely. “So I always try my best.”\n\n\tThe speech closed on a characteristically sincere note, with Sandler thanking his wife — “my forever girl” — and promising the audience he’s not done yet. \n\n\tWatch Sandler’s speech below:\n\n\n\n\n\t“Thank you guys for letting me make all these movies over the years. I’m going to try to make more.”\n\n\tThe Palm Springs International Film Awards gala, held annually during the Palm Springs International Film Festival, has become a key stop on the awards-season circuit. Sandler is currently nominated for a Critics Choice and Golden Globe Award for his turn in Baumbach’s film.\n",

The film took home four awards in total, including best director for Paul Thomas Anderson, best supporting actress for Teyana Taylor and best supporting actor for Benicio del Toro. \n\n\t“One Battle” star Leonardo DiCaprio was noticeably absent from the best actor category. Ethan Hawke took home the honor for his role as Lorenz Hart in Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” Runners-up for the award were Wagner Moura for “The Secret Agent” and Michael B.

    "body": "\n\tThis year’s Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards Gala will be a touch less star-studded as Leonardo DiCaprio will miss Saturday night’s ceremony amid the developing geopolitical situation in Venezuela.\n\n\tDiCaprio was set to receive the Desert Palm Achievement Award for his performance in “One Battle After Another.” However, Variety has learned the Oscar winner was not able to leave St. Barts due to air restrictions in the area following the international conflict. DiCpario was photographed on vacation with family and friends, including Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, ahead of the New Year.\n\t\n\n\t“Leonardo DiCaprio is unable to join us in person tonight due to unexpected travel disruptions and restricted airspace,” said a spokesperson for the Palm Springs International Film Festival. “While we will miss celebrating with him in person, we are honored to recognize his exceptional work and lasting contributions to cinema. His talent and dedication to the craft continue to inspire, and we are delighted to celebrate him with the Desert Palm Achievement Award this evening.”\n\n\n\tPalm Springs International Airport released a statement on X announcing that departing flights are at a ground stop. The statement read: “An FAA air traffic control issue is impacting Southern California airspace today. Departing flights are currently under a ground stop. Aircraft have been able to arrive, though some inbound flights have diverted and delays are expected. This is not specific to PSP and is affecting multiple SoCal airports. Travelers should check directly with their airline for the latest flight information. PSP will share updates as needed.”\n\t\n\n\tOn Saturday morning, President Donald Trump announced that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cila Flores have been taken into U.S. custody following a military operation overnight.\n\n\tWith “One Battle After Another,” DiCaprio is in the running to win a second best actor Oscar thanks to his performance as an ex-revolutionary who is forced back into his old life in order to rescue his daughter. The film, from director Paul Thomas Anderson, has been an early awards season darling, including winning the best picture prize from the National Society of Film Critics earlier Saturday. DiCaprio is also nominated for best actor at the Critics Choice Awards on Sunday.\n\n\tEven without DiCaprio’s attendance, the Palm Springs awards gala will feature plenty of A-listers, with honorees including Timothée Chalamet (Spotlight Award), Rose Byrne (Breakthrough Performance Award), Kate Hudson (Icon Award), Michael B. Jordan (Icon Award), Ethan Hawke (Career Achievement Award), Adam Sandler (Chairman’s Award), “Hamnet” director Chloé Zhao as well as actors Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal (Vanguard Award), “Frankenstein” director Guillermo del Toro and actors Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi and Mia Goth (Visionary Award) and “Sentimental Value” cast members Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas and Elle Fanning (International Star Award).\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio is worried about the future of moviegoing. During a recent interview with The Times of London, the “Titanic” star questioned if “people still have the appetite” for movie theaters. He also pondered if cinemas would “become silos – like jazz bars?”\n\n\t“It’s changing at a lightning speed,” DiCaprio said of the film industry. “We’re looking at a huge transition. First, documentaries disappeared from cinemas. Now, dramas only get finite time and people wait to see it on streamers. I don’t know.”\n\t\n\n\tWhatever happens, DiCaprio said he hopes that filmmakers of the future get their work shown on the big screen.\n\n\n\t“I just hope enough people who are real visionaries get opportunities to do unique things in the future that are seen in the cinema,” he added. “But that remains to be seen.”\n\n\tThe Oscar winner is a staunch defender of cinematic integrity. During a recent sitdown with Time, DiCaprio slammed AI in film, saying the technology is incapable of humanity and thus can’t be “authentically” considered art.\n\n\t“It could be an enhancement tool for a young filmmaker to do something we’ve never seen before,” DiCaprio said of AI. “I think anything that is going to be authentically thought of as art has to come from the human being. Otherwise — haven’t you heard these songs that are mashups that are just absolutely brilliant and you go, ‘Oh my God, this is Michael Jackson doing the Weeknd,’ or ‘This is funk from the A Tribe Called Quest song “Bonita Applebum,” done in, you know, a sort of Al Green soul-song voice, and it’s brilliant.’ And you go, ‘Cool.’ But then it gets its 15 minutes of fame and it just dissipates into the ether of other internet junk. There’s no anchoring to it. There’s no humanity to it, as brilliant as it is.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis probably wasn’t the kickoff to a run on “CBS Evening News” that Tony Dokoupil — or his bosses — envisioned.\n\n\tThe anchor, a veteran of CBS News’ morning program, was to have launched his tenure Monday, but a stunning attack on Venezuela by U.S. forces followed by an extraction of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, made his appearance on the network’s evening news all the more necessary, particularly as top personnel at other networks, including Tom Llamas at NBC and Kaitlan Collins at CNN, unveiled their intention to show up for weekend duty on their networks’ evening schedules.\n\t\n\n\tSo here was Dokoupil, on Saturday evening, working to brief viewers on the latest developments, aided by correspondents like Charlie D’Agata and Scott MacFarlane — and a three-segment interview with U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n\n\n\tViewers may have expected to see Dokoupil out from behind the desk, taking the temperature of more average Americans. Earlier this week, after all, he appeared in a promo telling potential viewers that “on too many stories the press missed the story. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\n\tSaturday’s “CBS Evening News” had no direct input from average Americans, and Hegseth, who enjoys a level of power most people in the U.S. do not, could certainly be viewed as “elite.”\n\n\tDokoupil has many challenges ahead. “CBS Evening News” has run in third place, well behind ABC’s “World News Tonight” and NBC’s “NBC Nightly News,” for years, and its standing has been eroded more in recent months as CBS tested a two-anchor format with Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson that ended up shedding viewers. While NBC has relied on just four anchors for “Nightly News” in about 40 years, CBS keeps swapping them out, moving in Scott Pelley, then Jeff Glor and Norah O’Donnell in just the span of a few years. Such tinkering makes the task of connecting with loyal viewership a more difficult one.\n\t\n\n\tHe has been picked to try and foster new audience ties by Bari Weiss, the recently installed editor in chief of CBS News. She arrived at the Paramount Skydance-backed outlet after it spent a reported $150 million on her opinion site, The Free Press. Weiss has no experience running a mainstream TV-news organization, and in recent weeks, it has begun to show. There have been controversies over a fully-vetted “60 Minutes” report that she ordered held, and people familiar with the newsroom say staffers have grown frustrated that a continued focus on her managerial decisions has taken attention away from serious journalism produced by CBS News reporters. CBS News was early to break news of the Venezeula strikes in the week hours of Saturday morning, as well as key details about some of the planning for the operations.\n\n\tWeiss hasn’t exactly smoothed the way for her anchor. Dokoupil’s early-January start was unveiled just three weeks ago, giving CBS little time to seed the ground for his arrival. TV network usually spend longer periods of time touting the looming arrival of a new evening anchor, and often send that journalist to meet with executives and staffers at affiliates around the nation, where local anchors are asked to push viewers to the national telecast that follows. Three weeks leaves little time to use outdoor advertising or other promotional tactics to spur interest, and a digital video distributed this week showing Dokoupil striving to get attention from passers-by in Grand Central Terminal did not suggest he was well known.\n\n\tWith the new anchor’s arrival, CBS has tweaked the look of the venerable program, which has ties to the revered Walter Cronkite. The screen is less cluttered by graphics, distracting the viewer less from what the anchor has to say. Whether Dokoupil would have more detail to offer after a whole day of cable news and broadcast networks’ special reports on the subject, remained to be seen. In the end, CBS News ceded most of its time to Hegseth.\n\n\tSaturday’s broadcast shouldn’t be seen as “the way it is,” as Cronkite used to say. Dokoupil was supposed to start his run on the program by visiting various U.S. towns and cities. Indeed, he was holding forth at KPIX, CBS’ San Francisco station Saturday evening. He is slated to return to New York for his Monday broadcast, delaying plans that are slated to have him start traveling by the middle of next week.\n\t\n\n\tDokoupil signed off Saturday night with the phrase, “That’s another day in America and the world.” But it was probably not just another day for him, and definitely the start of a longer journey.\n",

The first use of the word “television” came in our Jan. 12, 1927, edition.\nAs we explained back then, “Television is a process of making possible the viewing of a broadcasting artist in one’s own home no matter how far away the broadcasting station may be.” Even in this moment of radical, AI-fueled transformation, it’s still worth pausing to celebrate the miracle that inventors Philo T. Farsnworth, Vladimir Zworykin, John Logie Baird and others found the way to make pictures fly through the air — and land on a box in one’s own home.\nTo celebrate the business we love covering, as part of Variety‘s 120th anniversary retrospective, here’s a rich gallery of fabulous advertisements for great television shows, networks, studios and personalities that have graced our pages since 1949. For clarity, please note that the year cited in the headers for each entry reflect the year the ad ran in Variety.\nEnjoy. And with all due respect to the legendary radio comedian Fred Allen, he was wrong when he famously quipped that television is “a medium because it is neither rare nor well done.” It’s a great line, but the ensuing pages prove otherwise.\nRELATED CONTENT: Rare Movie Ads From 120 Years of Variety\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDu Mont (1949)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAs commercial television gained steam after the end of World War II, the Du Mont Company bragged about being early to recognize the power of television.

He played the irascible Sgt. Bilko, who was always getting in and out of scrapes with his men. \nWhen “The Phil Silvers Show” went into syndication, the title was changed to “Sgt. Bilko.” Back then, there was concern that the exposure in syndication would hurt the first-run audience for new episodes, so networks insisted that studios come up with new titles for their rerun packages.\nFrom the March 9, 1960, edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHome Run Derby (1960)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tZiv Television was a syndication company, so it’s likely that this film was months old by the time it landed on TV stations around the country. Nonetheless, our money’s on Hank Aaron, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays.\nFrom the Feb. 17, 1960, edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNaked City (1960)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThere are a million stories in the naked city.

A pilot was produced but the series was never ordered. \nFrom the March 9, 1960, edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCarol Burnett (1960)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLook at that laughing face.\nCarol Burnett made her mark as part of the ensemble on the comedy-variety series hosted by Garry Moore.

This ad demonstrates that Warner Bros. was all-in on the new medium — even when some film studios were still wary.\nFun fact: In this era, television activity for the studio was headed by Jack L. Warner’s son-in-law, William Orr.\nFrom the Jan. 26, 1961, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDanger Man (1961)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe great Patrick McGoohan starred in this British spy thriller series that hit right around the same time that James Bond was starting his legendary box office run. The series was picked up for the U.S. by CBS.\nFrom the Nov. 1, 1961, edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLeave It to Beaver (1960)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Leave It to Beaver” epitomized the G-rated domestic comedies that were popular in TV’s early days.\nThe series aired on ABC from 1958 to 1963. Rightly or wrongly, it is remembered as an example of TV pablum. Barbara Billingsley would later parody her image as a picture-perfect TV mom with a memorable cameo in 1980’s “Airplane.”\nFrom the Sept. 6, 1960, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Dean Martin Show (1965)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEverybody loves somebody sometimes… but Dean Martin felt the love for all who helped him get his show on the air. “The Dean Martin Show” variety hour would run until 1974, albeit with some hiatuses.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRowan and Martin (1966)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDan Rowan and Dick Martin were comedy partners for years before they hit paydirt with NBC’s “Laugh-in” in 1967.

The Smothers Brothers collide with the world of Sid and Marty Krofft on the cusp of the Summer of Love.\nThis context of this ad isn’t entirely clear, but it would appear that the Krofft brothers crafted a big-head puppet costume for use on CBS’ “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.” Tom and Dick were eager to show their appreciation. \nFrom the April 18, 1967, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHere, the William Morris Agency tubthumps its clients as “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” wraps its first season.\nFrom the July 24, 1967, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tColumbo (1968)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIt’s hard to tell from this ad, but this is promoting the first installment of the beloved “Columbo” detective drama franchise.\nThe great Peter Falk played the brilliant, if disheveled, LAPD detective Lt. Columbo (the character never had a first name in the series), who was known for drawing a bead on perpretators with the innocent sounding query, “Just one more thing…”\n“Columbo” episodes ran as a semi-regular series on NBC from 1971 through the late 1980s. Additional episodes aired on ABC in 1989 and 1990, and then occasionally through 2003.\nFrom the Feb. 6, 1968, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSid and Marty Krofft (1968)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe crafty Krofft brothers were masters of marketing themselves — with help from Variety.

Christopher Knight highlighted his work in a big episode for Peter Brady in the Feb. 20, 1970, edition.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBrian’s Song (1972)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThis 1971 TV movie was such a sensation in its debut on ABC that it later played in limited engagements in theaters in the U.S. and abroad.\nBilly Dee Williams and James Caan are both terrific in their roles as two professional football players who bond through adversity on and off the gridiron. It’s a tearjerker in the best way. \nFrom the April 21, 1972, edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1972)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“The Tonight Show” relocated from Manhattan to Burbank in 1972 as Johnny Carson sought a change of scenery and easier access to movie star guests.\nThe famed Mad magazine cartoonist Jack Davis delivered an illustration to mark the occasion.\nFrom the May 3, 1972, edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFree to Be … You and Me (1974)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMarlo Thomas was so ahead of her time. With 1974’s “Free to Be … You and Me,” she created a sui generis TV special that was designed to punch through gender stereotypes for women and for men.\nWomen can be tough, men can cry, don’t hold your breath for Prince Charming and it’s ok if girls and boys want to play with dolls. Those were some of the radical messages that Thomas infused into the special that included music and stars such as Alan Alda, Harry Belafonte, Mel Brooks and Cicely Tyson.\nThank you, Marlo! \nFrom the March 11, 1874 edition of Daily Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBattle of the Network Stars (1976)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNo, this isn’t an AI hallucination. This actually happened.\nSomehow, producers convinced stars from three different networks to compete in sports-esque challenges for an ABC Sports special. “Barney Miller” versus “Kojak” versus “Sanford and Son”! ABC Sports managed to do a few more “Battle of the Network Stars” specials. But this was the first.\nFrom the Nov. 10, 1976, edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSaturday Night Live (1976)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Saturday Night Live” gets its first promo push in Variety, about three months after its debut on Oct. 11, 1975.\nFrom the Jan. 28, 1976, edition of Variety\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSaturday Night Live (1976)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“A loaf of bread is fresh too, but it rarely gets laughs.”\nNBC clearly knew what it had in “Saturday Night Live.” Here the network gives “SNL” an Emmy FYC push.

In April 2024, he spent two days in the hospital for heart problems and diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening condition that happens when the body can't produce enough insulin.\n      \n    \n          Raber first gained fame on \"Breaking Amish\" in 2012 and later appeared on \"Return to Amish,\" where he was known as one of the most defiant cast members.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tCleeve Keller and Dave Noll have partnered with Goliath and Perfect Game to launch “Shark Bite,” a new game show based on the global brand. The family board game was first released in 2017.\n\n\t“Shark Bite” centers around five 20-foot animatronic sharks, each with their own unique personality and name. Five pairs of contestants will battle for the opportunity to receive $100,000, with the chance of going into the shark’s mouth if they get one question wrong. \n\t\n\n\t“’Shark Bite’ is enormously popular around the world,” said Keller. “And obviously sharks are always in the zeitgeist in just about every country across the globe. The ‘Shark Bite’ brand is the greatest IP we’ve seen in a long time.”\n\n\n\t“This is the ultimate family game show,” said Noll. “A giant stage with five, mind-blowing animatronic sharks! And if you get the wrong answer… you must go into the shark’s mouth. ‘Shark Bite’ easily has the potential to be the biggest global game show launch of 2026.”\n\n\tFormed in 2007, Keller/Noll have sold 70-plus shows encompassing nearly 4,600 episodes that have crossed $630 million in global revenues. Previously, the duo has worked on Food Network’s “Chopped,” in addition to various other programs. \n\n\tGoliath reaches over 100 countries, with more than 1.5 billion customers worldwide. Perfect Game was founded by executives Corey Rogers and Ross Greenberg, utilizing the global media rights to Goliath’s most popular games and transforming them into television shows for audiences to watch worldwide. \n\t\n\n\tKeller and Noll are represented by Danielle Hammer at WME.\n",

He will start in April.\n\n\tAt present, Katzmann serves as chief financial officer licensing and distribution at Leonine Group.\n\n\tHe will take over from Maria Kaltenegger, who, after six years on the Beta Film’s management board, will return to the financial auditor KPMG.\n\n\n\tDuring her time at Beta as chief financial officer, responsible for finance and controlling, human resources and IT, Kaltenegger has “made significant contributions to the further development of the group and its strategic direction in times of growth and profound transformation,” according to a statement.\n\t\n\n\tJan Mojto, CEO of Beta Film, said: “I would like to thank Maria Kaltenegger from the bottom of my heart for years of excellent and trusting cooperation, her outstanding expertise and valuable input, also within the company.

    "body": "\n\tAnother shake-up in the entertainment PR landscape has come to pass as the majority of employees of R&CPMK have joined Michael Nyman’s Acceleration Community of Companies that houses PR, marketing, brand, data and event specialty firms.\n\n\tACC has partnered with R&CPMK chief Cindi Berger to create PMK Entertainment, a new entertainment PR brand with a nod to the companies’ roots under Pat Kingsley, the famed personal publicity maven who was an indie powerhouse with a roster of top stars in the 1980s and ’90s. R&CPMK more recently has handled corporate clients as well as stars.\n\t\n\n\tThe union with Berger’s operation marks a full circle moment for Nyman, ACC founder and CEO, who was previously chairman and CEO of R&CPMK after a long career that included his partnership in Bragman Nyman Cafarelli. He stepped down in 2018 to begin building a hand-picked portfolio of specialty labels with the goal of serving a wider range of client needs, from PR and marketing to brand deals and from data to live events.\n\n\n\tLISTEN: Accelerate the Positive: Michael Nyman Builds a House of Specialty Marketing and Communications Firms (‘Strictly Business’ Podcast)\n\n\tThere was no acquisition per se. R&CPMK parent company Interpublic Group is in the midst of what is sure to be a complex merger and integration with fellow advertising giant Omnicom. It’s likely that R&CPMK wasn’t core enough to IPG’s earnings to warrant going through the merger process. So the chance to transition the bulk of the business to ACC was likely a welcome offramp for IPG. But it also reflects the general volatility in the entertainment PR landscape as no money changed hands.\n\t\n\n\tACC has taken on 77 R&CPMK staffers in total addition to a majority of that agency’s clients, per Nyman and Berger. Berger will be CEO of PMK Entertainment. That label will include a 35-person team, with R&C veteran Alan Nierob serving as president. \n\n\tPMK Entertainment’s client roster includes Antoine Fuqua, Billy Bob Thorton, Billy Crystal, Billie Jean King, Casey Wasserman, CJ Entertainment, Denzel Washington, Donnie Yen, Eddie Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Jeff Daniels, Jeremy Renner, Jerry Bruckheimer, Judith Light, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, Richard Gere, Rob Lowe, Sam Levinson, the Grammy Awards, Tribeca Festival, The Paley Center, the Rooftop at Pier 17, Edge and Vessel at Hudson Yards, Angel Studios, the X Games, and Colossal Biosciences, among others.\n\n\t“When IPG was evaluating their portfolio, it was decided that this company wasn’t going to be the right fit,” Berger told Variety. “I called Michael Nyman about joining ACC. I presented it to IPG and they were supportive. Michael fully embraced it. He saw it as a great opportunity for the ACC network and its model of specialization.”\n\n\tNyman emphasized that PMK Entertainment’s size and scope of business in entertainment PR fills a void in the collection of capabilities that he’s been assembling since 2019.\n\n\t“This is a unique situation and an incredible opportunity to bring in an incredible management team along with these clients. Most of R&CPMK will be absorbed into ACC business operations with everything residing in Manhattan and Century City,” Nyman told Variety.\n\n\tIn addition to the formation of PMK Entertainment, about 20 R&CPMK alums will join ACC’s in-house brand and marketing consulting firm Advisory. Another 22 staffers will join DKC, which focuses on brands and corporate clients in business-to-business communications as well as business-to-consumer messaging. ACC acquired DKC last year.\n\n\t”These extraordinary companies fit seamlessly within DKC’s expansive and growing portfolio of lifestyle, media, technology, entertainment and sports brands,” said Sean Cassidy, CEO of DKC. “We have always admired the talent of the R&CPMK team and look forward to this exciting next chapter together.”\n\n\tNierob, a respected industry veteran, said the mix of disciplines within PMK Entertainment and the broader ACC group of firms should make all of the brands more valuable to clients.\n\t\n\n\t“When Rogers & Cowan launched, they were the first company to house entertainment and corporate clients,” Nierob said. “I’m thrilled to be a part of the next generation of brand marketing, public relations and entertainment. It’s an exciting opportunity for both our clients and our entire staff.”\n\n\tWith the addition of R&CPMK, the ACC group now has about 620 employees in total.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat’s a comedy these days? It’s a hot topic, including among the comedy contenders at last week’s A Night in the Writers Room: Awards Season Edition. This year’s panelists hailed from shows that range from “funny, but dark” and “dark, but funny” to “funny, but emotional” and “crime procedural, but funny,” and everything in between.\n\n\tPerhaps the biggest headline on this front came from CBS’ “Elsbeth,” which had just announced hours earlier that it was moving out of drama awards contention to compete in the comedy field at most of the upcoming kudocasts, including the Golden Globes and Actor (formerly SAG) Awards. If you’re wondering why, you clearly haven’t watched “Elsbeth.” It may be a procedural centered on solving a few murders, but with star Carrie Preston’s eccentric ex-lawyer at the helm, it’s also wildly funny.\n\t\n\n\t“When [‘The Good Wife’ and ‘The Good Fight’ creators] Robert and Michelle King created ‘Elsbeth,’ and when they asked me to be the show runner, Robert said, ‘we like that you always lean into the comic.’ It is meant to be funny,” said “Elsbeth” executive producer Jonathan Tolins. “We just switched categories because when we started, we really didn’t know exactly what we were. We do give procedural, and we do a mystery, but it is really funny.”\n\n\tTolins was joined on the Night in the Writers Room: Awards Season comedy panel by fellow exec producers and showrunners Jeff Astrof (NBC’s new comedy “Stumble”); Greg Daniels and Michael Koman (Peacock’s “The Paper”); Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (Netflix’s “Wednesday”) and Michael Waldron (Hulu’s “Chad Powers”). Moderated by Variety executive editor, TV, Michael Schneider, the producers discussed their shows’ origin stories — with four of the five shows represented on stage coming from pre-existing IP. The panel also traded stories on how they created alternative schools and businesses inside the real world.\n\t\n\n\tMuch of the talk centered on tone — and how to strike the right balance between jokes, emotion and character building.\n\n\t“I guess my hope was a tone that you couldn’t quite pin down,” Waldron said of “Chad Powers.” “I liked that the show started out as a farce and something sort of silly. It was our plan by the end to go to a hopefully unexpectedly dramatic, dark and emotional place. Trying to sort of have it all. Can you have the absurd comedy, the shit jokes and all that, but can you make people cry too? That felt like a great challenge.”\n\n\tDaniels, who perfected the art of mixing comedy with emotion on shows such as “King of the Hill” and “The Office,” noted that “I think it’s a great way to keep people off balance, so they don’t anticipate the joke. They’re not 100% sure that’s what you’re going for. I think there’s a comedic reason to do it. But it’s also kind of more how life is. It’s not all yuks.”\n\n\tLike “The Office,” the spinoff “The Paper” also utilizes the mockumentary format to also explore emotion — this time centered on the staff of a dying local newspaper in Toledo. It’s a device that Astrof is trying as well on “Stumble,” about a cheerleading coach looking to rebuild after she’s fired from her job. “I love the format,” he said. “There’s a million jokes you can have… I’m just trying to find something that hits!”\n\n\tSpeaking of tone, “Wednesday” is a dark show that finds plenty of humor in the sarcastically mean but witty sayings of the title character.\n\n\t“It really is a tonal mix,” Gough said. “She is a blast to write. It’s also a character that keeps you honest, because there’s a procedural detective part of it. But she’s not doing things for the same reason that a normal teen detective would be doing them. We also play with a lot of visual humor as well.”\n\n\tAdded Millar: “We have the coffee table book of Charles Addams drawings from the New Yorker on our writer’s room table, and we look at that for inspiration — and it’s amazingly contemporary! His vision was just so spot on, and it’s very timeless. We do get amazing network notes, even though Netflix doesn’t give traditional network notes. Some of the executives don’t like anything to do with death!”\n\t\n\n\t“Wednesday” is I.P. based on “The Addams Family,” but the show this season also utilized some stop motion animation in the vein of director/executive producer Tim Burton — sort of making it I.P.\n\n\tAs the topic turned to I.P. origins stories, Tolins said he was nervous about taking a character like “Elsbeth” from “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” but appreciated having a base of knowledge to expand the character: “I think that the IP question is that, , it just gives you something to dig into and something to start that isn’t a blank page.”\n\n\t“Chad Powers” is based on a segment from Eli Manning’s ESPN series “Eli’s Places,” and it started out as a gag as Manning went into costume. “Glenn Powell and I had been buddies for a while, and we wanted to work together,” Waldron said. “This thing came our way because I think we were two people in town who were college football fans. We got on the phone, and I was like, ‘what I know you couldn’t do is a show about a guy in a prosthetic. You couldn’t do ‘Mrs. Doubtfire.’” And Glenn was like, ‘but what if you did?’ It was impossible. How would you actually pull that off? As I started to think about how impossible that would be, that’s when I really lit up.”\n\n\t“The Paper” came from Daniels’ desire to write about another workplace — and perhaps have a small connection to “The Office.” (Which turned out to be star Oscar Martinez.) Daniels currently has an overall deal with Universal TV, which also produced “The Office,” making the connection easy.\n\n\tDaniels had been working with Koman on another project when the idea for “The Paper” started taking shape. “He asked if I would be interested in working on a show about a newspaper,” Koman said. ”I said ‘yes’ immediately. He described the idea, and then a week later said that it would have something to do with ‘The Office.’ I had already signed on, but I did not know that this was going to be scrutinized at to any level, and that there would be expectations involved.”\n\n\tAdded Daniels: “There was a certain amount of pressure in terms of how it was going to be received, but, apart from Oscar, we weren’t really repeating any of the themes or characters. It was more like the spirit of the show.”\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, although “Stumble” is an original idea by created by Astrof and his sister Liz Astrof, it does have some background help: Monica Aldama, star of the Netflix reality series “Cheer,” also lends her expertise as an EP on the comedy.\n\n\t“That’s been the single best addition to the team,” Astrof said. “I’m very wary of non-writing producers. But we knew that we needed her expertise. The show started when my sister and I were watching ‘Cheer’ and I said, ‘this would be really funny if this was in the worst college in America.’ We just sat on it for a few years, and then we called Monica. She gives validity to it.”\n\n\tOn the Night in the Writers Room stage, “Chad Powers” produced the fewest episodes, with just six episodes in Season 1, while “Wednesday” produced eight-episode seasons for its first two years. As a returning broadcast show, “Elsbeth” produces the most, at 20, while “Stumble” might also reach that level in success. “The Paper” produced 10 episodes in Season 1, and that will likely be the Season 2 order as well — although Daniels and Koman would be happy to do more.\n\n\tQuipped Waldron: “I’m like, six episodes is hard enough. I don’t know how you make more than that!”\n\n\tSo what’s to come on “Stumble,” “The Paper,” “Wednesday,” “Elsbeth” and “Chad Powers”? On “Stumble,” the burning question is whether Courtney Potter (played by Jenn Lyon) can pull off turning this cheer team into winners and take them to the cheerleading championships in Daytona. “It’s giving them appropriate obstacles and giving them little victories along the way,” Astrof said, though he does add that Aldama thinks the cheer team on “Stumble” “never, ever in reality make it to Daytona.”\n\n\tAt the end of “The Paper” Season 1, the staff wins some journalism awards — but don’t think that means the Toledo Truth Teller has recovered. “We wanted to end the season certainly with some encouragement,” Koman said. “That doesn’t make the newspaper’s chances of survival any easier. But we did want to give the characters something to feel like what they were pouring into this might result in some very unlikely dreams coming true.”\n\n\t“Wednesday” ended Season 2 with several cliffhangers, including what happens to alpha werewolf Enid (Wednesday’s roommate) and the discovery that Aunt Ophelia is alive and has been locked in a basement.\n\t\n\n\t“it’s always fun to paint yourself into a corner and then figure out how to get out of it,” Gough said. “But yeah, Wednesday’s aunt is, is coming and now she has to go and try to save Enid.”\n\n\tAs “Elsbeth” continues its Season 3, Tolins said he’s excited to share the show’s Nov. 20 episode, featuring guest star Dianne Wiest as a nun, as well as this year’s Christmas episode, about a deadly Nutcracker performance.\n\n\tThen there’s “Chad Powers,” which is now busy working on Season 2. Waldron said he and Powell have a three-season arc in mind for the show.\n\n\t“We talk about it like a trilogy, and as we talk about trilogies, the second installment will be about the villains, the enemies gathering,” he said. “We’re letting our antagonists emerge, and going in there with the romance and everything. Glen Powell will be okay, even if Chad Powers is not. Oh. And a lot of nudity for Glen. We’ve talked about that.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers “Amsterdam Empire” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tEven though Famke Janssen was born in the Netherlands, she began acting only when she moved to the United States in the 1980s. She started as a fashion model appearing in commercials and on television shows. Today, however, she is best known for appearing in blockbuster franchises such as “X-Men,” “Taken” and the 1995 James Bond film, “GoldenEye.” After decades of making her mark in Hollywood playing formidable heroes and villains alike, she just recently made her acting debut in her native country and language, returning to the Netherlands for “Amsterdam Empire,” Netflix’s new Dutch-language crime series set in the eponymous city.\n\t\n\n\tIn the show, which premiered on Oct. 30, Janssen plays Betty Jonkers, a former Dutch pop star who is married to one of Amsterdam’s biggest marijuana moguls, Jack van Doorn (Jacob Derwig), the owner of The Jackal coffee-shop dispensaries. When Betty finds out that Jack is cheating on her with a younger Dutch television host (Elise Schaap), she threatens to expose the secrets of Jack’s unscrupulous business unless he grants her the company in the divorce settlement.\n\n\n\tAs Betty, Janssen also recorded an original song and music video for the series with Netherlands-based musician Palmbomen. She also executive produced the series, which was created by Nico Moolenaar, Bart Uytdenhouwen and Piet Matthys, and directed by Jonas Govaerts. \n\n\tJanssen spoke with Variety to talk about returning to the Netherlands for the role and the blockbuster career that brought her back there.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow did “Amsterdam Empire” come about and how did you get involved in the project?\t\n\n\tI actually got involved very early on in the process. Nico Moolenaar came to me through Netflix with an offer to play this character, Betty Yonkers. I think at that point only one script had been written, and so I had conversations with him and made my deal with Netflix. I said “I’m very interested in this, but I want to come on as an executive producer,” because now I have a 30-year career behind me. I’ve done 80 films or projects, and I’m going back to the Netherlands for the first time to act in my own language. As exciting as that was, I also thought that having Netflix behind it gave it the possibility of becoming an internationally watched show — a possibility, but not a guarantee, because it is still in Dutch. \n\n\tBut what I really liked about it was the authenticity. I think that we’re living in a time where there’s appetite for authenticity in the way that we haven’t seen in a long time, or maybe ever. We have shows like “Squid Game” and “Adolescence,”  these very locally made shows that found global audiences because they were so authentically made for their territory. That’s very much Netflix’s platform and idea with these local-for-local projects. “Amsterdam Empire” fit because it’s very authentically Dutch, and because Netflix is behind it, we have a global platform, and I really hope that it will reach a large audience.\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of authenticity, some audiences may be surprised by how intense of a place Amsterdam is depicted as, especially in the coffee shop world.  \t\n\n\tI mean, foremost, it’s fiction. We can’t forget that it’s a made-up story. Life in the Netherlands, I feel, is very misunderstood and misrepresented in the media. The funny thing is that life there is just the opposite. There’s no sense of any drug culture. It’s family oriented. People ride their bikes. They put their dogs and their kids and everything on it. I think of it more like a village than a city. It has a very different feel to it. Even the Red Light district where we filmed is more of a Disneyland-like kind of place. It feels very tame. I’m sure there are other aspects that I’m just not familiar with, because I’ve never gone deep into that world, but the truth of the matter is that the country’s marijuana legalization does not work the way that people think. It works the way that it’s described in the series: You can carry a small amount, you can smoke it in what’s called a “coffee shop,” but you can’t legally grow it. So there is a criminal aspect to the whole production of it.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid you enjoy returning to the Netherlands for the role?\t\n\n\tIt was a great opportunity. It was a character I could run with, and it was fun to go back to where I grew up. I was born and raised in the Netherlands. Dutch is my first language. My family’s there. But I didn’t start acting until I came to the States, so it was my first time acting in Dutch. It was really interesting to go back so deep into my career and do something that I’d never done before. There were a lot of firsts on it, and I really enjoyed it. I loved the fact that I was executive producer, and had a lot more creative say. I love the fact that I could design my own costumes. That was a very big jump to take in my in my career. I’ve worked very closely with costume designers in the past, and fashion has been something that has been a part of me for as long as I can remember because I grew up in the modeling world. I also did a music video for the series, and I had to sing and dance in it, so I was trained throughout the filming for song and dance. And that was definitely the best part of the entire experience.\n\t\n\t\tWas returning to the Netherlands something that you always wanted to do, or did the opportunity present itself serendipitously?\t\n\n\tIt was a serendipitous opportunity. I think over the years, some things had come my way, but they weren’t right yet. This time, the timing and the authenticity part of it, the fact that the world is now ready for more of these types of authentic stories with Netflix as the distributor, really just changed the whole game. For me, it’s very different to do a project that is only seen in the Netherlands compared to one that could potentially be seen by people around the world.\n\t\n\t\tHow was acting in Dutch? Even though it’s your native language, was there a learning curve to performing in it?\t\n\n\tIt was daunting at first, and it was probably the thing I was most nervous about, but it ended up being the easiest of all the things that I could have worried about. It was so natural to come back and speak it. So it wasn’t the hurdle that I expected it to be thankfully. It was nice because all of a sudden I could create this character, a character I’d never been able to create before. Because I’d never acted before in Dutch and I never played a Dutch person before, it already brought something different with it. And then there’s the fact that Betty is such an anomaly, such a unique creature. I really got to give her so many different colors, not just in terms of costumes, but in terms of personality. It became a very fun and interesting project to work on.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow did you get into character for someone as intense and layered as Betty?\t\n\n\tI guess the way that I see acting is that it’s all my life experience up to this point. Everything I’ve come across, every person I’ve interacted with, every pain and hardship I’ve felt, every joy that I’ve experienced, it all ends up layering you. As an actor, I find it incredibly helpful to have those life lessons and experiences, because I get to put them into my work. It’s a very cathartic experience sometimes. I think the more you experience in life, the more you get to give back to your characters. Playing Betty was a gratifying experience, and I just think that it was the right role at the right time for me. I really empathize with her, and I felt that I had to fight for her a lot because she seemed so alone and isolated in the story. She was misunderstood and so quickly labeled as this evil bad bitch. Whenever that dialogue was thrown in her direction, it just hurts so much because I thought, “No, she’s misunderstood! She’s in deep pain.” \n\n\tImagine being cheated on publicly. Being cheated on is bad enough, but publicly, and then add the fact that the new person is having their baby on top of everything else. I just empathized a lot with her. I wanted to give her a chance to be seen as someone who’s not only angry but deeply hurt and was coming from a lot of pain and had to learn a lot of lessons in life. She’s very childish, but she had to learn to grow up and fend for herself. I was really there to help her grow as a human being. But it was fun to play that kind of role. I wanted to give her this sort of unpredictability. She’s just filled with emotions that are coming out in every possible way without any type of control.\n\t\n\t\tAnd the season ends with Betty getting what she wants in terms of The Jackal, but this still leaves her running a pretty dangerous business. Do you think that there might be more to Jack and Betty’s story? Would you be open to a second season?\t\n\n\tWhether or not there’s a Season 2 is up to Netflix and the numbers. So we will find out in the near future, but I definitely see room for an interesting journey ahead of what Betty would do with the Jackal and how Jack would try to get it back.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©20thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of the future, a lot of your “X-Men” co-stars are reprising their roles next year in “Avengers: Doomsday,” and we’ve already seen Hugh Jackman return as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart return as Professor X in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You’ve said on record that you haven’t been asked to return as Jean Grey.\t\n\n\tAnd then when I say that, people don’t believe me. So I’m just gonna wait for the movie to come out and, you know, people can see for themselves.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIf you were offered it, would you be interested in returning to that character in this new universe?\t\n\n\tI’m always open to anything. I’m very open minded, and I love my career and the trajectory that it’s taken over time. I’m grateful for all the opportunities that have come my way, including the “X-Men” movies, “GoldenEye, the “Taken” franchise, all of them. It’s just been an amazing journey. So, it depends. It depends on the timing. It’s just a hypothetical question, because I don’t know that they would ever bring back my Jean Grey. At that point I would take a look at it. But I love where my life and career is going right now, the fact that I’m wearing different hats and that I’m executive producing. I did write, direct and produce a film with Milla Jovovich 15 years ago, so I’ve done a feature film before. The costume designing element is also amazing. I just finished a film called “One Second After,” and I designed my costumes for that too. My life is now enriched in all these areas, so it’s really hard to go back to something where I’m just asked to come in and say a few lines. So I really hope that I can continue this journey of establishing more functions within the industry, because it suits me.\n\t\n\t\tThe MCU is going to reintroduce the “X-Men” with a new cast after “Doomsday.” Any advice for whoever ends up playing Jean Grey?\t\n\n\tNo. I’m excited to see who they’re getting next. I mean, Sophie Turner was amazing, and I’m sure the next person will be too. They’ve been so good at casting incredible actors and no one needs any tips from me. I’m looking forward to seeing who they cast.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe James Bond franchise is also undergoing a transition. You had the opportunity to play a Bond girl who was also a Bond villain as Xenia Onatoppin in “GoldenEye.” What do you hope the next iteration of Bond brings to those archetypes?\t\n\n\tI hope that there are more female villains, because they are fantastic characters. We’ve seen the franchise have a lot of interesting characters over the past 60 years and I’m curious to see what they do next. They’ve been so clever at reinventing themselves over and over again to remain relevant. I’m very much looking forward to see who is going to play Bond, who else is going to be cast in it, what the storyline is and what exotic locations they go to.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAny words of wisdom for the next actors to step into the roles of Bond girls or Bond villains?\t\n\n\tBe authentically yourself. I hope that whoever they cast in any of the parts, they are not just going to think about the people who’ve played those parts before or the pressures that come with playing it. I hope that they can be authentically themselves and I’m sure that it will be absolutely wonderful to watch.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tReselling concert tickets for above face value is set to be banned in the U.K. The move comes days after a letter signed by Dua Lipa, Coldplay, Sam Fender and more urged the government to act to protect fans from exploitation.\n\n\tAccording to BBC News, U.K. ministers are expected to unveil a plan on Wednesday that will confront resale sites and ticket touting for live music, theater, comedy and sports events. Though fans will still be able to resell tickets to an event if they can no longer attend, the sale limit will be set to the original cost of the ticket and extra fees will be minimized. \n\t\n\n\tThe proposed plan from the U.K.’s department for culture, media and sport will strive to make resale tickets £37 ($48) cheaper on average, saving fans a total of £112 million ($137 million) per year. The resale platforms will be legally obligated to monitor and enforce the new regulations. \n\n\n\tOn Thursday, a slew of British music stars signed an open letter urging U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to make good on his promise to stop ticket touting after the government began a public consultation on the ticketing issue at the beginning of the year. Lipa, Fender, Coldplay, the Cure, Radiohead and more asked the government to act to “restore faith in the ticketing system” and “help democratize public access to the arts.” \n\n\tRecent large-scale concerts like Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour and Oasis’ reunion run have seen prices inflate massively, with resale tickets going for thousands of pounds. The craze over Oasis tickets even prompted the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority to open an investigation into Ticketmaster’s compliance with consumer protection law. \n",

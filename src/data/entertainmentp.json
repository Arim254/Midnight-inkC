    "body": "\n\tConsider it a touchdown for “Chad Powers“: Glen Powell‘s college football comedy has been renewed for Season 2 at Hulu.\n\n\tThe series, which began streaming on Sept. 30, stars Powell as Russ Holliday, a hotshot quarterback whose college football career crumbles when he makes a haunting mistake in the national title game. Eight years later, Russ makes a last-chance gambit to resurrect his football dreams by disguising himself as Chad Powers, a talented oddball who walks on to the struggling South Georgia Catfish team. \n\t\n\n\tThe show’s talented ensemble cast also includes Perry Mattfeld, Quentin Plair, Wynn Everett, Frankie A. Rodriguez and Steve Zahn.\n\n\n\tIn addition to starring, Powell co-created the show with Michael Waldron (“Loki,” “Heels,” “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness”) based on a viral sketch from ESPN’s “Eli’s Places.” In the bit, Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning went undercover, wearing a prosthetic mask, mustache and wig to participate in walk-on tryouts for the Penn State football team under the assumed name Chad Powers.\n\n\tEli Manning serves as executive producer for Hulu’s “Chad Powers” along with Omaha Productions’ Peyton Manning, Jamie Horowitz, Ben Brown and ESPN’s Burke Magnus, Brian Lockhart, Kati Fernandez. Powell also executive produces (for his Barnstorm Productions) alongside Waldron and Adam Fasullo (for Anomaly Pictures). Luvh Rakhe also executive produces, with Tony Yacenda serving as a director and executive producer. 20th Television is the studio. \n\n\tWord began to spread that the show was coming back for a second season in November, when a report from the Atlanta Journal Constitution stated that the local crew in Atlanta was told to expect production to kick off in January.  \n\t\n\n\tBoth Powell and Waldron shared potential Season 2 plans with Variety in an interview pegged to the season finale. Powell said at the time, “It’s a make-or-break thing for me that the University of Texas be included. I told Waldron, ‘If I have to support the UGA football program and not the University of Texas one more time, I’m gonna break.'”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Euphoria” fans have been waiting years and now their prayers have been answered: Season 3 is set to hit HBO in April.\n\n\tThe new episodes will arrive more than four years after the Season 2 finale. (Just think: in the wait between seasons, you could have enrolled and graduated from “Euphoria” High.)\n\n\tSam Levinson‘s teen drama returns with a sprawling cast of familiar faces and newcomers. Most of the original cast of now-A-listers are back, including Zendaya, Hunter Schafer, Eric Dane, Jacob Elordi, Sydney Sweeney and Colman Domingo. Also returning are Alexa Demie, Maude Apatow, Martha Kelly, Chloe Cherry, Dominic Fike and Nika King, as well as Alanna Ubach, Daeg Faerch, Melvin Bonez Estes, Paula Marshall, Sophia Rose Wilson and Zak Steiner.\n\t\n\n\tLevinson was on hand at an HBO Max presentation in London, U.K. to share a sneak peak of the explosive Season 3, revealing where some of the key characters have ended up four years on. “Five years felt like a natural place because if they’d gone to college they’d be out of college at that time,” he explained of where the show picks up. “We basically pick up Rue south of the border in Mexico, in debt to Laurie, trying to come up with some very innovative ways to pay it off.”\n\n\n\t“And then Cassie is living in the suburbs with Nate, they’re engaged and she’s very addicted to social media and envious of what appears to be the big lives that all of her high school classmates are living at this point in time.”\n\n\tHe promised: “I feel strongly this is our best season yet… I will say that Cassie and Nate do in fact get married. I’m confirming it. And I promise that it will be an unforgettable night.”\n\t\n\n\tLevinson also confirmed that Jules is in art school and “nervous” about her career as a painter while Maddy has moved to Hollywood and is working at a talent agency as well as on her own “side hustles.” Sharon Stone guest stars as a showrunner who hires Lexy as her assistant.\n\n\tJoining Stone in “Euphoria” for the first time are Rosalía, Trisha Paytas, Natasha Lyonne, Danielle Deadwyler, Eli Roth and Marshawn Lynch. Plus: Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Toby Wallace, Darrell Britt-Gibson, Kadeem Hardison, Priscilla Delgado, James Landry Hébert, Anna Van Patten, Asante Blackk, Bella Podaras, Bill Bodner, Cailyn Rice, Colleen Camp, Gideon Adlon, Hemky Madera, Homer Gere, Jack Topalian, Jessica Blair Herman, Kwame Patterson, Madison Thompson, Matthew Willig, Rebecca Pidgeon and Sam Trammell.\n\n\tAustin Abrams and Algee Smith were left off HBO’s cast list, as well as Storm Reid, who said in November that her character, Rue’s sister Gia, would be absent from Season 3. Barbie Ferreira, who played Kat, exited the series in August 2022, and Angus Cloud, who played Fezco, died at age 25 in July 2023.\n\n\t“Euphoria” follows a group of teenagers navigating an intense world of drug addiction, sex, crime and betrayal. “Euphoria” became a phenomenon, launching the careers of many of its young stars and becoming HBO’s most-watched series that does not involve dragons or zombies (the cabler’s fourth most-popular show overall).\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix is once again reconfiguring its video-game business strategy by selling Spry Fox, the developer behind “Cozy Grove” and the upcoming “Spirit Crossing,” back to the studio’s founders.\n\n\tVariety has confirmed that Spry Fox, which Netflix acquired in 2022, will spin out and once again become an independent studio. While Netflix will continue to be the publisher for the mobile version of “Spirit Crossing” when it releases next year, the game is now set to be published across more platforms.\n\t\n\n\tThe news of Netflix’s Spry Fox sale was first reported by Game File.\n\n\n\t“‘Spirit Crossing’ was built to connect the world, bring people together and inspire kindness, so being able to bring the game to as many players, across different platforms, is truly the best thing for the game,” co-founder David Edery said in a statement Wednesday. “We’re so grateful for our time at Netflix and our continued partnership publishing ‘Spirit Crossing’ next year.”\n\n\tWhile the unveiling of “Spirit Crossing” was a big announcement for Netflix during its presentation at the Game Developers Conference back in the spring, the streamer has been continuously shifting its strategy for the gaming division since president of games Alain Tascan joined Netflix in late 2024. \n\n\tThe current focus promoted by Netflix is a lineup of party games, narrative games, kids games and mainstream games, as well as more games on TV rather than just mobile titles. Netflix recently released several of these party games for TVs and mobile, as well as “Netflix Puzzled” and third-party titles including “PAW Patrol Academy,” “WWE2K25” and “Red Dead Redemption.” In the coming months, the streamer will release “Best Guess” with hosts Hunter March and Howie Mandel and “Dead Man’s Party: A Knives Out Game.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe second season of “Game of Thrones” prequel “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” is set to go into production next week. Season 1 will debut in Jan. 18, 2026 with Season 2 following in 2027.\n\n\t“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” is set around 100 years before the events of the original show based on George R.R. Martin’s blockbuster series. It follows Peter Claffey as Westerosi hedge knight Ser Duncan “Dunk” the Tall and Dexter Sol Ansell as his diminutive squire Egg. \n\t\n\n\tShowrunner Ira Parker was on hand at HBO Max‘s presentation in London, U.K. to give the audience a sneak peek of what to expect. “It felt very natural, it didn’t feel like a reach,” Parker said of working on the series. “I think we can all find a lot to relate to our one new character Ser Duncan the Tall, certainly I put a lot of myself into him. He’s treading in this strange world. He’s from the ass-end shithole of Westeros, the slums of Westeros, of King’s Landing and he doesn’t know anyone and he doesn’t know anything so all of these lords and ladies and princes and kings and queens that he encounters, it all seems a little absurd to him and he doesn’t quite know if people are making fun of him or not and a lot of good natural comedy comes out of the situation.”\n\n\n\t“We take you in on a little bit of a lighter, more friendly path to Westeros you get to hang out and enjoy yourself for a little bit and then it becomes Westeros and then things are gonna happen. But that’s the fun of this world, anything can happen, good and bad, people die. For no reason other than that’s what the Gods wanted for us.”\n\t\n\n\tParker also warned the audience that the more modest spin-off does not have the same budgetary freedoms of the original series. “We took everything from Dunk’s POV this season,” said Parker. “He’s the sole POV of the book and we have channelled everything from our music to our titles to our cinematography and our action and also our budget is a reflection of Dunk, who comes from nothing, he has very little. He is a simple, unpolished human being and so are we. There are some wonderful, big, polished, huge, epic shows within this world that can be enjoyed and we are not that. I hope the audiences will forgive us for some of our most unpolished-y parts, we really we tried our best, and that’s what Dunk’s doing. He’s going to this place that’s unfamiliar to him and he’s probably way in over his head and he’s probably giving it his best shot.”\n\n\tThe series is based on George RR Martin’s “Tales of Dunk and Egg” novellas, with Variety first reporting the show was in development in 2021. It was officially picked up to series in 2023. \n\n\tThe renewal announcement came during a press presentation by HBO and HBO Max Content chairman and CEO Casey Bloys on Wednesday in London. Bloys also revealed the launch date for the long-awaited third season of “Euphoria” as well as revealing that HBO Max is set to arrive in the U.K. and Ireland in March 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson’s action epic “One Battle After Another” swept the National Board of Review‘s 2025 awards, claiming best film, director, actor for Leonardo DiCaprio, supporting actor for Benicio Del Toro and breakthrough performance for Chase Infiniti.\n\n\tThe Warner Bros. film marks Anderson’s fourth NBR win overall and his second for directing. He previously won adapted screenplay for “Inherent Vice” (2014), original screenplay for “Phantom Thread” (2017) and directing for “Licorice Pizza” (2021). DiCaprio earned his third NBR acting prize, following supporting actor trophies for “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape” (1993) and “Django Unchained” (2012).\n\t\n\n\tRose Byrne took best actress for A24’s “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” after winning the New York Film Critics Circle award Tuesday. Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas claimed best supporting actress for Neon’s “Sentimental Value” in her first major awards recognition.\n\n\n\tWarner Bros. dominated the NBR winners with “One Battle After Another’s” five trophies, plus Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” winning original screenplay and Autumn Durald Arkapaw’s cinematography prize. “Sinners” also made the top 10 films list.\n\n\tNetflix had a strong showing with “Train Dreams” winning adapted screenplay for Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar while also landing in the top 10 alongside Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein.”\n\n\tOther notable inclusions were Universal’s “Wicked: For Good” and Searchlight’s “Rental Family” from director Hikari, both making the top 10 films.\n\n\tNotable omissions included Focus Features’ “Hamnet” from Chloe Zhao, which failed to crack the top 10, alongside Neon’s South Korean black comedy “No Other Choice” from Park Chan-wook. Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon” and Bradley Cooper’s “Is This Thing On?” were also shut out.\n\t\n\n\tLast year proved particularly rough for NBR’s predictive power. Of its major winners, only Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” won the Oscar. Best film winner “Wicked” and adapted screenplay winner “Sing Sing” secured nominations, but director Jon M. Chu, Daniel Craig for “Queer,” Nicole Kidman for “Babygirl,” Elle Fanning for “A Complete Unknown” and original screenplay “Hard Truths” failed to earn Academy recognition. Notably, eventual best actress winner Mikey Madison for “Anora” was named breakthrough performance.\n\n\tOver 40 years, most NBR best film winners have gone on to earn at least an Oscar nomination for best picture — exceptions include “Gods and Monsters” (1998), “Quills” (2000) and “A Most Violent Year” (2014). The 1980s included two notable misses: “Empire of the Sun” (1987) and “Betrayal” (1983), the latter tying with “Terms of Endearment.”\n\n\tSince the Academy expanded the best picture lineup in 2009, NBR and the Oscars have intersected only once with “Green Book” (2018).\n\n\tThe National Board of Review’s awards gala is scheduled for Jan. 13 in New York City.\n\n\tThe full list of winners is below:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRose Byrne stars in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBest Film: “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tBest Director: Paul Thomas Anderson, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tBest Actor: Leonardo DiCaprio, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tBest Actress: Rose Byrne, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” (A24)\n\n\tBest Supporting Actor: Benicio Del Toro, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tBest Supporting Actress: Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, “Sentimental Value” (Neon)\n\n\tBest Directorial Debut: Eva Victor, “Sorry, Baby” (A24)\n\n\tBreakthrough Performance: Chase Infiniti, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tBest Original Screenplay: Ryan Coogler, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tBest Adapted Screenplay: Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar, “Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\n\tBest Animated Feature: “Arco” (Neon)\n\n\tBest International Film: “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)\n\n\tBest Documentary: “Cover-Up” (Netflix)\n\n\tOutstanding Achievement in Cinematography: Autumn Durald Arkapaw, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\tOutstanding Achievement in Stunt Artistry: “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” (Paramount Pictures)\n\n\tNBR Freedom of Expression Award: “Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk” (Kino Lorber)\n\t\n\n\tTop 10 Films (in alphabetical order):\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” (20th Century Studios)“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.)“Frankenstein”  (Netflix)“Jay Kelly” (Netflix)“Marty Supreme” (A24)“Rental Family” (Searchlight Pictures)“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)“Train Dreams” (Netflix)“Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” (Netflix) “Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures)\n\n\tTop 5 International Films (in alphabetical order):\n\n\t“Left-Handed Girl” (Netflix)“The Love That Remains” (Janus Films)“The Secret Agent” (Neon)“Sentimental Value” (Neon)“Sirāt” (Neon)\n\n\tTop 5 Documentaries (in alphabetical order):\n\n\t“2000 Meters to Andriivka” (PBS)“Come See Me in the Good Light” (Apple Original Films)“My Mom Jayne” (HBO Documentary Films)“Natchez” (Oscilloscope Laboratories)“Orwell: 2+2=5” (Neon)\n\n\tTop 10 Independent Films (in alphabetical order):\n\n\t“The Baltimorons” (IFC)“Bring Her Back” (A24)“Father Mother Sister Brother” (Mubi)“Friendship” (A24)“Good Boy” (IFC)“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” (A24)“The Mastermind” (Mubi)“Rebuilding” (Bleecker Street)“Sorry, Baby” (A24)“Urchin” (1-2 Special)\n",

    "description": "\n\t“Reporter” and “subject” are antonyms for a reason: They’re different roles that require different skill sets to excel within. The former Washington",
    "body": "\n\t“Reporter” and “subject” are antonyms for a reason: They’re different roles that require different skill sets to excel within. The former Washington correspondent Olivia Nuzzi is learning this the hard way. In the fall of 2024, the writer went from chronicling scandal-ridden, attention-getting figures like Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to becoming one herself, thanks to a widely publicized (and allegedly nonphysical) affair with Kennedy, whom she had previously profiled for New York magazine. Nuzzi has had more than a year to adjust to this new notoriety and plot her return to public life in the form of “American Canto,” a quasi-memoir published this week by Simon & Schuster. Nuzzi had previously been announced as the new West Coast editor of Vanity Fair, though her sole byline of her tenure to date is an “American Canto” excerpt.\n\t\n\n\tBut while “American Canto” does mark a sharp break from Nuzzi’s previous prose style, its rollout displays a profound misunderstanding of what’s demanded from those in the limelight’s harsh glare. Nuzzi may have relinquished the role of aloof observer, yet she refuses to fully embrace the spirit of uninhibited disclosure that marks the opposite extreme. “American Canto” purports to be a dispatch from Trump’s America at the decade mark. The spectacle surrounding it is really proof that Trumpian shamelessness — or to call it by another name, reality stardom — isn’t as easy to pull off as it looks.\n\n\n\tIn fact, Nuzzi told Tim Miller of The Bulwark in an interview for his podcast, “I think shame is really important,” saying she intentionally chose to ignore others’ advice to “be shameless” because “everyone else is.” What Nuzzi seems not to comprehend is that it’s a little late for moral hauteur, or to return to the more comfortable terrain of detached appraisal. Nor does “American Canto,” with its nonsensical, faux-profound proclamations like “character is the thing you cannot outrun or outgun that spars with fate all along,” read like the work of a person especially bound by the strictures of shame. The book’s oblique, elliptical style (“this is more meaningful and more meaningless than you might think”) is not demure — it’s self-flattering.\n\t\n\n\tAt least Nuzzi is not alone in this limbo. Before the Kennedy story blew up, the erstwhile journalist was engaged to Ryan Lizza, another longtime chronicler of our nation’s capitol and its personalities. After stints at the New Yorker and Politico that each ended acrimoniously, the former with allegations of sexual misconduct, Lizza is now the proprietor of Telos News, a subscription-based newsletter hosted on Substack. It is this new venture, even more than his personal connection to Nuzzi or desire for petty vengeance, that explains Lizza’s decision to serialize his side of the story, complete with cliffhanger endings and strategically deployed paywalls.\n\n\tThough Lizza’s dispatches accuse Nuzzi of grave professional sins like killing negative stories about Kennedy on the politician’s behalf, beating her to the more limited revelations made in “American Canto,” and allegedly commissioning an illegal recording of Trump at Mar-a-Lago, there’s something rich about Lizza attempting to position himself on higher ethical ground. In this context, Lizza isn’t acting as a just-the-facts journalist anymore than his ex-fiancée is. He is, in the modern parlance, a creator — an independent business owner whose stock and trade is the attention he’s able to attract, which for the moment is considerable. Nuzzi and Lizza may no longer be in a relationship, but they’ve embarked on the same semi-involuntary career pivot. \n\n\tThus far, Lizza has proven more adept at this shared pursuit, if not at positioning himself as a victim. Semafor reported that his first dispatch, a deliberate bait-and-switch that culminated with the sensational allegation that Nuzzi also had an inappropriate relationship with former Republican presidential candidate Mark Sanford, attracted nearly three-quarters of a million readers. One could never confuse Lizza’s blog posts for carefully vetted reports; a tease hinting at a bombshell revelation about the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania, followed by an immediate admission Lizza couldn’t substantiate anything worth publishing, felt particularly cheap and dishonest. What they do deliver that Nuzzi thus far refuses to are lurid specifics: direct quotes from Kennedy’s erotic missives; the complete text of a strategy memo Nuzzi wrote for his doomed campaign; names of new characters to feed our insatiable appetite for drama. The Sanford mic drop stands in contrast to Nuzzi’s insistence on referring to Kennedy only as “the Politician,” producing no mystery and a great deal of annoyance.\n\t\n\n\tThe failures of “American Canto” have already been catalogued in a fusillade of savage reviews. But they’re perhaps best illustrated in contrast with Nuzzi’s most recent piece of writing: a list of bullet points titled “Signs Your Book Rollout Has Gone Awry,” run behind the paywall of the popular newsletter Feed Me. (Two can play at this Substack game, it seems.) The list was only Nuzzi’s second piece of press around the book, after a New York Times profile penned by Jacob Bernstein and before her conversation with Miller. Where “American Canto” reads like it was written on her phone — as she told Bernstein it had been — in the derogatory sense, “Signs Your Book Rollout Has Gone Awry” is a better-case-scenario for a Notes App dump. A typical entry reads: “It seems a positive development that Tina Brown describes your ‘pretentious’ book as ‘Ezra Pound meets Barbie.’” It’s as casual, concise and amusingly self-aware as “American Canto” is belabored and humorless. Some of her answers in a Q&A with Feed Me’s readers had a similar bite; when asked about the long-term impact of existing in the MAGA orbit, Nuzzi replied, in the artful understatement of the year, “Well, it couldn’t have been very good.” I laughed!\n\n\tNuzzi told Miller that “American Canto” is not “an effort to brand myself in any particular way,” a self-evidently ridiculous claim belied by unconvincing Joan Didion drag — driving around Malibu in a Ford Mustang — staged for the benefit of a New York Times photographer. This performance of self-seriousness coincided with Nuzzi’s Vanity Fair debut, an excerpt of “American Canto” accompanied by an “abstract nude” illustration. Traditionally, editors in journalism (including West Coast ones) are often anonymous figures, tasked with commissioning coverage from behind the scenes rather than effectively covering themselves. But as of right now, Nuzzi has little to offer except her own story. “American Canto” is not a road back into legitimacy, as Nuzzi seems to hope; to use the book’s favorite metaphor of fire, it’s a final burning of a bridge she crossed long ago. There’s a similar comedy to Lizza invoking credibility buttresses like “primary sources” while he’s blogging through his own breakup.\n\t\n\n\tEvery word these two publish puts them further away from classical reportage and closer to the role of influencer, that most modern of professions that works to monetize sheer volume of eyeballs. In a way, their saga is an extreme version of a broader predicament in media: establishment outlets and upstart platforms alike want voices with “personal brands,” but get caught flat-footed when this boundary pushing blows up in their face. This is a bigger problem for the Vanity Fairs of the world than the Substacks, who can shrug and invoke Section 230 while Condé Nast conducts an internal review. For the writers themselves, however, there’s no way out but through — no point in pretending, to oneself or to others, that any loftier goal is at work here than personal ambition or vendettas. We live in a nation governed by a game show host. If you’re really aiming to capture the moment, best to embrace one’s assigned role with gusto, even if that means you’re the villain.\n",

    "body": "\n\tYou know the visual artistry of Kenny Gravillis, and you have for years — decades even. You just don’t know that you know it. In the high-stakes world of Hollywood advertising, Kenny Gravillis is the creative maestro. His work is everywhere. As the visionary behind the shingle Gravillis, he is the definitive secret weapon for studios and top-tier filmmakers who demand more than just standard-issue posters.\n\n\tThe creator’s extensive portfolio includes iconic promotional material for a vast array of notable films, such as “Sinners,” “The Naked Gun,” “After the Hunt,” “Challengers,” “The Wild Robot,” “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” “Dune,” “West Side Story” and “Birds of Prey.” This impressive body of work extends beyond movies to include TV show ads and album covers. Rather than relying on typical advertising, the artist focuses on crafting campaigns and film posters that spark conversation, making him and his company highly sought-after for those seeking truly memorable promotional material.\n\t\n\n\tGravillis threw open the doors to his boutique graphic design studio in 2000 by Kenny Gravillis and DeAnna Gravillis, armed with a mission: to create visually arresting communication that speaks to the sophisticated, savvy consumer. On the company website, Gravillis’ nature is stated in no uncertain terms: “We try to make cool looking shit that people want to talk about.”\n\n\n\tMission accomplished.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGravillis continues to collaborate with ‘Sinners’ star Michael B. Jordan, left; The poster for ‘Logan’ is one of Gravillis’ more memorable campaigns, right. \n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom the start, he set his sights on cinematic and television campaigns that were anything but ordinary. It’s a vision that paid off spectacularly, propelling the studio from a bold newcomer to an undisputed market leader in the competitive landscape of entertainment advertising.\n\t\n\n\tGravillis’ career unfolded with an almost fated ease, with each step, from childhood passions to his current role, falling seamlessly into place as if guided by a divine hand. He grew up in London, a self-described “TV and movie junkie” who spent his ’80s youth devouring everything on the screen after his family got a VHS. A pivotal summer trip to New York cemented his love for American television.\n\n\tHe recalls a time in his life when a career in banking seemed to be the only viable option for a fresh graduate. Serendipity intervened, however, in the form of a relative who designed magazine layouts. A visit to his cousin’s workplace was all it took for his professional trajectory to change. “I remember going into that office, and this was obviously before computers, and just seeing just the energy of the office, the drawing boards, people laughing and joking and like, just having fun. And I was, ‘Oh my God, this is so much cooler than going into a bank.’”\n\n\tThen the big break came in 1989 when, at 21, he got a job at Def Jam Records during their early years. And that was where his life changed. “I ended up designing album covers,” he says. “Music was my first intro into the world of design. Def Jam has definitely guided me throughout my career; ’89 through ’95. And that when the company really sort of exploded in a way, but it exploded in a way where it didn’t try to explode. It just was honest and authentic in the music it was putting out and then the world just gravitated towards it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Things Fall Apart’ album cover forThe Roots (1999)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMCA Records\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGravillis says his “claim to fame music-wise” was designing the cover for Notorious B.I.G .’s “Ready to Die” album. “When my son was like 14, he came up to me, he was like, ‘Dad, Mom said you designed the Biggie cover.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, I did.’ He was, ‘OK. That’s cool. I gotta tell people about that.’” He laughs thinking about it.\n\n\tWhen he started his company 25 years ago, for the first three years or so, that’s all they did: music. And the name were big ones, the likes of the Roots, Erykah Badu, Santana, Mariah Carey and many others. “It was a really good time,” he says. The music industry, and with it the art of album cover design, began to buckle around 2003. Digital music platforms like iTunes didn’t just change how music was sold; they physically shrunk the canvas. The intricate artwork of the LP and CD eras gave way to bold, simple and instantly recognizable designs optimized for a tiny digital thumbnail.\n\t\n\n\t“The industry changed, and we needed to pivot — and the only thing that made sense to us was movies and TV,” he says. “We were very naive about it though. We thought we were so cool with all our music stuff. I think it would be different now, but back then in like 2000, 2003, 2004, we thought we could kind of just float over to the studios and be like, ‘Hey look, we’re these cool album cover kids.’ And the studios were like, ‘That’s a square.”\n\n\tThey are also very conscious of being pigeonholed. They noticed that when they started showing their work with such artists as the Roots, Common and Erykah Badu, a lot of the feedback they were getting was being putting them in a “you’re very urban” box. “I grew up on all types of films, so in my brain, I’m like, ‘When they say urban, what does that mean? Does that mean that we’re just going to be put on Black films?’ We were very nervous about it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Challengers’ poster art, left; Gravillis says, “’Back to Future,’ my favorite film. If my 15-year-old self said, ‘Forty years from now, we’re gonna redo this poster, my head would’ve blown off.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut then, another lucky break came along: Miramax and a “weird” dark comedy with Johnny Knoxville and Elizabeth Banks called “Daltry Calhoun” (2005).\n\n\t“The rumor goes that the marking people — I guess it wasn’t going well,” Gravillis recalls. “They had some comps that we did, and I guess they showed it to Harvey [Weinstein] or whoever it was at Miramax. He asked who we were, and that’s all we needed. And then all of a sudden, we started getting a ton of work from Miramax and [then the] Weinstein Company. That helped us just massively because the cool thing about Miramax and Weinstein was that their films were super artful and it was like indie darlings. So we kind of grew up as more like independent film.” And successful collaborations with Spike Lee, Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan have evolved into a constant flow of creative projects for Gravillis and his creative team.\n\n\tTheir list of film posters since then hits every genre imaginable and showcases their enormous range, from “Weird: The Al Yankovic Story” to “The Color Purple” to “Alvin and the Chipmunks.” His ambitions extend far beyond his own company. He is dedicated to building a lasting legacy for the creative field by inspiring a new wave of designers through the Otis College of Art and Design-Netflix Career Pipeline Program. “Basically, it’s a program that teaches what we do. Then at the end of 14 months, we actually place the cohorts into agencies for six months, and it becomes about if they can get a job out of it at the end. Our first graduating class, which was last December, had 14 kids and 12 of them have jobs so far.”\n\t\n\n\t“Gravillis has thrived in Hollywood for over 25 years because of its unmistakable style and fearless creative execution,” says Kalynn Jenkins, Chief Operating Officer of Gravillis Inc. “As we move into our next chapter, we’re expanding our focus to include more social and branding work — while continuing to be the creative force that has shaped some of the most iconic campaigns in film and entertainment.”\n\n\tAs the entertainment industry — and the world in general — continues to change, so does the Gravillis shop. In January, they started a social division. “As much as I love the printed poster, we all know how many eyes are looking at phones and looking at digital things,” he says. “Every agency is trying to figure out what the next steps are with that. … There’s an artistry there that people are still fending for. We have this term that ‘art will continue.’ I really believe that.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFlexing its development muscle at the current edition of the Ventana Sur market, Brazil’s Projeto Paradiso is rolling out three new fiction features – Stephanie Ricci’s “Night’s Mouth,” Wara’s “Who Named the Earth?” and Luciana Bezerra’s “My Brother” – as the latest projects backed by its Paradiso Incubator, one of the country’s most coveted screenplay labs.\n\n\tThe trio, hailing from São Paulo, Ceará and Rio de Janeiro, sketch the kind of cinema that Projeto Paradiso – a philanthropic initiative supporting the Brazilian film sector from the Olga Rabinovich Institute –  is betting on: formally ambitious, politically and socially engaged, rooted in sharply defined territories yet conceived to travel across festivals and markets.\n\t\n\n\tThe official announcement of the 2026 selection takes place at Ventana Sur on Wednesday, Dec. 3 during the panel “Project Development: Finding Time, Space, and Funding,” led by Programs’ director Rachel do Valle, head of studies Paula Gastaud and Gerardo Michelin, director of LatAm Cinema.\n\n\n\tAdditionally, the three projects from the 2025 Incubator edition were pitched at the event. Paradiso also confirmed that the Incubator’s 2026 edition will channel R$450,000 ($83,000) into grants, consultancies, workshops and international market access via the Paradiso Talent Network.\n\n\tDesigned to champion high-artistic-value productions and accelerate emerging careers, the Incubator has become a key launchpad since its 2019 bow, supporting 27 projects to date.\n\n\tReaching its eighth edition, the initiative already shows “tangible results for both talents and the audiovisual ecosystem,” according to Do Valle, who highlights that the new projects “represent diverse voices, aesthetics and territories.”\n\t\n\n\t“Paradiso Incubator is a cornerstone in opening doors to the international market,” Gastaud adds.\n\n\t‘Night’s Mouth’: A Senior Heroine\n\n\tLeading the new line-up, “Night’s Mouth” (“Boca da Noite”) is written and directed by São Paulo-based filmmaker Ricci and produced by Ladaia’s André Bulascoschi, Pedro Formigoni, Rodrigo Lavorato and Ricci.\n\n\tThe film centers on Areta, a 70-year-old woman whose greatest fear is not death but being forgotten. One strange night, after losing her house keys in downtown São Paulo, she sets out to find a 24-hour locksmith and instead falls into a maze of marginal and solitary figures who push her into an absurd journey through a disappearing city.\n\n\tRicci calls “Night’s Mouth” “a walking road movie set in the heart of the largest metropolis in Latin America,” in which a 70-year-old woman discovers “a singular kind of enchantment in places and characters that are usually feared or stigmatized.”\n\n\tIn development, the project comes into the Incubator on the back of strong lab momentum. Under its former working title “Eu Tenho Pavor da Velhice,” it was selected for IndieLisboa Lab 2025 and TIFF Director’s Lab 2025, and received Hubert Bals Fund Script and Project Development support, which also secured Ricci’s entry into the Paradiso Talent Network.\n\n\tFor Ladaia, a São Paulo shingle dedicated to auteur-driven projects, the feature extends a growing international footprint that already includes FIDMarseille and Rotterdam berths and Oscar-qualifying awards.\n\n\t‘Who Named the Earth?’: Indigenous Futurism\n\n\tWara’s debut feature “Who Named the Earth?” (“Quem deu nome à terra?”) leans into Indigenous futurism and sci-fi. Produced by Camilla Lapa for Ceará-based Araçá Azul Produções, the film is set in a near-future Brazil where a biometric system controls identity and the state systematizes race.\n\n\tIn this controlled landscape, non-binary Indigenous protagonist Hakan travels with their family to reclaim their roots, uncover hidden histories and join a resistance fighting to restore what was stolen, intertwining family bonds, ancestral memory and a broader struggle against institutional erasure.\n\n\t“My creative practice is rooted in visual and narrative immersion, where storytelling is inseparable from the spaces, communities, and ancestral knowledge that inform it,” says Wara.\n\t\n\n\t“Who Named the Earth?” already boasts a dense development track record. Early research and a first draft were backed by Ceará State Funding and Switzerland’s Gwaertler Stiftung, while the project has passed through BrLab Features, TorinoFilmLab Next and Cinélatino Toulouse’s Cinéma en Développement. In 2025, Wara was selected for Directors’ Factory Ceará-Brazil at Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight, co-directing the short “The Mangrove Beast,” and became the first Indigenous filmmaker to join the Paradiso Incubator and Talent Network.\n\n\tThe feature now enters a fresh phase with Brazilian producer Rachel Daisy Ellis from Desvia Filmes, the company she founded with “The Blue Trail” director Gabriel Mascaro, boarding as co-producer as the team kicks off the funding drive for production.\n\n\tFor Araçá Azul – a company formed by queer, non-hegemonic voices from Brazil’s Northeast – the film is conceived as a flagship collaboration foregrounding Indigenous and LGBTQIA+ perspectives for the global arthouse market.\n\n\t‘My Brother’: A Trans Sibling Drama\n\n\tRounding out the slate, “Meu Irmão” (“My Brother”), from Rio de Janeiro-based actress and director Luciana Bezerra, turns to intimate family drama in the Vidigal favela where Bezerra was born and has long worked as an arts educator with local NGOs and collectives. Conceived as an animated feature, the project is produced by Maria Fernanda Miguel for Favela dos Filmes, in co-production with Brazil’s Coqueirão Pictures and Dualto Produções and Germany’s Cinemanegro Filmproduktion.\n\n\tIn development, “Meu Irmão” follows Sofia, “the glue that holds her family together,” as a crisis erupts from her mother’s negative reaction to her brother’s gender transition. When Vivi goes to live with their father, Sofia fights to keep everyone united, becoming the emotional bridge between tradition and transformation as gender identity and physical distance threaten to fracture the household.\n\n\t“‘My Brother’ brings an urgent and deeply human story about family, acceptance and resilience,” says producer Miguel. “Through Sofia’s perspective, we explore how love can overcome prejudice and how a young person can become the bridge between tradition and transformation.” Positioned as a high-quality animated feature with “authentic Brazilian stories and universal emotional resonance,” the film aims to reach audiences worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tBacked by selections at Frapa and Filmecine, “Meu Irmão” fits Favela dos Filmes’ strategy of socially engaged, internationally co-produced animation. Working alongside Coqueirão Pictures – which adds experience in production and cross-border partnerships – the company is building a model that marries strong local identity with global reach, targeting multi-platform distribution while keeping underrepresented Brazilian voices at frame center.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen handicapping the Oscars, pundits scrutinize all kinds of statistics — such as previous nominations, how the contenders are perceived and the type of role they play — for clues. So we couldn’t resist looking at the actors vying for awards glory in this year’s race to see how the veterans stack up against the data and the fresh faces looking to break in.\n\n\tBest ActorReturning Champs\n\n\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio“One Battle After Another”STATS Oscar winner for 2015’s “The Revenant,” seven-time nomineeADVANTAGES He’s the star of the presumed front-running best picture candidate and he gets to run the gamut of emotions from love to desperation and even throws in some slapstick comedy as a former revolutionary called back in action when his daughter is put in danger.\n\t\n\n\tGeorge Clooney “Jay Kelly”STATS Two-time Oscar winner for supporting actor in 2006’s “Syriana” and for producing 2017’s “Argo,” eight-time nomineeADVANTAGES Literally no one else would have been as perfect playing the aging movie star in Noah Baumbach’s poignant elegy. He makes the charm look easy, but look closer at what isn’t being said — this is a beautifully nuanced performance. Also, he’s George Clooney and deadly on the circuit.\n\n\tKEEP AN EYE ON Brendan Fraser, “Rental Family,” who won in this category for 2022’s “The Whale”Back in the Ring\n\n\tTimothée Chalamet “Marty Supreme”STATS Two-time Oscar nominee for best actorADVANTAGES Even at his young age, he’s perceived as overdue (likely just missed out on winning this prize earlier this year for “A Complete Unknown.”) He is undeniable as a ping-pong prodigy in a very unique and heralded film.\n\n\tEthan Hawke “Blue Moon”STATS A four-time nominee in writing and supporting actor, this would be his first lead actor nom.ADVANTAGES Hawke delivers a career-best performance as Lorenz Hart, the less-heralded half of a songwriting team with Richard Rodgers. And the industry loves a movie about artists.\n\t\n\n\tKEEP AN EYE ON Hugh Jackman, “Song Sung Blue,” previously nominated for 2012’s “Les Misérables.”\n\n\tNew to the Race\n\n\tJoel Edgerton “Train Dreams”As this poem of a movie gains momentum, it’s hard to ignore the man at the center.\n\n\tOscar Isaac “Frankenstein”Many pundits have underestimated this film only to be proven wrong — and Isaac delivers probably the most complex and in-depth portrait of the mad scientist to date.\n\n\tDwayne Johnson“The Smashing Machine”His physical transformation into UFC fighter Mark Kerr is remarkable, but so is the tender heart he brings to the role.\n\n\tBest ActressReturning Champ\n\n\tEmma Stone “Bugonia”STATS Two-time Oscar winner for 2024’s “Poor Things” and 2017’s “La La Land,” five-time nomineeADVANTAGES Once again, Stone gives it her all in a fearless performance as a pharmaceutical CEO who may or may not be an alien.\n\n\tKEEP AN EYE ON Two-time best actress winner Jodie Foster, for “A Private Life”\n\n\tBack in the Ring\n\n\tJessie Buckley “Hamnet”STATS Previously nominated in the supporting actress category for 2021’s “The Lost Daughter”ADVANTAGES Currently seen as the front-runner for her raw and earthy portrait of William Shakespeare’s wife and the mother of the doomed title character.\n\n\tCynthia Erivo “Wicked: For Good”STATS Three-time Oscar nominee for 2025’s “Wicked” and 2020’s “Harriet” (best actress and song)ADVANTAGES She was nominated for the first and she’s just as good — if not better — this time around as the would-be Wicked Witch of the West. And the film is a runaway hit.\n\n\tKate Hudson “Song Sung Blue”STATS Previously nominated in supporting actress category for 2020’s “Almost Famous”ADVANTAGES She sings, she charms and she breaks our hearts as a woman who starts up a Neil Diamond tribute band.\n\n\tAmanda Seyfried“The Testament of Ann Lee”STATS Previously nominated in the supporting actress category for 2020’s “Mank”ADVANTAGES Seyfried is stunning in a risky film —a musical about the leader of the Shaker Movement — as a woman regarded as the female Christ by followers.\n\n\tNew to the Race\n\t\n\n\tRose Byrne “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”Showing the dark side of motherhood, Byrne is unflinching — and she picked up the Silver Bear for best leading performance at this year’s Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\tChase Infiniti “One Battle After Another”Making her feature film debut, Infiniti doesn’t miss a step and more than holds her own with Oscar-winners Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn.\n\n\tRenate Reinsve “Sentimental Value”Though she should have been nominated for “The Worst Person in the World,” this reunion with Joachim Trier should assure her a nod. She plays an actress who can’t connect with her director father.KEEP AN EYE ON Lucy Liu, “Rosemead”; Sydney Sweeney, “Christy,” and Tessa Thompson, “Hedda”\n\n\tSupporting ActorReturning Champs\n\n\tBenicio del Toro“One Battle After Another”STATS Previously won in this category for 2000’s “Traffic”ADVANTAGES Though his co-star Sean Penn is seen as a lock for a showier role, appreciation for del Toro’s scene-stealing Sensei is high and he could dance his way into the race.\n\n\tSean Penn “One Battle After Another”STATS Two-time best actor winner for “Mystic River” and “Milk,” five-time nomineeADVANTAGES Penn reminds us just how good — and darkly funny — he is with this tour-de-force as a military man whose words and actions don’t always add up.\n\n\tBack in the Ring\n\n\tPaul Mescal “Hamnet”STATS Previously nominated for lead actor for 2022’s “Aftersun”ADVANTAGES Mescal doesn’t miss a step as a young William Shakespeare in his formative years.\n\n\tJeremy Strong“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”STATS Previously nominated in this category for 2024’s “The Apprentice”ADVANTAGES He’s reliably great as Bruce Springsteen’s longtime manager Jon Landau.

    "body": "\n\tThe third season of revived HBO series “The Comeback” has revealed a first-look image at Lisa Kudrow back in action as actress Valerie Cherish, alongside the news that Andrew Scott is joining the cast. “The Comeback” will premiere in March.\n\n\tThe announcement was made by HBO chief Casey Bloys during HBO Max’s 2026 global programming slate presentation in London on Wednesday night. “Fleabag” and “Blue Moon” star Scott will be playing the head of a studio in the series alongside Kudrow, with other returning cast members including Dan Bucatinsky (who plays Val’s publicist), Laura Silverman (reality show producer, Jane) and Damian Young (Mark, Valerie’s husband). According to Kudrow, Bloys and “The Comeback” co-creator Michael Patrick King, Valerie is cast on the first sitcom ever written by AI.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThough Scott may be best known in the TV world for his role as a hot priest in 2019’s “Fleabag,” he most recently graced the silver screen in the Netflix psychological thriller series “Ripley” and also had a cameo role in Lena Dunham’s latest series “Too Much.”\n\n\n\t“The Comeback” originally aired on HBO for a 13-episode season in 2005 before being canceled, and then revived for an eight-episode second season in 2014. Shot in a found-footage style, “The Comeback” follows B-list sitcom actress Valerie Cherish (Kudrow) as she chronicles her return to television after a decade through a reality series. Its second season saw Valerie attempt to producer her own reality TV pilot for famed “Real Housewives” producer Andy Cohen. Further plot details about Season 3 have yet to be released.\n\t\n\n\tCo-created by Kudrow and King, “The Comeback” Season 3 cast also includes Tim Bagley, Matt Cook, Jack O’Brien, Ella Stiller, John Early, Barry Shabaka Henley, Abbi Jacobson, Tony Macht, Brittany O’Grady, Zane Phillips and Julian Stern. Kudrow and Patrick King also executive produce alongside Bucatinsky and John Melfi.\n\n\tScott is repped by CAA, United Agents, Relevan  and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.\n",

She told police he forcibly removed her clothing in order to check her vaginal and anal areas for hidden narcotics ... before striking her multiple times.\n      \n    \n          At this point, Nicole told police Milfort pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot her if she didn't tell him where his drugs were ... alternating between pointing the gun at himself and her over the next hour -- before she says he put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger early Saturday morning.\n      \n    \n          Officers responded to a 911 call from the front desk ... they searched the motel room and observed drugs and drug paraphernalia, children's toys and food strewn around the room ... as well as the loaded Taurus handgun.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Cops say after the interview and the search, they determined she and Milfort exposed their child to numerous drugs over their stay ... they say she made no attempt to remove the kid while Milfort was waving around the the gun.\n      \n    \n          A source close to the Milfort family tells TMZ … Nicole’s family currently has the child.\n      \n    \n          We broke the story ... police determined POORSTACY's death was a suicide -- though members of his family don't believe the official claim and believe it may be foul play.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Nicole's parents ... so far, no word back.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

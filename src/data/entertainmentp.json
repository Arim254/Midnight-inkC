    "description": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump had a seemingly scatological reaction to the nationwide “No Kings” protests against him Saturday.\n\n\tIn an AI-generated video ",
    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump had a seemingly scatological reaction to the nationwide “No Kings” protests against him Saturday.\n\n\tIn an AI-generated video Trump shared on his Truth Social platform Saturday evening, the U.S. president is depicted as a king in a fighter jet dropping what appears to be a large amount of fecal matter on protesters below. In the 19-second video, the president is in a fighter jet marked “King Trump,” and he is shown wearing a crown sitting in the cockpit. (The oxygen mask that “King Trump” wears does not fully cover his nose and mouth.)\n\t\n\n\tIn the video, “King Trump” appears to zoom the jet over New York City, whereupon he drops a payload of brown sludge on the protesters in the streets below him. The video is set to “Danger Zone,” the Kenny Loggins hit song from “Top Gun.” A watermark in the video indicates that it was created by someone with the handle @XERIAS_X.\n\n\n\tAmong other videos Trump shared Saturday on Truth Social was one originally posted earlier in the day on BlueSky by VP JD Vance that shows Trump placing a crown on his own head and then drawing a sword. That one is set to the song “Hail to the King” by heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the official White House account on X marked “No Kings” day by posting an image of Trump and Vance wearing crowns above an image of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate Minority Leader, wearing sombreros.\n\n\t“We’re built different. Have a good night, everyone. 👑,” the caption of the White House post said.\n\n\n\tOn Saturday, Oct. 18, nearly 7 million people participated at more than 2,700 “No Kings” protests in all 50 states, CNN reported. Celebrities including Mark Ruffalo, Jimmy Kimmel, Robert De Niro and Glenn Close shared support for the protests against the Trump administration’s actions.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s the latest weird AI-generated meme Trump has posted on social media over the years.\n\n\tIn May, Trump shared an AI-generated image of himself dressed as the Pope, following the death of Pope Francis on April 21 (and a few days before Chicago-born Pope Leo XIV was elected). In February, Trump shared an AI-generated video depicting the war-torn Gaza Strip transformed into the “Trump Gaza” resort, which among other scenes showed Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sitting shirtless poolside. \n\n\tAhead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Trump posted a series of AI-generated images falsely claiming that Taylor Swift endorsed him for president, including one portraying the singer as Uncle Sam overlaid with a message that said “Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.” Trump also shared a photoshopped picture depicting himself as Superman and other associates as DC superheroes.\n\n\tRELATED: Jimmy Kimmel, Robert De Niro, Glenn Close and More Speak Out in Support of No Kings Protests: ‘We’re Rising Up Again’\n",

    "body": "\n\tSabrina Carpenter delivered an NSFW performance on the Oct. 18 episode of “Saturday Night Live,” when she sang her “Man’s Best Friend” track “Nobody’s Song” and didn’t self-censor the lyrics “He sure fucked me up” on two occasions.\n\n\tThere was likely some miscommunication with NBC censors, as the profanity wasn’t muted or bleeped either time, causing it to go live uncensored on both the East Coast network broadcast and the Peacock simulcast. Some viewers on the West Coast noted that the broadcast seemed to be on a slight delay and had the audio go silent in their feed during the two F-words.\n\t\n\n\tCarpenter served as both the host and musical guest of the show, and the “Nobody’s Song” performance, with a martial arts stage setup, happened near the end of the show. Earlier in the evening, she sang “Manchild” as her first musical number.\n\n\n\tCarpenter recently used some surprise profanity on television during the 2025 VMAs while accepting the Best Album Award, where she said, “This world, as we all know, can be so full of criticism and discrimination and negativity. So to get to be a part of something so often, more than not, that is something that can bring you light, make you smile, make you dance and make you feel like the world is your fucking oyster, I am so grateful, so grateful to do that.”\n\n\tOff-the-cuff profanity has been much-discussed during “Saturday Night Live” history, with it being an open secret that NBC and creator Lorne Michaels don’t appreciate the show being opened up to potential FCC fines. Hosts like Kristen Stewart, Sam Rockwell and Ariana Grande have all dropped uncensored profanity during their monologues or sketches. Cast members such as Norm Macdonald and Jenny Slate have as well. The rock band the Replacements also dropped an F-bomb while performing in 1986.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, the show has hosted plenty of controversial musical performances, such as NBC removing upside-down American flags from Rage Against the Machine’s amps in 1996 to Ashlee Simpson’s botched vocal performance in 2004.\n\n\tCarpenter was not the only one to stir controversy by dropping the F-word in a high-profile setting in the last week. President Donald J. Trump used the word on Friday during a live news conference, saying that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro “doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States.” Rather than  shrink back from the rough language, the official White House X account and the administration’s rapid response team account both posted video of the president’s tough talk. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Austin Johnson’s Donald Trump dropped by an episode of the junk food podcast “Snack Homiez” during the Sabrina Carpenter-hosted episode of “Saturday Night Live” on Oct. 18.\n\n\tWhen asked by young men co-hosting the podcast — played by Carpenter, Chloe Fineman, Jane Wickline and Veronika Slowikowska — about his thoughts on the candy Airheads, he had a predictably long-winded answer that touched on the day’s “No Kings” protests and the president’s recent move to release disgraced former Republican congressman George Santos from prison. \n\t\n\n\t“You know who I like is that George Santos,” Trump said. “He’s weird, he’s a liar. I think he’s great. We don’t know anything about him, he’s one of our favorite people. I don’t know him at all, but one of our favorite people. People are marching because they’re happy he’s free. It’s a ‘Yes, King!’ march. They say, ‘Yes, King!'”\n\n\n\tTrump didn’t appear in the evening’s cold open, which is usually the case. The episode started about 14 minutes late due to college football running long, and the show began with a reprisal of the fan-favorite sketch “Domingo” instead of beginning with a traditional political cold open.\n\n\tSantos was also mentioned at the top of the episode’s Weekend Update segment, with Colin Jost joking, “Yesterday, President Trump finally released what everyone has been asking him to release: George Santos, the former Republican congressman who pled guilty to fraud and something called ‘aggravated identity theft,’ which I think is when you push someone in a closet and change clothes with them.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the “Snack Homiez” sketch below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBowen Yang will miss the Oct. 18 taping of “Saturday Night Live.”\n\n\tAccording to a source close to the show, Yang’s absence was preplanned so that the “Wicked” star could accept the Academy Museum’s Vantage Award, which honors an emerging artist who challenges and recontextualizes the dominant narratives in TV and film. He was still reportedly present to help write tonight’s episode and will appear in a pre-taped sketch.\n\n\n\tYang took to his Instagram stories on Saturday to announce his one-night departure from the show.\n\t\n\n\t“Missing the show tonight but it will be sooooo fun,” he wrote, “[Sabrina Carpenter] is amazing.”\n\n\tAs noted by Yang, Sabrina Carpenter will serve as host and musical guest for Saturday’s show. This marks the hosting debut for the two-time Emmy winner, although she previously appeared as a musical guest for the Season 49 finale hosted by Jake Gyllenhaal. She also appeared in “SNL 50: The Anniversary Special,” during which she sang with Paul Simon and appeared in a sketch alongside Marcello Hernandez.\n\n\tThe Season 51 premiere was hosted by Bad Bunny with music from Doja Cat. Amy Pohler hosted the following episode, joined by musical guest Role Model. Other upcoming hosts include Miles Teller, who will join for his second time as host on Nov. 26, as well as newcomers Nikki Glaser and Glen Powell, who will host on Nov. 8 and Nov. 15, respectively.\n\n\t“Saturday Night Live” airs every Saturday at 11:30 p.m. ET on NBC and streams on Peacock. Lorne Michaels created and executive produces the show, which is produced in association with Broadway Video.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKim Kardashian couldn’t see a thing when she arrived at the Academy Museum Gala on Saturday night in Los Angeles – for good reason.\n\n\tHer head was entirely covered by a face mask.\n\n\t“Margiela couture,” Kardashian told me exclusively on the red carpet. “[Designer] Glenn Martens. You know, I love Margiela. I flew in my favorite makeup artist Mario from New York, and this is kind of a last-minute thing, so I’m sure he’s not so happy with it.”\n\t\n\n\tShe says she was in “full hair and makeup” underneath the mask, which she was planning on taking off once inside the gala.\n\n\t“It does look very Skims-y,” Kardashian said, referring to her underwear line. “That’s why I was drawn to it when the Margiela couture show came out. I saw this look and I was like, ‘That is so Skims to me.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kardashian at Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala at Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on October 18, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Michael Buckner/WWD)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWWD via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSpeaking of Skims, I asked Kardashian about her new limited line of $32 merkins. Officially called “faux hair micro string thongs,” they sold out within minutes of going on sale. “That was just a fun idea that I had. There was a shoot, and someone wanted to, like, have hair down there once. And I was like, ‘Couldn’t this just be easy and have it on a thong?’ And so we made that happen. I had no idea that it would get that reaction and sell out in a few minutes.”\n\n\tIt’s not known yet if Kardashian took off the mask for the night’s dinner and program.\n\n\tThis year’s gale honorees included Penélope Cruz, Walter Salles, Bruce Springsteen and Bowen Yang  Presented by Rolex, the star-studded evening raises vital support for the museum’s exhibitions, screenings, and educational programming.\n\t\n\n\tThe 2025 Gala Host Committee included Amy Adams, Judd Apatow, Gael García Bernal, Laura Dern, Colman Domingo, Willem Dafoe, Goldie Hawn, Oscar Isaac, Zoë Kravitz, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Lupita Nyong’o, Jenna Ortega, Winona Ryder, Chloë Sevigny, Tessa Thompson, Rachel Zegler and many more.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSabrina Carpenter, the host as well as musical guest for this week’s “Saturday Night Live,” used her monologue to riff on her risque image, suggesting that she wants to be known for more than just being sexually provocative, while of course joking that she indeed has a one-track mind.\n\n\t“Now since I’m here, I want to clear up some misconceptions people have about me,” Carpenter said. “Everyone thinks of me as this, like, horndog pop star, but there’s really so much more to me. I’m not just horny. I’m also turned on and I’m sexually charged. And I love to read. My favorite book is the encyclopedia. It’s so big and it’s hard…”\n\t\n\n\tThe pop star showed the controversial cover photo of her recent “Man’s Best Friend” album. “Some people got a little freaked out by the cover. I’m not sure why,” she said. “It was just this me on all fours with an unseen figure pulling my hair,. But what people don’t realize is, that’s just how they cropped it. If you zoom out, it’s clearly a picture from the 50th anniversary special of Bowen (Yang) helping me up by the hair…” The image zoomed out further: “…after Martin Short shoved me out of the buffet line.”\n\n\n\tIn any case, Carpenter avowed, “There is a real person underneath all the sparkles and the wigs and the corsets. And another thing you might not know about me is that I love to interact with the audience during my show.” She took to the crowd, interacting with a young man who identified himself as Will from Maryland — both of which, naturally, turned her on. “Ooh, what a sexy, unusual place. See, I love talking to normal people. They’re so fascinating when they’re real like you.”\n\t\n\n\n\tBut when she asked what the audience member did for a living, and he answered “venture capital,” she quickly moved on.\n\n\t“The last one thing I like to do at my concerts is arrest someone for being hot. So who here can I arrest tonight?” Kenan Thompson came out with a pair of pink handcuffs, saying he was arresting her not for being hot but “for falsely impersonating an officer 200 times at your concerts.”\n\n\tThompson said he was actually there to get a Cameo for his daughter, only to have Carpenter tell him that would cost $200,000″ — and while he moved on, she announced that “if anyone else wants one, find me on Venmo.”\n\n\tThe monologue followed an opening Domingo sketch in which Carpenter was one of several women at a birthday party describing a bachelorette-style trip to Nashville while singing spoof versions of Taylor Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia” and Lady Gaga’s “Abracadabra.”\n\n\tLater, for her first musical number, Carpenter sang her No. 1 hit “Manchild” with girlish glee on a stage decked out as a bedroom, bouncing around on a bed in a yellow “SNL” T-shirt and pink “SNL” underwear, surrounded on either side by the band and eventually joined in the foreground by a sax soloist. \n\n\tThe second musical number, “Nobody’s Son,” had Carpenter singing in a martial-arts setting, Controversy arose as the east coast feed had her singing the words “fucked up” twice, uncensored. West coast viewers, however, reported that the audio went silent in those two instances, with censors apparently having more of a tape delay for that feed. \n",

    "body": "\n\tBette Midler is updating fans on the progress of “Hocus Pocus 3.”\n\n\tDuring a recent appearance on “Watch What Happens Live,” the “Beaches” star shared that the “Hocus Pocus 3” producers are currently ironing out “all the those logistical things” before shooting begins. She also revealed that she recently read an early draft of the script and thought it was “brilliant.”\n\n\t“Well, you know, they sent a script, and a lot of it was brilliant,” she said. “So I got very excited, and now we’re trying to figure out what it is and where it’s going to be and how much it’s going to cost and all those logistical things.”\n\t\n\n\tThe last time Midler discussed the “Hocus Pocus 3” script was in July 2024. During an appearance on the QVC+ talk show “Busy This Week,” she urged Disney to speed up development on the long-awaited sequel.\n\n\t“I haven’t seen the script, but I’ve heard rumblings,” Midler said at the time. “I think if they’re gonna, they oughta, because time is not just marching, time is barrel-assing to the finish line. Get us while we’re still breathing, I mean, God!”\n\n\tFormer president of Walt Disney Pictures Sean Bailey revealed that “‘Hocus Pocus 3’ is happening” in a 2023 profile with the New York Times. The first film, released in 1993, starred Midler alongside Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy as a trio of witches who return from the 17th century to cause havoc in modern-day Salem. Parker and Najimy are expected to return for the third film. \n\n\t“Hocus Pocus 2” became Disney+’s most-watched original film ever after its 2022 release, with 2.7 billion minutes watched over its opening weekend.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWe take it for granted today, but John Woo has one of the most recognizable visual signatures of any living filmmaker. Back in the mid-1980s, what started in Hong Kong reverberated around the world, as Woo — who was then stuck at the lowest point of his career — elevated action to art, finding poetry in the medium’s most destructive genre.\n\n\tFor many years, and for no good reason, it was all but impossible for international audiences to see the three John Woo movies that saved his career, launched Chow Yun-fat to stardom and revolutionized action cinema forever. They are, in chronological order, “A Better Tomorrow” (1986), “The Killer” (1989) and “Hard Boiled” (1992), and all three are playing in stunning 4K restorations this week at the Lumière Festival in Lyon, France, where Woo will be on hand to introduce his first three masterpieces.\n\t\n\n\tBefore flying overseas, the 79-year-old legend was gracious enough to welcome me into his headquarters in West Los Angeles, which overlooks the Getty Museum. The suite offers a panoramic view of the city Woo now calls home, and yet I found myself staring at the walls, on which hang giant posters for his most influential movies.\n\n\n\tIn the corner, separated by a tall glass wall — the kind it’s easy to imagine Chow crashing through in slow motion, with guns blazing in both hands — Woo’s office is decorated with enormous posters for two classics by French director Jean-Pierre Melville: “Le Cercle Rouge,” with Alain Delon, and “L’Aîné des Ferchaux,” starring Jean-Pierre Belmondo. I can tell this is going to be a good conversation, since Melville is my favorite director, too.\n\t\n\n\t“When I was young, I wrote quite a lot of poems,” Woo tells me. “I have always imagined that no matter what happens in this world, there is always some kind of beauty existing. And I also like romanticism. My style was greatly influenced by European movies, and especially Jacques Demy’s movie, ‘The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.’”\n\n\tThis isn’t what I expected to hear. With Woo, the connection to French crime films is clear: Melville was obsessive about American genre cinema. He studied, absorbed and ultimately improved upon the codes in such film noir classics as “This Gun for Hire” and “Odds Against Tomorrow.” Decades later, Woo did the same with Melville’s movies (“Le Samouraï” and “Le Cercle Rouge” in particular).\n\n\tBut a musical like “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” which explodes with color and ends in tears? It’s not the first reference that comes to mind.\n\n\t“When I’m making an action movie, I don’t see it is an action movie,” Woo explains. “It’s like a painting or a poem, sometimes even like a musical. I’m aiming for that kind of feel, because I’m a dreamer. I think that’s my style because I always have some kind of beautiful dream in my mind.”\n\n\tWoo’s first filmmaking job was working as assistant director for Shaw Brothers veteran Chang Cheh. At a time when the Hong Kong industry was dominated by sex comedies and kung fu movies, Chang taught him the principles of dynamic action. And though he never studied any of the martial arts, Woo has always loved dance, which made all the difference in how he stages gun battles.\n\n\t“I was a pretty good dancer when I was young,” says Woo, who choreographs the balletic action scenes in his films himself. “When it comes to the action in a movie, it’s all about the beauty of the body movement and the fighting skill.”\n\n\tIn the 1970s, Woo had a successful run directing comedies and other projects that might now seem off-brand to his fans, like the 1976 Cantonese opera “Princess Chang Ping” and low-budget action comedy “Money Crazy.” That changed in the early ’80s, when Woo hit a rough patch. “My movies didn’t work at all, and then I became a box office poison,” he says with a chuckle. “I was looked down on by so many people, and some of my friends even said I should retire.”\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Woo’s friend and fellow director Tsui Hark was on a hot streak, which put him in the ideal position with Golden Princess, a new production company with money to spend and limited experience in cinema. Unhappy to see talented peers unable to find work, Tsui used the opportunity to produce projects for Woo and others.\n\n\t“He’s a good man,” Woo says. “He liked helping the others, so if he saw anyone out of a job who couldn’t get a movie, he supported them.” It was Tsui’s idea to make a gangster movie that a family audience could watch — what became “A Better Tomorrow” — which Tsui would produce and Woo could direct.\n\n\t“That was my first auteur film,” Woo recalls. “He encouraged me to put myself into the movie, to make the movie my own. And he let me change all the dialogue, to say what I really wanted to say from my heart.”\n\n\tFor years, Woo had been wanting to make a film like “Le Samouraï,” but no one would give him the opportunity. At last, he was being given the green light to incorporate his personal style into a project, dressing Chow in a stiff trench coat — a nod to both Alain Delon and his favorite Japanese star, Ken Takakura — and giving the character a strict code of honor that would become a Woo signature. (At the time, the director felt the younger generation had lost appreciation for traditional morals, so he designed the dynamic between Chow and Ti Lung’s characters — which reminded Chinese audiences of the bond they felt toward old schoolmates — to reinforce the values of brotherhood, friendship and sacrifice.)\n\n\t“Before ‘A Better Tomorrow,’ I didn’t have much chance to try this kind of a style. Because I never got any support from the studio or anyone, I wasn’t able to experiment,” he says.\n\n\tWorking with Tsui for Golden Princess was different. So long as the films were profitable, the financiers left them alone.\n\n\t“We had a lot of creative freedom,” Woo remembers. “There was a trust between us, so we could do whatever we wanted, so every director, they had a great opportunity to try something new, something they had never done before.”\n\n\tAs far as the investors were concerned, Tsui and Woo knew the market. By keeping the budgets tight, they could be reasonably sure the films would break even — and many were wildly successful (“A Better Tomorrow” broke all box office records in Hong Kong, prompting a sequel, even though Chow’s character had been killed in the original).\n\t\n\n\t“Since we were trusting each other, there was no need to give them a completed script. We just let them know the idea, the rough budget and the shooting schedule,” Woo says. “Their main concern was about the casting, if you can find somebody who could guarantee you make money.”\n\n\tWorking for Chang back in the day, Woo had watched his mentor turn unknown actors into stars. And of course, he had developed his own strategies over the years. “I know how to use all kind of tools to help the actors,” he says. “I know what kind of lens will make him look good and what kind of angle. And the size will bring out his very special quality.”\n\n\tWith Chow, Woo saw something in the actor (who was a popular TV star, but nothing on the level of what followed) no one else had. Watching a show called “The Bund,” Woo noticed how the actor’s eyes helped tell the story and cast him against type as a triad gangster given a chance to redeem himself.\n\n\t“He had never punched a guy in his whole life,” says Woo, who tailors the action to each actor he works with. He might try to find out what sports a given performer prefers — like running or swimming — and then model his movement accordingly, incorporating that into his choreography. Woo even considers the size of his actors’ trigger finger when selecting the right guns for them to use in a shootout. “If he’s got a long finger, then he could be holding a little bit bigger guns. If he has a short finger like me, then he’ll hold a pistol, not too long.”\n\n\tOne of Woo’s signatures — actors holding two handguns, firing with both barrels at the same time — has an unexpected origin. “I’d seen a lot of Westerns,” Woo says, but he wasn’t thinking of cowboys with holsters on each hip. On “A Better Tomorrow,” he wanted to shoot the definitive gun battle in Hong Kong movie history, but Woo figured, “if he’s a professional killer and he’s a true hero, he would never use a machine gun. It’s too easy and not elegant.”\n\n\tWoo had a clear idea of the sound he wanted — he could hear the drumbeat in his head — but had never owned a gun in his life, so he asked the props team for help. The weapons experts suggested a semiautomatic Beretta 92F handgun that could fire up to 15 rounds nonstop, though the tempo wasn’t fast enough. Then Woo had an idea: “How about using two guns?” By staggering the rhythm, where Chow alternated pulling the trigger with each hand, Woo got the “music” he wanted.\n\t\n\n\t“A Better Tomorrow” was a huge hit in Hong Kong, which gave Woo a chance to make several more movies for Golden Princess. He had even more creative control on “The Killer.” Tsui was busy producing other films at the time, leaving Woo to do what he wanted — which, in this case, was a poetic hitman movie, à la Melville’s “Le Samouraï,” where an assassin sacrifices himself for the lounge singer who witnesses his crime.\n\n\t“I had the whole movie in my mind,” says Woo, who shot without a script, instructing the actors and crew what he wanted with each scene on set. According to the director, they thought he was making another “Better Tomorrow” and weren’t expecting something so romantic.\n\n\tWhen “The Killer” was invited to screen at the Toronto Film Festival, Woo was instantly recognized as a visionary talent by international critics. The director’s most bombastic movie by far, “Hard Boiled” made him an even hotter commodity abroad. The plot was inspired by a Japanese news report that had deeply disturbed Woo, about a lunatic guilty of poisoning baby formula. Ever the moralist (despite the level of violence in his films), Woo flipped the idea to focus on two cops who wind up protecting innocent hospital patients — including a ward full of newborn babies — from a ruthless triad boss.\n\n\t“What surprised me was how it got such a warm welcome from the Western world,” says Woo, who started to get offers to work in Hollywood.\n\n\t“The biggest reason I came to Hollywood was because I wanted to learn something new. At the same time, I tried to prove my style could also work in a Hollywood movie,” says Woo, whose signature techniques — slow-motion cinematography, gravity-defying choreography, over-the-top pyrotechnics — were already influencing Western directors like Robert Rodriguez and Luc Besson.\n\n\tWoo wasn’t quite prepared for how much stricter the American industry was about everything, from second-guessing the director to how violence is depicted. (His first Hollywood feature, “Hard Target,” earned an NC-17 rating on that front.)\n\n\tIn America, Woo observes, “The studio and the big star had so much control. They have final approval of the script and the supporting roles. But in Hong Kong, the director is everything.”\n\t\n\n\tOn “Hard Target,” Belgian bodybuilder-cum-action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme wanted a say in how Woo cut the footage. The Hong Kong helmer was lucky to have producers Sam Raimi, Jim Jacks and Rob Tapert in his corner. “When the star tried to control the editing, they threw him out,” he says.\n\n\tWoo’s best American studio experience was making “Face/Off,” which had been conceived as a more overtly sci-fi scenario set 200 years in the future. Woo wasn’t comfortable with that genre or the visual effects it would have required, so it was rewritten as a more contemporary “human drama” (in Woo’s words).\n\n\tWhat made it so satisfying, apart from all that stars John Travolta and Nicolas Cage brought to their characters, was having the full support of Paramount chairman Sherry Lansing. The way Woo tells it, Lansing gathered the entire crew at the outset and told the room, “All I want is a John Woo movie. So no one should give him any notes.”\n\n\tBut there was a harsh trade-off for all the creative freedom Woo had enjoyed in Hong Kong: Golden Princess owned the rights to all the films he and Tsui had made, which they parceled up and sold to different territories. Then the company went under, and the films fell out of circulation in most parts of the world. “So the Hong Kong movies we had made became just like a memory,” says Woo, who’s delighted to see them finally restored and back in circulation, since Shout! Studios acquired the Golden Princess library earlier this year.\n\n\tThe reason Woo was able to remake “The Killer” last year can be explained by a fluke over film rights: Nearly three decades ago, Columbia had wanted to do an American “cover” version, but couldn’t get it off the ground. Many screenwriters and directors had come and gone from the project, without success.\n\n\t“It never came together. And then after 20 years, they gave the rights back to us,” Woo says. He was working in China, shooting “Red Cliff” at the time, but he was intrigued by Brian Helgeland’s idea of gender-flipping the killer, so Chow Yun-fat’s character would be a woman.\n\n\t“When I came back, I really got excited, because I had never considered a female killer before,” he says.\n\n\tAccording to Woo, his biggest regret about the Golden Princess period — and the film he’ll never be able to fully recover — is 1990’s “Bullet in the Head” (the film he made between “The Killer” and “Hard Boiled”).\n\t\n\n\t“The original cut was three hours, but for the Hong Kong release, I was forced to cut it down to two hours,” he explains. Woo had to slash several scenes he was proud of to appease the producers. Once Woo came to Hollywood and had earned enough money, he tried to buy the rights to the movie, but it was too late: The Hong Kong lab that held onto the deleted footage had thrown it out after a year. “They only get saved for one year, and then they are thrown away like garbage,” he says.\n\n\tThe good news is that Woo’s other Golden Princess projects have survived and can now be rediscovered by audiences who grew up on “The Matrix” and the John Wick movies.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSam Rivers, bassist and founding member of the metal band Limp Bizkit, died on Saturday, the band announced in a social media post. No cause of death was stated, although he had a history of alcohol-related liver disease; he was 48.\n\n\t“Today we lost our brother. Our bandmate. Our heartbeat,” the band wrote. “Sam Rivers wasn’t just our bass player — he was pure magic. The pulse beneath every song, the calm in the chaos, the soul in the sound.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Jacksonville, Fla. In 1977, Rivers first began playing music in middle school, beginning with tuba because his friend, future Limp Bizkit drummer John Otto, played jazz drums. While Rivers and Otto are often said to be cousins, the pair had initially thought they were related, but turned out not to be.\n\n\n\n\tRivers later switched to bass and guitar, and became friends with future Limp Bizkit singer/rapper Fred Durst. The pair formed a short-lived band called Malachi Sage, but soon regrouped with Otto to form Limp Bizkit in 1994, uniting with madcap guitarist Wes Borland (who would leave and rejoin the band several times) and later, former House of Pain member DJ Lethal.\n\n\tThe band was aligned with the fast-rising “nu-metal” movement and, after a show in Los Angeles opening for Korn, were signed by Flip Records, whose founder, Jordan Schur, later struck a distribution deal  with Interscope for the band’s debut album. That album, “Three Dollar Bill Y’all” was released in 1997, and the band toured extensively with the Deftones, Helmet, and on the Warped tour. The rapidly building buzz culminated with their 1999 follow-up, “Significant Other,” driven by the single “Nookie” and a half-serious metal cover of George Michael’s hit “Faith.”\n\t\n\n\tThe album rocketed to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and Limp Bizkit quickly became one of the biggest rock bands in the country. However, their set at the disastrous 1999 Woodstock festival was marred by violence; many blamed Durst for the uproar, as he crowdsurfed on plywood that rioters had torn off of festival fixtures and then shouted “It wasn’t our fault” as he left the stage, although opinions vary. The violence resulted in three deaths, dozens of injuries and 44 arrests, amid multiple incidents of rape, vandalism and arson.  \n\n\tThe band followed with the 2000 set “Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water,” but Durst’s unfiltered, often homophobic and sexist lyrics and comments and ongoing conflicts between him and Borland resulted in the latter leaving the band in 2001. Rivers shifted over to guitar for the band’s 2003 album “Results May Vary,” but Borland rejoined the following year.\n\n\tLimp Bizkit went on hiatus in 2006 and Rivers worked as a producer with Jacksonville bands Burn Season and the Embraced, a role he would continue after the band reunited in 2009. Limp Bizkit continued to tour and release albums sporadically over the following years, although Rivers left in 2015 for health reasons that he later revealed were liver ailments due to alcohol abuse. \n\n\t“I got liver disease from excessive drinking … I had to leave Limp Bizkit in 2015 because I felt so horrible, and a few months after that I realized I had to change everything because I had really bad liver disease,” Rivers told writer Jon Wiederhorn. “I quit drinking and did everything the doctors told me. I got treatment for the alcohol and got a liver transplant, which was a perfect match.”\n\n\tHe rejoined in 2018 and remained until his death.\n\n\t“He was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of human. A true legend of legends,” the band concluded in its post on Saturday. “And his spirit will live forever in every groove, every stage, every memory,” the band continued. “We love you, Sam. We’ll carry you with us, always. Rest easy, brother. Your music never ends.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHollywood is speaking out in support of the No Kings protests.\n\n\tOn Saturday, hundreds of thousands of Americans across all 50 states took to the streets to protest against President Donald Trump and his administration. ICE’s aggressive raids remain a key issue in the demonstrations, as they were during June’s No Kings protests. Insertions of the National Guard into major metropolitan areas and sweeping cuts to federal programs are also top of mind for protestors.\n\t\n\n\tMark Ruffalo, one of Hollywood’s most vocal stars against the Trump administration, took to Threads to shout out No Kings protests in Gainesville, Fla., Minneapolis, Philadelphia and New York City.\n\n\n\t“Amazing,” he wrote. “So many people love the USA and want NOKINGs.”\n\n\tJimmy Kimmel posted an infographic on Instagram containing dozens of scathing nicknames that protesters can call the president on their signs. Examples include “Commander-in-Theif,” “Greedy McGolfy,” “Mar-a-Lardo,” “Orange Julius Caesar” and “Uncle Scam.”\n\n\tIn the caption, the late-night host wrote, “When you’re making your #NoKings posters, remember… Donald Trump LOVES a good nickname.”\n\n\tOn Oct. 9, Robert De Niro appeared in a video on the TikTok account of political activist group Indivisible to encourage people to attend the No Kings protests.\n\n\t“The original No Kings protest was 250 years ago,” De Niro said. “Americans decided they didn’t want to live under the rule of King George III. They declared their independence and fought a bloody war for democracy. We’ve had two and a half centuries of democracy since then. Often challenging, sometimes messy, always essential.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “Now we have a would-be king who wants to take it away: King Donald the First. Fuck that. We’re rising up again, this time, nonviolently raising our voices to declare: No Kings.”\n\n\tJohn Cusack gave an interview to News 4 San Antonio while at a No Kings protest in Chicago. He said, “It’s all upsetting. Seeing a sort of fascist authoritarian…cosplay that the right wing has been fooling around with for so long, seeing it devolve into the real thing is predictable, but deeply saddening.”\n\n\tOn Facebook, Paul Schrader posted a photo of a No Kings protest in Times Square with the caption “I was there.”\n\n\t8-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close posted a photo to Instagram of her holding a sign that read, “No oligarchs. No dictators. No despots. No autocrats. No kings!!” In the caption, she quoted Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, writing, “‘…that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from this earth.”\n\n\tSee more celebrities supporting the No Kings protests below. \n\n\n\n\n",

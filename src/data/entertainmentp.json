    "body": "\n\tThat’s a wrap on “Spider-Man” star Tom Holland for his latest outing as the web-slinging Marvel superhero.\n\n\t“Spider-Man: Brand New Day” director Destin Daniel Cretton announced Friday that filming has wrapped on the fourth of Holland’s solo movies, thanking the star for his “kind, generous leadership on and off screen, for your relentless work ethic, your fearless performances, and for your friendship.” \n\n\n\tIn “Brand New Day,” Holland returns as Peter Parker after the kid from Queens accidentally broke open the multiverse in 2021’s “No Way Home,” and is forced to make the difficult decision to make the entire world, including his closest friends MJ and Ned (Zendaya and Jacob Batalon), forget his identity. The Sony/Marvel movie also features Mark Ruffalo (as original Avenger Bruce Banner aka the Hulk), Jon Bernthal (Frank Castle/the Punisher), “Severance” standout Tramell Tillman, “The Bear’s” Liza Colon-Zayas, Michael Mando (Scorpion), Marvin Joness III (Tombstone) and Sadie Sink (playing an undisclosed, but much-discussed role). \n\t\n\n\t“I’m so deeply grateful for the people who walked with me through the biggest, most rewarding film I’ve ever been a part of,” Cretton wrote on Instagram. “To our amazing cast, for breathing so much life into these beloved characters and moving us every day. To our unbelievable crew, who worked tirelessly with unmatched creativity and craftsmanship, who made me laugh so hard my stomach never stopped hurting. I love you all so much and can’t wait for the world to see your stunning work on the big screen.”\n\n\tOn a more personal note, Cretton also thanked his wife, fashion designer Nikki Chapman, “for laughing through the insanity and carrying our entire family on your back” and his kids “for forcing me to put my phone down and get out of my head long enough to build a fort in the living room with couch cushions.” \n\t\n\n\t“Brand New Day,” which swings into theaters on July 31, is Cretton’s second MCU movie, following 2021’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.” He was previously set to direct the now-scrapped “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,” but departed the project in November 2023. Cretton is also the co-creator and one of the directors of the upcoming “Wonder Man” series. The Disney+ show, starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, begins streaming on Jan. 27.\n\n\t“Captain Marvel” star Brie Larson, who starred in Cretton’s acclaimed 2013 indie “Short Term 12,” was among the many commenters to salute the filmmaker on a job well done, writing, “Congrats!!!! Love you bro!” and “Hugs to my spidey too!!!”\n\n\tThe “Brand New Day” update comes as the first teaser for the next “Avengers: Doomsday” debuted in theaters ahead of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” The clip for the movie, out next December, reveals the return of Chris Evans as Steve Rogers. Anticipation for the new Spider-Man movie is high, as each of Holland’s outings has been more successful at the box office than the last. “Spider-Man: Homecoming” grossed $880 million in 2017; then, in 2019, “Far From Home” generated $1.13 billion. 2021’s “No Way Home,” which featured previous Spider-Men Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, became the first post-pandemic blockbuster, with a global box office haul of $1.9 billion.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Last Frontier” has been canceled after one season at Apple TV.\n\n\tThe thriller series stared Jason Clarke as Frank Remnick, who is described as “the lone U.S. marshal in charge of the quiet, rugged barrens of Alaska. Remnick’s jurisdiction is turned upside down when a prison transport plane crashes in the remote wilderness, setting free dozens of violent inmates. Tasked with protecting the town he’s vowed to keep safe, he begins to suspect the crash wasn’t an accident, but the first step of a well-crafted plan with far-reaching and devastating implications.”\n\t\n\n\tAlong with Clarke, “The Last Frontier” starred Dominic Cooper, Haley Bennett, Simone Kessell, Dallas Goldtooth, Tait Blum and Alfre Woodard. Jon Bokenkamp and Richard D’Ovidio created the series and served as executive producers along with Clarke, Laura Benson, Glenn Kessler, Albert Kim and director Sam Hargrave.\n\n\n\t“The Last Frontier” received mixed reviews from critics, achieving a 46% on Rotten Tomatoes. Variety‘s review said that after “an entertaining bait-and-switch” in the first episode, the show “gets bogged down in a serialized plot that’s more convoluted and generic than the simple pleasures of maniacs running amok and small-town cops chasing them down.”\n\n\t“The Last Frontier” premiered on Oct. 10, with the Season 1 finale coming on Dec. 5. In an interview with Variety after the finale, Bokenkamp and D’Ovidio said they were already discusing ideas for a potential second season, including a change of location. “I think that we’ve discussed many avenues to take with the second season, but we’ve pretty much exhausted a lot of stories in Alaska,” D’Ovidio said, with Bokenkamp adding, “We’ve certainly talked a lot about where they end up, maybe a beach somewhere. But it also occurs to me that the U.S. Marshals hunt bad guys around the world. Sidney [Bennett] and Havlock [Cooper] represent a problem to Frank, but that doesn’t mean they are his only problem.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tToho has revealed celebrations for the 10th anniversary of “My Hero Academia The Animation,” unveiling plans for a new episode, global concert tour and commemorative visual at Jump Festa.\n\n\tThe milestone anniversary arrives as the anime adaptation of Kohei Horikoshi’s manga reaches a significant chapter in its history. The series, which premiered in April 2016, aired its final episode on Dec. 13 following eight seasons and 170 episodes across a decade-long run.\n\t\n\n\tA brand-new episode titled “More” will premiere May 2, 2026, streaming exclusively on Crunchyroll worldwide outside Asia. The episode adapts content from the manga’s 431st chapter, which appeared exclusively in the final volume, following protagonist Deku and his classmates eight years after their graduation from U.A. High School. The episode expands the narrative beyond the anime’s original conclusion.\n\n\n\tThe series follows Izuku Midoriya, a boy born without superpowers in a world where 80% of the population possesses abilities called Quirks, as he trains at U.A. High School to become a professional hero. The story chronicles Midoriya and his classmates as they develop their abilities and navigate the challenges of hero society.\n\n\t“We are incredibly proud to celebrate ten years of ‘My Hero Academia’ with fans around the world,” a Toho spokesperson said. “This milestone represents not only a decade of unforgettable stories, heroic characters, and epic battles, but also the incredible support and passion of our global audience.”\n\n\tToho also unveiled “My Hero Academia in Concert,” a world tour featuring composer Yuki Hayashi’s music paired with scenes from the anime. The tour launches May 30, 2026, at Pacifico Yokohama before expanding internationally. \n\t\n\n\tAt Jump Festa, Toho debuted the official 10th anniversary logo and teaser visual. The anniversary visual, produced by Bones Films and illustrated by longtime character designer Yoshihiko Umakoshi, showcases 10 versions of Deku across his evolution as a hero. \n\n\tThe anniversary follows a landmark year for the franchise. Horikoshi’s manga, which has sold 100 million copies worldwide, concluded its serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump in August after a decade-long run. The anime adaptation includes four feature films alongside its television run.\n\n\tThe official anniversary celebration begins April 3, 2026, marking exactly 10 years since the anime’s first broadcast. Toho indicated that today’s announcements represent the initial wave of anniversary plans, with additional projects, collaborations and events to be revealed throughout 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix viewers are about to be stirred and possibly even shaken as several James Bond titles are set to come to the streaming giant starting in January. It’s a surprising development considering Amazon MGM owns the James Bond library and the two are streaming competitors. \n\n\tStarting Jan. 15, Netflix subscribers in the U.S., German-speaking countries, France, Latin America and several other territories can watch the most recent Bond movie “No Time to Die” as well as “Die Another Day,” “Quantum of Solace” and “Skyfall” for a three-month period. Other Amazon-owned titles including select “Rocky” and “Creed,” and the “Legally Blonde” films will also stream on Netflix. \n\t\n\n\tAmazon’s original series “Hunters” is already available in the U.S. and several other territories, and “Man in the High Castle” and other series will also stream on Netflix.\n\n\n\tChris Ottinger, Head of Worldwide Distribution at Amazon MGM Studios, said, “When Amazon acquired MGM, Amazon’s plan was to continue licensing MGM’s iconic library to streaming and television partners around the world. Bringing these iconic films and shows to Netflix is part of that continued strategy. James Bond remains one of the most enduring and influential franchises in cinematic history, and alongside other beloved titles in our library like Hunters among other series, this agreement reflects the continued global appetite for premium storytelling and the strong working relationship we’ve built with Netflix.”\n\n\tThe Bond films typically stream on Prime Video for two months each year around Bond Day in October, and also play on MGM+ during the period from October through December. \n\t\n\n\tThe Netflix deal should help keep interest in the franchise alive as viewers wait for the 26th James Bond movie from director Denis Villeneuve. Although the director is already in place, the release date is likely to be several years in the future, possibly in 2028.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBlake Lively‘s lawyers filed a motion for sanctions Friday against attorneys for Justin Baldoni, accusing them of laughing, speechifying and engaging in other disruptive behavior during depositions.\n\n\tHer lawyers have also complained about questions regarding Lively’s romantic and sexual history, which they argue are irrelevant to her harassment and retaliation lawsuit against Baldoni and others involved in “It Ends With Us.” \n\n\n\t“Ms. Lively’s sexual and/or romantic history has no bearing on the matters at issue in this case and we will not tolerate such examination,” her lawyers wrote to Baldoni’s lawyers, including Bryan Freedman, in September.\n\t\n\n\tLively’s side invoked the “rape shield law,” which protects victims of sexual assault from questions about their sexual history.\n\n\tThe last straw apparently came on Monday, when, according to Lively’s side, Freedman and co-counsel Kevin Fritz impeded and delayed the deposition of Nicole Alexander, who is testifying as a defense expert.\n\n\tLively’s side accused Freedman and Fritz of an “ongoing pattern of deposition misconduct,” including chewing up time by making lengthy objections.\n\n\tLively’s lawyers have filed motions for sanctions several times already in the highly contentious case. In one such instance, they accused Freedman of trying the case in the media. In another, they accused Baldoni’s lawyers of improperly withholding evidence during discovery.\n\n\tThe parties have a court-mandated settlement conference scheduled for Feb. 11. The trial, originally set to begin in March, was postponed earlier this month to May 18.\n\t\n\n\tBaldoni’s team has filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that her allegations amount to nothing more than a “litany of minor grievances” and the case should be thrown out. Lively’s side responded that her director and co-star is seeking to avoid accountability for creating a hostile environment on set. \n\n\tJudge Lewis Liman is expected to hear argument on the summary judgment motion and on one of the sanction’s motions on Jan. 22.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for plot points in “The Housemaid,” now in theaters.\n\n\tFor fans of Freida McFadden’s thriller novel “The Housemaid,” watching the Lionsgate adaptation movie was a bit of a different experience — we went in knowing the twist. While most of the largest moments in the book were represented in the movie, not everything weas the same. In fact, one storyline was much smaller in the film than in the book.\n\t\n\n\t“The Housemaid” follows a young woman, Millie (Sydney Sweeney), who has a dark past and is desperate for work; she excitedly accepts the job as a live-in housemaid for a wealthy family, Nina and Andrew Winchester (Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar). Soon, she finds out their seemingly perfect life is far from it.\n\n\n\tThe book is split into two perspectives — first, Millie’s, then Nina’s. From Millie’s POV, Nina is the villain, a mentally unstable, harsh wife and mother while Andrew does everything to keep her happy. From the community, Millie hears that Nina tried to take her own life after leaving her daughter to die in the bathtub. Luckily, doting husband Andrew called the police just in time and Nina was hospitalized. He’s the man who chose to stay with her and take care of her.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandon Sklenar as Andrew Winchester and Amanda Seyfried as Nina Winchester \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel McFadden/Lionsgate\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe second half of the book and movie, Nina’s POV reveals what actually happened: Shortly after marrying Andrew, he began abusing her and locking her in the attic without food, torturing her. He once drugged her and she woke up in the bathroom only to discover her daughter in the bathtub — and the police taking her away. From then on, he continued to punish her and threatened to get her taken away again if she didn’t stay. She decided to hire Millie so that she could escape — she knew he’d cheat — but also because of Millie’s past. Millie spent 10 years in prison for murdering a man who assaulted a friend — so she could take him down.\n\t\n\n\tBelow, Variety breaks down some of the biggest changes from the book and the movie — including that ending.\n\n\tAndrew’s torture of Millie\n\n\tIn both the movie and the book, Millie starts to put together what has happened after Andrew locks her in the attic, beginning to torment her. But in the book, he makes Millie painfully balance three large books on her stomach for hours. He has installed a camera to watch and when she doesn’t do it correctly the first time, he makes her do it again.\n\n\tIn the movie, the scene is more violent. Since she’s been locked in the attic for accidentally breaking antique dishes, he orders her to, using a piece of the plate, slice 21 deep cuts into her stomach.\n\n\tMillie’s torture of Andrew\n\n\tIn the book, Millie then taunts Andrew and gives him a taste of his own medicide, asking him to balance the same three books on his groin, then instructs him to pull out his teeth with pliers.\n\n\tIn the movie, after being let out, Millie uses the knife Nina has hidden inside to slit Andrew’s throat and lock him inside the room. As he bleeds out, she breaks more of his mother’s china in front of the door and instructs him to pull out his front tooth since he’s convinced too many people he’s a good person with this perfect smile.\n\n\tAndrew’s death\n\n\tIn the book, the gardener, Enzo (who knew what happened to Nina, and stayed on the grounds to try and help), convinced Nina to go back to the house to save Millie. When she does, she finds Andrew in the attic, dead of starvation.\n\n\tThe movie gets a bit darker; Nina’s daughter is the one to convince her to go back and help Millie, but when she returns to the attic, she opens the door assuming Millie is locked inside. Instead, Andrew is alive and charges out, trying to attack both Nina and Millie; eventually, he begs Nina to give him another chance, giving her the opportunity to tell him how awful he is. Ultimately, Millie shoves him over their spiral staircase where he falls to his violent death.\n\n\tThe end\n\n\tA policeman questions Nina in the book, revealing that his daughter was once involved with Andrew. In the movie, it’s a policewoman who does the interrogating before sharing that her sister was in a relationship with him. Since they both knew the harm he caused, they believe that his death was an accident. \n\t\n\n\tAt the end of the book Millie teams up with Enzo to form a group to help women in abusive relationships. That doesn’t exist in the movie but the flash forward to one year later is the same: she’s interviewing for a new position at the home of  woman who’s being abused and got her name from Nina. Has she been hired to kill him? Possibly. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichele Morrone as Enzo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel McFadden/Lionsgate\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEnzo’s patricipation\n\n\tOverall, it’s important to note that in the book, the family groundskeeper Enzo is a much larger part of the story, trying to help Nina escape multiple times and eventually, helping her come up with the plan to hire a new woman to draw Andrew’s attention away. Millie once makes a move on him, knowing that it’d be smarter than going after Andrew, a married man. He turns her down.\n\n\tAfter she did escape, Nina and Enzo spends a night together. Eventually, he tells her it’s not right to leave Millie in danger with Andrew. Later, he calls to alert her the attic light on is on and Millie hasn’t been seen in days, encouraging Nina to come check on her. She agrees to do so as long as he’ll protect her daughter; he does just that.\n\n\tIn the movie, the character, portrayed by Michele Morrone, was barely part of the story. It’s made clear, eventually, that he did help Nina try to escape but he’s more of a background character than a key part of the film.\n\n\tIf more movies come out, and they stay close to the story told in the books, Enzo will be back — and not in a small way.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlexander Ludwig and AJ Michalka have been cast in Season 4 of “The White Lotus.”\n\n\tThis makes them the first new additions to the series, which brings in a new lineup of stars — often including several A-listers — with each season. So far, only three cast members have appeared in more than one season: Jennifer Coolidge, who played Tanya McQuoid in Seasons 1 and 2; Natasha Rothwell, who played Belinda Lindsey in Seasons 1 and 3; and Jon Gries, who has played Greg Hunt in all three seasons.\n\t\n\n\tSeason 4 of “The White Lotus” will take place in France, though no plot details are known yet besides that, like previous seasons, it will follow “a new group of White Lotus hotel guests and employees over the span of a week,” according to an official description. Series creator Mike White has also teased a more urban setting: “I want to get a little bit out of the ‘crashing waves against rocks’ vernacular,” he said in a video HBO released after the Season 3 finale. \n\n\n\tDetails regarding Michalka and Ludwig’s characters are not yet known.\n\n\tMichalka is best known as one-half of the pop-rock duo Aly & AJ alongside her sister Aly Michalka. The group rose to prominence after signing with Disney-owned Hollywood Records, with several of their songs appearing in Disney Channel projects and both sisters appearing in the Disney Channel movie “Cow Belles.” Her acting credits have also included the films “The Lovely Bones” and “Super 8.” On TV, she had a recurring role on ABC’s “The Goldbergs” and led the spinoff “Schooled” in addition to voice roles on “She-Ra and the Princesses of Power” and “Steven Universe.” Michalka is repped by United talent Agency, Amplified and Mckuin, Frankel, Whitehead. \n\t\n\n\tLudwig’s prominent roles include Björn Ironside in “Vikings” on the History Channel, Isherwood in “Earth Abides” on MGM+, Dorn in the two most recent “Bad Boys” films” and Cato in “The Hunger Games.” He is repped by Untitled Entertainment, Gersh and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. \n\n\t“The White Lotus” is executive produced by White, David Bernad and Mark Kamine. \n",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tDirector James Cameron is back with biggest and longest “Avatar” movie yet, “Fire and Ash.” Taking place shortly after the events of 2022’s “The Way of Water,” “Fire and Ash” ups the stakes even further, bring massive battles between the Na’vi and humans, and introduces the series’ scariest villain yet.\n\n\tJust like “The Way of Water” introduced the aquatic Metkayina clan, who became allies with Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his family, “Fire and Ash” debuts the evil Mangkwan tribe, led by the mystical Varang (Oona Chaplin). The Mangkwan live in a dormant volcano and raid the other Na’vi groups on Pandora, which is how they first run afoul of the Sullys. \n\n\tSoon, the Mangkwan ally themselves with Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who still has a bone to pick with Jake, and trade in their spears and arrows for guns and flamethrowers. Varang grows close with Quaritch and joins her fiery Mangkwan forces with the human RDA army, who captures Jake. \n\n\tAfter escaping, Jake bands together the Na’vi forces to battle the Mangkwan and RDA, but the bad guys are nearly too powerful and kill many of the Sullys’ allies. In the nick of time, the whale-like Tulkun aid the heroes, and Jake’s adopted daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) connects with the spiritual deity Eywa and rallies the animals of Pandora to their cause. Jake’s family saves the day and defeats Quaritch, Varang and the RDA…for now.\n\n\tCameron has long spoken about his plans to make “Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5,” which have release dates set for 2029 and 2031, respectively. The director has said he’s already shot some footage for a fourth movie, but Disney greenlighting it will depend on how well “Fire and Ash” is received. The two previous “Avatar” movies each grossed more than $2 billion at the worldwide box office, so expectations for “Fire and Ash” are high. \n\n\tJust like “The Way of Water” and “Fire and Ash,” the next sequels would jump ahead in time to account for the young actors’ aging, Cameron has revealed. “Fire and Ash” also briefly introduces a new, airborne group of Na’vi called the Wind Traders, who would play a role in the fourth and fifth movies. They’re led by Peylak (played by “Harry Potter” alum David Thewlis), who shelters the Sully family before they’re attacked by the Mangkwan raiders.\n\n\tSee who else may reappear in future “Avatar” sequels, and who fans said goodbye to in “Fire and Ash” below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tQuaritch: Dead or Alive?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tQuaritch and Jake Sully are forced to partner up but also face off multiple times in “Fire and Ash.” In the climactic battle, the two fight in the midst of a gravity well that sends rocks hurtling through the air. The two briefly put aside their differences and save Spider, Quaritch’s human son raised by Jake, who nearly falls to his death. Just when it seems like Quaritch and Jake have made amends, Neytiri joins them with her bow pointed at Quaritch, and he throws himself to the fires below. We don’t see Quaritch fall to his death, only disappear into the plumes of smoke. So, it’s possible that he survives and could reappear in “Avatar 4,” but would he ally himself with Varang once again or finally switch sides and be Team Sully?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tVarang: Missing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tVarang, the newest villain in the “Avatar” franchise, goes missing after she leads her fiery Mangkwan forces along with the RDA against the Sully family and their own army. She flees the battle after Kiri connects with the mystical Eywa and summons more animal allies to turn the tide of the fight. Currently missing, Varang is too compelling of an antagonist to not bring back for “Avatar 4.” There are also fan theories that she and Quaritch could reunite, or possibly start their own family to take on the Sullys in a sequel.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRonal: Dead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tKate Winslet’s Metkayina mother dies during the final battle against the Mangkwan and RDA. However, she’s able to give birth in her final moments with the help of Neytiri, who promises to raise the newborn girl as one of her own. If there is an “Avatar 4,” surely the Sully family’s latest addition would have to factor into the plot, with Neytiri, Jake and their children raising a young kid in the dangerous world of Pandora.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRotxo: Dead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRotxo is one of the divers of the Metkayina and a friend of the Sully children and Ronal’s son, Ao’nung. He dies during the final battle against the Mangkwan and RDA.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tScoresby: Dead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCaptain Mick Scoresby returns after his debut in “The Way of Water,” this time rocking a robotic arm after losing the limb in the last movie. The deep-sea fisherman hunts the Tulkun and harvests the valuable substance Amrita found inside of them, which can stop humans from aging. However, Scoresby meets his match in “Fire and Ash” and is swallowed by a Tulkun out of revenge during the final battle.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Recording Academy has announced its Special Merits Awards for 2026, observing the Lifetime Achievement Award, Trustee Award and Technical Grammy Award recipients: Carlos Santana, Chaka Khan, Cher, Fela Kuti, Paul Simon, and Whitney Houston are the Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award honorees; Bernie Taupin, Eddie Palmieri and Sylvia Rhone are the Trustees Award honorees; and John Chowning is the Technical Grammy Award honoree. The ceremony will be held on will be held on Jan. 31, 2026, at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a true honor to recognize this year’s Special Merit Award recipients — an extraordinary group whose influence spans generations, genres and the very foundation of modern music,” said Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy. “Each of these honorees has made a profound and lasting impact, and we look forward to celebrating their remarkable achievements on the eve of Grammy Sunday.”\n\n\n\t+ The Songwriters Hall of Fame has announced the posthumous induction of Jerry Ragovoy, a prolific songwriter and producer whose hits include “Time Is on My Side,” “Piece of My Heart,” “Try (Just a Little Bit Harder),” “Cry Baby,” “Get It While You Can,” “Ain’t Nobody Home,” “A Wonderful Dream,” “Stay with Me,” and many more; several of those hits were written under the pseudonym Norman Meade.\n\n\tRagovoy, who passed away in 2011 at age 80, was honored during an intimate ceremony last week in New York.\n\n\t+ Pioneering independent music company Beggars Group secured a majority stake in XL Recordings in 2024, according to newly released documents reported by Music Business Worldwide.\n\t\n\n\tBeggars had long held a 50% stake in XL, but its most recent annual earnings filing with the UK’s Companies House confirms that it paid a $3.3 million consideration to XL Recordings’ “other shareholder” in October 2024 to acquire a majority stake — who would be XL co-owner Richard Russell. Following the transaction, Beggars Group’s ownership share of XL Recordings rose to 51%. XL, known for releasing Adele’s first three albums as well as major hits by the Prodigy, Fontaines D.C, and others, is now listed as a subsidiary of Beggars rather than a joint venture.\n\n\t+ Island Records has promoted Caroline Ellis to Vice President, A&R. Based in Los Angeles, she will report to Jackie Winkler, Senior Vice President, Head of A&R, Island Records.\n\n\tEllis will continue to handle A&R for artists across the label, including Chappell Roan and Suki Waterhouse. Ellis recently signed the Platinum-certified and acclaimed actress, Waterhouse, who is currently in the studio working on new music.\n\n\t“Caroline has impeccable taste and a rare ability to connect with artists, building the kind of trust that fuels great music,” said Winkler.  “Her exceptional ear and steady temperament are true assets to the team, and I’m thrilled to see her step into this richly deserved role as VP of A&R.”\n\n\tEllis joined Island Records in 2020 as Senior Director, A&R after a stint at Interscope Records, where she worked with the 1975, Japanese House, Jack Garratt and Pale Waves.\n\n\t+ BMG has renewed and expanded its direct music publishing agreement with TikTok. According to the announcement, the new agreement strengthens BMG’s leadership in modernizing publishing deals by raising reporting and attribution standards across digital platforms and introducing improvements to how publishing rights are managed and promoted.\n\n\tTracy Gardner, Global Head of Music Business Development, TikTok, said, “BMG truly understands the power of TikTok and the opportunity it creates for songwriters today. They understand the platform, they embrace innovation, and they work with us hand-in-hand to strengthen rights management and unlock meaningful value. This expanded partnership reflects the trust and momentum we’ve built together — and we’re excited to continue driving growth for the songwriters at the heart of music discovery on TikTok.”\n\t\n\n\tCeline Joshua, EVP, Global Marketing and Streaming, said, “This agreement underscores our focus on building scalable, forward-looking partnerships that elevate the role of songwriting in today’s music economy. We continue to invest in systems and structures that protect rights, ensure attribution, and add value for creators across the digital landscape.”\n\n\t+ Universal Music Group and Splice have agreed to collaborate on joint exploration of the next generation of AI-powered music creation tools for musical artists. The agreement builds on Splice’s suite of AI-enabled creator tools and will also explore AI-powered virtual instruments and tools that enable UMG artists to bring their own sounds into Splice’s AI workflows.\n\n\tMichael Nash, EVP & Chief Digital Officer, Universal Music Group said, “We’re excited to form this alliance with Splice to promote the alignment of innovation and ethicality in addressing the interests of the creative community to leverage cutting-edge AI-enabled tools to further their artistic expression. We look forward to partnering with Kakul Srivastava and her team on this critically important strategic technology front.”\n\n\t“We’ve spent time building AI tools designed to fairly compensate creators and keep them in control,” said Kakul Srivastava, CEO of Splice. “We’re thankful for Universal’s continued support, and excited to work together to put these commercial tools in the hands of artists everywhere, knowing they can trust the end result.”\n\n\tMonday, December 15\n\n\tHYBE has announced a significant expansion into the rapidly growing African music market through a new global management partnership with two influential voices shaping African and diaspora music: Brandon Hixon and Colin Gayle.\n\n\tTogether, they are launching a global management initiative designed to amplify African artists, develop cross-cultural storytelling, and build long-term creative pathways across the U.S., Asia, and the world, according to the announcement. Under this partnership, HYBE will establish a pipeline of emerging and established talent and sign new artists. Tyla — honored at Variety‘s Young Hollywood event last summer — will be the first artist supported under this expanded vision. She will continue to be guided by Hixon and Gayle, with HYBE providing additional global reach.\n\t\n\n\t“We are thrilled to partner with cultural architects like Brandon Hixon and Colin Gayle, whose vision is essential to driving the powerful momentum of African artistry onto the global stage,” said Jason Jaesang Lee, CEO of HYBE. “This partnership represents a pivotal moment in HYBE’s global expansion strategy. By combining their expertise with our global network and resources, we will establish a strategic, sustainable bridge designed to amplify authentic African voices and artistry to fans across the world.”\n\n\tHixon said, “Our work has always been about connecting great artists with the world in the right way. HYBE brings a global perspective that complements how Colin and I build. Together, we can help artists move freely and tell their stories on the biggest stages.”\n\n\tGayle added, “We’re entering a moment where African artists have unlimited potential. With HYBE’s collaborative support, we can help them expand their reach while staying true to the roots that make this music extraordinary.”\n\n\t+ The ASCAP Foundation, the charitable organization dedicated to supporting American music creators, today announced that Patricia Leonard has been appointed to serve as executive director. She succeeds Nicole George-Middleton, who was recently promoted to executive vice president, head of creative membership at ASCAP.\n\n\t“For 50 years, The ASCAP Foundation has succeeded by providing recognition and support so that developing music creators of all kinds can flourish,” said The ASCAP Foundation President Paul Williams. “We are elated to have Patricia Leonard take over the Executive Director role and confident that her love of music and her deep background in the arts and philanthropy will enable the Foundation to continue to thrive for years to come.”\n\n\tLeonard joins the ASCAP Foundation with more than two decades of experience in arts and philanthropy. She was formerly chief philanthropy officer with the Princess Grace Foundation, where she led the planning and execution of charitable events and sponsorship opportunities and created new programs such as the Crown Patrons Society for high-value donors. Prior to that, she served as the director of institutional giving for the Manhattan Theatre Club and as director of institutional relations for the Metropolitan Opera. She serves on the boards of the New York New Music Ensemble and New York Women Composers, is a founding member of the New York Composers Circle, and is the composer of “My Dearest Friend,” an opera inspired by the letters of John and Abigail Adams.\n\t\n\n\tFounded in 1975, the ASCAP Foundation has supported American music creators through music education, talent development and humanitarian programs. In 2024 alone, its programs reached more than 300,000 individuals, including 60,000 K–12 students, through scholarships, mentorship initiatives and educational programs.\n\n\t+ Nick Hartley, [PIAS]’ longtime chief operating officer and chief financial officer, has announced his retirement and will step down from both roles and his position on the company’s board, effective December 31st, 2025.\n\n\tHartley started his career as a chartered accountant before moving from the UK to Australia in 1984 to take up his first music industry role with EMI Australia, where he quickly rose to become finance director. He then moved to PolyGram Australia in 1990 as CFO and was promoted to the role of PolyGram U.K. Group CFO in late 1995 after returning to the UK. He left PolyGram in late 1998 after its acquisition by Universal and joined [PIAS] in January 2000. Under his guidance, the company has expanded its global operations, enhanced financial performance, and continued to foster successful partnerships with artists and labels. He also played an important role in the acquisition of [PIAS] by Universal in 2024.\n",

In 2019, he was arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. While awaiting trial in New York City, he killed himself in his cell.\n      \n    \n          Donald Trump, Clinton and Bill Gates are among many high-profile politicians, entertainers, business titans, academics and other powerful international figures known to have been close associates of Epstein. Trump downplayed the importance of releasing the files this year -- despite making campaign promises to open up the investigation -- even saying he didn't want support from anyone who was demanding more about the case.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

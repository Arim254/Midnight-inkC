    "body": "\n\tGlobal colossus Fremantle has added to its vast entertainment portfolio, securing worldwide production, development and distribution rights outside Japan to “Special Delivery,” a whacky fun comedy game show co-developed by Amsterdam’s Blue Circle, a Fremantle company, and Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), the top Japanese producer and broadcaster.\n\n\tFremantle will bring “Special Delivery” to market at this week’s London TV Screenings, the biggest European TV sales platform of the first six months of the year, where the RTL-owned Super Indie hold a Feb. 27 upfront.\n\t\n\n\tBilled by Fremantle as an “irresistibly fun comedy competition,” “Special Delivery” plays to Japan’s strength as an format export power, Variety noted Monday: “high-concept entertainment formats built around simple game mechanics.” \n\n\n\tHere, comedians are sent on hilarious missions to try to deliver anything, anywhere, anyhow. The parcels they collect at Delivery HQ are “absurd,” the destinations “impossible” and the conditions “ridiculous.” The net result is “unpredictable deliveries that create maximum mischief, laugh-out-moments and instantly visual, viral-ready comedy,” Fremantle noted Tuesday, announcing its deal on “Special Delivery.”\n\n\tCommissioned for TBS in Japan, “Special Delivery” bowed this January in Japan, where its debut episode ranked No. 1 in its time slot, scoring a 28% audience share. \n\n\tPlayed by celebrities in Japan, the format can be adapted to different casting approaches worldwide, Fremantle noted.\n\t\n\n\t“As a broadcaster known for bold, inventive comedy, TBS has been an exceptional creative partner, and together we’ve shaped a format that harnesses the originality of Japanese entertainment into something with clear global potential,” said Vasha Wallace, Fremantle EVP global acquisitions and development, global entertainment. “There is a strong appetite worldwide for big, visual, laugh-out-loud comedy, and ‘Special Delivery’ has all the ingredients to travel and connect with audiences beyond Japan,” she added. \n\n\t“We’re delighted to partner with Fremantle on ‘Special Delivery,’ and proud of what the teams have created together in Japan. The format’s bold physical comedy and playful competition feel universally entertaining, and we’re excited to see the format reach audiences internationally,” observed Kentaro Fukuda, head of global IP studio at TBS.\n\n\tBlue Circle is a 100% Fremantle subsidiary which is one of the biggest and most prolific Netherlands specialists in entertainment, daily show, sports and lifestyle programming, behind Dutch reversions of “Dancing With the Stars,” “Idols” and “X-Factor.”\n\n\tTBS ranks as one of Japan’s biggest media conglomerates, with a bevy of international format breakouts, such as game show “Takeshi’s Castle,” sports entertainment reality format “Ninja Warrior,” sold to 160 territories, and variety show “Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan,” which spawned “America’s Funniest Home Videos.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart covered the Right’s enthusiastic response to the United States’ hockey victory over Canada at the Olympics and poked fun at FBI Director Kash Patel for joining Team USA in the locker room for the celebration.\n\n\tAt the top of Monday’s show, Stewart painted a dismal picture of what America was like before Team USA’s 2-1 gold medal win.\n\n\n\t“This country is in such emotional turmoil right now,” Stewart said. “A feeling that we are one nation divided, under siege. That perhaps we have crossed a Rubicon of this great American experiment, and that we, slowly and inexorably, are sliding into the abyss of fallen and broken democracies. But then!”\n\t\n\n\tThe show then cut to a clip of Jack Hughes scoring the game-winning goal for Team USA.\n\n\t“We’re back, motherfucker!” Stewart exclaimed. “I know the powerful elites remain unaccountable, but he put the thing behind that other guy! This country was sinking into a cesspool we couldn’t recover from, but he put the vulcanized rubber disc behind the lord of the net! It was so unifying! There is nothing that can take away from the joyous moment as all Americans celebrate this incredible — wait, what the fuck?”\n\n\tThe late-night host cut his celebration short upon seeing that Patel celebrated with Team USA in their locker room.\n\n\t“Is that FBI director Kash Patel?” Stewart added. “Are they putting a medal on FBI director Kash Patel? Is Kash Patel a Make-a-Wish man?”\n\n\tStewart then turned his attention to the Right’s reaction to the win. The show cut to a clip of conservative commentator Benny Johnson saying that the triumph represented “masculinity and celebration,” two things that have been “completely and totally sanitized from our arch feminist culture, our estrogenetic culture.”\n\t\n\n\t“First of all, what a super weird year hockey is having. Like, in four months, to go from, ‘Nobody gives a shit about hockey,’ to, ‘Well, I like to watch them fuck,’ to, ‘Only hockey can save us from a dystopian, estrogenetic future.’” Stewart joked, referencing HBO’s hit queer hockey series “Heated Rivalry.” “Perhaps the strangest part is how this victory in a hockey match is being perceived on the right geopolitically.”\n\n\tStewart then cut to clips from Fox News, in which contributors said that Canadians are “basically communists” and that “hockey is all that they had, and we took that away.”\n\n\t“What is with this sore winning?” Stewart joked. “And by the way, don’t we have enough real enemies? Now we got to pretend like Canada’s way of life is incongruous to the west? ‘Yeah! fuck those completely best neighbors our nation has ever had!’”\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Happy Endings” and “The Mindy Project” star Adam Pally has been cast as the lead in “The Sanctuary,” an upcoming comedy series from New Zealand’s Kevin & Co. and Sky.\n\n\tIn “The Sanctuary,” Pally will star as “an eccentric American billionaire hiding from the law in New Zealand who is forced to convert his lavish private island into a Department of Conservation sanctuary to avoid extradition.” \n\n\n\tJoseph Moore and Laura Daniel created the eight-episode series, which has been picked up to air in New Zealand on Sky’s Three network, as well as on the streamer ThreeNow. There’s no word yet on distribution in the U.S. (L.A.-based producers Happy Accidents and Warner Bros. Discovery’s New Zealand division, which had previously been reported as producers on the project, are no longer involved.)\n\t\n\n\tBesides “Happy Endings” and “The Mindy Project,” Pally also starred on series including “Making History” and “Indebted,” and also was an executive producer on Comedy Central’s “The President Show.”\n\n\n\tPally also launched his latest comedy special, “An Intimate Evening With Adam Pally,” last October on HBO. He starred opposite Stephen Curry and Ego Nwodim in the Peacock comedy series “Mr. Throwback,” which he also executive produced, and appeared in Netflix’s “FUBAR.”\n\n\tIn unscripted, he and Jon Gabrus starred in the travel‑comedy series “101 Places to Party Before You Die.” The collaborators also co‑host the SmartLess Media podcast “Staying Alive with Jon Gabrus and Adam Pally.”\n\n\tPally’s film credits include Paramount’s “Sonic the Hedgehog” franchise (and the Paramount+ spin‑off series “Knuckles”), as well as  “Who Invited Charlie?,” Netflix/WWE Studios’ “The Main Event,” “Most Likely to Murder,” “Dog Days,” “Band Aid,” “Iron Man 3,” “Dirty Grandpa” and “The Little Hours.”\n\t\n\n\tUpcoming projects include Sam Mendes’ “The Beatles — A Four‑Film Cinematic Event,” where he’ll play controversial Beatles manager Allen Klein. He’ll also be in Madeline Sackler’s sci‑fi dramedy “O Horizon,” as well as Melissa Miller’s “Run” and Steve Pink’s “What the Fck Is My Password.”\n\n\tKevin & Co.’s credits include “Taskmaster NZ.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance leaders spent a busy week in negotiations, and now the WBD board is likely to tell shareholders before the market opens on Tuesday that it is taking the bid under review while still recommending the Netflix transaction that is up for a vote on March 20.\n\n\tRepresentatives for WBD and Paramount Skydance declined to comment late Monday. The financial terms of the new offer were not immediately clear. \n\t\n\n\tMonday wrapped a busy seven-day period in which the WBD board sought Netflix’s blessing to engage in discussions with Paramount to “seek clarity” on its “best and final offer.” WBD asked Paramount Skydance “to clarify your proposal, which we understand will include a WBD per share price higher than $31” in a letter from Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav and board chairman Samuel Di Piazza Jr. to Paramount’s board.\n\n\n\tIf WBD is formally considering the Paramount Skydance offer, the next move in this chess game will come from Netflix: The streamer has four days to match Paramount’s new offer, or it could bail out of the bidding process. A source close to the situation noted that WBD is legally bound to recommend its signed agreement with Netflix, valued at nearly $83 billion. Paramount has fielded a $108 billion offer for the entirety of WBD, including its cable channels. Netflix is buying Warner Bros. and HBO Max.\n\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, in a Feb. 20 interview with Variety, declined to say how the streamer would respond to a higher offer from Paramount. But he did say that Netflix has a “rich history” of being “willing to walk away and let someone else overpay for things.”\n\t\n\n\tUnder Netflix’s agreement with WBD, the streamer would buy Warner Bros.’s studios and streaming businesses for $27.75 per share (in all cash, a change Netflix made last month from its previous cash-and-stock offer). WBD shareholders would retain equity in Discovery Global, the company’s proposed spin-off entity housing CNN, TBS and other linear networks as well as Discovery+.\n\n\tEllison first approached WBD CEO Zaslav in September 2025, initially offering $19/share for Warner Bros. Discovery. That came just weeks after Ellison’s Skydance Media closed its acquisition of Paramount Global. Paramount’s interest in WBD prompted the board to initiate a formal M&A review process — and the board picked Netflix as the winning bidder. WBD’s board has previously rejected Paramount’s takeover offers nine times.\n\n\tParamount’s takeover offer is backed by Larry Ellison (David’s tech-billionaire father) and RedBird Capital Partners. The company has secured debt financing from Bank of America, Citigroup and Apollo Global Management. Paramount’s bid also includes capital from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.\n",

    "body": "\n\tZDF Studios has taken international distribution rights to Season 4 of premium factual series “Ancient Superstructures,” a new run that will prominently feature Barcelona’s Sagrada Familia as it heads toward a milestone moment this June.\n\n\tProduced by Pernel Media in association with RMC Découverte, Histoire, SBS and ZDF Studios, the new season is currently in production and slated for completion this spring. \n\n\n\tZDF Studios has secured rights across worldwide markets excluding French-speaking territories and Australia.\n\t\n\n\t“Ancient Superstructures” has carved out a distinctive niche in the landmarks-and-history space by pairing high-end CGI with scientific investigation, using a multi-scale approach — from satellite imagery to microscopic analysis — to decode the engineering behind some of the world’s most iconic monuments.\n\n\tSeason 4’s itinerary spans multiple territories and eras, with episodes dedicated to Greece’s Acropolis of Athens, Germany’s Neuschwanstein Castle, and France’s Pierrefonds Castle and the medieval city of Carcassonne.\n\n\tThe marquee installment, however, centers on the Sagrada Familia, where the production has been granted exclusive access to film the placing of the final stone on the basilica’s main structure — positioned by the producers as a historic TV moment.\n\n\tThe June milestone coincides with the centenary of architect Antoni Gaudí’s death and the official inauguration of the Tower of Jesus Christ. \n\n\tTopping out at 172.5 meters (565.9 feet), the basilica is set to become the tallest church in the world. While the main structure and its 18 towers are scheduled for completion in 2026, additional decorative work on the Glory Façade is expected to continue through 2034, giving the season a time-stamped, front-row view of one of Europe’s most ambitious long-term builds.\n\t\n\n\t“This franchise has consistently set the gold standard for factual programming by blending high-end CGI with rigorous scientific investigation,” said Nikolas Huelbusch, director of unscripted at ZDF Studios. “Being able to capture the historic completion of the Sagrada Família — a project 144 years in the making — is a testament to the series’ relevance,” he added.\n\n\t“Our mission has always been to reveal the ‘invisible’ secrets of these marvels through cutting-edge technology. With Season 4, we are taking this to a new level,” said Pernel Media executive producer Fabrice Frank.\n\n\tPernel Media founder and CEO Samuel Kissous added: “This franchise reflects exactly the kind of premium, internationally resonant programming Pernel is committed to producing.”\n\n\tThe deal underscores ZDF Studios’ role as a global distributor and co-production partner within the commercial arm of German public broadcaster ZDF, while France- and U.K.-based Pernel Media continues to scale an international slate spanning premium factual alongside a growing English-language scripted pipeline.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRobert Carradine, an American actor best known for his roles in the 1984 comedy film “Revenge of the Nerds” and the 2001 Disney Channel original series “Lizzie McGuire,” has died. He was 71.\n\n\tHilary Duff, who played Carradine’s titular on-screen daughter in “Lizzie McGuire,” shared news of the actor’s death in an Instagram tribute on Monday night.\n\n\t“This one hurts,” she wrote. “It’s really hard to face this reality about an old friend. There was so much warmth in the McGuire family and I always felt so cared for by my on-screen parents. I’ll be forever grateful for that. I’m deeply sad to learn Bobby was suffering. My heart aches for him , his family and everyone who loved him.”\n\t\n\n\tJake Thomas, who played Carradine’s son Matt McGuire on the Disney sitcom, also shared a tribute on Instagram. \n\n\t“My heart hurts today,” Thomas wrote. “I was fortunate to know Bobby for most of my life. And he was one of the coolest guys you could ever meet. Funny, pragmatic, sometimes cranky, always a little eccentric. He was a talented actor, musician and director. But more than anything, he was family. I have many fond memories of being with him and his family throughout my life. Good moments, challenging moments and lots of laughs in between.”\n\n\tHe continued, “I looked up to him growing up. And later, I came to realize he thought I was pretty neat, too. So I guess I was doing something right.” \n\n\tCarradine starred alongside Anthony Edwards in Jeff Kanew’s 1984 cult classic “Revenge of the Nerds.” In “Lizzie McGuire,” he played the McGuire family patriarch, Sam. His other notable film credits include “Escape from L.A.,” “The Big Red One,” “Body Bags,” “The Long Riders” and “Django Unchained.”\n\t\n\n\tCarradine was born in 1954 to a family of entertainers. His father was actor John Carradine. Two of his brothers, David and Keith Carradine, were actors and filmmakers, while his third sibling, Christopher Carradine, was a Disney Imagineer. His breakout film was the 1972 western “The Cowboys,” in which he appeared alongside John Wayne. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat’s old is new again.\n\n\tOne of the headliners on Banijay Entertainment’s formats slate at London TV Screenings this week is a rebooted returning show, “Fear Factor: House of Fear,” Lucas Green, Banijay Entertainment’s chief content officer, operations, tells Variety.\n\n\tGreen says that it “really hit the sweet spot of what audiences and clients want,” adding “What they’ve done with ‘Fear Factor’ is a very simple twist, which is they’ve turned it into an arced reality.”\n\t\n\n\t“By turning it into an arced show with a reality cast who are in it together, and rather than just doing one off, very terrifying challenges, it’s got a bigger reality storyline as well, which links them all together. And I think it’s no coincidence that it’s done amazingly well on streaming.”\n\n\n\tThe show, hosted by Johnny Knoxville, is Hulu’s number one streamed show, he says, and between Fox and Hulu the new season, after the fifth episode, has seen 1.5 billion minutes streamed already.\n\n\t“It totally justifies this idea of turning it into an arced reality show that you want to come back and see what happens to the ‘Fear Factor’ contestants. They’re living in a scary cabin in the wood, and as well as trying to overcome their fears, they’re trying to overcome each other and have an ultimate winner.”\n\n\tBanijay is already in talks for the show to return and for European territories to make local versions.\n\n\t“It’s not just been a case of bringing back an old title, but it’s a really neat response to the types of shows and the structure of how people are consuming their shows.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s taken what was previously a close ended show and turned it into an arc reality.”\n\n\tOther hot returning shows include “The Summit” and “Shaolin Heroes,” which both launched in the last two to three years, and are now gaining traction. “The Summit” has local versions in seven territories and “Shaolin Heroes” in six. He ascribes the success of these to a certain extent to producers “being able to learn from the lessons of other territories.”\n\n\t“I think combining all of that editorial expertise to not just be the format police who tell you how you have to make the show, we really do provide opportunities to allow you to take these big, new IPs and work with them creatively and adapt them to local needs and budgets and cultures.”\n\n\tOne thing these shows have in common, he says, is that they are stripped reality so they are very bingeable. “They are all the types of shows that you would watch two or three episodes back-to-back. They work very well on streaming.”\n\n\tOne aspect that is relatively new is the introduction of content creators to the mix. For example, they have been included in the cast of Banijay’s “The Fifty.”\n\n\t“[These shows] are very well suited to content creators who can bring pre-existing followers and audiences. They’re a kind of a new breed of VIP. And I think that in the past, the word ‘influencer’ got a bad name, but actually a lot of these content creators know their audience really, really well, and they have got very passionate, dedicated followings.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNewly formed Australian independent production banner Filmbarr is making its formal debut at SXSW 2026 with two films in the festival’s lineup, anchored by the world premiere of psychological thriller “And Her Body Was Never Found,” while simultaneously unveiling a four-title slate that spans elevated horror, true crime and prestige drama.\n\n\tFounded by Tristan Barr (“Subject,” “Head Count”), longtime collaborator Josh Doke – one of the forces behind breakout indie hit “Skinamarink” – and producing partner Erin Crittenden (“The Grand Tour,” “Seven Snipers”), Filmbarr is positioning itself as a home for formally inventive, filmmaker-driven genre cinema built to travel internationally. The company’s mandate centers on pairing bold directors with recognizable international casts, bridging festival and commercial audiences at disciplined budget levels.\n\t\n\n\t“And Her Body Was Never Found,” which lands in SXSW’s Visions section for risk-taking artists, is perhaps the most literal embodiment of that philosophy. Inspired by the self-contained filmmaking ethos of Robert Rodriguez, Banks and Cohen wrote, directed, and starred in the film – essentially functioning as their own crew – shooting across Washington State’s national parks while hauling their own gear and operating out of a rental van. The script was assembled from real arguments between the couple, reframed as a cinematic metaphor for being trapped in a communicative spiral, as their characters’ attempts to reconnect devolve into murder. The pair generated the film’s entire budget through clinical trial participation and credit cards.\n\t\n\n\tAlso premiering at SXSW is “Dead Eyes,” a visceral horror feature from director Richard Williams shot entirely in a specialist-designed first-person POV format. The film stars Mischa Heyward (“Bring Her Back”), Ana Thu Nguyen (“Mortal Kombat”), Stephen Phillips (“Bring Her Back”), Alea O’Shea (“Sissy”) and Charles Cottier (“Demon Disorder”).\n\n\tBeyond SXSW, Filmbarr has two additional titles in the pipeline. Australian fantasy-horror “Deathkeeper” will world premiere at FrightFest in March. Based on a novel, the elevated genre film follows an angel cursed to age decades each time he saves a life, and features an ensemble cast including Shuang Hu (“Five Blind Dates”), Peter Thurnwald (“XO, Kitty”), Isabella Procida (“Rock Island Mysteries”), Charles Cottier (“Seven Snipers”), George Pullar (“Evil Dead Burn”) and Matt Caffoe (“Dunny Derby”). Collectively the cast commands more than 18 million social media followers, reflecting Filmbarr’s strategy of aligning traditional genre storytelling with strong digital reach.\n\n\tRounding out the slate is “Cut Sick,” a psychological crime drama directed by Amanda Kaye exploring the story of one of Australia’s most notorious female murderers. The project previously participated in the Biennale College Cinema at the Venice Film Festival and is moving into production later this year, signaling Filmbarr’s expansion into prestige-leaning true crime with strong international festival potential. Action feature “Seven Snipers,” starring Tim Roth, Radha Mitchell, Ioan Gruffudd and Ryan Kwanten, is also among the company’s upcoming releases.\n\n\t“The independent market has tightened significantly, particularly around pre-sales,” said Barr. “To compete in a landscape dominated by IP and in-house streamer production, the model must evolve. Audiences will always look for singular authentic voices and distinct cinematic experiences. We’re building Filmbarr around projects that can cut through on originality.”\n\n\tCrittenden added: “Budgets are contracting, but the tools available to filmmakers have never been more powerful. Technology is enabling ambitious storytelling at a fraction of traditional costs. The opportunity now lies in backing filmmakers with bold perspectives and giving them the creative latitude to deliver something the market hasn’t seen before.”\n\t\n\n\tBanks said of “And Her Body Was Never Found”: “We really put everything we had into this movie, not only our finances, but our experiences, our secrets, our fears. Both of us have dreamed of making movies our entire lives, though, so what could be more worth the risk?”\n\n\tCohen added: “We studied the dysfunction in our communication inside and out, and learned to accept and rely on each other in ways we never thought possible.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Team USA ended the Milan Cortina Olympics with 12 gold medals — the best performance ever at a Winter Games — NBCUniversal is also touting a shiny performance for its coverage of the 17-day event. According to the company, this repped the most-watched Winter Olympics in the U.S. since 2014.\n\n\tThis year’s Winter Games coverage (which spanned 3,200 hours and 116 events) averaged 23.5 million viewers via NBC, Peacock, NBCUniversal’s digital platforms and Versant’s USA Network and CNBC. That includes the “Milan Prime” afternoon window (2 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET) and the U.S. primetime (8 p.m. to 11 p.m.) time periods. According to NBCU, it’s the best Winter Games performance since the Sochi Games in 2014, and was up 96% from the Beijing Winter Games in 2022 (12 million).\n\t\n\n\tAccording to NBCU, all full 15 competition days (Feb. 7 to Feb. 21) averaged over 20 million viewers. Also, “Milan Prime” (live in daytime) and “Primetime in Milan” averaged 3.3 million viewers daily streaming across Peacock and NBCU digital.\n\n\n\tAmong big events, the USA women’s hockey team’s victory over Canada on Thursday was the most-watched women’s hockey game ever (5.3 million viewers on USA Network and Peacock).\n\n\tAmong local markets, Milwaukee was tops — with a 13.7 rating/49 share, followed by Minneapolis (13.5/53) and Fort Myers, Fla. (13.1/42). In social, NBCU said its Milan Cortina Olympics content registered 4.28 billion impressions across NBC Sports social channels up 437% increase vs. the Beijing Olympics in 2022 and 231% above the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.\n\n\t“These Olympics captured everyone’s imagination in ways no one could have predicted,” said Molly Solomon, the executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “The settings were stunningly beautiful, providing a spectacular backdrop for the intense competition. The technology – including enhanced audio and drones – coupled with the unprecedented access we had to athletes and their lives allowed us to take the audience inside their stories in fresh, meaningful ways. And Team USA represented the best of every one of us, giving us so much to look forward to for many Olympic Games to come.” \n\t\n\n\tAdded NBC Olympics prexy Gary Zenkel: “The Milan Cortina Olympics proved once again that the American audience will gather in large numbers over 17 days to experience this unmatched global competition. These Winter Games — superbly hosted across northern Italy, and produced and distributed by a team of 2,700 — reached blockbuster U.S. audiences of more than 50 million viewers each day, continuing the media dominance we experienced less than two years ago at the Paris Olympics. We can’t wait for the return of the Olympics to the United States with the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028 and are ecstatic to be the U.S. media home of five Olympic Games over the next decade.”\n\n\tThe Winter Olympics wrapped what NBCU was calling “Legendary February,” with the Winter Olympics, Super Bowl LX and the NBA All-Star Game, all in the same month. \n\n\t“Beginning with the February 1 debut of Sunday Night Basketball, our NBC Sports and Olympics personnel delivered a truly ‘Legendary February’ to our audiences on NBC, Telemundo, Peacock and Versant’s USA Network and CNBC that definitely exceeded our expectations,” said NBC Sports president Rick Cordella.\n\n\tWith that schedule of sports events, Peacock is boasting it best month ever, helping bolster entertainment fare like “The Burbs,” which had Peacock’s highest first-day original debut. Also, four of Peacock’s top 10 usage days of all time and seven of its top 10 largest reach days took place during the Milan Cortina Olympics. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThere was more than a gold medal on the line following Team USA’s overtime win over Canada in the 2026 Winter Olympics hockey final: new data shows the U.S.’ historic hockey victory also led to a spike in ticket sales for regular season hockey games online.\n\n\tTeam USA defeated Canada by a score of 2-1 after New Jersey Devils forward Jack Hughes slotted the winning goal home just over 90 seconds into sudden-death overtime. The golden goal secured the U.S. men’s first Olympic gold medal since the famous “Miracle on Ice” win over the Soviet Union at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.\n\n\n\tNow, stats from ticketing site Gametime show ticket purchases for New Jersey Devils NHL games spiked “dramatically” in the hours following the gold medal game. \n\n\tGametime says transactions for National Hockey League tickets online were “more than 10x higher” than a typical day. The so-called “get-in price” for upcoming Devils’ games also “more than doubled,” per Gametime, with Wednesday’s game between New Jersey and the Buffalo Sabres showing a 127% price increase. “This kind of demand spike is typically reserved for playoff runs and championship celebrations,” notes Gametime on its blog. \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBuy NHL Tickets on Gametime\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tUse promo code SAVE20 at checkout for $20 off first purchase of $200 or more\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe 2026 Olympics were officially a ratings bonanza, with NBCUniversal touting an average of more than 23 million viewers watching across NBC, Peacock, USA Network and CNBC during the two-week period. Hockey was among the biggest draws, with the U.S. women’s hockey team’s victory over Canada ranking as the most-watched women’s hockey game ever, attracing 5.3 million viewers across USA Network and Peacock. While ratings for the men’s gold medal match — which also saw the U.S. topple Canada — have yet to be released, it’s clear there’s a surge of new interest in the sport.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStubHub\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBuy NHL Tickets on StubHub\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tStubHub’s Fan Protect Guarantee ensures valid tickets or your money back\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThat’s not even taking into account the “Heated Rivalry” effect: ticketing site SeatGeek released data in January suggesting that the hit HBO Max show may have driven demand for hockey tickets, especially among new fans. According to SeatGeek, the average number of hockey tickets sold on its site increased by 24% during the week of “Heated Rivalry’s” buzzy season one finale in December.\n\n\tThe site also cited a 13% year-over-year increase in the share of solo ticket buyers. As SeatGeek says, “This trend aligns with anecdotal evidence that ‘Heated Rivalry’ may be pulling in new or more casual fans—people curious enough to check out a game on their own.”\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSeatGeek\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBuy NHL Tickets on SeatGeek\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tUse promo code VARIETY10 to save $10 off purchases of $250 or more\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tYou can find NHL tickets online on Ticketmaster, which is the Official Ticket Marketplace of the NHL. Can’t find the seats you want or looking to score a deal online? You can also buy NHL tickets online through third-party sites like SeatGeek, Gametime, StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\n\tThe 2025-26 NHL season kicked off in October before the league took a mid-season break in February to allow players to complete in the Olympics. The league resumes play Feb. 25 as teams fight for a spot in the Stanley Cup playoffs in April. The Florida Panthers are the current Stanley Cup champions, having defeated the Edmonton Oilers last year.\n\n\tThe Professional Women’s Hockey League or PWHL, meantime, resumes play after the Olympics on Feb. 26. The eight-team women’s league features Boston, Minnesota, Montréal, New York, Ottawa, Toronto, Seattle and Vancouver. The current champions are the Minnesota Frost.\n",

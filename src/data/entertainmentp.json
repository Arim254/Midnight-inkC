    "body": "\n\tMultiple artists are seeking to leave the Wasserman Agency after details regarding founder-CEO Casey Wasserman’s connection to late financier and convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell emerged in documents last week, sources tell Variety. \n\n\tThe artists’ agents are said to have presented Wasserman with an ultimatum that he step down and divest or sell the company, which he thus far has declined. However, Wasserman, who is currently in Italy with the Olympics, is said to be meeting with top executives at the company later this week to determine a course of action. He is chairman of the organizing committee for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where he is also facing pressure to step down.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a house on fire,” one source says. \n\n\n\tSeveral artists, beginning with Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino and including Chappell Roan and top indie acts Wednesday, Water From Your Eyes and Beach Bunny, have posted social-media messages expressing unhappiness with Wasserman and are seeking or beginning the process to leave.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe agency is one of the largest in the music business, with a roster also featuring Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar, Lorde, Phish, Raye, SZA, Joni Mitchell, Janelle Monae, Geese and frontman Cameron Winter, Tyler, the Creator, Wednesday and hundreds of others. Wasserman’s artist roster was taken down from its website at some point over the last couple of days, presumably in response to artists’ requests for their names to be removed.\n\n\tHowever, the situation is more complicated for agents, who typically are bound by contracts spanning three to five years, whereas the artists are not. Complicating the situation further, artists often tend to be more loyal to their agents than agencies, and many follow their agents from one company to another over years. Similarly, agents often travel together from one company to another, sometimes over decades.\n\t\n\n\tThe situation was said to reach a “fever pitch” over the weekend, one source says, and has only accelerated from there. The executives, who include such veteran agents as Marty Diamond, Duffy McSwiggin and others, are said to be rallying together in an effort to maintain a unified company in some form. Sources say that several offers have been made for the company, along with the possibility for the executives to buy the division themselves, although it is unclear how serious or realistic any of the proposals are.\n\n\tRepresentatives for Wasserman and many of the above artists either declined or did not respond to Variety’s requests for comment. News of the impending ultimatum was first reported by the Wrap late Sunday, although rumors had been circulating since the latest batch of Epstein documents was released.\n\n\tIn a social media post Monday, the band Wednesday wrote, “Last week we were among the hundreds of artists who were aghast to find out about Casey Wasserman’s communications with Ghislaine Maxwell,” it reads in part. “It’s also important that we acknowledge the team of people we work with at the Wasserman agency as decent and trustworthy people with whom we’ve worked several years dating back to a time prior to their connection with Wasserman.”\n\n\tThe agency was formed in 2021 after a number of agents and artists parted ways with Paradigm, and Wasserman merged that company with his existing sports division. That sports division is not said to be at a similar crisis point.\n\n\tOn balance, Wasserman is not currently connected to any of Epstein’s crimes or misconduct and is documented as riding on Epstein’s private jet once (on a 2002 humanitarian trip with a Clinton Foundation delegation), and exchanging raunchy emails with Maxwell while he was married, years before the crimes became public. He has apologized for the connection, saying he was “terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” He is also the head of several charities.\n\n\tHowever, it is the second such scandal in 18 months for Wasserman. In July of 2024 — ironically, during the Paris Olympics — a damning report emerged in which Wasserman, grandson of the vaunted Hollywood dealmaker Lew Wasserman, was accused of having “serial” affairs with junior employees over many years. These reported indiscretions — on which Wasserman did not comment — caused a stir at the time but seemed to fade as weeks went by. Billie Eilish’s departure from the agency was perceived to be connected to the report, although multiple sources tell Variety she was already leaving when it emerged.\n\t\n\n\tComing so soon after the previous allegations, optics — particularly for a company named after its founder — can matter more than facts.\n\n\t“As an artist represented by Wasserman, I did not consent to having my name or my career tied to someone with this kind of association to exploitation,” Cosentino wrote. “Staying quiet isn’t something I can do in good conscience — especially in a moment when men in power are so often protected, excused, or allowed to move on without consequence. Pretending this isn’t a big deal is not an option for me.”\n\n\tVariety will have more on the situation as it develops.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tFollowing his historic Super Bowl Halftime Show, Bad Bunny has teamed up with Mitchell & Ness on a  jersey inspired by the cream white ensemble he wore on stage at Levi’s Stadium. \n\n\tThe front of the cream white jersey says “Super Tazon” (the Spanish translation for Super Bowl), with LX Super Bowl printed on the back, underneath a Bad Bunny football logo. The sportswear brand will release the jersey in limited quantities, which are currently available to pre-order on the Mitchell & Ness website. Product will officially ship out on May 1.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlimited-edition\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBad Bunny Super Bowl Jersey\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe new release isn’t an exact replica of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl jersey but is clearly inspired by the cream white ensemble he wore during the show, including a custom Zara jersey emblazoned with his real surname “Ocasio” and the number 64 on the back.\n\n\tMitchell & Ness isn’t the only brand to capitalize on Bad Bunny’s global stage at Super Bowl LX. The Puerto Rican superstar also debuted his signature Adidas sneakers, the BadBo 1.0, during his Halftime Show. Inspired by ’90s athletic and skate aesthetics, the BadBo 1.0 is the first signature sneaker from Bad Bunny in collaboration with Adidas. Instead of leaning heavily on traditional Three Stripes branding, the new sneaker incorporates a distinct winged midfoot support and patterned cutouts for a unique profile for the storied sneaker brand.\n\n\tBad Bunny opted for a fully accessible look for his Super Bowl performance, choosing a head-to-toe cream monochromatic ensemble from the Spanish fast fashion brand Zara — eschewing the flashy couture that often dominate highly televised moments. Her topped off his monochromatic ensemble with wide-leg chinos, a collared shirt and matching gloves, later switching to a boxier blazer and tie in the same shade.\n\n\n\tPre-order Bad Bunny’s Mitchell & Ness Super Bowl jersey here. \n",

A one-hour radio show Bongino did for Westwood One also ran at one time on the Fox Nation streaming service.\n\n\n\tHis first stint as a contributor at Fox News started in 2019, and by 2021 he was hosting the weekend program  “Unfiltered With Dan Bongino.” He left the company in 2023, citing difficulties in agreeing on new terms for his next contract. “You know, I’ve been there doing hits and working there for ten years… so the show ending was tough,” he said on his podcast in 2023. “And I want you to know it’s not some big conspiracy.

    "body": "\n\tMichael Douglas revealed at the recent TCM Classic Film Festival in New York City that director Oliver Stone originally disliked his acting in 1987’s “Wall Street” so much that he asked Douglas if he was taking drugs during production. \n\n\t“Okay, so we were finishing the second week of filming, and there was a knock on my door. ‘Hey Mike, it’s s Oliver. Can I come in?'” Douglas remembered (via EW). “I say, ‘Yeah, come on in.’ He comes in the trailer and sits down. He says to me, ‘You okay?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’m okay.’ [He says], ‘Are you doing drugs?’ I said, ‘No, I’m not doing drugs.’ And he said, ‘Because you look like you’ve never acted before in your life.'”\n\t\n\n\tDouglas informed Stone that he wasn’t watching the film’s dailies to check on his performance “because I’m one of those guys that always sees what’s wrong or what’s not going to be in the film… so I don’t pay attention to the dailies. So I said, ‘I guess I’d better take a look,’ and he said, ‘Yeah, you better.'”\n\n\n\t“And then I’m looking at them really hard, and critically, and they seemed pretty good,” Douglas continued about when filming resumed. “So I keep saying, ‘I think it’s pretty good.'”\n\n\tStone eventually came around and agreed with his star, who played the iconic role of Gordon Gekko opposite Charlie Sheen and Daryl Hannah in “Wall Street.” The film centers on the relationship between Sheen’s young stockbroker and Douglas’ wealthy corporate raider. \n\n\t“He was willing for me to hate his guts for the rest of this movie to get that extra little push,” Douglas said of Stone’s original insults, which he did not take personally. “His record of successes with actors is quite impressive. So I’m deeply, deeply appreciative of the fact that it gave me part and the fact that he pushed me to another level.”\n\t\n\n\tDouglas ended up winning the Oscar for best actor thanks to his performance in “Wall Street.” He was also awarded a Golden Globe and the National Board of Review’s best actor prize. He returned as Gordon Gekko in Stone’s 2010 sequel “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.”\n\n\tIn Matt Zoller Seitz’s “The Oliver Stone Experience,” Stone had this to say about Douglas: “I think he was more comfortable [playing a villain], but I think Michael struggles for comfort levels. I mean, he’s not comfortable, per se; he’s always looking. If you notice, he moves his shoulders a lot. When he’s misused, which he sometimes is in films, that cockiness of Gekko can be irritating, smarmy, in the wrong roles. But I like Michael when he’s doing it in good movies, with good material. I liked him in ‘Wall Street’ very much.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBill Maher said during a recent “Club Random” podcast interview (via Mediaite) with Adam Carolla that Jimmy Kimmel is “very mad at me.” Carolla and Kimmel used to work together as co-hosts of “The Man Show” on Comedy Central from 1999 to 2004.\n\n\t“Jimmy Kimmel, you know, he’s very mad at me and I know you’re close to him,” Maher told Carolla. “I hope you tell him that I’m sorry that it got bent out of shape. I don’t think I did anything wrong. We can have disagreements. I mean, you and I don’t agree on everything, look at this clash now, and yet we’re cool.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Republicans are always this sort of difference between the right and the left. It bugs me so much,” Maher continued, noting how Democrats struggle with criticism far more than Republicans. “My tribe is supposed to be the left, but these are the people who just can’t talk to you unless you’re exactly there, whereas the Republicans, they always fucking come to my show. John Kennedy from Louisiana was on last week, took his beating like a man, like they all do, and we came across lovingly and smilingly and happily and we can disagree.”\n\n\tMaher said that Kimmel is “one of the nicest guys,” but he is not going to go the traditional late-night route when it comes to political humor. Maher will always take aim at both political parties, “and if that’s not good enough for you, then I think you’re the asshole,” the “Real Time” host added.\n\n\t“I don’t just buy into the left-wing bullshit, and I never stop making fun of the right-wing bullshit at all!” Maher said. “And like, if that’s not good enough for you, then I think you’re the asshole, and I don’t think Jimmy is an asshole… I think he’s a great guy, and it bugs me that, you know, because of what the latest thing was, that, you know, we may never talk again.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile Maher did not say directly why Kimmel is mad at him, it appears tied to a “Real Time” episode last November, where Maher called out Kimmel’s wife, Molly McNearney, for revealing she had cut ties with Trump-loving family members.\n\n\tMcNearney joined Kimmel for an interview on the “We Can Do Hard Things” podcast at the time and opened up on her “challenging” relationships with Trump-supporting family members amid the president’s ongoing feud with Kimmel. She said she has “sympathy” for her relatives who are “deliberately being misinformed every day,” but “it hurts me so much because of the personal relationship I now have where my husband is out there fighting this man.”\n\n\t“To me, them voting for Trump is them not voting for my husband and me and our family,” she added, saying “unfortunately” she has “lost relationships with people in my family because of it.”\n\n\tMaher responded to McNearney’s reveal on “Real Time” by saying: “She says she’s lost relationships with relatives because she wrote them an email before the election with ten reasons why they shouldn’t vote for Trump, and some still didn’t obey, so you know. Ultimatums. Ten reasons? I can think of 100. But I would never present it to someone as an ultimatum. Ultimatums don’t make people rethink their politics. They make them rethink you.”\n\n\tThe host then said on a December episode of the “Club Random” podcast that Kimmel was mad at him for the criticism, adding: “I was as kid-gloved as I could. And I see they’re mad at me. Uh, I’m sorry. I mean, I was being, again, as respectful as I could, but I don’t agree with that point of view. And since she went public with it, it wasn’t out of school for me to go public with it. I love Jimmy. I’ve always have. I don’t know him that well, but he’s a great guy… I hope we’re friends forever, but I don’t know. You know, the liberals and the woke, that’s a schism. It just is.”\n\n\tWatch the latest episode of Maher’s “Club Random” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAndy Cohen isn’t letting Bad Bunny trolls get away with bashing the Super Bowl Halftime Show. The host of Bravo’s nightly talk show “Watch What Happens Live” and the executive producer of “The Real Housewives” franchise spent time on Threads after the big game roasting Bad Bunny bashers. \n\n\t“NOT ONE WORD OF ENGLISH FROM Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl LX Full halftime performance!!” one Threads user wrote. “How disgraceful American sports have become, especially in the year of our 250th Anniversary!! I did not watch, and I have no plan to watch in the future!!”\n\t\n\n\t“Lynda, your bangs are begging for help. Oh, and that’s Lady Gaga singing in English,” Cohen fired back, acknowledging the user had posted Lady Gaga’s English-language portion of the Halftime Show on her profile.\n\n\n\tWhen another user claimed that the “majority of Americans don’t want to see men wearing Dresses,” presumably referring to Bad Bunny photo shoots from the past, Cohen asked about the Super Bowl: “Who was in a dress?”\n\n\tA separate Threads user translated Bad Bunny’s songs into English and posted the lyrics, writing: “For all those who are not fluent in Spanish here are the lyrics in english for his opening song. It’s a shame and honestly makes me sick the NFL promoted this junk.”\n\n\t“Now let’s read Kid Rock’s lyrics,” Cohen responded, referring to the headliner for Turning Point USA’s “All-American Halftime Show,” which was designed as a MAGA alternative for people outraged with the NFL for choosing a Spanish-language artist like Bad Bunny for the real Super Bowl Halftime Show. \n\n\t“Wow. The ending of that Turning point concert. Kid Rock has me fighting back tears. Such a powerful message,” wrote one Threads user in praise of Turning Point USA’s concert.\n\t\n\n\tCohen responded, “Me too. The idea that I can wear jorts while looking like a prune gives me hope about getting older! Kinda getting misty just typing it.”\n\n\tThe Bravo icon, who was also see on Super Bowl night as the star of a NERDS Candy commercial, also confronted Donald Trump’s takedown of Bad Bunny’s performance by writing: “Was there ever a moment in history when the President’s opinion of the Super Bowl Halftime Show was relevant?”\n\n\tTrump took to Truth Social not long after halftime to criticize Bad Bunny’s performance as “absolutely terrible.” The president said it was “one of the worst” Super Bowl Halftime Shows in recent memory. \n\n\t“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World,” Trump added. “This ‘Show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sinners,” “Zootopia 2” and “KPop Demon Hunters” took top honors at the Advanced Imaging Society Awards.\n\n\tThe Lumiere Awards recognized outstanding creative and technical achievements during its 16th annual celebration. The awards honor the artists, engineers and innovators whose work continues to push the boundaries of storytelling and cinematic technology.\n\n\t“These Lumiere winners produced their brilliant stories by pushing the boundaries of what’s possible creatively and technically,” said Jim Chabin, president of the Advanced Imaging Society. “In these honorees we see our industry’s future – and that future is truly more exciting than ever.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Society awarded the best live action feature film Lumiere Award to “Sinners,” with best supporting actor nominee Delroy Lindo on hand to present the award to producer Sev Ohanian. The film’s sound team — Chris Welcker, Steve Boeddeker and Benny Burtt — were present to accept the Lumiere for best audio. Voters praised “Sinners,” calling it a “brilliant and meaningful story,” and noted that as a film, it was “perfectly executed.”\n\n\n\t “Zootopia 2” won best animated feature. Actor and voice artist Patrick Warburton presented the award to director Byron Howard. Voters noted not only its stunning visuals, but its “unprecedented technical integration across every production dimension.”\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” took home two Lumiere awards, winning for best original song for “Golden” and best musical scene or sequence for “Golden.”\n\n\tPicturehouse’s “The King of Color,” written and directed by Patrick Creadon, won best documentary. The film follows Larry Herbert, inventor of the Pantone Matching System, which established a universal worldwide standard for color. Creadon was there to accept the award and read a note of appreciation from 97-year-old Herbert. AIS commented, “We’re an organization spanning filmmaking, post-production, and technology, united by a commitment to educating audiences. ‘The King of Color’ tells our origin story.”\n\t\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” won best motion picture – musical. AIS honoree and director Jon M. Chu accepted the award. Voters commented on “the way it perfectly integrated difficult, high-production value VFX and imagery work into the musical storytelling throughout the film. The work in all departments was extraordinary in this film.”\n\n\tThe Lumiere for best theatrical scene or sequence was awarded to “Avatar: Fire and Ash” for the third act Flux Devil fire tornado battle sequence. Oscar-nominated visual effects supervisor Eric Saindon of Wētā FX accepted the award on behalf of the VFX team that included Joe Letteri and Lightstorm’s Richard Baneham, who also attended. Voters unequivocally agreed that the unforgettable third-act sequence once again set a new benchmark for visual effects–driven storytelling.\n\n\tAmong the episodic winners was “Andor” Season 2, which received the Lumiere for best episodic – live action, accepted by executive producer John Gilroy, Meanwhile, the award for best episodic – animation went to “Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,” accepted by showrunner Jeff Trammell.\n\n\tOther technical awards went to Apple TV’s “Severance” for best audio – episodic, accepted by scoring mixer Chris Fogel. “Stranger Things” Season 5 won the Lumiere for best use of high dynamic range – episodic and was accepted by colorist Jared Arkulary from Company 3, and “F1” won best use of high dynamic range – feature film, accepted by Company 3 colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld.\n\n\tGoogle was presented with the Society’s annual Sir Charles Wheatstone Award for its innovations that include its VEO and Imagen models, Google Cloud and YouTube production tools. The award was accepted by Anil Jain, global managing director of strategic industries.\n\n\tThe awards also recognized five organizations for their “impact and innovation” in driving the media and entertainment ecosystem forward this year. Production Technology Lumiere Awards were presented to the following: AMD for their EPYC CPU’s and Threadripper PRO workstation tools; Conductor, by CoreWeave, was recognized for their desktop tools for cloud optimization; Flawless became the first AI company to be recognized for pioneering Assistive AI that preserves and supports human creativity; 6P Color was recognized for their “Full Color Range” format for electronic color imagery; DisneyResearch|Studios was honored with a Lumiere for its Artistically Controllable ML Stereo Conversion toolset.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition, VUE and CEO Tim Richards were honored with the Society’s Governor’s Award for Cinema Excellence for their new generation of premium EPIC screen cinemas, featuring state of the art laser projection and sound.\n\n\tAs previously announced, Ethan Hawke was honored with the 2026 Distinguished Artist Award for his performance in Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” Former president of Lucasfilm Kathleen Kennedy presented Hawke with the award and said, “Whether he’s playing a young idealist, a tortured poet, or — most recently — Lorenz Hart in ‘Blue Moon,’ Ethan brings the same deep commitment to showing us the essence of what makes us human. His work invites us to feel more, understand more and care more. That honesty, that humanity, is at the heart of everything he does. Ethan doesn’t just step into the spotlight — he is the light.”\n\n\tChu was awarded the inaugural Judy Garland Legacy Award, which was introduced by Garland’s daughter Lorna Luft and presented by actor Josh Gad.\n\n\tThe Harold Lloyd Award was presented to Joseph Kosinski and Jerry Bruckheimer by Suzanne Lloyd, chairman of Harold Lloyd Entertainment. \n\n\tSee the complete list of winners below:\n\n\tBest Feature Film – Live Action: “Sinners”\n\n\tBest Feature Film – Animation: “Zootopia 2”\n\n\tBest Documentary: “The King of Color”\n\n\tBest Motion Picture – Musical: “Wicked: For Good”\n\n\tBest Audio – Theatrical: “Sinners”\n\n\tBest Audio – Episodic: “Severance”\n\n\tBest Original Song: “Golden,” from “KPop Demon Hunters”\n\n\tBest Use of High Dynamic Range – Feature Film: “F1”\n\n\tBest Use of High Dynamic Range – Episodic: “Stranger Things” Season 5\n\n\tBest Musical Scene or Sequence: “KPop Demon Hunters” – “Golden”\n\n\tBest Theatrical Scene or Sequence: “Avatar: Fire and Ash” – “Flux Devil”\n\n\tBest Episodic – Animation: “Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man”\n\n\tBest Episodic – Live Action: “Andor” Season 2\n\n\tBest International 3D Documentary: NHK for The Mark of Beauty Tokyo Imperial Palace\n\n\tBest Use of VR: Dolphins of the Reef, Immotion\n\n\tProduction Technology Awards:AMD, DisneyResearch|Studios Flawless, 6P Color, CoreWeave\n\n\tGovernor’s Award for Cinema Excellence: VUE\n\n\tSir Charles Wheatstone Award: Google\n\n\tJudy Garland Legacy Award: Jon M.

    "body": "\n\tNoam Ash was about 27 years old when he and his then-boyfriend called it quits. At the time, Ash didn’t have much money nor another place to live.\n\n\tWhat did he do?\n\n\tHe moved in with his grandparents.\n\n\t“I lived with them for over a year,” Ash tells me. “It was the best year, but honestly, I was so mortified and embarrassed by the whole thing. I did not want anyone to know that I lived with them. But my manager at the time thought it was hysterical. She said, ‘You have to write something about this.’ And then I did and this is the result of that.”\n\t\n\n\tThe this is “Bookends,” a rom-com written by and starring Ash as an aspiring novelist who finds romance with his grandparents’ doctor (Charlie Barnett) when he moves in with them after he finds out his boyfriend (Spencer Belko) is having an affair with their spin instructor (Jared Reinfeldt).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoam Ash and Charlie Barnett in “Bookends”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAsh’s grandparents died before the movie, directed by Mike Doyle, got made. “They did know that I was writing this, this piece, and that it was really a love letter to them,” Ash says.\n\n\tCaroline Aaron and F. Murray Abraham play Nate’s grandparents. As the movie unfolds, the grandfather begins to show signs of dementia. “For my mom and my aunt, it’s their dad,” Ash says. “When they watched the movie, they were like, ‘Oh, my god, it’s dad.’ My mother asked if I showed Murray videos of grandpa. I was like, ‘No. It’s all in the writing, honey. My mom was like, ‘How does he know the mannerisms and the hand gestures and everything?’”\n\t\n\n\tNot only is Ash openly gay but so is Barnett. Authentic casting was important to Ash and Doyle. “That was something Mike and I discussed a lot,” Ash says. “We also wanted to show that Jews come in all different shades, shapes and sizes and Charlie’s mom was actually Jewish. He was like, ‘I wasn’t raised Jewish. I was like, ‘That’s OK. We’ll claim you.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tF. Murray Abraham and Caroline Aaron in “Bookends”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith an upswing in political attacks aimed at the queer community, Ash admits he initially worried that the movie would have trouble finding a distributor.\n\n\tBut then “Heated Rivalry” came along.\n\n\t“I think they proved that in the absolute biggest way that you can have the steamiest, gayest, most homoerotic show probably ever made for television, and it could also have huge mainstream success,” Ash says. “That has put my mind at ease.”\n\n\t“Bookends” premieres Feb. 9 at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe producers behind Bad Bunny’s triumphant Super Bowl LX Halftime Show had a problem: The NFL wouldn’t allow more than 25 carts to bring equipment on to the all-grass Levi’s Stadium field in Santa Clara, Calif. To pull off Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio’s and his creative team’s tremendous production plans, that meant something would have to give.\n\n\tLuckily,  a solution to one of the show’s most stunning visuals — the pastizales (grass fields and other plants) that harken back to Bad Bunny’s native Puerto Rican landscape — was to make it real people. Production designers Bruce and Shelly Rodgers recruited around 380 people to dress up as the grass, allowing for easier on-and-off staging.\n\t\n\n\t“That solution of making the plant people, and then the plant people getting on and off in time, plus all the sets and all the performers — it was audacious in every direction,” said creative director Harriet Cuddeford. “There were over 330 actual cast performers in addition to the plant people. It was just huge.”\n\n\tBad Bunny and the event’s producers and directors pulled off what may have been the most intricate halftime extravaganza in Super Bowl history. With superstar guests like Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, a real-life wedding and authentic business owners (including Los Angeles’ own Villa’s Tacos), the “Benito Bowl” was planned with many moving parts that could have gone wrong.\n\n\t“There’s just so many variables in live TV,” Cuddeford said. “Even the weather. It was on a real grass field, and there’s no roof. We had to have backup rain plans. There were so many things that could have caused an issue. But it just kind of almost flawlessly unfolded before our eyes. We were all just like, ‘Wow, it worked!’”\n\t\n\n\tDirector Hamish Hamilton — who has produced countless Super Bowl Halftime Shows, Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and more — said, “It was the biggest team effort of a show I have ever been involved in.”\n\n\tHere are some details Cuddeford and Hamilton shared about this year’s Bad Bunny halftime show.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBad Bunny managed to pull off several stunts while singing at the same time. At one point, much to the producers’ chagrin, the singer climbed a tall utility poll without any safety rigging.\t\n\n\t“He refused to wear a harness,” Hamilton said. “He was like, ‘I don’t need it.’ There are all kinds of legal ramifications to that, which is not really my thing, but interestingly enough, when he decided he wasn’t going to wear a harness, we were able to then put a camera on the pole to look down at him climbing up!”\n\n\tAdded Cuddeford: “There was all safety and rigging and all of that available, obviously, of course, but he didn’t want it. He does his own stunts, that guy, and he learned it in about three minutes. Straight up that pole. At rehearsal, we were all like, ‘Is he gonna be OK?’ But he just went straight up there, and managed his vocals. Very agile. He could just, like, handle anything.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of stunts, Bad Bunny falling through the roof of the pink casita was one thing — but it also had to be perfectly timed to the pre-tape of him doing the same thing as seen by the family watching TV inside.\t\n\n\t“The stunt itself, to fall through the roof, wasn’t so crazy — there’s a trap door,” Cuddeford said. “They just literally open it, and pull it out underneath him. But it required so much meticulous planning, because we cut straight into the pre-tape. Inside the pre-tape was the shot on the TV of him falling through the roof of the Super Bowl — so the family in the la casita were watching the Super Bowl live, and then he fell onto their table. That’s basically two different pre-tapes: The pre-tape inside the house, and then there’s the pre-tape on the field of him falling through the roof during the dress rehearsal. And then comping that all together, then cutting to the transition of him falling through the roof and be able to kick the front door open.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe couple who got married during the halftime show is from Ontario, Calif., and had sent Bad Bunny a wedding invitation on a lark.\t\n\n\tAccording to Hamilton, the engaged couple wound up with 15 extra wedding announcements — so they sent most to local businesses with the hope of maybe getting some free wedding perks. But the last invite? “They were like, ‘Why don’t we send one to Bad Bunny? Lots of people send wedding invitations to him, so why not,’” Hamilton said. “Bad Bunny’s office reached out, and they thought, ‘Amazing, maybe we’ll get a signed photo. But they were invited to a Zoom call, which they thought was kind of weird.”\n\t\n\n\tOn the Zoom call, they learned the plan: Bad Bunny was inviting them to get married at the Super Bowl. “It was like, an overprinting of wedding invitations led to a series of events where they wound up getting married during Bad Bunny’s performance at the Super Bowl!” Hamilton said.\n\n\tThe couple had planned to make Bad Bunny’s “Baile Inolvidable” be their first dance. “And so, they went from planning to play it at their wedding to being on the Super Bowl with him live, singing it,” Cuddeford said. “And with the bonus prize of Lady Gaga being the wedding singer as well.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDespite rumors on social media, Bad Bunny didn’t hand his recently won Grammy to Liam, the young boy from Minnesota who had been imprisoned by ICE. But that moment is meant to convey a personal connection to the performer’s childhood.\t\n\n\t“The kid is somebody that we cast,” Cuddeford said. “But the story behind that was Benito’s idea. He’d grown up watching his idols on TV getting awards. In his life now, he stands on stage and gets given awards by his idols. He knew the Grammys were coming up, and he was hoping to win something. And then obviously he won Best Album last weekend. And so, he really wanted to inspire the next generation.”\n\n\tThat’s why the boy at the Super Bowl was wearing an outfit similar to one a young Benito is seen wearing in a well-known photo of the superstar as a young child. “This is really representing a younger version of himself,  with the hope of him inspiring  the kids of today,” she said.\n\t\n\t\tDid Bad Bunny get his Grammy back?\t\n\n\t“I actually don’t know if he took it back,” Cuddeford said. “Knowing him, he might have just left it with the kid, honestly.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRicky Martin \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBad Bunny personally selected Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin as his guests; Martin, of course, is a Puerto Rican childhood idol. And the song Martin sang, “Lo Que Le Paso a Hawaii,” not only resonates in Puerto Rico, but in Hawai’i too.\t\n\n\t“That’s a very meaningful song, almost kind of a plea to not turn Puerto Rico into Hawai’i,” Cuddeford said. “To make sure that it kind of retains its culture and its identity. It was just very powerful to have a Puerto Rican icon whom he deeply loves and respects to join him and to perform that song. It was something that during his residency, he had many guest artists would come and sing that. He’d never managed to align to have Ricky do it, so he was so excited to have Ricky do it at the Super Bowl.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThose guest small business owners, vendors and workers are all real-life people, flown into the Super Bowl for the show.\t\n\n\tThat includes Los Angeles’ own Villa’s Tacos founder Victor Villa, as well as a real piragua (Puerto Rican shave ice dessert) vendor, boxers Xander Zayas and Emiliano Vargas, a real nail technician, barber and more. Even the priest that married the Ontario couple is an actual, ordained minister.\n\n\t“The performance is celebrating normal people, and what it is to be human and love and have joy, and really appreciate one another,” Cuddeford said. “This was to show how much he values his community, to celebrate normal people on the world’s biggest stage, especially people who are of importance in in Latino culture. He’s a very authentic person, Benito, and it’s about just being authentic and very real and very human.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnd yes, that was Maria Antonia Cay, better known as Toñita, taking a shot with Bad Bunny inside a re-creation of her famed Brooklyn landmark the Caribbean Social Club.\t\n\n\t“We faithfully recreated this  iconic, very important for the culture, Puerto Rican bar in Brooklyn,” Cuddeford said. “And then we flew Toñita out to be part of the performance. And you saw him do the shot with her at the point in the song when he sings about doing a shot with Toñita.”\n\t\n\t\tThere were few hairy moments, including one that involved a camera crane spinning out of control.\t\n\n\tThat crane, which was used in the beginning sequence around the casita, lost digital connection — “So, literally, it started spinning like a hose out of control,” Hamilton said. “But probably a second before we needed the shot, the camera locked again in perfect position, and we were allowed to take it!”\n\n\tAnd at another point, there’s a bit of a wobble from one of the low angle cameras that’s looking up at the casita. “Basically, everybody’s racing for a shot, and the handheld cameraman taking the shot gets hit by the Chapman dolly trying to make a shot after — and they collide, and that’s why there was a wobble. It’s split-second timing.”\n\n\tHamilton admitted it’s “terrifying” watching the camera operators running around each other as they get their shots. “In the performance of ‘NuevaYol,’ there are moments when the cameras literally get to their point of shooting half a second before they’re on,” he said. “The crane comes out, the cameras run half the way along a football pitch and literally, then run into Benito!”\n\t\n\n\tAdded Cuddeford: “The camera work was insane and so intricate and so carefully planned and such a feat, and could have just gone so wrong at any moment.”\n\t\n\t\tThe use of all those grass people made for a very different kind of staging — and the producers debated for some time on how to make the show visually unique for home viewers while still making it watchable for the fans in the stands at Levi’s Stadium.\t\n\n\t“Probably more than any other show, this was choreographed to the camera,” Hamilton said. “With the grass people, it was quite enclosed. And so there were many debates about  the camera versus the people in the audience in the stadium. For the stadium, they definitely had a restricted view during certain parts of the show. But I think that we ended up with a really good balance.”\n\t\n\t\tThe show’s cinematic look is by design, as the producers switched to cinema cameras for Super Bowl halftime a few years ago.\t\n\n\t“For many years now, we have effectively used cinema cameras in a live television domain, which is really ambitious,” Hamilton said. “It’s very nerve-racking when you’re putting effectively Ferrari-esque technology to work in circumstances more attuned to using a Land Rover. These cameras are not really made to be used and run around a football field and put up in eight minutes. But they allow you to get an image that is significantly different to the imagery available on the game cameras. Until six or seven years ago, we would use the all-purpose sports cameras, which you can throw them off a cliff, and they’ll bounce back. Whereas these kind of digital cinema cameras, they have very specific lenses, and they work in a very specific way. It’s a complicated, challenging workflow, but a lot of people comment on how cinematic it looks.

No suspects, persons of interest, or vehicles have been identified.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As you know ... Nancy was reported missing last Sunday, Feb. 1, after failing to show up for church. Annie and Annie's husband, Tommaso Cioni, were the last ones to see her at dinner the night before.\n      \n    \n          As we've told you ... Nancy is 84 years old and not in terrific health. She has a pacemaker and needs daily medication. It's unclear if she's receiving her pills.\n      \n      ",

I've known them since before the kids were born. I'm godfather to Cruz.

In the posts, Brooklyn accused his parents of controlling him for much of his life and claimed his anxiety disappeared after stepping away from his family. He also defended his wife, Nicola Peltz, pushing back against claims she influences or controls him.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          Brooklyn further alleged tensions boiled over at his wedding, claiming Victoria interrupted a planned moment when Marc was serenading the newlyweds. According to Brooklyn, his mom instead danced with him in a way he described as inappropriate and humiliating.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Marc Anthony\n              \n                          \n                David Beckham\n              \n                          \n                Nicola Peltz\n              \n                          \n                Brooklyn Beckham\n              \n                          \n                Victoria Beckham\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Family\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fights & Feuds\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tU.K. sales and distribution company Blue Finch Films has closed a raft of international sales for horror-comedy “Hold the Fort,” with Sunrise Films picking up North American rights to the William Bagley-directed feature.\n\n\tSunrise Films, whose recent slate includes Toronto Film Festival selection “Saipan,” starring Steve Coogan and Éanna Hardwicke, has acquired the film for North America with plans for a summer release.\n\n\n\tThe genre pic, which made its world premiere at Fantasia Film Festival before touring the festival circuit, has also been acquired by Signature Entertainment for the U.K. and Ireland. Additional deals have been struck with Lighthouse Home Entertainment for Germany, Mediawan Rights for France, Wild Duck Prods. for Spain and Vendetta Filmes for Portugal.

    "body": "\n\tSales company Sola Media has added CGI animated film “Guardian Rabbits — the Secret of the Golden Egg” to its lineup at the European Film Market and has released the first image from the film.\n\n\t“Guardian Rabbits” is the third installment in the “Rabbit” universe, following “Rabbit School” and “Rabbit Academy,” which both were sold to more than 180 territories. The latter was a box office hit with a $10.5 million gross worldwide and ranked third among the top German films abroad.\n\t\n\n\tThe new film is directed by Ute von Münchow Pohl, who also helmed “Rabbit Academy” and “Rabbit School,” as well as “The Super Elfkins,” “The Elfkins — Baking a Difference” and “Raven the Little Rascal.”\n\n\n\tAll three “Rabbit” films are produced by Germany’s Akkord Film Produktion, which teams again with co-producers Arx Anima and Seru Animation, German distributor Leonine and Sola.\n\n\tIn the new film, rabbit girl Emmy is chosen as the new Guardian of the Golden Egg — the magical source of Easter — but she doubts she can live up to the legacy. Her worries grow when a group of badgers takes over the Rabbit School and steals the Egg.\n\n\tOn her rescue mission, she uncovers a hidden truth: the badgers are trying to save their dying ancient tree, the heart of their world. Faced with an impossible choice, Emmy unites rabbits, foxes and badgers, proving that the true magic of Easter is courage, unity and sharing its light with all.\n\n\tAt the EFM, Sola will present exclusive first footage to buyers.\n\n\t“We are thrilled to continue our collaboration with Akkord Film and to present ‘Guardian Rabbits’ at the EFM in Berlin,” said Solveig Langeland, managing director of Sola. “With a top animation team, new enchanting character designs and a compelling story, the film invites audiences back into our favorite rabbits’ universe. Buyers can look forward to a highly promising project filled with fun, action and heart.”\n\t\n\n\tCurrently in production and scheduled for delivery at the end of this year, “Guardian Rabbits” will be released in Germany around Easter 2027 by Leonine, one of Germany’s leading distributors.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn the red carpet for AppleTV+ series “The Last Thing He Told Me” Thursday evening, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Garner both had memories of James Van Der Beek to share.\n\n\tVan Der Beek, who died Wednesday at 48, had one of his final roles in the “Legally Blonde” prequel series “Elle,” which Witherspoon is executive producing. It premieres July 1 on Amazon Prime.\n\n\tVariety‘s Marc Malkin asked Witherspoon on the carpet about working with the late “Dawson’s Creek” actor. “It was so fun because, you know, growing up in this business, we always knew James,” Witherspoon said. “He was always around. We went to parties together. It’s just a devastating loss.”\n\t\n\n\tWitherspoon continued, “He’s been so loved in our community. He was always such a generous person and a man of very high character and high values. He brought that to everyday work on the set with our young cast. They just adored him.”\n\n\tShe wrote on Instagram Wednesday that she was “devastated” and continued, “What an extraordinary, talented man who also showed great kindness and grace in every action. Praying all the angels watch over his family during this difficult time.”\n\n\tGarner told Malkin, “We grew up together. We celebrated their success, and James always brought his whole family into every room with him, and I just send all of my love to Kimberly and to their beautiful children.” \n\n\tAfter Van Der Beek’s death, Garner wrote “What a heartbreaking loss. So much love to you, Kimberly, and to your kids, as you navigate this tender time.”\n\n\tGarner stars in and executive produces “The Last Thing He Told Me,” which premieres its second season Feb. 20. Witherspoon executive produced the series through her Hello Sunshine shingle.\n",

    "body": "\n\tColleen Atwood (“One Battle After Another”), Paul Tazewell (“Wicked: For Good)” and Kate Hawley (“Frankenstein”) were the big winners of the 28th Costume Designers Guild Awards on Thursday evening.\n\n\tOn the TV side, Kameron Lennox took home the award for her work on “The Studio,” while Michael Wilkinson won for “Andor.”\n\n\n\tFor the first time in the history of the guild, there was a tie in the excellence in short form design category Rafaella Rabinovich won for “Dandyland” Episode 10 and Michelle Martini, CDG for“Uber Eats: A Century of Cravings” – Super Bowl. \n\t\n\n\tHawley who won for excellence in period film for “Frankenstein” thanked Guillermo del Toro and said, “I would have given up at certain times without him… I love that he celebrates and supports all of us and the process of being an artist.”\n\n\tActor Courtney Hope who plays Sally Spectra on “The Young and the Restless” and “The Bold and the Beautiful” hosted the evening, which celebrated special honorees Michelle Cole, James Cameron, Kate Hudson and Teyana Taylor.\n\n\tTaylor who received the Vanguard Spotlight Award said, “Costume Design has always been bigger than fashion. In my life, it’s storytelling. Before a character ever speaks, what they wear is already telling you who they are, their strength, their vulnerability, their journey. That kind of visual language has inspired me since I was a little girl.” Taylor went on to say, “This award represents creative freedom, the freedom to take risks, push boundaries and honor where I came from and just to continue to evolve to the next generation of creatives.”\n\t\n\n\tCole who is on the board, thanked the guild’s president Terry Gordon and said, “They are fighting for each and every one of you designers.”\n\n\tTazewell who won for excellence in sci-fi/fantasy for “Wicked: For Good’ called his win a full circle moment. He said, “To have experienced the journey that I experienced, creating the costumes, the looks for the world of ‘Wicked’ and ‘Wicked: For Good’ has changed my life in so many profound ways.\n\n\tHudson received the Spotlight Award, which honors an actor whose talent and career personify an enduring commitment to excellence, including a special awareness of the role and importance of costume design. While onstage accepting her award, Hudson recalled, how her earliest memories “are sitting on the floor of a studio in Hollywood surrounded by every sequence imaginable, looking down at me are these giants, my exquisite mother, and the phenomenal, iconic Bob Mackie designed for her, both in life and on film.” She added, “Watching that level of artistry as a child, it was magic.” She added she had hoped to work with everyone in the room and joked, “I promise I’m really fun to work with. I’m good at collaborating, and I’ll always take a note. You can say no, but I do continue to be in awe of what you do.”Cole accepted the Career Achievement Award, which recognizes an individual whose career in costume design has left an indelible mark on film and television.\n\n\tThe evening’s Distinguished Collaborator Award was presented to James Cameron by Deborah L. Scott. The award recognizes individuals whose exceptional skills and contributions have significantly advanced the craft and art of costume design. It highlights behind-the-scenes professionals whose dedication and expertise are essential to the storytelling process through costume design. \n\n\tCameron who has worked with Scott for over three decades recalled their time working on “Titanic.” He said, “Deborah had to clothe 2200 extras. So you can look at the task in terms of its scale; ,all of these costumes for the first class, second class, third class passengers and all the crew and so on. But I think that you can imagine the scale of that project, especially when all the costumes had to go in the water and come back out and still be usable, tuxedos and everything getting immersed night after night, because the Titanic itself sank once for a movie, we had to sink it over and over.” \n\n\tCameron ended his speech by saying, “These awards and this community that celebrates the art of design is so critical in this Age of the onslaught of AI.” He added, “AI don’t sew,”\n\t\n\n\tSee the full list of winners below.\n\n\tExcellence in Contemporary Film“Bugonia” – Jennifer Johnson, CDG“F1 The Movie” – Julian Day, CDG“One Battle After Another” – Colleen Atwood, CDG (WINNER)“Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” – Jenny Eagan, CDG“Weapons” – Trish Summerville, CDG\n\n\tExcellence in Period Film“Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale” – Anna Mary Scott Robbins“Frankenstein” – Kate Hawley, CDG (WINNER)“Hamnet” – Malgosia Turzanska, CDG“Hedda” – Lindsay Pugh“Sinners” – Ruth E.

    "body": "\n\tThe Motion Picture Association on Thursday denounced the newest AI video generator, Seedance 2.0, saying it had unleashed a flood of copyright infringement in the day since it became available.\n\n\tByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, said the model represents a “substantial leap in generation quality” since the previous version. Videos generated by the service – notably one of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting on a rooftop — have gone viral on social media platforms.\n\t\n\n\t“In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,” an MPA spokesperson said in a statement. “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity.”\n\n\n\tThe trade association made a similar comment after OpenAI released Sora 2 last fall, which also generated a glut of AI-enabled copyright infringement.\n\n\t“OpenAI needs to take immediate and decisive action to address this issue,” the MPA said at the time. “Well-established copyright law safeguards the rights of creators and applies here.”\n\n\tOpenAI was responsive to those concerns, implementing safeguards that made it much more difficult for users to violate studio copyrights. Disney later made a deal with OpenAI to license 200 characters for use on Sora 2, which was seen by many as a potential template for other studios to follow.\n\t\n\n\tBut it is not clear whether ByteDance would be open to that approach, or whether copyright owners will be compelled to start filing takedown notices and infringement suits. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\tSome reacted to the Seedance videos with doom and resignation.\n\n\t“I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us,” wrote Rhett Reese, writer of the “Deadpool” films, in a comment on the Cruise-Pitt video. “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases.”\n\n\tThe video was generated by Ruairi Robinson, an Irish film and commercial maker. \n\n\t“This was a 2 line prompt in seedance 2,” he wrote on X. “If the hollywood is cooked guys are right maybe the hollywood is cooked guys are cooked too idk.”\n\n\tIn response to backlash over the video, he wrote: “Today’s question is: should i be killed for typing 2 lines and pressing a button.”\n\n\tOther Seedance videos circulating online include riffs on “Spider Man,” “Titanic,” “Stranger Things,” “Lord of the Rings,” “Shrek,” and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrooding Nordic noir crime thriller “The Pushover” has been bought for North America by MHZ Networks, in a deal negotiated with international distributor Reinvent Yellow Sales. \n\n\tIn an upbeat rollout, “The Pushover,” the second adaptation of a Lone Theils crime novel after hit “Fatal Crossing,” has also closed Poland (NC+) and Benelux (Lumiere Group).\n\n\tDenmark’s DR and Sweden’s TV4 pre-bought rights to the six-part “The Pushover,” part of this year’s Berlinale Series Market Selects.  \n\t\n\n\t“The Pushover” begins when a woman is found dead in her pool in Copenhagen’s upscale Danish Riviera of North Zealand. Her boyfriend, it transpires, is a notorious con man, Tom, who claims the death was an accident. “The Pushover,” like “Fatal Crossing,” features hard-driving journalist Nora Sand (Marie Sandø Jondal), who investigates Tom’s past in an attempt to prove the woman’s death is murder.          \n\n\n\t“The story feels authentic and grounded, driven by human flaws, moral ambiguity and quiet tension rather than flashy twists. It keeps you hooked until the very end, with an unpredictable conclusion you simply can’t guess in advance,” said Helene Aurø, at Reinvent Yellow.\n\n\tProduced by Shuuto Arctic for Norwegian streamer Altibox, “The Pushover” reunites “Fatal Crossing” scribes Arne Berggren and Kristine Berg and helmer Magnus Berggren.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA GoFundMe campaign for James Van Der Beek’s family has raised $2 million after his death at 48.\n\n\tVan Der Beek, who starred as Dawson Leery on the hit WB series “Dawson’s Creek,” died on Feb. 11 following a battle with colorectal cancer. Shortly after the news broke, friends launched a GoFundMe to support his wife, Kimberly Van Der Beek, and their six children.\n\n\t“In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James’s medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,” the message on the GoFundMe reads. “They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time. The support of friends, family, and the wider community will make a world of difference as they navigate the road ahead.”\n\t\n\n\tThe friends who created the page thanked fans on Feb. 12 for their donations, saying, “Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for showing up for James and his beautiful family. Your kindness has meant more than we can put into words. In the middle of deep grief, your support has been a light. It reminds us that love is real, that community is strong, and that James’s spirit continues to bring people together.”\n\n\tThey added that the family is spending time together to mourn and asked for privacy. “Your respect and understanding will give them the room they need to heal,” the statement continues. “Please continue to keep James’s wife and loved ones in your thoughts and prayers. Thank you for honoring his life with compassion, generosity, and love.”\n\t\n\n\tVan Der Beek was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2023 and publicly shared his diagnosis the following year. In 2025, he partnered with Propstore to auction memorabilia from “Dawson’s Creek” to help cover the costs of his treatment. He later expanded the effort by selling jerseys from the 1999 film “Varsity Blues,” raising funds for his own medical costs and to help other “families walking the same path.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has described its recently released “The Pete Davidson Show” as a “video podcast” — and now SAG-AFTRA has signed an agreement with the streamer that covers the production as such.\n\n\tThe talk show hosted by the “Saturday Night Live” alum, which debuted Jan. 30 on Netflix, sort of looks like a TV show. For one thing, it’s available exclusively on Netflix, not widely distributed on major audio platforms like Apple Podcasts or Spotify as is typical for podcasts.\n\t\n\n\tAfter the Davidson show was announced, SAG-AFTRA reached out to Netflix to discuss whether the project should be treated as a TV show or a podcast. On Thursday, the actors union announced that it struck a podcast agreement. \n\n\n\t“SAG-AFTRA and Netflix have executed a podcast agreement covering ‘The Pete Davidson Show,'” a rep for the union said in a statement to Variety.\n\n\tThe news comes as SAG-AFTRA on Monday (Feb. 9) commenced a round of bargaining on a new overall agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), of which Netflix is a member.\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA didn’t disclose the terms of the podcast agreement with Netflix for the Davidson show. But typically the union’s podcast agreements have less stringent requirements than TV agreements do. Whereas TV contracts require payment of residuals, podcast contracts generally do not. In addition, TV contracts have relatively strict rules regarding a production’s safety protocols, working hours, breaks and travel, which are often simplified in podcast agreements.\n\n\tAccording to its FAQ on podcast contracts, the union says, “SAG-AFTRA negotiates term Podcast Agreements with podcast companies that have minimum rates and specific terms that may be different from our promulgated agreements. We also have contracts and relationships with broadcast shops and audiobook companies that produce podcasts.”\n\t\n\n\tOn “The Pete Davidson Show,” the comedian sits down “with his famous friends for revealing conversations from the comfort of his garage,” Netflix says. The guests on the first two episodes of the show are Machine Gun Kelly (MGK) and Charlamagne Tha God.\n\n\tThe podcast is produced by Above Average president Marc Lieberman and Ayala Cohen (former head of  talent at “SNL”). Sarah Brennan Kolb directs. Separately, Davidson has made two comedy specials for Netflix: 2020’s “Alive From New York” and 2024’s “Turbo Fonzarelli.”\n\n\tNetflix also has an original video podcast hosted by former NFL star Michael Irvin called “The White House,” featuring sports analysis from a rotating roster of co-hosts including former pro football wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Currently SAG-AFTRA and Netflix do not have a podcast agreement covering this show.\n",

In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack,” the Phoenix bureau of the FBI posted on X. \n\t\n\n\tThe bureau has received over 13,000 tips since Savannah Guthrie‘s mother was reported missing on Feb. 1, and it said the description might help narrow down the tips. \n\n\n\tThe description was obtained from a forensic analysis of the Ring camera video from Guthrie’s front door . On Tuesday, the FBI released the first images taken from the Ring camera, which showed a masked man with a backpack who was armed with a gun. The video appeared to be captured just before the camera was disabled. \n\nToday, the FBI is increasing its reward up to $100,000 for information leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.New identifying details about the suspect in the kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie have been… pic.twitter.com/GJcx4ra6wX— FBI Phoenix (@FBIPhoenix) February 12, 2026\n\n\n\tNancy Guthrie was reported missing on Feb. 1, and the Pima County Sheriff’s Department declared her disappearance a crime on Feb. 2. Sheriff Chris Nanos said that he believed Nancy Guthrie did not leave her house “on her own” after investigators found “concerning” evidence at her Arizona residence.\n\n\tAlso on Tuesday, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department told ABC News that a person had been detained for questioning in connection with the case and that authorities were preparing a search of a location in relation to the detainee. However, that person was later released. \n\t\n\n\tPatel wrote with the release of the photos, “Working with our partners – as of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie’s front door the morning of her disappearance.”\n\n\tSavannah Guthrie on Monday posted a video to her Instagram begging for the public’s help in recovering her mother. \n\n\t“We believe our mom is still out there,” Savannah Guthrie said in the video. “We need your help. Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home — trying to find her. She was taken and we don’t know where. And we need your help.”\n\n\tShe continued, “So I’m coming on just to ask you not just for your prayers, but no matter where you are — even if you’re far from Tucson. If you see anything, if you hear anything, if there’s anything at all that seems strange to you — that you report to law enforcement. We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help.”\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          Multiple sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ ... producers currently have no plans to replace Jill on the E! series after she was fired this week over her controversial statements about Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime performance, which many people found to be racist.\n      \n    \n      \n      Jill Zarin’s review of Bad Bunny’s #SuperBowl Halftime Show… 🥴 pic.twitter.com/XH8f0HjQpI— Gibson Johns (@gibsonoma) February 9, 2026\n              @gibsonoma\n          \n  \n    \n          We're told the show's producers feel the remaining women are more than capable of carrying the show and don't need anyone else to take over Jill's spot.\n      \n    \n          Our sources also tell us fans could still see familiar faces from past RHONY seasons because there's chatter about cameos during filming. Speaking of former cast members, Dorinda Medley has just joined the reunion show ... but not as a full-time cast member, as of now.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we reported, Blink49 Studios cut ties with Jill on Tuesday after she posted and then deleted an Instagram video on Sunday criticizing Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show. The clip, later reposted on X, sparked backlash and ultimately led to her termination from the E! project.\n      \n    \n          Sources close to Jill told us she believes she was punished for expressing an opinion, especially when other Housewives have weathered controversies without losing their roles. Our sources tell us she quickly deleted the video after realizing she misspoke and, after rewatching the performance, came to better understand its cultural significance.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to reps for E! ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jill Zarin\n              \n                          \n                Bad Bunny\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Real Housewives\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

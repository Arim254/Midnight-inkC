    "body": "\n\tIce-T recently told “The Breakfast Club” (via Entertainment Weekly) why he swapped the lyrics from his 1992 track “Cop Killer” to “ICE Killer” during a live performance. The Grammy winner explained that when he first did it during a Los Angeles show in July, it wasn’t a premeditated change.\n\n\t“I have political things I think about,” Ice-T said. “Now when I did that, that didn’t happen just recently. It happened when we played in L.A. at the Warped Tour. When I was there, ICE was active out there. So it’s like, I’m in the midst of ICE raids and stuff like that, and I’m in front of an L.A. audience, and it just came out. I didn’t know I was gonna do it.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “My brain just said, ‘Do “ICE Killer.”‘ And it went over.”\n\n\tTensions with ICE have been at an all-time high in the U.S. following the killing of two American citizens at the hands of federal agents: Minnesota residents Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Ice-T maintained that whether he says “Cop Killer” or “ICE Killer,” the message is the same. He said of the song’s purpose, “I’m just protesting.”\n\n\t“I think we’re headed to some really ugly terrain,” he said. “And Black people really ain’t got nothing to do with it. It’s bad. I think the moment somebody shoots an ICE agent, it’s gonna get bad.”\n\n\tDespite protesting with his music, Ice-T said the only ones who should have any authority on social issues are the people “that really carry it with them daily.”\n\n\t“If that’s who you are. If it’s not, don’t do it for publicity. Don’t do it for hype,” he said. “Don’t let your publicist tell you, ‘Speak on this topic.’ Because if you’re not educated enough to speak on it, you’re going to end up caught out there.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKid Rock gave an impassioned testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee earlier today, addressing the ongoing issues plaguing the ticketing industry and the unfair practices employed at the expense of both artists and fans.\n\n\tIn his five-minute speech at the hearing, titled “Fees Rolled on All Summer Long: Examining the Live Entertainment Industry,” the musician outlined how the ticketing industry has evolved on the promise of lowering costs and benefitting all areas of live entertainment, but has in turn become an industry plagued with “fraud and abuse.”\n\t\n\n\tRock, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, explained earlier today that he was in a “unique position” to testify before Congress because “unlike most of my peers, I am beholden to no one — no record companies, no managers, no corporate endorsements or deals. To put it plainly, I ain’t scared to speak out on these issues like many artists, managers and agents are for fear of biting the hand that feeds them.”\n\n\n\tHe referred to Pearl Jam’s testimony in 1994 against Ticketmaster having a monopoly over the ticketing business, and turned his attention to Live Nation and Ticketmaster’s merger that led to the formation of Live Nation Entertainment in 2010.\n\n\t“In 2009, Congress was told under oath that merging Live Nation and Ticketmaster would benefit artists and fans,” said Rock. “The CEO of Live Nation called the merger an experiment, and promised it would increase competition and lower costs.” He continued, “Needless to say, that experiment has failed miserably. Independent venues have been crushed. Artists have lost leverage. Fans are paying more than ever, and getting blamed for it. Should Ticketmaster and Live Nation be broken up? Probably. Would that alone fix things? Not sure it would. But I am sure of this: no artist should be forced to sell their tickets without a say in who sells them and how they are sold.”\n\t\n\n\t“It’s no secret,” he said, “that this industry is full of greedy snakes and scoundrels. Too many suits lining their pockets over talent they never had and fans they mislead. The truth is, much of this could have been or still could be solved through technology, especially proof of humanity tools. It hasn’t happened yet because there’s just too much money in the secondary ticket market. Ticketing companies didn’t fail to stop this; seems they chose not to.”\n\n\tRock implored Congress to subpoena the contracts throughout the industry and said that they would find “mountains of fraud and abuse.” He concluded by offering various solutions to the issues, including artists controlling who sells their tickets and how; resale ticket price caps; and outlawing speculative ticketing. “This wasn’t an experiment,” he said. “It was a monopoly dressed up as innovation. So I’ll close now with the words of one of my favorite rock bands, the Who, and say it is my sincere hope we won’t get fooled again.”\n\n\tRock has made fixing the ticketing industry a priority in his career, meeting with Donald Trump in March 2025 as the President signed an executive order intended to protect fans by cracking down on exploitative ticket scalping.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaking a breather from the imperiling of Gerard Butler — their latest collaboration “Greenland 2: Migration” opened just three weeks ago — director Ric Roman Waugh puts Jason Statham through a similar action wringer in “Shelter.” This mix of espionage intrigue, shoot-outs and rather rote sentimentality has the star as a recluse revealed as a fugitive, who then must flee an army of deadly pursuers while protecting a teenaged innocent (Bodhi Rae Breathnach from “Hamnet”). None of these elements feel very fresh, least of all in Ward Parry’s formulaic screenplay. But they’re executed with sufficient slick professionalism to make for a passable if unmemorable diversion. \n\t\n\n\tA man we eventually learn is called Mason (Statham) lives alone on an otherwise uninhabited small island in the Outer Hebrides off Scotland’s west coast. His presence is a mystery; the lighthouse one initially assumes he maintains has been inoperable for years. All he seems to do is drink, play chess with himself, and accept weekly deliveries of supplies (mostly booze) from the owner of a fishing trawler (Michael Shaeffer) and his orphaned niece Jessie (Breathnach). She grows irked that this surly, stand-offish stranger refuses any overture of friendliness. Yet they’re thrown together soon enough, when she and her uncle get caught in a storm. Mason has to rescue the girl, then tell her that her only remaining relative has drowned. At first she fears she is now some creep’s captive, as her host is evasive about returning to the mainland. But he has other reasons for that wariness.\n\t\n\n\tForced to visit a pharmacy himself in order to treat her wounds, Mason is spotted by the pervasive hidden spyware that’s just gotten the Prime Minister (Harriet Walter) and current MI6 chief Manafort (Bill Nighy) in hot water with Parliament. To quell that scandal around governmental invasion of public privacy, Manafort agrees to “retire.” Nonetheless, he orders a full assault team to track and exterminate this newly-found “most wanted” criminal, a purported international terrorist. Heavy armed hordes sporting night-vision gear invade the island — only to find it booby-trapped, their prey quite capable of dispatching the lot single-handedly. However, surviving that immediate crisis only means Mason must flee with the now equally-imperiled Jessie, trying to stay one step ahead of various hunting parties.\n\n\tThey include both legit law enforcement and “rogue” units under Manafort’s direction. It doesn’t take long for two of his more principled subordinates (Naomi Ackie, Celine Buckens) to realize Mason is no terrorist, but a onetime M16 agent framed by former colleagues for the offense of refusing some particularly dastardly commands. Now of course those ex-allies want him — and anyone unlucky enough to cross his path — dead in order to keep their own past misdeeds covered up. \n\n\tThis “Bourne”-like premise, hinging on a near-unkillable protagonist whose existence incriminates corrupt state officials, doesn’t develop much intricacy in Parry’s script. Instead, it simply provides an excuse to lunge from one action setpiece to another. Everywhere man and child seek safety becomes the scene of a siege: A farmhouse, a former colleague’s (Daniel Mays) rural home, eventually a private London nightclub. \n\n\tHeavy on bullets, knives, miscellaneous household items (not excluding a nailgun) and punches thrown, these violent sequences are vigorous and stunt-filled. But they lack the conceptual or staging novelty to linger in the mind. And between melees, we’re stuck trying to believe in or care about the evolving bond between brusque loner Mason and needy adolescent Jessie, which does not benefit from pedestrian dialogue or flat character psychology. \n\n\tStatham, as ever, has scant trouble convincing us he’d be able to thwart an endless line of lethal assailants. Waugh keeps the tone sober enough to prevent that from growing ludicrous, however short on credibility this story may be in general. But the cocksure authority that makes this actor so effective an action figure does little to sell the glibly penned “parental” dynamic between leads. Breathnach, who played ill-fated Hamnet’s older sister and here resembles adolescent Saoirse Ronan, is trapped by a part that requires little more than cowering and whining. The highly capable support cast (also featuring Bryan Vigier as Manafort’s most dogged hitman) likewise can’t do much to elevate routinely conceived roles, with Nighy punching the clock as a stock villain. \n\t\n\n\tStill, “Shelter” has energy, good pacing, and solid production values…even if neither style or content achieve the distinguishing personality that might make you remember this generically-titled entertainment a week later. Irish locations stand in for some purported Scottish ones in Martin Ahlgren’s widescreen cinematography. (Closing credits thank 1970s celebrity psychic Uri Geller for “filming at Lamb Island,” the tiny land mass he owns, and has claimed hides buried ancient Egyptian treasure.) David Buckley, composer for Waugh’s last several films, contributes a score that’s functional if nondescript until it moves into thumping techno terrain for the last reel. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMatthew Lillard told Entertainment Weekly that it was “beautiful” to see fans and industry names come to his support last year after Quentin Tarantino publicly dissed him along with fellow actors Paul Dano and Owen Wilson. During a viral interview on “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast” last fall, Tarantino slammed Dano as “the weakest fucking actor in SAG” and added that “I don’t care for” Lillard or Wilson. \n\n\t“It was like living through your own wake,” Lillard said about the resulting tributes to his career on social media that were posted to combat Tarantino’s comments. “All those R.I.P. emails or tweets and Instagram posts and TikToks, all of the things we see after somebody passes are so sweet. And the reality is I just got to live through all of it firsthand — alive and kicking! I can’t imagine a more lovely reaction to what happened.”\n\t\n\n\t“It was crazy. I keep showing it to my wife to convince her that I am worthy, that people still like me,” Lillard added. “Nobody has to like me. Nobody has to like any actor out there, obviously. It’s personal preference. I am not everyone’s first choice, that is obvious, but to then have that kind of reaction was beautiful.”\n\n\tMany of Lillard’s former Hollywood collaborators used social media to champion him after Tarantino’s comments went viral. Mike Flanagan, who directed the actor in “The Life of Chuck” and cast him in the upcoming “Carrie” series reboot, called Lillard the “the goddamn greatest.” James Gunn worked with Lillard on the “Scooby Doo” movies and called him “one of my favorite guys (and actors).” George Clooney even accepted a prize from AARP earlier this year and said that he “would be honored to work with” any of the actors Tarantino dissed.\n\t\n\n\tDano similarly received widespread support from fans and industry colleagues. Speaking to Variety, Dano said “it was really nice” to see such a reaction and “I was also incredibly grateful that the world spoke up for me so I didn’t have to.”\n\n\tLillard originally weighed in on Tarantino’s comment while speaking at GalaxyCon in Columbus, Ohio. He said “who gives a shit” while also acknowledging that “it hurts your feelings. It fucking sucks. And you wouldn’t say that to Tom Cruise. You wouldn’t say that to somebody who’s a top-line actor in Hollywood.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Boys” baddie Antony Starr will next star in a scripted Netflix series titled “Breakers,” from the creator of “Somewhere Boy” and production company behind “Baby Reindeer.”\n\n\t“Breakers” follows two best friends from America who go on a backpacking trip in Australia. There, they encounter a seemingly perfect community of surfers and are drawn in by its leader, a charismatic and mysterious figure named Brando (Starr).\n\n\n\tProduction on the series has already begun in Western Australia, and filming will wrap in June. “Breakers” marks the first Netflix series to shoot in Western Australia and is supported by local tax incentives.\n\t\n\n\tPete Jackson (“The Death of Bunny Munro,” “Somewhere Boy”) is the writer on the series, which will be directed by Mary Nighy (“Say Nothing,” “Industry”) and Ng Choon Ping (“What It Feels Like For A Girl,” “Femme”).\n\n\tThe show is produced by the BBC Studios-owned Clerkenwell Films, which was behind “Baby Reindeer” and “The End Of The F***ing World.” The show is produced in partnership with BBC Studios Productions Australia. Executive producers are Gavin O’Grady, Petra Fried, Wim De Greef and Jackson.\n\n\tStarr is coming off a five season run on Amazon Prime Video’s “The Boys,” which will air its final season in April. He recently wrapped production on Neon’s “Samo Lives,” in which he will play Andy Warhol. His other credits include Netflix’s “Banshee,” Amazon’s “G20,” “Cobweb” and “American Gothic.” He also recently cameoed on Apple TV’s Seth Rogen comedy “The Studio,” playing a fictionalized version of himself.\n\n\tDeadline broke the news.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Will Poulter’s agents sent him the script for “Union County” and writer-director Adam Meeks’ accompanying 2020 short film, he was struck by the filmmaker’s approach to telling a recovery story.\n\n\tThe thing that set it apart from other takes on the opioid crisis, Poulter told Variety, was “the fact that it didn’t really start with a story and then a search for a place, but rather the story that was being told was a reflection of the real work that was being done.”\n\t\n\n\t“Union County” follows Poulter as Cody Parsons, a young man entering a court-ordered drug rehabilitation program in rural Ohio alongside his brother Jack (Noah Centineo). Meeks’ extended family lives in the area, and six years ago, he began developing the story after his uncle introduced him to the drug court judge, who invited him to sit in on a meeting. But what makes the filmmaker’s approach particularly unique is that the majority of his cast are nonprofessional actors; they’re real-life participants in the program, bearing their truths on camera.\n\n\t“With Adam being from the area, and them having spent so much time within the community, making it in collaboration with folks who are part of the recovery community, it just meant that it was coming from such a respectful and responsible place,” Poulter explained, sitting beside the filmmaker for Variety’s “Anatomy of a Film: Union County” conversation at Sundance. “I felt very lucky to be the outsider coming in and being trusted with a part in it.”\n\n\tThe ultimate insider of this story is Annette Deao, who has worked as a therapist in the adult recovery court for more than 20 years.\n\t\n\n\t“Annette is the heart and soul of this program and of recovery efforts in Ohio, and so the whole short film that became the feature was really born of our friendship,” Meeks said.\n\n\tIn the short, Deao played a counselor named “Debbie.” She had two scenes. “After we shot the second scene, I went up to you, and I was like, ‘I knew you’d be good, but I didn’t know you’d be this good,’” Meeks recalled. “And you said, ‘Oh, I didn’t tell you? I studied acting for four years before I ran this drug court program.’”\n\n\tThe crowd assembled at the Adobe House on Main Street laughed as Deao chimed in: “It was really the standing joke. My undergraduate [degree] was in theater and music, and then I went back to school to become a therapist, thinking I would become a music therapist at some point. But, you know, it led somewhere else.”\n\n\tThrough his own laughter, Meeks added: “Needless to say, I wrote a much larger role for her in the feature.”\n\n\tAs for how he developed “Union County’s” hybrid narrative, Meeks said that he’d always been interested in “ways that we can break down these dividing lines between fiction and nonfiction.”\n\n\tHe explained: “It was also important to fictionalize the core narrative, both as a way to get to a certain kind of intimacy of storytelling and a character portrait, but also to allow us as filmmakers to observe the difficult moments and the kind of treacherous nature and do it without imposing that on somebody who’s going through recovery. It’s an extremely difficult, long process that doesn’t need a camera crew alongside it.”\n\n\tAs the project evolved from the short film to the feature, the crew focused on building relationships with the people of Bellefontaine, Ohio (pronounced Bell Fountain).\n\n\t“Between the short, and scout trips and research trips, we’ve been hanging around your world for so long that by the time it came to making the film, there was just a lot of comfort and a lot of trust there,” cinematographer Stefan Weinberger said. “We felt like we could blend in a bit with the scenery in the drug court, and people were just incredibly open and honest with their stories. That was such a beautiful privilege for us to be able to witness and to film.”\n\n\tTo play the role, Poulter had to drop his British accent and master a Midwest drawl. To do so, he worked with dialect coach Sonja Field and studied documentary footage the team had shot of the locals. Most helpful, though, was the time Poulter spent in Ohio getting to know the community at large.\n\t\n\n\t“The year prior [to filming], we went out and spent some time, and that I was important to fortify the trust and the relationships that you see on screen, and in terms of getting a sense of how folks speak,” Poulter said. “It’s one of the friendliest places you could possibly imagine. That was quite shocking as a Londoner, people being nice to you in the street.”\n\n\tPoulter would stick to the Midwest accent between takes, and he got so good, Meeks said, that he’d often forget the actor was British.\n\n\t“There were so many moments — and I, hopefully, only expressed them out loud a few times — where, at the end of a week or at the end of a day, I’d be like, ‘Why is Will talking in a British accent?’” Meeks said, laughing.\n\n\tEditor and producer Sean Weiner added: “I remember on Fridays at the end of the shoot, we would hear, ‘Wrap for the day,’ and the crew would yell out like, ‘Will’s British again!’”\n\n\tPoulter and Centineo also shed a considerable amount of weight to portray young men coming out of the throes of addiction. But fasting grows tiresome and lonely, and they’d grown close to Deao. So, one day, the actors reached out to ask if they could come hang out.\n\n\t“We live in an about 200-year-old bank barn that’s renovated into a house, so we have about 18 acres and some gardening and some animals,” Deao said, recounting the conversation. “My husband said, ‘Well, we have some mulch to lay…’ And they’re like, ‘We’re in!’ So, they come out to the farm, and they’re throwing mulch for us; we’re grilling on the barbecue, having a great time. But we invited the whole crew out — we have a lot of space — and we did a tie-dye party.”\n\n\tBehind the scenes, the indie film production was a well-oiled machine, but it also felt like a family. \n\n\t“We broke bread together; we laughed together; we threw mulch together,” Deao said, as her fellow panelists doubled over laughing at the memories. “It was beautiful. And I don’t think that Noah had ever seen a cow.”\n\n\tWatch the full interview above to learn more about the cast and crew’s special bond, commemorated by a flock of chickens living on Deao’s farm.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Lincoln Lawyer” fans certainly will not object to this news. The popular Netflix legal drama has been renewed for Season 5 at Netflix ahead of the launch of the show’s fourth season. \n\n\tSeason 4 of “The Lincoln Lawyer” will debut on Feb. 5 and is based on the Michael Connelly novel “The Law of Innocence.” The fifth season will be based on the novel “Resurrection Walk” and will consist of 10 episodes. \n\n\n\t“We’re so excited to share the upcoming fourth season with the audience on February 5th, and even more excited to share the news that we’re already hard at work on the next one,” said co-showrunners Ted Humphrey and Dailyn Rodriguez. “Season Four is the most challenging and intensely personal journey we’ve taken Mickey Haller on yet, and we’re thrilled and grateful to be able to continue the ride in Season Five!”\n\t\n\n\tThe official logline for Season 4 states, “Mickey Haller (Manuel Garcia Rulfo) faces his toughest case yet as he and his team work tirelessly to prove his innocence in the murder of a former client, Sam Scales. To clear his name, they must unravel Sam’s final scam, forcing them to go head-to-head with the DA’s office, the FBI, and ghosts from Mickey’s own past.”\n\n\tAlong with Garcia Rulfo, the cast of Season 4 includes Neve Campbell, Becki Newton, Jazz Raycole, Angus Sampson and Cobie Smulders.\n\n\tDavid E. Kelley created “The Lincoln Lawyer” for television and serves as executive producer. Humphrey developed the show and serves as executive producer and co-showrunner alongside Rodriguez. Connelly, Ross Fineman, Barry Jossen, Tana Jamieson and Matthew J Lieberman also serve as executive producers. A+E Studios produces.\n\t\n\n\tPer Netflix, “The Lincoln Lawyer” has pulled 171 million views across its three seasons to date, with a view defined as total hours viewed divided by total runtime. The show has also collectively spent 26 weeks in the Netflix global top 10 chart. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to explore creating a $5 million subsidy for microdramas, the short-form vertical videos enjoying a surge in popularity.\n\n\tThe council voted 14-0 to direct city staff to come up with public or private funding sources to support microdrama production.\n\n\t“Many of these productions do not fit the needed requirements to qualify for state tax credits,” said Councilman Bob Blumenfield, who authored the motion. “This is a problem that we need to fix.”\n\t\n\n\tBlumenfield got the idea from his brother Jay, a TV veteran who recently produced the microdramas “Her Heart, Held Hostage” and “Hired to Obey” for the MyDrama platform. In an interview, Jay Blumenfield said that the genre has offered a ray of hope.\n\n\n\t“I do believe it’s one way that we can bring back the creative middle class in this town,” he said. “I think that’s been completely hollowed out by mergers and moguls and stupidity.”\n\n\tBut he said that tiny microdrama budgets — about $200,000 apiece — make it difficult to shoot in Los Angeles.\n\n\t“If we can get $20,000, $30,000 extra, that’s the difference between being able to do it here or not,” he said.\n\n\tCalifornia expanded its tax incentive from $330 million to $750 million last year. But projects must have a budget of at least $1 million to qualify. In Georgia, the minimum spend is $500,000 and producers can use multiple projects to meet that threshold.\n\n\tMicrodramas are generally non-union. They started in China, and many of the companies that make them are based there. Bob Blumenfield argued that Los Angeles should establish itself as a global hub for such productions.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s pretty new here, but there’s a lot of American players getting in,” Jay Blumenfield said. “I still think a lot of the Chinese companies and foreign companies want to shoot here. They like the American creatives and actors and all that.”\n\n\tBob Blumenfield’s proposal calls on the city to explore reducing permit fees and to look into creating a “micro-budget concierge” that would provide a three-day permit approval process.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 14, Episode 4 of “The Masked Singer,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Night,” which aired Jan. 28 on Fox.\n\n\tC",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 14, Episode 4 of “The Masked Singer,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Night,” which aired Jan. 28 on Fox.\n\n\tCowabunga, dude. “The Masked Singer” sent home its latest notable on Wednesday during “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Night.” Unmasked on the episode was comedian Claudia Oshry, from the popular Instagram account @GirlWithNoJob and podcast “The Toast.”\n\n\n\tOshry ended her run as Queen Corgi, after performing “Unstoppable,” by Sia on this week’s episode. (She had previously performed “Don’t Rain on My Parade,” by Barbara Streisand, in the Season 14 premiere episode.) But instead of being eliminated, Oshry/Queen Corgi announced that she was stepping down from the competition.\n\t\n\n\tOshry told Variety that she decided to bow out of the show after she realized the time commitment was impacting her role as a new mother. “I moved my whole family out there,” she said. “I had a four-month-old at the time. I was breastfeeding exclusively. I was pumping in the trailer, and it really started to take its toll. I was spending a lot of time away from my baby. That’s just not what I thought it was going to be. I was having so much fun, but I was so conflicted between continuing on and, obviously winning, and being at home with my baby. Ultimately, I decided that after some my performances, this has fulfilled a dream. This has checked the box. I’ve sung on national TV, I did what I came here to do. And so that’s when I was like, ‘You know what, I think I can go out, let somebody else win.’ And go out gracefully.”\n\t\n\n\tGiven the unusual end to the episode, there wasn’t even a final guess from panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg, Ken Jeong and Rita Ora. Earlier, Jeong thought it was Amy Schumer, Ora guessed Ali Wong, and Thicke went with Whitney Cummings.\n\n\tOshry said she informed the producers about her desire to exit early — but that the panelists were not informed. “I can say everyone was so supportive, pretty much,” she said. “The producers, the execs, everyone who I worked with were mostly women. One of them was even pregnant. So I felt like I was chatting with people who understood, and they were really eager to make me comfortable. They told me that this was an option. And I was like, You know what? I think that would work for me. I think it would work for the show. I didn’t want to be super disruptive to the flow of the show, because they know how it works. But I also just wanted to prioritize my experience and myself. I feel like we came to a really good place of it. And I think it ended kind of storybook.”\n\n\tThis reps the second time that a “Masked Singer” decided to unmask rather than wait to be eliminated; in Season 4, Mickey Rourke decided to take off his costume on his own after a performance.\n\n\tCelebrating the 40th anniversary of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” the night opened with Jeong singing along to the franchise’s theme song — which means, coincidentally, that songwriter Chuck Lorre will now be getting a check from the show.\n\n\tGalaxy Girl, Stingray, Cat Witch and 14 Karat Carrot join Pugcasso, Snow Cone and Crane in moving on to the next round. Still waiting their turn: High Voltage, Calla Lily, Owl and Eggplant.\n\n\tClaudia Oshry (Queen Corgi) joins Taraji P. Henson (Scarab), Tone Loc (Handyman), Tiffany Haddish (Le Who Who), Todd and Julie Chrisley (Croissants) and David “Big Papi” Ortiz (Googly Eyes) as the celebrities unmasked so far on “The Masked Singer” Season 14.\n\n\tBack for Season 14 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists McCarthy Wahlberg, Jeong, Ora and Thicke.\n\n\tNew this season is “America’s Insider,” in which singer, dancer and social media personality Kylie Cantrall will share behind-the-scenes hints and clues for viewers. The twist: Cantrall is in costume as Cat Witch, but will only unmask for viewers — so the audience knows who she is, but the panelists don’t.\n\t\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” Season 14 themed episodes include a tribute to “Star Trek,” the ‘90s comedy “Clueless,” the comic franchise “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and the blockbuster “Twilight Saga” films. Also Fox’s new “Fear Factor” reboot will feature host Johnny Knoxville in a “Fear Factor: House of Fear Night,” and an “Ozzfest Night” honors late rocker Ozzy Osbourne, including a special tribute by “Masked Singer” alum Kelly Osbourne (Season 2’s Ladybug) saluting her father’s musical influence.\n\n\tThe 18 Masked contestants in Season 14 include Eggplant, Pugcasso, Queen Corgi, the Croissants, Owl, 14 Karat Carrot, Snow Cone, Galaxy Girl, High Voltage, Googly Eyes, Scarab, Handyman, Crane, Le Who Who, Pangolin, Stingray, Cat Witch and Calla Lily.\n\n\tPer the show, the Season 14 contestants have sold a combined 94 million records, received 47 Teen Choice Award nominations, 12 Emmy nominations, two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one Tony Award win and one Academy Award nomination.\n\n\tHere were the performances on Wednesday’s two-hour premiere episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCat Witch, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCat Witch\t\n\n\tSong: “Teenage Dream,” by Katy Perry\n\n\tPrevious song: “Abracadabra,” by Lady Gaga\n\n\tClue: Pocket watch that says 10:10. “With limited time in the business, I’ve starred in some incredible films and movies. In fact, I think some of you have watched them.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Victoria Justice, Ashley Tisdale, Lisa from Blackpink\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Charli D’Amelio, Addison Rae, Lisa from Blackpink\n\n\tCat Witch voiceover: “One of the coolest thing about the Ninja Turtles has always been collecting the action figures. It was a first question I asked when I became a star: Am I going to be a toy? The first time I saw it at Walmart, I freaked out. And to my surprise, they couldn’t keep them on the shelves. But the coolest part? Knowing it’s probably the first action figure that some kids will ever get. That’s a dream come true. See you in the toy box.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStingray, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tStingray\t\n\n\tSong: “Momma Song,” by Benson Boone\n\n\tPrevious song: “Stayin’ Alive,” by Bee Gees\n\n\tClue: Sushi. “Owning restaurants is just one part of my empire.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Jaden Smith, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Donald Glover\n\t\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Lenny Kravitz, Jaden Smith, Lil Romeo\n\n\tStingray voiceover: “When you’re swimming with the sharks in Hollywood, it’s easy to get swept away in the currents of fame. But I had a secret weapon: I had an oracle in my home. I go them for all my advice. Relationships, career. She’s literally changed the world. Certainly changed mine. She’s my mom. Life moves fast, and we don’t always get the chance to say it. So let me tell you right now: Mom, thank you for all your advice, for holding my hand, making room for me in your bed when I was scared. I love you.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGalaxy Girl, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGalaxy Girl\t\n\n\tSong: “Just A Girl,” by No Doubt\n\n\tPrevious song: “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl,” by Chappell Roan\n\n\tClue: Jingle bells. “Holidays are definitely an important time in my career. I love the holidays and the cheer.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Dixie D’Amelio, Anne Hathaway, Hillary Duff\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Lindsay Lohan, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Emma Stone\n\n\tGalaxy Girl voiceover: “I know first-hand, when you spend your life in front of cameras, people try to control your every move. Especially as a woman. They try to tell you what to wear, how to talk, your whole image. But I am not here for all of that. The night before one of the biggest shoots of my life, I changed my whole look. And I didn’t tell anybody. The next day, when they saw what I had done, everyone panicked. But they don’t know what’s best for me. I do. And I was right, the shoot went global. Oh, and my look? Iconic.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQueen Corgi, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSong: “Unstoppable,” by Sia\n\n\tPrevious song: “Don’t Rain on My Parade,” by Barbra Streisand\n\n\tClue: Avocado toast. “I wouldn’t be anything without my morning toast.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Amy Schumer, Ali Wong, Whitney Cummings\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Nikki Blonsky, Maya Rudolph, Aidy Bryant\n\n\tQueen Corgi voiceover: “Comin at cha from New York, it’s the Call Me Corgi podcast. Queen Corgi, great to have you on the podcast.” “Thank you, it’s so great to be back in my hometown. I used to waddle past Madison Square Garden dreaming that it would be my name in lights one day. That’s for Lady Gaga, not me. But I look better in a meat gown than Lady Gaga. But when I finally got a chance to headline my first tour, you know I saved the best for last. Madison Square Garden. And guess what, I sold out. As a new mom, I want my baby to know that no dream is too big.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t14 Karat Carrot, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWild Card: 14 Karat Carrot\t\n\n\tSong: “Hold On, I’m Comin,” by Sam and Dave\n\n\tClue: Five 24K carrot. “I made a few bad judgements when I was younger. But now I’m living the golden life.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Al Green, Otis Williams of the Temptations, Morgan Freeman, Verdine White\n\n\t14 Karat Carrot voiceover: “Being a wild card is a little bit out of my comfort zone. Because I play by the rules. But it wasn’t always that way. I used to be trouble. I ended up hitting rock bottom. I got locked away. With no promise of a golden future. I was letting my family down. And that was no way to live. So I cleaned up my act. I guess deep down, I was always a good guy. Justice really is the balance between carrot and the stick.”\n\n\tPast “The Masked Singer” winners include T-Pain as Monster (Season 1), Wayne Brady as Fox (Season 2), Kandi Burruss as Night Angel (Season 3), LeAnn Rimes as Sun (Season 4), Nick Lachey as Piglet (Season 5), Jewel as Queen of Hearts (Season 6), Teyana Taylor as Firefly (Season 7), Amber Riley as Harp (Season 8), Bishop Briggs as Medusa (Season 9), Ne-Yo as Cow (Season 10), Vanessa Hudgens as Goldfish (Season 11), Boyz II Men as Buffalos (Season 12) and Gretchen Wilson as Pearl (Season 13).\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment. Rosie Seitchik, Craig Plestis and Cannon are executive producers, while Seitchik serves as showrunner. The series is based on the South Korean format created by Mun Hwa Broadcasting Corp.\n",

Pretti's wearing a remarkably similar outfit to the one he wore 11 days later when he was shot.\n      \n    \n        Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n      \n    \n          The clip starts with Pretti yelling and appearing to spit on the vehicle as federal officers are driving away from the area ... before he brings his foot up and kicks and shatters the rear right tail light, leaving it hanging by cords.\n      \n\n          Agents jump out of the SUV and chase Pretti down ... slamming him to the ground while a crowd gathers around them and screams at the agents.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Inexplicably, after the tense altercation ends and Pretti's able to get back to his feet, agents just let him go ... leaving him on the street corner despite the damage he's done to the vehicle.\n      \n    \n          A rep for the Pretti family tells TMZ ... they knew about the incident on January 13. The rep says Alex sustained injuries but did not get medical care.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As Pretti pulls away from the agents, you can see the butt of a handgun in the rear waistband of his pants -- just as it was during his fatal encounter with the feds.\n      \n    \n          Steve Schleicher, the attorney for the Pretti family tells TMZ ... \"A week before Alex was gunned down in the street -- despite posing no threat to anyone -- he was violently assaulted by a group of ICE agents. Nothing that happened a full week before could possibly have justified Alex’s killing at the hands of ICE on Jan 24.\"\n      \n    \n          As we've reported ... 11 days after that initial clash, feds again wrestled Pretti to the ground on a city street ... and a Border Patrol agent and a Customs and Border Protection officer fired a series of shots at Pretti. He died at the scene.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Protests have exploded all over Minnesota and the rest of the country in the days after the killing. Trump administration officials have already publicly labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n      \n    \n          The Department of Homeland Security tells TMZ ... HSI is reviewing this footage.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Alex Pretti\n              \n                          \n                ICE\n              \n                          \n                Insane Videos\n              \n                          \n                Shootings\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

In the essay, she says the next morning she woke up in a pool of blood.\n      \n    \n          \"It hurt to walk. It hurt to sit. It hurt to remember,\" she writes.\n      \n    \n          But later, Brooke says she actually initiated a subsequent sexual encounter, thinking it would help her take back control.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Tragically, Brooke writes, her plan completely backfired ... \"I just implicated myself in my own abuse.\"\n      \n    \n          According to Brooke, it was her \"preexisting relationship\" with Matt that made it difficult for her to frame it as abuse at first.\n      \n    \n          She writes, \"Even now, I hear 'rape' and think of masked strangers in dark alleys. Back then, I had no idea what to call what happened other than weird and humiliating.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As you know ... Brooke's complaint led to Matt's firing from NBC. He denied the accusation, saying all their encounters were consensual. In the aftermath, several other women came out with their own allegations against Matt. His wife of 19 years, Annette Roque, later filed for divorce.\n      \n    \n          When TMZ reached out to Matt by phone for comment, he said he was at dinner and hung up.\n      \n      ",

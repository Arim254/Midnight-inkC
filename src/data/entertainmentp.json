    "body": "\n\t“Dhurandhar,” the Ranveer Singh-led espionage thriller about an Indian undercover operative infiltrating Karachi’s criminal underworld, has landed at No. 1 on Netflix’s global Top 10 non-English films list – and is also No. 1 in both India and Pakistan, a streaming outcome that cuts straight through the region’s long-frozen theatrical politics.\n\n\tOn Netflix’s Tudum weekly chart (Jan. 26-Feb. 1), “Dhurandhar” ranked No. 1 worldwide among non-English films with 7.6 million views. The chart shows the film sitting at No. 1 in India and No. 1 in Pakistan in Netflix’s Top 10 Movies lists. The title is also riding high across South Asia, including chart-topping or near-the-top placement in markets such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, reinforcing the film’s regional pull beyond its home base.\n\t\n\n\tThe Pakistan result lands with extra charge because Indian films have been shut out of Pakistani cinemas for years, a situation that intensified in recent years after both countries moved to block each other’s titles theatrically amid renewed bilateral tensions. In other words, a film designed around India’s intelligence footprint inside Pakistan – the kind of premise that would typically be dead on arrival theatrically across the border – is now reaching Pakistani audiences at scale through Netflix’s frictionless pipeline.\n\n\n\tAnd it isn’t only South Asia. The film is also charting strongly in parts of the Middle East, where India-Pakistan political sensitivities can make theatrical releases for this kind of material complicated or commercially risky – leaving streaming as the cleaner route to audiences in expatriate-heavy territories.\n\t\n\n\tAditya Dhar directed the film, with Jio Studios and B62 Studios producing. Singh leads the cast, with Akshaye Khanna playing the antagonist. The cast also includes Sanjay Dutt, R. Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, Sara Arjun, Rakesh Bedi, Manav Gohil, Danish Pandor, Saumya Tandon, Gaurav Gera and Naveen Kaushik.\n\n\t“Dhurandhar” is told in two parts, with the first installment following a decade-long Indian intelligence operation where an undercover agent (Singh) infiltrates Karachi’s criminal and political underworld. “Dhurandhar: The Revenge,” releasing theatrically March 19, is expected to continue the saga and also provide Singh’s character’s backstory. \n\n\tThe first part of the saga has become the highest-grossing Hindi-language film in India. It has collected $116 million locally and $32 million internationally. \n\n\tIndia and Pakistan have fought four wars since Partition in 1947 — in 1947–48, 1965, 1971 and 1999 — with the territory of Kashmir remaining the central flashpoint in a relationship marked by military confrontation, diplomatic breakdowns and periodic escalations.\n",

    "body": "\n\tProducer Harman Baweja and director Arati Kadav are teaming up for a new film, marking their second collaboration following last year’s critically acclaimed drama “Mrs.”\n\n\tThe duo unveiled their reunion timed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of “Mrs.,” the Sanya Malhotra-starrer that became a cultural touchpoint for its exploration of domestic identity and gender dynamics.\n\n\t“Mrs.,” produced by Baweja’s Baweja Studios with backing from Jio Studios’ Jyoti Deshpande, earned widespread acclaim, including at Black Nights Tallinn and IFFI Goa, and collected multiple awards across major platforms. The film reimagined Jeo Baby’s Malayalam-language cult hit “The Great Indian Kitchen” through a North Indian cultural framework, incorporating traditions like Karwa Chauth while chronicling the gradual erosion of a woman’s sense of self. Baweja also served as co-writer on the project alongside Kadav.\n\t\n\n\tDetails of the new projects are under wraps at the moment.\n\n\n\t“‘Mrs.’ reaffirmed my belief audiences are ready for audacious cinema that is intimate and transformative all at once,” Baweja said. “Collaborating with Arati evoked a thrill that you get from being on the same page with someone, while also being challenged. I’m excited to have her bring honesty, intelligence, and immense emotional clarity to our fresh collaboration, which we have the pleasure of announcing on ‘Mrs’ first anniversary. When a collaboration is built on trust and shared intent, you naturally want to create again. This next project is born from that very faith, and I’m looking forward to once again pushing boundaries together.”\n\t\n\n\tKadav added: “I feel very happy, safe, inspired, and delighted to work with Harman Baweja. He and his team, including our creative producer Tasneem Lokhandwala, have always helped me do my best. As a team, we have a lot of mutual respect and faith in each other, which I feel is the foundation of a great relationship. Mrs. was a great collaboration, and it was because of the team that Baweja Studios brought together for me, including my actress Sanya Malhotra. I am actually very happy to collaborate with Harman for the rest of my life. As I said, Baweja Studios feels like home.”\n\n\tThe announcement comes as Baweja Studios maintains momentum with recent release “Haq” and an active development slate for 2026 that includes “Dil Ka Darwaza Kholo Na Darling,” “Captain India” and “Boy From Andaman,” along with several projects in development.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has settled a defamation lawsuit brought a Vanity Fair staffer who claimed that she was falsely portrayed in the Shonda Rhimes series “Inventing Anna.”\n\n\tRachel DeLoache Williams, a former friend of con artist Anna Sorokin, sued in 2022, claiming that the series gave the false impression that she had abandoned and betrayed Sorokin and depicted her as “snobbish” and “greedy.”\n\n\t“Williams and Netflix have resolved the lawsuit,” said a Netflix spokesperson and her attorney, Alexander Rufus-Isaacs, in matching statements on Friday.\n\t\n\n\tThe series was based on a New York magazine article about the fake heiress, who went by Anna Delvey and who served nearly four years in prison for fraud. \n\n\tWilliams argued that the Netflix series sought to get audiences to root for Sorokin, transforming her from a real-life villain into a more palatable anti-hero. In the process, she alleged that she was turned from a victim into Sorokin’s foil.\n\n\t“Shonda Rhimes and the others responsible for creating and writing ‘Inventing Anna’ believed that the Series needed a villain,” Williams’ lawyers wrote in a court filing. “Out of animus toward Williams, they cynically decided to portray Williams as that villain.”\n\n\tNetflix tried to throw out the lawsuit in 2024, arguing that the show’s creators had a literary license to give their interpretation of events. A federal judge in Delaware denied that motion. \n\n\tNetflix next filed a motion for summary judgment following extensive discovery. That motion was still pending when the case settled.\n\n\tRufus-Isaacs has also filed suits against Netflix on behalf of Nona Gaprindashvili, a Georgian chess champion who alleged she was disparaged in “The Queen’s Gambit”: and on behalf of Francisco “Pipin” Ferreras, who claimed that the film “No Limit” falsely implied that he had killed his wife.\n\t\n\n\tRufus-Isaacs has argued that films based on true events do not enjoy a special exemption from defamation law. While deposing Rhimes in November 2024, he asked her whether she had any rules about fictionalizing the behavior of real people.\n\n\t“We had a position on accurately portraying people based on the facts and their behavior and then fictionalizing moments that made those facts even clearer,” Rhimes said. “I feel like I wanted to capture the essence of what that person was in those moments that we were portraying, and I definitely had a rule that we would never portray a woman in a severely negative way. That’s not what we do. We create three-dimensional people.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor too long now (it’s starting to feel like 1,000 years), Dracula movies have been an industry, a monster brand unto themselves. At this point, it’s like seeing the umpteenth version of a Shakespeare warhorse or a musical like “Annie” — what is there left to discover? The saga of Dracula has become an endless rerun. And even if you don’t feel like you’ve already lived through a century’s worth of Dracula movies, and that they’ve wrung this story dry, there have been two elaborately eye-catching and overproduced recent versions — “Renfield,” in which Nicolas Cage did his thing as Dracula (the same thing he’s been doing since “Vampire’s Kiss,” in 1989), and Robert Eggers’ “Nosferatu,” in which the ratio of awesome production design to interesting drama was about seven to one. (I’d say something similar about Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” but that’s another story.)\n\t\n\n\tSo here we are again, caught up in the never-ending slow-drip flood of cinematic Dracula mythology, now with Luc Besson’s wan, derivative, dutifully time-period-hopping, different-but-not-really-new take on the vampire legend. The movie, big surprise, wants to be more “romantic” than horrific (my sarcasm descends from the fact that this is already an entire category of Dracula movie, dating back to the 1979 Frank Langella version). Come for the fangs, stay for the swoons. As the kids used to say, BFD.\n\n\n\tCaleb Landry Jones, a very good actor, starts off by playing Dracula as a shockingly direct descendant of what Gary Oldman did in the opening 45 minutes of “Bram Stoker’s Dracula.” The makeup is a total knockoff: the white hair piled in a neat bun (in this case with two long side bangs), the rotting parchment skin, the fossilized teeth, all enhanced by the winning delicacy of Jones’ performance, starting with the way he says (à la Oldman), “I am Vlad, the second prince of Volokia. Count…Dragoool.” Jones’s Dragoool suggests a fusion of Oldman, Karloff’s Mummy and the Cryptkeeper, with shades of Klaus Kinski, Willem Dafoe, Heath Ledger and a grimacing carp.\n\t\n\n\tDracula hosts Jonathan Harker (Ewens Abid) in his spired castle (it’s as huge as Notre Dame) at the foot the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. But we meet him when he’s a young prince in 1480 Eastern Europe, drawn into battle and away from his beloved wife, Elisabeta (Zoë Blue). The two are first seen cavorting in the sheets, but she soon gets slaughtered, and this causes him such anguish that he can no longer accept God’s provenance. He says to the priest, “Tell God that until he brings back my wife, my life no longer belongs to Him.” Cue a thunderclap and a statue of Jesus dripping a tear of blood.\n\n\tDanny Elfman’s score, echoing the waltz theme of “Rosemary’s Baby,” is more atmospheric than anything else in “Dracula,” which Besson has staged like a music-video director who has grown too weary for fast cutting. Once the film leaps ahead to Paris in the late 1800s, Jones appears as a dandified version of his princely self. But here, as in “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (which I always thought should have been called “Francis Ford Coppola’s Bram Stoker’s Dracula”), the lead actor is more compelling as the ancient, ethereal, elfin-demon Dracula than he is as the long-haired Lothario in a top hat speaking in a vague Transylvanian accent. “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” went to sleep during the more contemporary sections, and so goes Besson’s “Dracula,” which is basically about its title vamp trying to romance Mina, who is presented as the reincarnation of Elisabeta (Zoë Bleu plays both roles). Dracula: “Madame, it is an honor and a pleasure to see you again.” Mina: “Have we met before?” Dracula: “In a dream, perhaps. I have this strange feeling that we have known each other…for a long time.” The audience: “Zzzzzz.“\n\n\tIt’s not as if we needed to see “Dracula” remade as a blood-soaked Valentine’s Day movie. Christoph Waltz is on hand as the Van Helsing character, known simply as the Priest, and he does his tastefully understated scenery-chewing. There’s one splashingly gory sequence, when Maria (Matilda De Angelis), Dracula’s first disciple, goes demon and gets decapitated and staked-through-the-heart. The film finally returns to Dracula’s castle, where four stone gargoyles come to life, and where there is bad swordplay, schlocky cannon fire, and a fortune-cookie theological lecture from Waltz’s Priest. At the end of the movie he says, “The spell is broken.” Watching this “Dracula,” we know just what he means.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Mystery Science Theater 3000” stars Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett know a thing or two about bad movies. \n\n\tWith the news that the show is being revived for four new episodes and the veteran “MST3K” trio are returning, fans have wondered which movies they might skewer. In an interview with Variety, Nelson, Murphy, and Corbett said that they are zeroing in on just the right choices.\n\n\n\t“[Our] eyes are on films that are more like the ones that we used to do — sort of corny, nothing too absolutely current,” Murphy told Variety. “Sort of classic bad, if that makes any sense, rather than modern bad.”\n\t\n\n\tGiven that their Kickstarter campaign for the new episodes blew past its funding goal in a matter of hours, the audience’s appetite for cheesy movies (and seeing these three riff on them) is as strong as ever. Corbett calls the excitement around their return to the show “great and vindicating and exciting and a little terrifying.” But as they are celebrating the 20th anniversary of RiffTrax — largely the spiritual successor to “MST3K” — the trio has certainly not been sitting idle.\n\n\tStill, this marks their first return to “MST3K” both in front of and behind the camera since the original show signed off the Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy) back in 1999. It is also the beginning of a new era of the show since it was officially announced just a few weeks ago that original creator Joel Hodgson had sold his interest in the series to Shout! Studios parent company Radial Entertainment. \n\n\tBut fans seemingly have little to worry about, as these three are as game as ever to try to keep their sanity with the help of their robot friends. \n\t\n\n\tCheck out the full Q&A below. \n\n\tThis interview was conducted on Feb. 4. It has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n\t\tThe Kickstarter campaign has raised over $1.3 million in just two days. How does it feel to see that kind of support right out of the gate? \t\n\n\tBill Corbett: It feels great and vindicating and exciting and a little terrifying. We have to justify that now, and I think we can. But, you know, it’s been a while. \n\n\tKevin Murphy: It’s really nice that even after all this time, people still have a fondness for the show, the way we did the show. And I think that’s what we’re seeing there. \n\t\n\t\tI looked this up and the budget of the Joe Don Baker film “Mitchell” was $1.16 million, so you did a “Mitchell” in one day. \t\n\n\tMurphy: Wow, we did a “Mitchell!”\n\n\tMichael J. Nelson: We’d have to look at the dollar amount in the calculator and see are we still ahead in today’s money.\n\t\n\t\tWell, no one is ever going to be ahead of Joe Don Baker. \t\n\n\tCorbett: I wouldn’t recommend it. He’d knock you right over.\n\t\n\t\tBut seriously, when did the conversations between RiffTrax and Shout! Studios to bring back “MST3K” start?  \t\n\n\tCorbett: That was at least six months ago, but more, really, I think. Right, guys? Like maybe nine months ago, eight months ago?\n\n\tMurphy: Yeah, it was last year, I think in the spring, but in the meantime, Shout! Factory went through this merger, which sort of delayed things for a while…And they were in the middle of, as everyone learned, acquiring all the rights to the show from Joel.\n\n\tCorbett: I just want to make it clear, we are perfectly happy AARP guys. They asked us. And I think the thing that we came up with that sounds exciting also sounds risky too, like if we don’t recapture the magic, or if somebody gets a glimpse of me and goes, “Oh my god, what happened to him?!” Me specifically. But the thing that I think ameliorated it for us was we said, “Can we take a relatively small bite and do four?”\n\t\n\t\tKevin, you referenced doing the show the way you guys used to do it. What does that mean specifically? \t\n\n\tMurphy: Well, when I first heard that they might want to do this, I talked to our old DP, Jeff Stonehouse…And he said, “Oh, do it old school. We need to do this old school the way that we did it then.” He was such a wizard at doing in-camera effects. And then having all our props hand built, and not relying on any sort of digital compositing or green screen beyond what we need to do in order to make the shadow work and go through the doors, simple things like that…It really makes the thing that much more fun for us and for everyone involved, because it’s all hands on.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnd you guys are celebrating the 20th anniversary of RiffTrax this year. What sorts of things have you learned in that time that you want to bring to these new episodes of “MST3K?” \t\n\n\tNelson: Well, I would speak for Kevin here. Kevin has learned nothing in 20 years.\n\n\tMurphy: Not a damn thing. Really, one thing I know that we’ve learned to do better is to is how to riff. We’ve learned to take our time, let the movie be the straight person, and set up the jokes for us better. So we have a lot of punch lines. And I know we’ve learned to feel like dead space is not what we think it is. People aren’t yearning for us to keep doing an endless stream of jokes.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s strange to me that outside of “MST3K” and RiffTrax, not too many people have tried to take riffing to the level you all have taken it to. Why do you think that is? \t\n\n\tNelson: I think one of the reasons for that…It’s that it’s really hard to to riff the way that we do. And it’s a writing that’s not very rewarding for the average person who just wants to be a writer…This is very technical writing. I happen to enjoy it. I think everyone that works with us enjoys it and loves that outcome of it, but it is really, really difficult. And I don’t mean to say that — we’re not nuclear sub runners here or anything — but I’m just saying it’s hard. And people often go like, “This sounds like fun!” Then they do it for two minutes and they go “Wow, this is really hard.”\n\n\tCorbett: There is almost an element of masochism in writing it. I mean, I think we’ve gotten over it because we’ve gotten good at it. It’s a weird thing to be good at, but we are absolutely the specialists in the world…We are not intimidated by many movies, although some we just feel like that’s not going to be fun, or that’s one we should just pass on. We have a pretty good nose for movies that are just not going to work. And that’s most of them, really.\n\n\tNelson: We always have some people complain. They’re like, “Hey, why would you do this movie? That’s a good movie!” We’re like, “Yeah, we’ve done a lot of good movies, movies that we like,” but the commentary then would match the thing. If you sit with a good friend of yours and you’re watching a movie that you like, and then he’s riffing on it, you’d say, “Hey, man, come on.” So that’s our intent. We also enjoy this movie, and therefore the comments match it, but we’re still being funny. So that’s a challenge that I actually love.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI know you guys are going to reveal the four movies you’ll be doing over the course of the Kickstarter campaign, but what can you share about them? Are you targeting older movies like “MST3K” typically did or more modern ones? \t\n\n\tMurphy: Well, I’d say since we know that we’re revisiting “Mystery Science Theater,” the way that we knew it and loved it, that our eyes are on films that are more like the ones that we used to do — sort of corny, nothing too absolutely current. Sort of classic bad, if that makes any sense, rather than modern bad…We’re casting the net to find just the right bad for us that fits with the puppets, rather than the three of us and our voices. And there is a little bit of a difference there. “Mystery Science Theater” was always more family friendly. RiffTrax tends to be a little bit…more out there these days.\n\n\tNelson: We hate families at RiffTrax.\n\t\n\t\tThen you announced that all four episodes will be released on RiffTrax later this year. Was there any discussion about partnering with a platform like Netflix like they did for the other revival seasons? \t\n\n\tMurphy: I think we always wanted to do it ourselves, because once someone like Netflix is involved, as good as they are what they do, you’ve got more people maybe wanting to tell you what to do with it, rather than just us. We’re responsible for the success or failure of this thing ourselves, and that feels right. And to have other people –as well meaning as it might be — sticking their fingers in the pie, it’s just not something that I think any of us would be comfortable with. We like finger free pies.\n\n\tCorbett: Get out of my pie! I will also add that…we have had RiffTrax stuff go out on other platforms and the way that they pay you changes depending on what mood they’re in. And it only goes in one direction. So, we don’t want to be at the mercy of that so much either.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn a faintly misty morning in South Africa’s Kamiesberg mountain region, 79-year-old goatherd Hettie (Hettie Farmer) watches her flock as they hobble and nibble along the rough, khaki-colored landscape, and wonders for the first time if they wonder about her. Is she a mother to them, or an omnipotent ruler? She’s not inclined toward sentimentality or anthropomorphism, and she’s had enough children of her own in a long, hard-up life. But poetry colors pragmatism in the narration that runs throughout “Variations on a Theme.” Liltingly read in a characterful Afrikaans vernacular by co-director Jason Jacobs, it dips in and out of various characters’ inner dialogues in the close rural neighborhood of Kharkams, seeing the philosophical substance in unassuming lives.  \n\t\n\n\tA deserving winner of the top prize in the Tiger Competition at this year’s Rotterdam festival, “Variations on a Theme” is itself a deceptively modest affair, running just barely to feature length as it takes in the rustling environmental details and the lolling pace of most days in Hettie’s small, deprived village. But there’s political and historical heft to this elegiac, tea-stained snapshot, as directors Jacobs and Devon Delmar consider how decades of compacted racial discrimination and governmental neglect have shaped the self-sufficient routine of Hettie and many others like her. \n\n\n\tIt’s a worthy, quietly more radical follow-up to the duo’s excellent, Venice-premiered 2024 debut “Carissa,” another portrait of a marginalized Cape community of the type that tends to get little representation in South African cinema. Though that film never got the degree of festival exposure or arthouse distribution that it deserved, one hopes the Rotterdam win will go further towards putting Jacobs and Delmar emphatically on the world-cinema map — as proudly regional filmmakers with a lyrical sensibility to stand beside that of fellow Southern African auteur Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese. But there’s a warmly observational, literary quality to their work, too, lovingly attentive to language and local custom, in the spirit of such long-gone storytellers as Herman Charles Bosman and Eugène Marais.\n\t\n\n\tPer the opening credits, Jacobs and Delmar’s gently meandering script is “based on true stories,” though the tone of the exercise weaves freely between cockeyed whimsy and documentary-style portraiture — the latter impression enhanced by the casting of lively non-professionals in key roles. Some faces from “Carissa” pop up again, including that film’s scene-stealer Gladwin van Niekerk, here appearing as the village’s spendthrift hairdresser. But the film belongs to Farmer, Jacobs’ own grandmother, who gives Hettie an unfussy sturdiness of mien and spirit to counter the growing, sighing frailty of her person, and a steady, narrow stare that occasionally seems to see through time. \n\n\tWidowed for some years, Hettie has grown solemnly fond of the solitary life, though her children — who have long since departed for bigger towns, believe the time has come for her to live with them. Leaving Kharkams, where Hettie has lived her entire life, would mean leaving behind various ghosts that kept her company over the years — most notably that of her father Petrus, who settled in the village after four years spent fighting abroad in the Second World War, a time of his life he preferred never to speak about.\n\n\tA prologue, accompanied by stirring archival footage, addresses the South African government’s unjust treatment of black soldiers like Petrus — whose state reward for his service upon his return was a bicycle and a pair of boots, while many of his white counterparts were welcomed home with land and livestock. Eight decades later, Hettie still feels the social and economic impact of that insult, and is first to sign up when she hears of a government reparations scheme, promising overdue compensation to the descendants of black veterans — though only after a maze of paperwork and an administrative payment on her end. A clear scam, it has taken in Hettie and a number of her neighbors, now waiting in vain for a payday that will never come.\n\n\tStill, Hettie is used to waiting indefinitely for better days that may or may not arrive, and with her 80th birthday celebrations imminent, she feels little anguish as she takes stock of a life still replete with small, alive things. Those include her goats (whose tinkling bells provide a near-constant soundtrack atop Mikhaila Alyssa Smith’s elegant, restrained piano themes) and her cats, an undefined tangle of grandchildren, and the local flora and fauna she silently greets on her daily ramblings. \n\t\n\n\tJacobs’ narration, beautifully and often wittily written, articulates this awareness without imposing a loftier worldview on the character, and sometimes digresses into the yearnings and peculiarities of other Kharkams residents — a man hopefully digging for diamonds in the bare earth of his living room, another dozily reflecting on a 1970s one-night stand that remains his life’s high-water mark. Cinematographer Gray Kotzé likewise captures the region’s scruffy natural beauty, with its ruddy fynbos flowers and dry, putty-hued soil, without overly dignifying or prettifying it, and gazing with equal interest and affection at the unlovely zinc buildings and barbed-wire fences that mark human life there.\n",

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following story contains plot details from “Eyes Without a Face,” Season 4, Episode 5 of “Industry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following story contains plot details from “Eyes Without a Face,” Season 4, Episode 5 of “Industry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tOn “Industry,” heroes are hard to come by. But in the HBO series’ audacious Season 4, Sweetpea Golightly (Miriam Petche) is about the closest the show gets to one. Introduced in Season 3 as an entry-level employee at the since-collapsed bank Pierpoint & Co., Sweetpea fit right into the finance drama’s salacious intrigue, where sex is often just as transactional as the latest high-stakes business deal. In addition to her day job as an eager new analyst, Sweetpea had a side hustle on OnlyFans, where she sold pictures to the same older businessmen who talked down to her on the trading floor. Along with her name, Sweetpea’s extracurricular pursuits helped her quickly stand out even in a cast stacked with rising stars.\n\n\tIn Season 4, however, Sweetpea’s starting from a more vulnerable place. Her anonymous accounts have been made public, thanks to recently disgraced dirtbag Rishi Ramdani (Sagar Radia); now, the only job she can get in her career field of choice is working for Harper Stern (Myha’la), a Machiavellian striver who’s allergic to intimacy, and hardly a reliable boss. But beggars can’t be choosers, so Sweetpea follows Harper from Mostyn Asset Management to her independent venture SternTao. On “Industry,” however, underdogs are always the best motivated to succeed — and in the season’s fifth episode, “Eyes Without a Face,” Sweetpea finally gets her time to shine.\n\n\tHarper had previously bet the fate of SternTao, a shorts-only fund that makes money when its targets fail, on the demise of Tender, a fintech start-up that’s suspiciously pivoted from facilitating porn payments to making growth-minded acquisitions in Africa. With SternTao’s short position squeezed by Tender’s stubbornly ascendant stock price, Harper agrees to send Sweetpea and Kwabena (Toheeb Jimoh), another SternTao trader Harper also happens to be sleeping with, to Ghana so they can take a look at Tender on the ground. There, Sweetpea puts her dogged investigation skills to use and returns with proof hard enough to save SternTao from ruin. Now Harper won’t have to commit fraud to secure more funding!\n\n\tThis being “Industry,” the win comes at a cost. On a quest to track down Swift GC, a company Tender acquired for an eyebrow-raising $50 million, Sweetpea goes to their office (it’s a PO Box), interrogates the M&A lawyer (his tiny office doesn’t scream “massive deals”) and interrogates Tender’s Africa chief Tony Day (Stephen Campbell) under the pretense that she still works at Mostyn. Day smells a rat and gives Sweetpea a blandly threatening phone call while she and Kwabena are kicking back a few beers on the beach. Shortly afterward, Sweetpea goes to the bathroom, where she’s assaulted by a stranger who breaks her nose along with her sense of security. \n\n\tRather than back down, Sweetpea resolves to “run a fucking train” on her adversaries. (She also sleeps with Kwabena to blow off some steam.) The men who look down on her for sex work are mostly faceless, but Tender offers a more specific target for her frustration. Luckily, a family friend of Kwabena’s provides the missing piece of the Swift GC transaction: Tender only said they paid $50 million for the company, which is little more than a decrepit office building. The falsely inflated acquisition was primarily a way of getting falsely inflated revenue off the books before prying eyes could apply real scrutiny. Having uncovered Tender’s house of cards, Sweetpea makes her triumphant return to London — but rather than accept Harper’s offer of a shoulder to cry on, Sweetpea flatly comes clean about the Kwabena hookup, makes clear she expects to be paid, and heads back to her apartment to break down in sobs.\n\n\t“She believes that if she can see this through, then she is of some value that she feels she’s lost,” Petche says of her character’s motivation for seeing the Tender takedown through. A recent graduate of the prestigious Guildhall conservatory, Petche is, like Sweetpea, a relative newcomer who’s quickly established herself in a high-pressure environment. Petche spoke with Variety about shooting on location, how getting doxxed has affected Sweetpea’s mindset and what “Industry” has taught her about the art of making good TV. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThis season is such a great one for Sweetpea overall. Headed into it, did you have a conversation with creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay about where they saw the character going?\t\n\n\tI had a call with one of our producers much earlier on, specifically about Episode 5, before I’d even got the scripts for Episodes 1 and 2 and 3 and 4. So it was more just keeping that conversation alive and making me aware of what was going on, because this episode is so crucial — not only for Sweetpea, but for the arc of the season. I was like, “OK, I need to understand how she gets here. If she’s arriving here emotionally, what do I need to do, working backwards, to build up to this moment? If this is the peak of her arc, how do I plan every step before and then after?”\n\t\n\t\tI assume that call was partly about going on location. Can you tell me a bit about filming in Africa?\t\n\n\tWe actually went to South Africa. We went to Durban in South Africa for, actually, a very short while. Most of the episode was filmed in Cardiff in the U.K. So there were only the shots that we couldn’t really — the ones that were necessary for us to be on location. For example, the beach shot, the moments when me and Toheeb are at the beach bar. \n\n\n\tI mean, going on location is obviously so incredible as an actor, because you’re put into a different set of circumstances. But it wasn’t the entirety of the episode, which was a very interesting way to do it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tChronologically, how did the Durban trip slot into the shoot?\t\n\n\tIt was at the very end. So we had done everything else and then, if I remember correctly, it was at the very end of that episode. It was pretty much 72 hours we were out there. It was a very, very, very short time. It was this whirlwind experience of wrapping up this episode.\n\t\n\t\tAfter what happened to Rishi’s wife in the Season 3 finale, the possibilities for the show widened, and violent, scary things can happen. So as a viewer, the bathroom scene was quite alarming — I was curious what that scene was like for you to film as an actor.\t\n\n\tI personally feel like that scene isn’t played for shock value. I think what matters the most to Sweetpea is this loss of control and safety, and how her sense of agency over the situation very quickly dissipates. And then from that moment on, she becomes different in her approach to Tender, to relationships. It really stays with her for a long time after that moment itself. \n\t\n\n\tWith the practical part, you want to make sure everyone is safe and everyone feels happy. We had stunt coordination. Everyone was checking in with one another. It’s like choreography, like anything that needs to be done with care. You go through it step by step, moment by moment, making sure everyone feels that they know what’s happening. Once you understand the choreography, you can then effectively communicate the scene to the audience. Once you have those steps in place, you can then really engage with the scene.\n\t\n\t\tYou speaking about Sweetpea feeling a loss of agency and control reminds me of how she must be feeling in the wake of this horrible violation and doxxing that she’s experienced. Do those feel like similar mindsets to you?\t\n\n\tI think that in Episode 5, the stakes for her are quite existential. I think she pushes through these extremes, not because she feels admirable or she feels heroic, but because these stakes are so existential for her. This is her career, her credibility — and really, at the end of the day — her sense of self-worth. She believes that if she can see this through, then she is of some value that she feels she’s lost. It’s the lengths that she’ll go to to prove herself, and as seen at the end of the episode, what it costs her to keep going. But I think that loss of agency is implemented at the very beginning of the season, like you said, with the OnlyFans leak. I think this is her grappling with having a sense of control over her own narrative.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen Sweetpea and Kwabena talk about if there needs to be a “why,” I agree your character doesn’t need one for pursuing sex work. But in terms of her motivation for being in this incredibly cutthroat industry and working as hard as we see her work this season, what do you feel like propels her in this financial world?\t\n\n\tI think that she is a person who believes her worth has to be proven, and that’s why she’s drawn to this high stakes environment. Because if she does these things, and if she’s brilliant enough, and if she’s useful enough and indispensable enough, then she can survive anything, even if it costs her emotionally or physically. She thinks that her brilliance is her safety. And I think what specifically this episode shows us is that it doesn’t keep her safe at all. In fact, it kind of collides with everything that’s going on. At the end of the episode, when she breaks down, I feel like that moment is the price of her composure finally being paid off. I wanted that moment to just feel like a relief and a letting go of everything from this season and the episode.\n\t\n\t\tThis episode also moves the Sweetpea-Harper relationship forward. On the one hand, Harper gives Sweetpea this job where no one else will. But at the same time, Sweetpea seems very clear-eyed about Harper’s faults and says no to her coming upstairs. What do you feel like Sweetpea’s attitude toward Harper is?\t\n\n\tTheir relationship is fascinating to me, because when I go back to Season 3 in my mind, when Sweetpea joins Pierpoint, Harper has already left. So all she has is these stories of Harper. I think Sweetpea admires Harper and sees her as this uncompromising, extremely intelligent, self-driven woman. So when Sweetpea has the opportunity to work with Harper, she grasps it with both hands. But then when they’re working with each other, the idealized version of someone gives way to the real person, and you realize what they’re actually like. There’s a frustration from Sweetpea that Harper, particularly at the beginning of the season, isn’t operating at her highest level for the entire team. And it frustrates Sweetpea, because she sees how brilliant Harper is, and how brilliant she can be. \n\t\n\n\tShe’s never really had an issue in saying that to her, or being quite blunt with her about how she feels. When she sees Harper not working for the team’s best interests, there’s this mix of admiration but frustration. When you want someone to be different, it’s a very interesting dynamic. Particularly in Episode 5, when Sweetpea comes back and says, “I want to be paid.” She’s putting up these walls to protect herself from what’s been taken on that trip away. She’s sort of protecting herself from the world.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s also a fascinating contrast between your character and Toheeb’s where Sweetpea comes straight out and says, “I hooked up with this person you’re also hooking up with,” and he doesn’t take the opportunity to be honest. You see that streak in Sweetpea where she’s able to be very straightforward, very blunt. Where do you think that tendency comes from with the character?\t\n\n\tFunnily enough, when I was thinking about who she was in Season 3, I think she observes people around her. I think she observes how people succeed. I think she observed how people succeeded within the world of Pierpoint. She’s aware that it’s a very cutthroat dynamic. And I think that she psyched herself up to say, well, if I want to succeed, I have to be like the people that I’ve seen be successful before me. I have to be cutthroat. I have to be honest. I have to have an opinion. And maybe part of that confidence initially is bravado. Initially, it’s fake it until you make it, and then as time progresses, and particularly within this season, she is a lot more upfront with her genuine opinions and feelings. That bravado has given away to this woman who actually really wants to be very good at her job. So yeah, it’s a mix of learned behavior and also innately what was already there that she’s now giving space to as well.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHarper has become so compromised, and in contrast, Sweetpea is incredibly easy to root for. As the person who plays her, are you worried at all that over the long term, she will become a little more corrupted?\t\n\n\tI am worried for her! I am worried for her, but it’s also one of the things I love about the show. These characters aren’t straightforward. They are morally complex, like human beings can be. They can change over time, and they can be one way one year, and a completely different person the year next. That’s what I really liked when I watched the first two seasons, before I was in the show — that you could be rooting for a character, and then the rug would be pulled from underneath you, and you think, “Oh, no, why did you do that?” That’s what I found endearing about the show. So I suppose, as much as I personally want the best for Sweetpea, I think that in line with the show, if she finds herself in some more complex situations or doing some more compromising things, I would understand why the character might have gone in that direction.\n\t\n\t\tLike a lot of other people who have come into their own on the show, you’re very early in your career. What have you learned from being on this particular show that you hope to take forward with you into other projects?\t\n\n\tI learned how TV is made, to be honest with you.\n\t\n\t\tThat’s important!\t\n\n\tIt really, honestly is. I like to know everything that’s going on. I’m like Sweetpea in that way. And honestly, it’s really helpful as an actor. I went to drama school, and you’re prepared with technique and emotional insight and all of these things. But I wasn’t taught about how a show is made, what it means to be a part of a season, how a set works. I’ve learned so much from this show, not only just technically as an actor, but just professionally.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 1 finale of “Spartacus: House of Ashur,” now available on Starz.\n\n\tSteven S. DeKnight ha",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 1 finale of “Spartacus: House of Ashur,” now available on Starz.\n\n\tSteven S. DeKnight has helped create several cinematic universes over the years. He wrote on “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and the spinoff “Angel” in the early aughts, lent his talents to Superman on “Smallville,” ran a “Transformers” writers’ room in 2015, directed “Pacific Rim: Uprising” in 2018 and served as showrunner for Marvel’s “Daredevil” on Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tBeginning in 2010, however, DeKnight has been expanding a universe of his own with “Spartacus.” Though the series shares a title and general timeline with Stanley Kubrick’s 1960 feature, the Starz and Lionsgate television series takes the historical epic into new territory, matching the conventions of sword and sandals with sex and slaughter for a visceral dramatization of history. \n\n\n\tThe series began with “Spartacus: Blood and Sand” in 2010. A prequel series, “Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,” later premiered in 2011, and the timeline continued with “Spartacus: Vengeance” in 2012 and “Spartacus: War of the Damned” in 2013, which saw the title gladiator’s death in the final episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Matt Klitscher/Starz\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLate last year, “Spartacus” returned to television after more than a decade, but the show did not reemerge with new tales of the eponymous Thracian. Instead, the new series, titled “Spartacus: House of Ashur” focuses on the subtitular character: the Assyrian Ashur (Nick E. Tarabay) who stood enemy to Spartacus in the original series and met a gristly demise at the end of “Vengeance.”\n\t\n\n\tNevertheless, the new series opens with Ashur in the underworld, where he is given the opportunity to reexperience life in a different timeline, one in which he evaded death, killed Spartacus and now stands Dominus in his own House. Ashur awakes in this alternative timeline, but not all is blissful. Throughout the series, he still must navigate the politics of the Roman Empire, contending with the crass authority of Julius Caesar (Jackson Gallagher) and his wife Cornelia (Jaime Slater), aiming to elevate his House’s notoriety in the arena by introducing the ferocious gladiatrix, Achillia (Tenika Davis), and all the while, trying to maintain peace within and without in his new chance at rewriting history. \n\n\tAnd rewrite history he does! The “House of Ashur” season finale, which premiered on Starz on Feb. 6, concludes with Ashur murdering Caesar, thus subverting the Ides of March and revising one of the most infamous deaths in human history. After Achillia gains victory in the arena and brings triumph to the House of Ashur, Caesar dismisses the agreement that would see Ashur gain favor among the Roman Empire. The two then engage in an intense and intimate battle of fists and blades, culminating in Ashur delivering a fatal blow to the mighty Caesar. In the penultimate shot, Ashur stands over the Emperor’s dead body in a pool of blood and utters the episode’s now-ironic title: “Hail Caesar.”\n\n\tAhead of the finale, Variety caught up with DeKnight to discuss his return to “Spartacus,” the uncoupling of history in “House of Ashur” — and the future of all the franchises he’s touched over the years.\n\n\tAnd the other main thing that I wanted to do was work with Nick Tarabay again. I loved working with Nick; I worked with him on a couple of projects. He’s a complete pro, and I thought he really deserved to be front and center, because he’s such a fantastic actor.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s start by stating the obvious: Ashur was decapitated in “Spartacus: Vengeance.” What made you want to resurrect the character and make a season in an alternative timeline, focusing on him as the hero?\t\n\n\tTwo main things: first and foremost, I just thought it was an incredibly juicy character and that there was more to explore. When we see Asher in “Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,” we see a guy who’s eager to be part of the Brotherhood. He wants those relationships, but through a series of circumstances, he’s ridiculed, humiliated and injured — and that makes him really bitter. So I always thought it would be interesting to explore whether he can rediscover his humanity. Can he find his heart again?\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Matt Klitscher/Starz\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow did you and the writers decide on the story?\t\n\n\tAbout three years ago, I pitched this crazy idea to Lionsgate and Starz. They said that they wanted more “Spartacus,” so I went through the usual permutations: What if we focused on Caesar? What if we focused on the triumvirate? What if we did Antony and Cleopatra? But none of them felt like “Spartacus” in the true sense of the series. I really love the confined upstairs-downstairs storytelling with the political intrigue. In the original show, Ashur says, “This is the rise of the house of Ashur.” The writers and I mused about, what if we actually did that show, and eventually we said, “Why the hell not? Why not do a ‘What If…’ where we can uncouple from history so the audience doesn’t know what’s coming and explore this great character?”\n\t\n\t\tDid you always know that you wanted to reintroduce Caesar into the universe of“Spartacus”?\t\n\n\tWell, we had Caesar in the original show, played by Todd Lasance, and he was unfortunately not available because he’s starring in his own show and we’re very happy for him. But when I first talked to Nick, I called him up after Lionsgate and Starz said yes to the show. He was in France at the time, and I pitched him the story and he was immediately on board, and part of that pitch was I told him, “At the end of Season 1, you kill Caesar and the last line is ‘Hail Caesar.’” He loved it and now, here we are.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Matt Klitsche/Starz\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSo you knew from the beginning that the season would end with the battle between Ashur and Caesar, and the further rewriting of history?\t\n\n\tYeah. A lot of people watching the show keep asking, “When are we going to see Caesar, Crassus and Pompey take over the Republic?” Obviously, I couldn’t tell them, but we had a different plan. The interesting thing about the show is that now that Ashur is alive again, he knocks over the historical dominoes, and starts changing history. The first change is that he introduces the female gladiator about 70 years earlier than it actually happened. And the next big one is that he murders Julius Caesar, which obviously completely upsets history and the triumvirate. And what happens from there is really interesting to me. So, yes, I had this idea from the very beginning. I thought it would be a super cool, different approach to history, and really show the audience that we are now truly uncoupled from history.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDespite the ending, though, Caesar’s wife, Cornelia, really has more of a presence throughout the season. Why did you decide to make her the more prominent and consequential character in the story?\t\n\n\tWell, I talked to my historical consultants and they explained that Julius Caesar is the most famous Roman in history, but at this point in time, his wife, Cornelia, was actually more powerful, richer and better known, and she was helping Caesar rise up through the ranks because she truly loved him. It was a love relationship. I think there’s a story when Caesar was banished — or on the run and had to live in a cave — and she joined him because she loved him so much. So really this came from the historical consultants saying that she was actually the one that everyone wanted to suck up to at this point in history. She was the daughter of Cinna, who was the previous dictator of the Roman Republic, and she had a lot of notoriety and power and public presence. I thought it would be very interesting to subvert those expectations of Caesar being front and center, and instead have it be his wife who’s working on his behalf.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Matt Klitsche/Starz\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnother interesting character that you introduce in this season is Achillia. How did you and your fellow writers develop her and decide to introduce the concept of gladiatrixes to “Spartacus”?\t\n\n\tOn the original show, Rob Tapper and I always wanted to introduce the female gladiator, because we just thought it was really cool, but we were sticking much closer to history and we ultimately decided that it was a bit too far since it was like 70 or 80 years out of the time period. But we really wanted to do it, so this time around, with the uncoupling of history, we went for it. It introduced a cool, different visual element for the show, and from there, we started building a character with a mysterious past that’s fighting her own demons. We found a way for her to be thrown into this brutal world where no one, including Ashur, expects her to survive. She’s a gimmick. Ashur just uses her to get his foot in the door, but then, against all odds, she survives, barely. And then he’s really got a hot property — and a hot property like that, of course, in classic entertainment fashion, is mimicked. All the other promoters want to copy it, so that’s where the Scythian came in. She’s the next one as it’s catching on. People in the show want to see more gladiatrixes. So that story will continue, and we’ll see more female gladiators.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDoes that mean that you have more “Spartacus” in the pipeline? Will there be a Season 2 of “House of Ashur”?\t\n\n\tYeah, we’ve actually already written Season 2. It all depends on the audience and the viewership, but we’re very happy with the response so far, and we’re ready to go.\n\t\n\t\tAcross all of the seasons of “Spartacus” do you ever get notes from the studio regarding the amount of sex and violence? Do they ever ask you to tone it down, or, contrarily, do they ever insist that you amp it up, given that it’s part of what makes the show unique?\t\n\n\tThankfully no. Starz and Lionsgate were both very supportive from early on, and they were clear that they wanted more of the same show. They didn’t want us to tone it down for the times. Their opinion from the start was, “Look, we know this show isn’t for everybody —we’re not trying to make it for everybody. We want to make another ‘Spartacus.’” So that was fantastic to hear in this day and age, that they didn’t put restrictions on us. They were very happy with what we were delivering and they felt it was very much in the spirit of the original show.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhere does the unique dialogue of “Spartacus” come from? How did you create this unique Shakespearean dialect riddled with profanity?\t\n\n\tA lot of people think that the syntax is Latin, but it actually has nothing to do with Latin. It was a pure creative invention from the beginning of the original series, just because I wanted to convey to the audience the sense of a different time. I have a background in playwriting; that’s what I studied in college and I was deeply steeped in Shakespeare, but I didn’t want to go full Shakespeare because with a modern audience, it’d be incredibly difficult to understand. The show’s already challenging as it is, so I just mashed two of my favorite things together: Shakespeare and “Conan the Barbarian.” I just wanted to put those together and then run it through the lens of growing up in South Jersey, which means I curse a lot. I wanted that kind of juxtaposition of the highfalutin language with a lot of cursing, which just felt right for the world.\n\t\n\t\tNow that you’ve created this alternative timeline, are there other “Spartacus” characters that you’d be interested in revisiting or resurrecting?\t\n\n\tDefinitely. I always wanted to do a Gannicus spin off from the original series, played by the fantastic Dustin Clare. At the end of “Gods of the Arena,” he gains his freedom from the arena and goes off wandering. He disappears in the time period of the show for five, six or seven years, and then reappears in “Spartacus: Vengeance.” And I always thought it would be great to do like a Spaghetti Western kind of version, you know, a “Have Sword, Will Travel,” with Gannicus wandering the lands, looking for redemption for his own past deeds as he gets involved with helping people. Like, a Man with No Name Spaghetti Western, but with a sword- and-sandal bent.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLastly, beyond “Spartacus,” you’ve been involved in so many franchises over the years from Marvel, DC, “Transformers” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” Some of these series, notably “Buffy” and “Daredevil” are getting new life right now in the form of reboots. Would you be interested in returning to any of those universes as a writer, director or producer, as you’ve served in the past?\t\n\n\tI’m always open, but I also love to see what the next generation of creatives are going to bring to the table. It’s like, I’ve had my go and it was a great time. I loved working on “Buffy” and “Daredevil,” but I’m really excited about the “Buffy’ reboot. I cannot wait to see what they do. I was especially excited when I heard Sarah Michelle Gellar was going to be part of it, which, to me, makes it even more exciting. So, would I answer the call if I was available? Of course. I love those worlds, but I think they’ll do just fine without me, and I’m just excited to see what these creatives do with the properties.\n\t\n\t\tAny advice for the folks rebooting “Daredevil” on Disney+ right now?\t\n\n\tI think they got a handle on it. Quite frankly, my advice is always the same for all creatives: swing for the fences. Just absolutely go for it and people will show up. Particularly with“Daredevil,” they’rebenefiting from having Charlie Cox, Vincent D’Onofrio, Jon Bernthal, and, of course, the incredible Deborah Ann Woll. You absolutely cannot go wrong with that talent. They are just amazing. I’d watch those guys read the phone book, so I’m sure that they’re going to do great.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

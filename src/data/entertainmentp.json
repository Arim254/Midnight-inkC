    "body": "\n\tWhile Jimmy Kimmel noted his contract extension with Disney during Monday night’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” he also jabbed at President Donald Trump for the job he did as host of Sunday’s Kennedy Center Honors.\n\n\tAt a Saturday event related to the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump singled out Kimmel as a “horrible” TV host. Kimmel responded on Monday’s monologue with his own critique. \n\n\n\t“I thought we were friends. I’m starting to think he’s got a crush on me,” Kimmel joked, pointing out Trump’s weekend activities at the Kennedy Center Honors and the FIFA World Cup 2026 Draw, also held in D.C.\n\t\n\n\t“He’s been boasting about hosting, saying, ‘We’ve never had a president host the Kennedy Center Honors before,’ which, yeah, why do you think that is?” Kimmel asked during his monologue. “We’ve also never had Neil Patrick Harris order a military strike on a fishing boat before.”\n\n\tLater in his monologue, Kimmel told the crowd he has renewed his deal to host “Jimmy Kimmel Live” through May 2027, “or until the world ends, whichever comes first,” as he told the crowd at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood.\n\n\t“I was giving a lot of thought and decided I would like to spend less time with my family, and so to our audience here and at home – I’m honored and humbled to be a part of your routine. Whether it’s in bed at night, or …during your morning toilet time,” Kimmel said. “It means a lot to me to have your attention – and to work with this great group of people for another year.”\n\n\tKimmel renewed his deal with Disney early Monday and will remain the host of ABC‘s late-night program through 2027. His current deal was expected to expire in 2026.\n\t\n\n\tKimmel confirmed the renewal in an Instagram post Monday afternoon, writing, “I am pleased to announce another no-talent year!” The phrase “no-talent” is a favorite of Trump’s when lashing out at late-night hosts who criticize him on air.\n\n\tKimmel’s relationship with Trump is tumultuous to say the least. The president habitually attacks Kimmel on Truth Social, often after the late-night host takes a swipe at him on air. In November, Kimmel said during a Tuesday night broadcast that Trump “loses his mind” every time a reporter asks about his connection to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The following night, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “Why does ABC Fake News keep Jimmy Kimmel, a man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS, on the air?”\n\n\tKimmel’s relationship with ABC hasn’t been the smoothest either. In September, the network pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off the air for several days after Nexstar and Sinclair, two of the nation’s largest TV station owners, complained about the host’s on-air comments about Charlie Kirk, a young conservative activist who was assassinated.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn this week’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart called out Donald Trump for accepting FIFA’s inaugural Peace Prize while simultaneously escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela.\n\n\tAt the top of Monday’s show, Stewart turned his attention to last Friday’s FIFA World Cup draw, during which the groups for the initial phase of the global soccer tournament were revealed. But, as noted by the late-night pundit, the big question of the night wasn’t “who would be in this year’s group of death or how FIFA would find a way to fuck over Scotland,” but rather “who would win FIFA’s first Peace Prize?”\n\t\n\n\t“Because when I think of one sport that fosters peaceful coexistence, it’s the beautiful game,” Stewart joked. “All right, here we go! Who’s it going to be?”\n\n\n\tStewart then cut to the World Cup draw, where FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced Trump as the first-ever recipient of the Peace Prize.\n\n\t“Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!” Stewart facetiously exclaimed. “He won the prize specifically created to appease him! The FIFA appease-prize!”\n\n\tLater in the show, Stewart added, “The craziest part wasn’t necessarily Donald Trump being awarded an entirely fictitious golden butt plug. It was the cognitive dissonance of flipping over to the news channels, post-peace ceremony.”\n\n\tStewart then cut to a series of news clips claiming that America is “on the brink of war with Venezuela,” and that Trump is “ramping up the pressure” on the nation’s leader, Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\t“The brink of war? President Trump, did this meaningless award mean nothing to you?” Stewart said. “By the way, if you think they’re not serious about Venezuela, they seem to be setting a pretty nice table.”\n\t\n\n\tMore soundbites followed, explaining that the Pentagon is “surging battleships towards the coast of Venezuela,” and that the campaign amounts to “the largest U.S. show of force in the Caribbean in decades.”\n\n\t“Not including, of course, your friend Stephanie’s destination bachelorette party. That is the largest show of force,” Stewart joked.\n\n\tWatch the entire monologue below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Baahubali” star Tamannaah Bhatia has been cast as actor Jayashree in the upcoming Indian biographical drama “V. Shantaram,” joining Siddhant Chaturvedi in the epic chronicle of the pioneering Indian filmmaker’s life and legacy.\n\n\tThe makers unveiled a first-look poster of Bhatia as Jayashree, the accomplished actor known for her work in films including “Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani,” “Shakuntala,” “Chandra Rao More” and “Dahej.” Jayashree was also V. Shantaram’s second wife and a key figure in his cinematic journey.\n\t\n\n\tThe poster showcases Bhatia draped in a pink Nauvari saree, evoking the vintage era of Indian cinema. The casting follows the recent unveiling of Chaturvedi in the title role of the biographical drama tracing Shantaram’s journey from the silent era through his emergence as one of India’s most influential auteurs.\n\n\n\t“It’s a great responsibility to portray a character rooted in one of the most influential eras of our cinema. And I feel immensely honored to bring to life Jayashree, as she has been part of such legendary projects and the amount of grace she had was surreal,” Bhatia said. “Shantaram built a legacy that continues to shape generations, and decoding his universe has allowed me to witness the brilliance of the man behind the legend. Bringing a piece of that legacy to the screen is truly a special feeling, and I am thankful for the makers of ‘V. Shantaram’ to see me as Jayashree.”\n\n\tV. Shantaram, born Shantaram Rajaram Vankudre in 1901, was a pioneering force in Indian cinema whose career spanned nearly seven decades. He founded two major film studios — Prabhat Film Company in 1929 and Rajkamal Kalamandir in 1942 — and directed the first Marathi-language talkie, “Ayodhyecha Raja,” in 1932. His films, including classics like “Duniya Na Mane” (1937), “Do Aankhen Barah Haath” (1957), “Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje” (1955) and “Navrang” (1959) were celebrated for their technical innovations and progressive social themes addressing issues like communal harmony, dowry, and prisoner rehabilitation. Known for his signature style of lavish sets, unique song picturizations, and visual symbolism — he used cinema as an instrument for social change throughout his career. He received India’s highest film honor, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, in 1985.\n\t\n\n\tWritten and directed by Abhijeet Shirish Deshpande, “V. Shantaram” is presented by Rajkamal Enterttainment, Camera Take Films and Roaring Rivers Productions. Rahul Kiran Shantaram, Subhash Kale and Sarita Ashwin Varde serve as producers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tFreddy Fazbear and his friends have done it again.\n\n\tThe bloodthirsty animatronics beckoned enough franchise fans to theaters to make “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” a box office hit this weekend. The film’s ending — complete with a mid-credits scene, an end-credits scene and a handful of cliffhangers — is already encouraging plenty of debate and analysis online.\n\t\n\n\tEmma Tammi, who directed both films in the series, spoke with Variety about the series’ next steps. During this film’s mid-credits scene, Springtrap — the antagonistic animatronic from the game “Five Nights at Freddy’s 3” — is seen booting up. It’s implied that the spirit of William Afton (Matthew Lillard), the co-founder of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, now controls the device.\n\n\n\tTammi said that she and screenwriter Scott Cawthon (who also created the games) planned to bring the villain back for a third movie, after he makes a cameo in the visions of his daughter Vanessa Shelly (Elizabeth Lail) in “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2.”\n\n\t“We end Movie One with him being dragged off, and the idea was always that he would be teed up at the end of Movie Two for a third film, should we be fortunate enough to make one,” Tammi said. “That really links to where Movie Three and Game Three enter the scene. We get these great glimpses of William Afton throughout this film that are really more through the lens of Vanessa and her memories and PTSD from her relationship with him. To then get a glimpse towards the end of what he is now becoming and has become, when the assumption is, at least from our characters within the film, that he’s dead … it’s just such a great way to bring it back to Afton.”\n\t\n\n\tYet Springtrap wasn’t the final moment in the film. Instead, we hear grieving father Henry Emily (Skeet Ulrich) leave a message for Mike (Josh Hutcherson) in which he reveals he was business partners with William at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, and warns him to avoid the Marionette, which has been taken over by his dead daughter’s soul.\n\n\t“That was inspired by some of the tape recordings from the game,” Tammi said. “It was a mishmash also of picking up the Marionette at the end, as it intersects with Henry, and certainly as he’s reaching out to Mike. This film is really an introduction to Henry, without going too deep into his backstory. That recording felt like the perfect tease to nod our hat to the fact that we would be going deeper with him in a third film.”\n\n\tAlso exciting is the fact that Ulrich and Lillard might be onscreen together if the third installment is made. Notably, the pair made a splash in 1996’s “Scream,” where they played the deadly duo posing as Ghostface.\n\n\t“Once [Ulrich’s] name was brought up for the first time, it just clicked so hard, and we all got so excited about it,” Tammi said. “I think every crew member who started catching wind that this was something that was going to happen had such an overwhelmingly excited response. It was an across-the-board validation for how cool this was going to be, and how well-received that reunion was going to be.”\n\n\tUltimately, despite the film’s emphasis on killer robots and a dense backstory, Tammi is proud to bring audiences human stories that fans can love as well.\n\n\t“I think our human characters are as important as our animatronic characters, and as important as the lore,” she said. “For me, they all hold equal weight. I would absolutely want to continue that moving forward.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tArtists Equity, the studio founded by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, has hired veteran producer and executive Amy Baer as its president of film and television. \n\n\tSince it launched in 2022, Artists Equity has produced “Air,” “The Instigators,‘ and “The Accountant 2,” many of which have starred Affleck or Damon.  The company’s upcoming releases include “The Rip,” an action film starring Damon, Affleck, Teyana Taylor, and Scott Adkins, that will be directed by Joe Carnahan, as well as “Animals,” a thriller directed by Affleck, who stars alongside Gillian Anderson, Steven Yeun, and Kerry Washington.\n\t\n\n\tFor over 13 years, Baer has served as president of Gidden Media, which she founded in 2012, producing “The Apprentice,” “Last Vegas” and “Mary Shelley.”  From 2020 to 2023, Baer also served as president of Landline Pictures, overseeing the development and production of films including “Jerry & Marge Go Large” and the upcoming comedy “The Best Is Yet to Come,” reuniting the “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” team of Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck. \n\n\n\tBefore founding her own company, Baer launched CBS Films and served for four years as its president and CEO. She previously spent 17 years at Sony Pictures, overseeing “Moneyball,” “The Pursuit of Happyness,” “Something’s Gotta Give” and “Adaptation.” Baer is a member of AMPAS, PGA, Producers United, Film Independent, and SAG, and recently concluded a six-year term as board president of Women in Film. \n\n\tBaer will report to Affleck, Artists Equity’s Co-Founder & CEO, and Chief Operating Officer Dillon West.\n\t\n\n\t“Amy is a world-class executive and producer whose track record speaks for itself,” said Affleck. “She brings a wealth of experience, not only in leadership roles at major studios, including our valued partner in Sony Pictures, but also as a successful independent producer, building a deep understanding of the evolving industry landscape. Throughout her career, she has championed work that balances creative integrity with commercial success. Our goal at Artists Equity has always been to empower talent, and Amy is a perfect fit to represent our principles while expanding our vision for film and television.”\n\n\t“Artists Equity has quickly distinguished itself as a leading home for resonant, artist-driven storytelling, pioneering a bold new model for the future of our industry,” said Baer. “I am thrilled to join Ben, Matt, and the rest of the team as we build the company’s next chapter, centering creative voices to make films and television series that connect with audiences worldwide.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tT-Series and JP Films have unveiled the first look of Ahan Shetty from “Border 2,” expanding the war film’s scope to include the Indian Navy alongside the Army and Air Force.\n\n\tThe poster depicts Shetty as a Navy officer in combat, with blood streaked across his face and a military weapon in hand. The reveal follows earlier character posters for Sunny Deol, Varun Dhawan and Diljit Dosanjh, the latter portraying an Indian Air Force officer.\n\t\n\n\tShetty, the son of actor Suniel Shetty, made his acting debut with the action romance film “Tadap” (2021), for which he won the IIFA Award for Star Debut of the Year – Male. “Border 2” marks his second major film role. Next up for Shetty is a horror feature. \n\n\n\tSet in 1971, the original “Border” (1997) was headlined by Deol, and took place along the border region of Longewala, where a small battalion of Indian soldiers fought a large Pakistani strike force. It is considered a landmark Indian war film.\n\n\t“Border 2” is directed by Anurag Singh who previously helmed Akshay Kumar-starring “Kesari” (2019), based on the Battle of Saragarhi in which an army of 21 Sikhs fought against 10,000 Afghans in 1897.The cast includes Deol, Dhawan, Dosanjh, Shetty, Medha Rana, Mona Singh and Sonam Bajwa. The production is backed by Bhushan Kumar, JP Dutta and Nidhi Dutta under the T-Series and JP Films banners.\n\n\tPresented by Gulshan Kumar and T-Series in association with J.P. Dutta’s J.P. Films, the production team includes Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar, J.P. Dutta and Nidhi Dutta.\n\n\tThe film is scheduled for release on Jan. 23, 2026, targeting the Republic Day weekend in India, a lucrative period for patriotic films.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron revealed in an interview with Discussing Film that he received pushback from the studio when he decided to expand the number of “Avatar” sequels from three films to four. After the record-breaking success of the original “Avatar” in 2009, Cameron assembled a writer’s room to begin developing the continuation of a story across three sequels.\n\n\t“We were working on three scripts and then it turned into four. Two got split into two and three,” Cameron said about his decision to split what was the original script for “Avatar: The Way of Water” into both “The Way of Water” and a new third movie, “Fire and Ash.” The decision meant that what was planned to be the third “Avatar” movie would now be the fourth, bringing the total number of films in the franchise to five.\n\t\n\n\t“I actually got a fair bit of pushback from the studio,” Cameron said. “My counterargument was, ‘Wait a minute. What part of you getting another chance to make $2 billion is in question here?'”\n\n\n\tThe original “Avatar” remains the highest-grossing movie in history (unadjusted for inflation) with $2.9 billion. Cameron knew what he was talking about with his counterargument to the studio as 2022’s “The Way of Water” grossed $2.3 billion to become the third highest-grosser in history. Now the pressure is on for “Fire and Ash” to cross the $2 billion mark at the worldwide box office later this month.\n\n\tCameron previously revealed that he’s already shot footage for “Avatar 4,” but going back to finish the next sequel and continue into “Avatar 5” will all depend on the success of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Speaking to Collider in 2022, the filmmaker revealed that the “Avatar 4” script was the first “Avatar” sequel not to receive a single note from studio executives.\n\t\n\n\t“I can’t tell you the details, but all I can say is that when I turned in the script for [‘The Way of Water’], the studio gave me three pages of notes,” Cameron said. “And when I turned in the script for 3, they gave me a page of notes, so I was getting better. When I turned in the script for 4, the studio executive, the creative executive over the films, wrote me an email that said, ‘Holy fuck.’ And I said, ‘Well, where are the notes?’ And she said, ‘Those are the notes.’ Because it kind of goes nuts in a good way, right?”\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” opens in theaters Dec. 19.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump said he’s withholding judgment about whether Paramount Skydance‘s hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery or Netflix‘s deal with WBD should prevail. \n\n\tAt a White House briefing with reporters Monday, Trump was asked if he supports Paramount’s takeover bid for WBD. The president responded, “I don’t know enough about it. I know the companies very well. I know what they are doing. But I have to see. I have to see what percentage of market [share] they have. We have to see the Netflix percentage of market [share], Paramount percentage of market [share]. I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine. You know, I want to do what’s right. It’s so very important to do what’s right.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump’s comments came just hours after David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance launched a direct-to-shareholders hostile takeover effort for WBD, offering $30 per share in an offer with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. That came after Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced an $83.7 billion agreement, under which the streamer would buy WB’s studios, HBO, HBO Max and games divisions.\n\n\n\tParamount’s all-cash offer is backed by Larry Ellison, the wealthy father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison; RedBird Capital Partners; the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi; and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners investment company. Kushner is Donald Trump’s son-in-law, married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka.\n\n\tTrump, asked if Kushner’s involvement in the Paramount bid would affect the president’s opinion, said, “I’ve never spoken with him” about Paramount’s WBD deal.\n\t\n\n\tTrump, who has exerted control over federal agencies, said he will be participating in the government review of the Netflix-WB deal.\n\n\tOn Sunday, standing on the red carpet for the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump declared that “I’ll be involved” the decision about whether of not to approve the Netflix-WB deal. According to Trump, Sarandos visited the Oval Office last week. During the meeting, the Netflix co-CEO was seeking to reassure the president that his company would not amass anything close to monopoly power — and that other media conglomerates would still be bigger than Netflix together with WB and HBO Max. \n\n\tSarandos is “a fantastic man,” Trump said at the Kennedy Center. “I have a lot of respect for him, but it’s a lot of market share” that Netflix would amass if it owned Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Trump added: “It could be a problem.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Trump has been friendly with the Ellisons — “They’re big supporters of mine,” he has boasted — and the president publicly praised David Ellison, saying “he’ll do a great job” as CEO of the merged Skydance Media-Paramount. The Ellisons surely have been bending his ear in trying to persuade him to oppose Netflix’s WB gambit on anticompetitive grounds. \n\n\tBut on Monday morning, Trump lashed out at the Ellisons over this week’s “60 Minutes” segment with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once an ardent Trump supporter who has earned the president’s displeasure after she criticized his handling of the government shutdown and other issues including the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n\t“Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA, because nobody could have changed her views so fast, and her new views are those of a very dumb person,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social account. “That was proven last night when washed up, Trump hating, 60 Minutes ‘correspondent,’ Lesley Stahl, who still owes me an apology from when she attacked me on the show (with serious conviction!), that Hunter Biden’s LAPTOP FROM HELL was produced by Russia, not Hunter himself (TOTALLY PROVEN WRONG!), interviewed a very poorly prepared Traitor, who in her confusion made many really stupid statements.”\n\n\tTrump continued: “My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP” — and he opined that since the Ellisons bought the company, “60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”\n\t\n\n\tTrump pointed out that Paramount Global, seeking to close its deal with Skydance Media, this summer paid the president $16 million to settle his lawsuit over a previous “60 Minutes” segment. Trump’s lawsuit accused the venerable CBS News program of deceptively editing a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris, thereby inflicting harm on Trump personally and allegedly interfering with the 2024 election. Paramount and CBS had called the suit meritless and moved to have it thrown out, but Paramount Global — at the behest of former controlling shareholder Shari Redstone — eventually reached a deal paying Trump to settle it.\n\n\tTrump’s opposition to either deal wouldn’t necessarily doom its chances of getting regulatory approval. During Trump’s first term, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner on antitrust grounds; the move was reportedly motivated by Trump’s hatred of CNN. A federal judge ruled in favor of the companies and in February 2019 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWelcome to Variety Awards HQ! Your weekly command center for the Oscars race.\n\n\tIt’s Dec. 8, 2025, and we’re deep in the thick of it. The past seven days have been a whirlwind of major awards season benchmarks, and if anyone thought this year’s race would follow a predictable script, they were proven wrong.\n\n\n\tThe Golden Globe nominations dropped Monday, marking a notably international and genre-diverse field, with Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” leading all films with nine nominations. Other top contenders included “Sentimental Value,” “Sinners,” “Marty Supreme” and “The Secret Agent,” while films like “Jay Kelly” and “Wicked: For Good” fell short in best picture (comedy), despite multiple nods.\n\t\n\n\tJust days prior, the Critics Choice Awards nominations added fuel to the fire, helping clarify which films are gaining real momentum. “Bugonia” snagged a surprise best picture nom, in addition to its star Emma Stone. At the same time, there were strong showings with acting nominations for Jacob Elordi (“Frankenstein”) and Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”) signaled real heat behind the performances.\n\n\n\tThen came the Los Angeles Film Critics Association on Sunday night, throwing a few calculated curveballs. Ethan Hawke picked up leading performance for “Blue Moon” alongside Rose Byrne’s work in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” which brings her three of the “Big Four” critics awards, with the National Society of Film Critics still to come in January.\n\n\tThis week also brought major events across the circuit, from studio FYC screenings and Q&As to the early guild buzz already beginning to percolate. It’s been a week that sharpened the picture, and in some cases, rewrote it entirely.\n\t\n\n\tAs always, each week, we’ll deliver sharp analysis, exclusive interviews with key contenders (both above and below the line), and inside reads on the behind-the-scenes shifts affecting the race.\n\n\tWe’re always looking to spotlight unique angles, rising talent, and sharp on-the-ground reporting. Email me at cdavis@variety.com for submissions and coverage consideration.\n\n\tCatch up on the week’s top five events below.\n\t\n\t\tInside the NYC ‘Sinners’ Luncheon: A Starry Celebration In Soho\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Dec. 2, Warner Bros. hosted an intimate luncheon at Manuela in Soho to celebrate Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” one of the season’s most closely watched awards contenders.\n\n\tThe event brought together an eclectic and powerful mix of filmmakers, actors, producers, and tastemakers for a day of conversation, connection and celebration of the film’s rising momentum.\n\n\tHosted just days before Golden Globe and Critics Choice nominations were announced, the luncheon functioned as both a quiet flex and a strategic push, reminding voters and influencers alike of the film’s cultural impact and deep creative bench.\n\n\tAmong the attendees were writer and director Ryan Coogler, star Michael B. Jordan, and co-star Delroy Lindo. Also present at the event were: Gayle King, Laverne Cox, Phylicia Rashad, Shaka King, Julie Dash, Elegance Bratton, and Barbara Broccoli.\n\n\tOther notable guests included Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy, Todd Komarnicki, Stella Meghie, Omar Benson Miller, Marsha Stephanie Blake, and comedian Hannibal Buress.\n\n\tThe room also included several award-winning filmmakers and Academy members such as Dee Rees, J.C. Chandor, and Lisa Cortés, as well as casting director Francine Maisler and composer Jon Batiste.\n\t\n\t\tReba McEntire Hosts Starry ‘Song Sung Blue’ Event at DGA\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHugh Jackman, Reba McEntire, Kate Hudson and Craig Brewer seen at a special screening of ‘Song Sung Blue’ \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFocus Features via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Dec. 7, Focus Features teamed up with country music icon Reba McEntire to host a special screening of “Song Sung Blue” at the Directors Guild of America in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe event was part of the ongoing awards push for Craig Brewer’s musical drama, which has been building strong word of mouth the past few weeks.\n\n\tThe evening drew a packed house of Academy members, DGA voters, and industry insiders, with representation from major agencies including WME. Following the screening, McEntire introduced a lively and heartfelt Q&A featuring director/writer/producer Craig Brewer alongside stars Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson.\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue” has been quietly emerging as one of the season’s sleeper contenders, particularly for Hudson, whose performance has been singled out in recent screenings, and just garnered a Golden Globe nom for best actress (comedy).\n\t\n\t\tCharlize Theron Joins Baz Luhrmann for ‘Wicked: For Good’ Celebration in L.A.\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMiranda McDonald\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Dec. 2, Baz Luhrmann hosted a special celebration for Universal Pictures’ “Wicked: For Good,” featuring a live performance and reception in Los Angeles. The event, part of the studio’s ongoing awards season campaign, highlighted the film’s original music and showcased its ensemble cast. Among the notable attendees was Charlize Theron, adding star power to the evening. The celebration drew industry voters, guild members, and creatives for a night honoring the musical’s achievements. As “Wicked: For Good” builds momentum this season, the Luhrmann-led event served as a stylish reminder of the film’s artistic and cultural impact.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDocumentary Oscar Hopeful ‘Predators’ Gains Awards Momentum\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter premiering at Sundance 2025 to widespread acclaim, “Predators” has steadily emerged as one of the year’s top documentary contenders. Directed by David Osit and distributed by MTV Documentary Films, whose recent Oscar track record includes “Ascension,” “The Eternal Memory,” and “Black Box Diaries,” the film has built momentum through the fall season.\n\n\tCurrently boasting a 98% Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, “Predators” has resonated with critics and audiences alike across its theatrical run in over 35 markets.\n\n\tWith support building from both critics and the documentary branch, “Predators” is positioning itself as a dark horse contender in a competitive nonfiction field this awards season.\n\t\n\t\t‘Sentimental Value’ Ramps Up Awards Season Presence With Tastemaker Events in L.A. and NYC\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStephanie Augello\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJoachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” continued to solidify its status as a major awards season contender with a series of high-profile screenings and Q&As this past week, drawing enthusiastic support from voters according to sources and attendees.\n\n\tOn Dec. 1, the Directors Guild of America hosted a packed screening followed by a thoughtful conversation between Trier and editor Olivier Bugge Coutté, moderated by Judd Apatow.\n\n\tThe campaign continued in New York on Dec. 3, where the “Sentimental Value” team held a tastemaker screening at iPic Fulton for Academy members. Trier was joined by stars Stellan Skarsgård, Renate Reinsve and Elle Fanning. Academy Award winner Sofia Coppola (“Lost in Translation”) introduced the screening, adding an extra layer of prestige and support.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tIn an image shared to his socials last week, Harry Styles is seen on the set of his “Aperture” music video, sporting shiny black under-eye patches and sipping a Big Gulp.\n\n\tThe patches are reminiscent of 111SKIN’s Celestial Black Diamond Eye Mask, previously seen on celebrities such as Anne Hathaway, Charli XCX and Priyanka Chopra. Infused with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and retinol, the active product helps dry and tired under-eyes become a thing of the past. Whether you’re a light sleeper, frequent flyer or night owl, these patches will keep the party going all day — or night — long. The 8-pack, currently on sale for $80, are available for purchase below.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWhile 111SKIN’s eye masks are our best guess for which brand Styles donned in his promo, the brand helloSKIN also offers similar black eye masks. In an email to Variety, the brand wrote that “While we can’t officially confirm this, the eye patches seen are identical in look, shape and finish to helloSKIN’s Charcoal Hydrogel Eye Masks.”\n\n\tFounded in 2023, woman-owned helloSKIN is the world’s first fully dissolvable skincare brand, with a mission to make beauty cleaner, smarter and more responsible. Designed to leave no trace, their products can be completely dissolved in boiling water once you’re done using them. These eye masks detox and refresh tired eyes, drawing out impurities and soothing puffiness, all while restoring balance and clarity. Plus, they’re available for a much more affordable $12  thehelloskinco.com.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“Aperture” marks the lead single of Styles’ fourth studio album, “Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally,” which comes out March 6 and is available for pre-order here. The music video was released on Friday, along with the album’s full tracklist. His tour, Together, Together, is set to kick off later this year with stops in seven cities, including an impressive 30-night residency at the iconic Madison Square Garden. With a schedule like that, one thing is certain: there are many more eye masks in Harry Styles’ future. \n\n\n\tMatch Styles by purchasing 111SKIN’s Celestial Black Diamond Eye Mask or helloSKIN’s Charcoal Hydrogel Eye Masks today.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tOliver Peoples is turning to one of Hollywood’s most enduring style icons for its latest eyewear release. The luxury eyewear brand has unveiled an exclusive Spring/Summer 2026 collection honoring the legacy of Paul Newman, launched on Jan. 26 — what would have been the actor, philanthropist and racing legend’s 101st birthday.\n\n\tThe Paul Newman optical and sunglass frames reinterpret the teardrop silhouette long associated with Newman’s off-screen uniform, translating his effortlessly cool aesthetic into a modern, collectible eyewear line. Made in Japan, the styles feature bold acetate construction and refined detailing, including a custom engraved “PLN” temple cap, a racing-inspired corewire nodding to Newman’s lifelong love of motorsports, and a signature hue dubbed “Newman Blue,” inspired by his famously piercing eyes. Select optical frames are finished with a light wash blue lens.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe collection joins Oliver Peoples’ Estate Collection, which celebrates cultural icons whose personal style transcended eras, alongside previous tributes to Gregory Peck and Cary Grant. Each pair is presented in dedicated packaging featuring the Oliver Peoples x Paul Newman signature mark. In keeping with Newman’s legacy beyond film, the collaboration also supports Newman’s Own Foundation, which donates 100% of its profits and royalties to help children in need — aligning the collection’s luxury positioning with a philanthropic mission that defined much of Newman’s later life.\n\n\tAcross classics like “Cool Hand Luke,” “The Hustler,” “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and “The Verdict,” Newman projected a rare mix of rugged masculinity and introspective restraint through his wardrobe and accessories. Off screen, that sensibility translated into a uniform of tailored jackets, crisp shirts, lived-in denim and, most memorably, sunglasses that became an extension of his persona.\n\n\n\tThe Oliver Peoples Paul Newman collection will be available globally at Oliver Peoples boutiques, online and through select wholesale partners. Optical styles are priced at $493, while sunglasses range from $555 to $619.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Skyscraper Live,” a stream of Alex Honnold‘s free solo climb of one of the tallest buildings in the world, reached 6.2 million views on Netflix.\n\n\tThe climb, which took place at the Taipei 101 tower in Taiwan was originally set to air on Friday, Jan. 23 before being postponed to the next night due to bad weather concerns. (The time zone difference meant that in Taiwan, the climb was postponed from Saturday morning to Sunday morning.) Therefore, the stream only had one day — from Saturday night to Sunday night — to rack up viewership on the Netflix English language TV Top 10 for Jan. 19-25, where it ranked at No. 3 for the week.\n\t\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety after the climb, Honnold said the climb or the weather was not what stressed him out. \n\n\n\t“Climbing is always at the mercy of nature,” he said. “Everything about climbing, you’re always at the whim of conditions. Is it too hot? Is it too cold? Is it windy, is it rainy? My whole climbing life is always dictated by the weather, by nature. And so yesterday didn’t feel that different. The only reason that it was at all stressful is because it’s supposed to be a live broadcast. The idea of pushing this a day, I was like, ‘Man, I don’t know how many crew people are here, but they’re a lot, and all their flights need to change today, and all their hotels change.'”\n\n\tThe number one and two spots again belonged to “His & Hers” and “Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials” respectively, with the former show pulling 17.2 million views for the week and the latter pulling 8.7 million. Other Top 10 English language shows this week included “Finding Her Edge” at No. 4 with 5.5 million. Bert Kreischer’s scripted comedy series “Free Bert” also made its inaugural appearance on the Top 10 list, ranking at No. 8 with 3.2 million views. \n\t\n\n\tOn the English language film chart, the Ben Affleck and Matt Damon-led “The Rip” repeated at No. 1, seeing only a minor dropoff from its first week on the chart with 40.4 million views this week compared to 41.6 million in its first three days. Elsewhere on the film chart, the James Bond films “No Time to Die” and “Spectre” both made the list at No. 3 and No. 7 respectively. That comes just after the Bond film library became available to stream on Netflix on Jan. 15. \n\n\tSee the Netflix Top 10 for Jan. 19-25 below, beginning with English-language shows and movies and followed by non-English-language shows and movies.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWell Go USA Entertainment has secured North American distribution rights to “Blades of the Guardians,” a Chinese action film from Mandarin Motion Pictures. \n\n\tDirected by renowned action choreographer Yuen Woo-ping (“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), the historical martial arts feature stars Wu Jing (“Wolf Warrior” series), who also serves as producer, alongside Jet Li (“Once Upon a Time in China”), Nicholas Tse (“Raging Fire”), Yosh Yu (“Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms”), and K-pop artists Jun (Wen Junhui) of Seventeen and Winwin of NCT.\n\t\n\n\tThe film adapts Xianzhe Xu’s comic series and unfolds during China’s Sui Dynasty under Emperor Yang Guang’s oppressive reign. The story centers on a skilled mercenary named Biao Ren navigating the harsh deserts of the Western Regions who becomes entangled in a perilous scheme while completing what initially appears to be a simple escort assignment.\n\n\n\tPeace Film Production produced the project, with the screenplay written by Yu Baimei, Chao-pin Su, Chan Tai Lee and Larry Yang.\n\n\t“‘Blades of the Guardians’ is a sweeping action epic led by legends of the genre,” said Doris Pfardrescher, president and CEO of Well Go USA Entertainment. “With Yuen Woo-ping’s masterful direction and an extraordinary ensemble led by Wu Jing and Jet Li, the film delivers high-intensity action on a grand scale. The film is a celebration of martial arts cinema, a genre that has long been at the heart of Well Go’s identity and global audience connection.”\n\n\tThe film is set to open during the Lunar New Year holiday period on Feb. 17.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrian Robbins, former co-CEO of Paramount Global, has launched Big Shot Pictures, an entertainment company that will develop animation franchises.\n\n\tSony Pictures Entertainment has entered into a first-look theatrical distribution deal with Big Shot, which will produce both animated and hybrid live-action films for the studio. The company said it has acquired the rights to “Eloise at the Plaza,” the children’s book series created by Kay Thompson and illustrated by Hilary Knight about a six-year-old who lives at the legendary New York City hotel. \n\t\n\n\tRobbins has extensive experience in the family entertainment space. He previously oversaw Nickelodeon and co-founded AwesomenessTV, a digital media company that targeted tween audiences and was acquired by DreamWorks Animation. He also founded Tollin/Robbins Productions, which produced hit series such as “All That,” “Kenan & Kel” and “Smallville.”\n\n\n\tAt Paramount, Robbins tried to reinvigorate the studio’s motion picture division, which produced hits such as “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Sonic the Hedgehog” and “The Naked Gun.” However, his tenure overlapped with Shari Redstone’s efforts to sell the company, which complicated his plans for a rebound. Last year, Paramount struggled at the box office, releasing flops such as “The Running Man” and “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.”\n\n\tIn a press release announcing the new venture, Robbins announced the company has secured strategic investment from Greycroft, Sony Pictures, MarcyPen Capital Partners, ValueAct Capital, and CAA. Big Shot said it is represented by Matthew Johnson of Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole LLP and David Hernand of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.\n\t\n\n\tSo how is Big Shot different than the many, many companies competing in the the family entertainment space, one of the most durable genres in Hollywood? Some of it is the way it will develop proof of concepts. It plans to use digital platforms such as YouTube to test and build audiences for the intellectual property it develops. If they connect, those franchises will then be reconstituted as long-form theatrical releases and streaming series. The company said it will also develop gaming, consumer products and experiences. \n\n\t“We will build for how kids actually discover and connect today,” Robbins said in a statement. “The opportunity couldn’t be more clear to us, and the time is now. From reimagining timeless IP to discovering the bold, original ideas by emerging creators, we will work with the most talented artists to bring these stories to life.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDenmark’s Ingeborg Topsøe, a fast-emerging screenwriter whose credits include Milad Alami’s multi-prized “The Charmer,” has won this year’s Nordic Series Script Award for Netflix smash hit “Secrets We Keep.”\n\n\tOne of Scandinavia’s most prestigious industry plaudits, the Award was announced Tuesday at the Göteborg Festival’s TV Drama Vision, its TV conference strand and market. \n\n\n\tAlways a frontrunner, Topsøe manages in writing “Secrets We Keep” to pull off a difficult double whammy: an engrossing thriller set in North Zealand, a Copenhagen plush riviera of white stone mansions in which the well-heeled Cecile investigates the disappearance of the neighbours’ au-pair which at one and the same time is packed with social observance – on noblesse-oblige privilege and its economics, as well as parenting, racism and gender violence. \n\t\n\n\tThe scripts also form an excellent platform for the direction of of Per Fly (“Follow the Money”) whose sumptuous visuals layering further social sarcasm on a tight, tense mystery plot, building to Fly’s majestic final shot, loaded with the protagonist’s new-found fuller understanding of her own social horror.\n\n\tProduced for Netflix by Claudia Saginario at Uma Film (“The Opponent,” “The Excavation”) and starring Marie Bach Hansen (“The Legacy,” “White Sands”) as Cecilie, “Secrets We Keep,” shot to No. 1 on Netflix’s global non-English language TV charts on May 15 last year, staying at No. 1 for three weeks and scoring 34 million views – numbers only bettered by only five other Netflix non-English language series in 2025.\n\t\n\n\t“This years’ winner asks the questions: Can intimacy be outsourced? How far are you—as a single individual—willing to go to maintain your position in life? At what cost do you uphold existing power dynamics, both in your private sphere and on a global scale?” the Nordic Series Script Award jury said in a statement. “By confronting us with the harsh realities of human existence – without smothering the audience in numbing escapism – the winner shows that it is possible to combine a compelling, nail-biting whodunit thriller with a strong social commentary.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(L-R) ‘Secrets We Keep’ Simon Sears as Mike Vinter-Jensen, Marie Bach Hansen as Cecile Mike Vinter-Jensen and Lukas Zuperka as Viggo in Reservatet.

The Creative Courage recipient is selected from admissions by the Nordic streamers and broadcasters, the Göteborg Festival explained Tuesday.   \n\n\tThe Creative Courage Award winner was selected by Liselott Forsman, CEO Nordisk Film & TV Fond, and Cia Edström, head of TV Drama Vision at the Göteborg Film Festival.  \n\n\t“We want to honor the commissioners and producers who dared to make this extraordinary horror series come to life by combining a family story with a Sweden in a microcosmos with multiplying vampires on a ferry, they said.\n\n\tWritten by Mats Strandberg and Malin Lagerlöf, “Blood Cruise” was created for television by Mats Strandberg and Chris Andrew.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tElla Langley could hardly have picked a hotter moment to announce the coming release of her sophomore album. Her “Choosin’ Texas” single has become a true phenomenon, showing staying power in the top 5 of the Spotify chart like few country singles ever before it. The tune’s success has more than laid the groundwork for anticipation for “Dandelion,” which will arrive April 10.\n\n\tThe title track will be out on DSPs Friday. Langley issued a minute-long trailer for the album Tuesday, in which she says, “I’ve thought about this record every single day for the last year and a half…. This next record to me has so much growth in it.”\n\t\n\n\tThe album was executive-produced by Miranda Lambert — the country star who is one of the co-writers on “Choosin’ Texas” (and who just made news of her own Tuesday with the sale of her catalog to Sony Music Publishing) — and Ben West. No track list was issued as part of the announcement.\n\n\n\tExplaining the meaning of the title to her, Langley says in the teaser video, “Dandelions are masters of survival, thriving in even the harshest environments. Often dismissed as a common weed, this unassuming plant carries a deeper symbolism of hope, healing, and resilience.” In a press release, she added, “I learned that dandelion tea is actually a natural detox for the liver. So a record called ‘Dandelion’ after a record called ‘Hungover’ made all the sense in the world to me.”\n\n\n\n\n\t“Choosin’ Texas” is currently at No. 3 on the Spotify US Top 50 — one spot ahead of Bruno Mars’ solo comeback single, “I Just Might,” and just behind the new song from Harry Styles and a Djo hit. With the genre generally having had a harder time than pop getting a foothold at or near the top of the streaming chart, country singles have rarely gotten lodged in the Spotify top 5 the way this one has. The fact that it is in a more traditional vein than most songs that make the country chart makes it all the more of a curious and, to many, welcome phenomenon.\n\t\n\n\tThis week, the single is at No. 6 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100. It moves up a notch to No. 2 on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart, after 14 weeks; every other song in the top 20 has taken a greater number of weeks to reach its position, making it one of the fastest country radio risers in recent memory.\n\n\tTwo vinyl editions of “Dandelion” have gone up for sale on Langley’s website — a signed, limited-edition “honey bee yellow” LP, and the standard-edition, unsigned “puffball white” version.\n\n\tLangley’s debut album, “Hungover,” is still riding high after 77 weeks on Billboard’s country albums chart, currently sitting at its high-to-date of No. 6.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscar-nominated feature documentary “Nobody Against Putin” is heading to the 32nd annual Sedona International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe film, which had its world premiere at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, delivers an insider’s view of the impact of Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine on the lives of Russia’s children. Directed by David Borenstein and co-directed by Pavel Talankin, the doc follows Talankin, a Russian teacher in a small town, as he secretly records his school’s transformation into a propaganda and recruitment center following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kino Lorber acquired North American rights to the film earlier this month. On Tuesday, “Nobody Against Putin” received a BAFTA nod for best feature doc\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to “Mr. Nobody Against Putin,” the SIFF lineup includes prestigious 2025 docs from Sundance (“André Is an Idiot”), Venice (“Kim Novak’s Vertigo”), and DC:DOX (“Steal This Story, Please!”).  In all 36 feature docs will screen at SIFF, which runs from Feb. 21 through March 1. The fest lineup also includes 32 doc shorts, 36 feature-length narrative films and 42 animated and narrative shorts.\n\n\n\t“We are looking forward to an epic film festival this year with an extraordinary selection of thought-provoking, inspiring, entertaining and engaging films from around the world,” said SIFF executive director Patrick Schweiss “Film fans can expect to be moved, inspired and entertained for nine straight days with a phenomenal lineup of films, special events and filmmaker conversations, workshops and panels.”\n\n\tThe fest will kick off on Feb. 21 with “In Love With Marilyn,”  a cabaret-style concert show starring Samantha Stevens, celebrating Marilyn Monroe’s upcoming 100th birthday. \n\t\n\n\tSophie Hyde’s “Jimpa,” starring Olivia Colman and John Lithgow, and the Al Pacino meta drama ‘Billy Knight’ will both screen as SIFF Centerpiece movies. “Jimpa” follows filmmaker Hannah (Colman) who takes her trans nonbinary teenager Frances (Aud Mason-Hyde) to Amsterdam to visit their gay grandfather “Jimpa” (Lithgow). “Billy Knight” follows aspiring filmmakers Alex (Charlie Heaton of “Stranger Things”) and Emily (Diana Silvers of “Booksmart”) as they navigate the path between youthful ambition and true artistic expression. When Alex discovers a box of unfinished scripts and a handkerchief bearing the name “Billy Knight,” he sets out to unravel his late father’s creative legacy. Pacino stars as the enigmatic titular figure, described as part muse, part ghost of cinema past.\n\n\tOther SIFF centerpiece films include: Nick Davis’ documentary “You Had to Be There,” about a humble Toronto run of the hippie musical “Godspell” that became a historic incubator for modern comedy; Don Scardino’s narrative “A Break In The Rain,” about grief and reconciliation; Dale Griffiths Stamos’ narrative “Imbalance” about the shifting cultural landscape of higher education during the #Me-Too movement and stricter Title IX regulations; and Stephen Ward’s narrative feature “Dust to Malibu” about a father attempting to reconcile with his estranged daughter on a road trip to scatter her mother’s ashes in California.\n\n\tFounded in 1995 as a three-day exhibition of independent films, SIFF has grown into the largest single annual event in the Sedona community. SIFF seeks to broaden the understanding of the human condition, raise social consciousness, present thought-provoking film and dialogue and entertain and inspire residents of the local community and the world\n\n\tSIFF films will screen at the Mary D. Fisher Theatre, the Alice Gill-Sheldon Theatre, Harkins Theatres Sedona 6, and the Sedona Performing Arts Center. Roughly 20 films will screen daily during the nine-day festival.\n\n\tSIFF panels and Q&A participants will be announced in the coming days.\n\n\tSedona International Film Festival Full Lineup:\n\n\tNarrative Features:\n\n\tA Break in the Rain\n\n\tAnorgasmia\n\n\tBeau Ideal\n\n\tBilly Knight\n\n\tCrossing Delancey\n\n\tDreams\n\n\tDust To Malibu\n\t\n\n\tEthan Bloom\n\n\tFantasy Life\n\n\tFrontier\n\n\tGazelle\n\n\tImbalance\n\n\tIsola\n\n\tJimpa\n\n\tLeads\n\n\tMemo\n\n\tMistake\n\n\tMr. Burton\n\n\tMuganga\n\n\tOmaha\n\n\tOnce Upon My Mother\n\n\tOne Stupid Thing\n\n\tPieces of Us\n\n\tReading Lolita in Tehran\n\n\tShambhala Story\n\n\tSwitch & Bait\n\n\tThe Fallow Few\n\n\tThe Future Awaits\n\n\tThe Marching Band\n\n\tThe Mohican\n\n\tThe Most Precious of Cargoes\n\n\tThe Secret Floor\n\n\tThe Shrowdinger\n\n\tThe Snare\n\n\tTo Move Is Friction\n\n\tZoe\n\n\tDocumentary Features:\n\n\tA Life Illuminated\n\n\tA Life Outside: American Mountain Guides\n\n\tAndré Is an Idiot\n\n\tBest Day Ever\n\n\tBlame\n\n\tComparsa\n\n\tCreede U.S.A.\n\n\tDream Boats\n\n\tDream Touch Believe\n\n\tKim Novak’s Vertigo\n\n\tLittle Singer\n\n\tMozart’s Sister\n\n\tMr. Nobody Against Putin\n\n\tMy Dear Theo\n\n\tMy Sunnyside\n\n\tNatchez\n\n\tPaint Me A Road Out of Here\n\n\tRemaining Native\n\n\tRoad 190\n\n\tRoom to Move\n\n\tSons of Detroit\n\n\tStarman\n\n\tSteal This Story, Please!\n\n\tStronger Than You Think\n\n\tThe Bend in the River\n\n\tThe Chaplain & The Doctor\n\n\tThe Cowboy\n\n\tThe Eyes of Ghana\n\n\tThe Gardener, the Buddhist & the Spy\n\n\tThe Last Dive\n\n\tThe Renaissance Prince\n\n\tTrade Secret\n\n\tUnderland\n\n\tVoices: The Danny Gans Story\n\n\tWider Than the Sky\n\n\tYou Had to Be There\n\n\tDocumentary Shorts:\n\n\tA Mystical Ornithology\n\n\tA Sacred Pause\n\n\tAldo’s Bug Extravaganza\n\n\tArctic Alchemy\n\n\tDeath of a Fantastic Machine\n\n\tDi Sarno – The story of Emilio’s Ballato\n\n\tDivers\n\n\tExodus\n\n\tHouston’s Whitebeam\n\n\tI am everything\n\n\tI Am Somebody\n\n\tIcebreakers\n\n\tJust Jools\n\n\tLa Orquesta\n\n\tLast Days on Lake Trinity\n\n\tMiles of Life\n\n\tMy Memory Walls\n\n\tNice Girls Don’t Ask\n\n\tOld Girl in a Tutu: Susan Rennie Disrupts Art History\n\n\tOn Healing Land, Birds Perch\n\n\tPerseids\n\n\tRovina’s Choice\n\n\tSallie’s Ashes\n\n\tShanti Rides Shotgun\n\n\tThe Birds\n\n\tThe Conscience Files\n\n\tThe Petal Pusher\n\n\tThe Rebel Reef: Seeds of Hope\n\n\tVan Gogh and the Hospital Garden\n\n\tVoices from the abyss\n\n\tWhat The River Knows\n\n\tYour Opinion, Please\n\n\tNarrative Shorts and Animated Shorts:\n\n\tA Matter of Time\n\n\tBabka\n\n\tBeast of the Seine\n\t\n\n\tBeing Dead Should Be Easy\n\n\tBenchless\n\n\tDaniel Van den Berg is Dead\n\n\tDisco Beats\n\n\tDishwasher\n\n\tDon’t be late, Myra\n\n\tEgg Timer\n\n\tEmergency\n\n\tExtinguished Lives\n\n\tFirst Time\n\n\tFitted Sheet\n\n\tFlesh & Blood\n\n\tForevergreen\n\n\tFundbox – A Love Story\n\n\tGrim & Sunshine\n\n\tGrind\n\n\tHigh School Detention The Musical\n\n\tI Love You More Than Dinosaurs\n\n\tI Often Dream of Trains\n\n\tLeaf\n\n\tLonely\n\n\tMassage Therapy\n\n\tMiriam\n\n\tOlive\n\n\tTaste of a Memory\n\n\tThe Art of Inflation\n\n\tThe Demon Core\n\n\tThe Journal\n\n\tThe Lingering\n\n\tThe Other Side\n\n\tThe Reach\n\n\tThe Ride\n\n\tThe Stones of Dunamase Castle\n\n\tThe Vote\n\n\tThe Whistle\n\n\tTwo People Exchanging Saliva\n\n\tUndelivered\n\n\tWaiting for Aphrodite\n\n\tWildKind\n",

Luckily, most of this year’s big awards winners are already available on streaming, or at least available to rent/purchase on Prime Video and Apple TV+.\n\n\tBoth of this year’s biggest nominees — Ryan Coogler’s vampire saga “Sinners,” which earned a record-breaking 16 Oscar nominations and Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” which closely follows with 13 nods — are both available to stream on HBO Max (and Hulu, with this add-on). The Emma Stone-led “Bugonia,” meanwhile, is available to stream on Peacock, while Apple’s “F1” blockbuster quickly landed on Apple TV+ (currently offering a free trial).\n\n\tOther Best Picture nominees include Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Clint Bentley’s “Train Dreams,” both streaming on Netflix; “Sentimental Value,” available to rent on Prime Video; and “The Secret Agent,” available for pre-order on Prime Video. Neither “Hamnet” nor “Marty Supreme” have received streaming homes yet. \n\n\tNetflix picked up 18 of this year’s nominations, meaning they’re all available on the streamer. Buzzy titles include “The Perfect Neighbor,” nominated for Best Documentary, “KPop Demon Hunters,” nominated for Best Animated Feature and two short films: “The Singers” and “All the Empty Rooms.”\n\n\tThe 98th Academy Awards will broadcast live from the Dolby Theatre on March 15, broadcasting live on ABC and Hulu. In the meantime, check out the best way to stream all of this year’s feature film nominees — and a full list of this year’s nominees here. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSinners\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tOscar Nominations: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Score, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Sound \n\n\tWhere to Stream: Hulu (with HBO Max add-on)\n\n\tVariety Review: “It’s vibrant and richly acted, and also a wild throat-ripping blowout.

the beloved films of Studio Ghibli, which have offered some of the most iconic representations of wartime Japan and its long, fraught recovery period. ‘Little Amélie’ starts from a place of (mostly endearing) solipsism and builds empathy and emotional depth as it goes.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tZootopia 2\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit:

House’s past few hits, “Zootopia” has shrewdly established both an environment that could be further explored from countless other angles (in a spinoff TV series, perhaps) and an odd-couple chemistry

Adam died of \"atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease with obesity.\"\n      \n    \n          Adam's dad, Jim Williams, reached out to fans in a Facebook post Monday, writing, \"Our beloved Son . . . your beloved friend . . . died, in essence, of a heart attack in his sleep from health issues he probably never knew he had.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          He continued ... \"Now, we can all stop guessing. Be grateful the Lord allowed him to die at home and not in a foreign country.

Deputies initially went to his Orlando, Florida home for a welfare check, but found nothing out of the ordinary.\n      \n\n          A concerned friend later borrowed a ladder and looked through a third-story window -- spotting Adam lying motionless on a bed. Deputies returned to the home and pronounced him deceased at the scene.\n      \n    \n          Adam rose to fame through his wildly popular YouTube channel, where he chronicled travel adventures, theme parks, roadside oddities, and pop-culture landmarks -- building a massive following along the way.\n      \n    \n          He was 51.\n      \n    \n          RIP\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Social Media\n              \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Death\n              \n                          \n                Viral\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

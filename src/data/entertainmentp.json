    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWhen Broadway star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/aaron-lazar/\">Aaron Lazar</a> was cast for a guest spot on the Amazon MGM series “Countdown,” he wasn’t expecting to bond with star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eric-dane/\">Eric Dane</a> in the way that they did.</p>\n<p>\n\t“When I met Eric and he shook my hand, I could see and feel something was off,” Lazar tells me. “I asked him what was going on. Eric said to me, ‘I think I have what you have.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tLazar was diagnosed with ALS in 2022. When Lazar filmed “Countdown,” it was months before <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/eric-dane-als-diagnosis-1236366684/\" target=\"_blank\">Dane went public with his diagnosis</a>.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was in a wheelchair and I was so nervous they weren’t going to be able to dress me in my suits,” Lazar said, referring to his <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/scene/columns/eric-danes-countdown-cast-als-diagnosis-1236439759/\" target=\"_blank\">“Countdown”</a> wardrobe to play a governor. “But it turns out they knew exactly what to do because they had already been working with Eric and what he had been going through.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/scene/columns/eric-dane-first-carpet-since-als-diagnosis-1236435458/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MORE: Eric Dane Walks First Red Carpet Since ALS Diagnosis, Vows to Keep Acting: ‘It Always Feels Great to Be on Set … I’m Going to Keep Doing It’</strong></a></p>\n<p>\n\tEver since Lazar revealed he was living with the disease, he has made it his mission to educate and inspire—not only about ALS, but any sort of challenge someone may be facing. He went on a year-long speaking tour and earned a Grammy nomination in 2024 for his debut album “Impossible Dream,” which features a “We Are the World”-like rendition of “The Impossible Dream” from “Man of La Mancha” with Sting, Lin Manuel Miranda, Josh Groban, Liz Callaway, Neil Patrick Harris, Leslie Odom Jr., Adrienne Warren, Kelli O’Hara, Norm Lewis and more.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe’s following up his music success with “Impossible Dreams,” a new video podcast series presented by the ALS network, which premieres Tuesday, Oct. 7. Confirmed guests include Mark Cuban, Ben Stiller, Sara Bareilles, Gabrielle Reece, Andrew Rannells and Kristin Chenoweth, among others.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“For me, the podcast is a gathering of stories that remind us of our own power,” Lazar says. “If people walk away from an episode feeling more hopeful, more awake to what’s possible in their own lives, then I’m fulfilling my mission. Our mantra is: live your impossible dreams. My hope is that the podcast helps people do that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLazar’s dream guest is <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/jim-carrey/\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Carrey</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Jim Carrey embodies the heart of what ‘Impossible Dreams’ is about — transformation,” Lazar says. “He’s an extraordinary soul who has consciously cocreated his life. He’s reached the height of success and turned inward to explore meaning, consciousness, and what truly matters. I think his journey mirrors mine in some ways and our conversation would remind people that joy and awakening can coexist.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile there is no cure for ALS, Lazar remains optimistic about the future. “I’ve read more than 100 books over the last few years on healing and the nervous system and putting much of that wisdom into practice. I have learned that with courage, hope becomes faith, and faith when practiced becomes belief, and belief when practiced becomes knowing,” says Lazar, who is the father of two teenage boys with his ex-wife. “What started as a seed of hope from within has been cultivated through a disciplined practice into a way of life. I continue to draw inspiration from books, but mainly draw inspiration from helping other people find inspiration. I guess being an inspiration, having an impact on someone else’s life is an honor that deeply inspires me.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the music video for “The Impossible Dream.”</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-c0_XeFW52M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.pngtiw=639\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.png 639w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.png?resize=150,55 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.png?resize=300,111 300w\" /></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe equation has been reversed on CBS’ recent “Grammy Salute” specials: They were traditionally all-star salutes where the legendary artist being feted makes a cameo appearance at the end (assuming they’re alive). But with a recent Earth, Wind & Fire tribute under that banner and, now, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cyndi-lauper/\">Cyndi Lauper</a> special, we get full-on concerts from those artists, with a selection of guest duet partners. That’s all the better, for anyone who missed Cyndi Lauper’s recent farewell tour — or anyone who didn’t — as she brings more than enough wattage to power two hours on her own in Sunday night’s “A Grammy Salute to Cyndi Lauper: Live from the Hollywood Bowl.” Although, when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/joni-mitchell/\">Joni Mitchell</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sza/\">SZA</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cher/\">Cher</a> turn up, they’re nothing to sneeze at.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“She’s So Unusual,” her first solo album promised us in 1983. This special — exec-produced by Grammys veteran <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ken-ehrlich/\">Ken Ehrlich</a>, Recording Academy head Harvey Mason Jr. and Lauper — is so unusual, too. The risk taken is in how close it comes to being a straight transcription of the show she toured around the country this year, give or take a few superstars and niche guests. There are exactly two talking heads who show up during the duration of the time slot: brief video testimonials from Brandi Carlile and Billie Eilish that barely take up the space of a minute between them. The rest of it is unexpurgated Cyndi, on stage, and not in conversation — that decision possibly influenced by the fact that fans already got a big amount of that in her 2023 Paramount+ documentary “Let the Canary Sing.” This time around with Lauper, the show must go on, and, really, only the show, filmed over two nights at the end of August as her goodbye tour wrapped up at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs far as the “features” go, she is generally very well-matched, diva-wise and otherwise. Country powerhouse (and recent <em>Variety</em> cover subject) Mickey Guyton proves an ideal harmonic blend for Lauper early on, on what may be one of the less familiar numbers of the night, “Who Let in the Rain.” In a memorably long and glittery black coat, John Legend steps out with her onto the ridge that separates the Bowl’s pool seating area from its other boxes for an up-close-and-personal “Time After Time”; he lends a smoother counterpart to her always slightly rawer-feeling tone. Angélique Kidjo and Trombone Shorty add slightly more regionally exotic touches to the already left-of-pop-center New Orleans bop, “Iko Iko.” </p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Shorty returns to sit in with Lauper and Mitchell on the latter legend’s beloved “Carey.” (That’s the one number in which the guest is doing her own number, rather than joining the headliner for one of hers, but in the case of Mitchell, the mountain must come to Mohammed. And Lauper is hardly skipping the chance to use her tribute special to pay tribute herself, to the wolf’s-head-cane-tapping comeback queen.) The presence of SZA adds plenty of extra sparkle on the show’s penultimate duet, “True Colors.” SZA clearly plays well with others, judging from her Kendrick Lamar collab being one of the year’s biggest hits, and she fares just as well belting something a bit closer to the middle of the show-biz road. And there could be no better casting for “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” than Cher, who even got a designer polka-dot pantsuit to match Lauper’s, and makes the star’s signature song sound like it belongs in her catalog, too. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe only collaboration that doesn’t really pay off in these two hours is the one with Jake Wesley Rogers, which gives one of Lauper’s greatest songs, “Money Changes Everything,” an extended coda that is just very… shouty. On the other hand, even if it’s not a musical highlight, you may appreciate that the duet with Rogers ends in a simulated wrestling match, presumably in tribute to Lauper’s early-career friendship with the late Captain Lou Albano (who gets a shout-out much earlier in the broadcast). Wrasslin’ didn’t change everything for Lauper, but it was one of those early signposts that this was an artist who was going to do it her own way, whether that means associations with meaty and beefy types or her longstanding LGBTQ+ allyship.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDid we say a few paragraphs back that this special was not about conversation? Let’s put a substantial asterisk on that, come to think of it, because we only meant it had a (welcome, to us) lack of interview footage. But you <em>will </em>hear her talk. Lauper devoted a lot of her concerts each night this year to storytelling, making it fairly close to her version of a one-woman show, even if she had a full band kicking back behind her while she regaled her audiences with tales of her upbringing, career achievements and setbacks and thoughts about feminism. This “Grammy Salute” offers a surprising amount of those lengthy song introductions, seemingly rendered intact (because the way she tells them, there’d be few easy ways to cut ’em up). All that chat might test the patience of some, but these fairer-weather friends can go do the dishes and come back at 10:50 to hear “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” while fans who appreciate the full measure of her kooky/contemplative personas can settle in for the luxury ride.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong her solo numbers for the night, however serious her themes will become, nothing comes ahead of the 42 years of pleasure, and self-pleasure, that “She Bop” has provided. (When the cameras cut away to a couple of young girls amid the audience reaction shots, you do wonder what the PMRC would make of youngsters being exposed to this smut, if only they’d survived.) On the other hand, “The Goonies ‘R’ Good Enough” is by no means a requisite part of her set, though it’s fun enough to get it anyway, for pure nostalgia and not much else. (Original “Goonies” cast members Corey Feldman and Martha Plimpton get the reaction shots here.) “Who Let In the Rain” is the occasion for Lauper’s first extended introduction of the night, as she explains she wrote it in 1989, at a time when her career was experiencing a sudden dip and she was getting unwanted advice from men in gold chains: “I found myself, instead of the people that made me famous, sitting with people that I ran away from home to get away from.” Surveying her first post-stardom professional failures, she says, “I forgot that you can’t let one chapter eclipse your whole life.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs always, Lauper sounds like one tough Queens cookie, even if she might be accused of being a snowflake, by non-fans who happen upon the special and hear her espousing what we can still consider liberal ideals. Says Carlile, in her video clip: “Thank you for everything that you’ve done for all people, particularly women, and that thank you will never be enough thanks to cover what you’ve done for the queers.” Lauper doesn’t expound on that a lot herself, beyond noting that her costume designer encouraged her to add more glamour for the sake of the gays. But at the end of “True Colors,” when she and SZA let a giant pride flag be blown up over them by unseen fans… well, it may not be enough to scuttle incoming network regulatory approvals, but there is still little doubt that it will not be a welcome sight in all of America right now, and that she’s being especially true in waving it.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOther undertones go unspoken but will be obvious to fans, like “Sally’s Pigeons,” with an introduction Lauper makes mostly about her neighbors … but which her followers will know is about a childhood friend who died from a back-alley abortion. (The “21 years” in the originally recorded lyric has now been changed to “52 years,” to establish that the song still takes place the year before Roe v. Wade was implemented.) None of this is put in the casual viewer’s face, but feminists and the gay community can take, well, pride in how Lauper continues to be a poster girl for their revolutions even as she holds court as your basic eager-to-entertain veteran pop star.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the most telling stories Lauper offers is about the tradition of seamstresses ran strong in her Italian immigrant family, and how she thought, “If they could do that with cloth ” — sewing together disparate elements, that is — “maybe I could do that with music… I was into deconstruction before it was way happening.” But as much as she did it with a marriage of music styles, she actually did do it with cloth, too, even if she wasn’t the one manning the sewing machines. The music may have ended up pretty danged mainstream, but there’s still an interestingly avant-something quality to her changing costuming during the night. (She credits Christian Siriano and Geoffrey Mack for the tour couture.) At one point, she is just a rooster, and at another, she has what looks like part of a black bodice sewn onto the front of a white dress shirt, and at still another, she is starkly wigless. Fashion may be among the least of the things most people watching “A Grammy Salute to Cyndi Lauper” will care deeply about, but in this case, it does make the woman… or at least render the woman’s lifelong career curiosities symbolically large.</p>\n</div>",

    "description": "<div><p>\n\tIt’s been about a year and a half since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/dua-lipa-radical-optimism-houdini-train",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIt’s been about a year and a half since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/dua-lipa-radical-optimism-houdini-training-season-interview-1235945095/\">Dua Lipa released her third album, “Radical Optimism,”</a> a project perfectly suited to soundtrack a pleasant day at the beach. She recorded it during scraps of time on her 2022 tour for “Future Nostalgia,” a record that exhumed the tropes of disco past and mapped them to a contemporary pop sound. “Optimism” wasn’t met with the same enthusiasm as her previous record — perhaps because “Nostalgia,” released at the onset of the pandemic, offered the fantasy of escape at a time when it was needed most — yet it still succeeded in broadening the scope of her pop powers, folding in new influences while refining the bombast of its predecessor.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLipa brought that album to life for the first of four sold-out performances on her “Radical Optimism” tour last night at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum, making for a pop spectacular that never ran out of breath. It’s easy to forget just how many hits she’s amassed since her 2017 self-titled debut — so many, in fact, that her “Barbie” smash “Dance the Night” was relegated to a 30-second blip during the encore — yet here they were on full parade for nearly two hours, strung together like a greatest hits retrospective without coming across as a grab at, for lack of a better word, nostalgia.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt 30, Lipa is a curious artist, one who clearly attained Main Pop Girl status with “Future Nostalgia” but feels separated from the trappings that come with it. She doesn’t have as rabid a fan base as her peers — her fandom name is “Loves,” in case you were wondering — yet she manages to occupy a space of her own in the competitive world of pop. She’s present in the discourse but doesn’t oversaturate the conversation, giving us glimpses into her glamorous life with regular updates on social media, carefully curating her persona as an alluring yet ultimately unattainable figure.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s why her “Radical Optimism” tour felt so immediate. Lipa was fully present and in fuller command, never missing a note or a cue as she played ringleader to a backing band and dance crew. If we’re talking about living the life of a showgirl, then Lipa surely lives up to its demands with at least five glittery outfit changes (fur boa and floor-length coat included), lasers galore and vanity mirror light bulbs flashing on the screens behind her. She embraced the “Optimism” aesthetic with the set, designed like a cresting wave to mirror her much-discussed album cover, and punctuated the most explosive moments during songs like “Break My Heart” and “Hallucinate” with jettisons of confetti.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s something to be said about how much Lipa has improved as a performer since her early days of gigging across town at the Belasco and Hollywood Palladium. Her dance moves have been memed to death (some called her most viral one the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PooDad09JEU\" target=\"_blank\">“pencil sharpener”</a>), yet these days, there’s little reason to needle them. She was constantly on the move, flanked by dancers on the lip of the stage for “One Kiss” and strutting down the walkway to the throbbing beat of “Electricity.” The only times she stayed still were to really center the song, standing in a swirling ring of fire on “Love Again” and posing as the nucleus of her band for a spot-on cover of Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain.”</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tAnd then there’s the voice. One of Lipa’s most significant attributes is the husky tone of her mezzo-soprano, lending a gritty roughness to her songs’ pop polish. Perhaps the most dynamic vocal moment of the entire evening came during “Falling Forever,” when she stood atop the stage and brought out two backup singers mid-song. The music cut out, leaving the three of them to deliver powerful harmonies before the band kicked back in. It was joyous and elevated, the type of sophisticated touch that reinforced that this was more than just your average pop show.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe only time the evening felt like it could have fallen off the rails was during her crowd work. She descended into a barrier between the stage and pit, taking selfies and chatting with clearly starstruck fans who struggled to respond. But she handled it with grace, as she tends to do, running along the lip of the B-stage and slapping hands with audience members as the very hard-working crew members dismantled and assembled new stage setups in real-time.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIf “Radical Optimism” felt like a more measured successor to “Future Nostalgia,” as some fans complained, her show at the Forum may be cause for its reconsideration. “Illusion,” “Maria” and “Training Season” felt just as vibrant as “Levitating” and “Physical,” as if she assembled them all on the same sparkly factory line. That’s part of her charm, that no matter how much she tinkers with her formula, she manages to make it all feel specifically her. That she’s able to bring it all to life and tie such a neat bow on it is yet another testament to how singular she remains in the ever-changing pop landscape.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/channing-tatum/\">Channing Tatum</a> is getting candid about navigating the movie business.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring a recent appearance on “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4etz4t5QzN8\">Hot Ones</a>,” the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/roofman/\">Roofman</a>” star said that in the current state of the industry, it feels like actors are “incentivized” to appear in subpar productions for money rather than take a big swing on something “really, really good.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I think, now, when you get asked to do a movie, or you’re trying to get a movie made, it’s a very confused pipeline of possibilities,” Tatum said. “It really feels like, at times, that you’re incentivized to make bad things to get paid, rather than make something really, really good, for the fucking people that actually get to see these things and [for the type of] people that I want to see these movies, the person that I was when I was a kid. And I want good movies.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added, “I’m like, ‘Man, I want to give my money to the good movies.’ It’s such an upside-down moment, but I do believe that the disruption is going to lead to something good. I do believe that. I do believe the streamers came in for a reason, and it had to change. It had to morph.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLater in the episode, Tatum took a few jabs at his past work. When asked about his 2010 romance “Dear John,” he called it “such a generic” movie. When speaking about his role in 2024’s “Deadpool & Wolverine,” he said he doesn’t feel like “part of” the film since he was only “in it for two seconds.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not the first time Tatum spoke up about Hollywood’s troubles. In his <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/features/channing-tatums-roofman-avengers-doomsday-1236502009/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Variety</em> cover story</a>, the “Magic Mike” star said that streamers have caused serious confusion in the entertainment industry, both “for good and bad.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The streamers came in and effed up the industry a bit — for good and for bad. The studios are confused; the streamers are confused,” he said. “You’re incentivizing me to go make a subpar movie — a B script, a programmer that isn’t special.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSee Tatum’s entire “Hot Ones” episode below. </p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4etz4t5QzN8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>",

On Sept. 10, over 3,900 industry names, including Emma Stone, Olivia Colman, Ayo Edebiri, Lily Gladstone, Mark Ruffalo, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/stars-sign-pledge-complicit-israeli-film-companies-1236511010/\" target=\"_blank\">pledged to avoid collaboration</a> with Israeli film companies that are “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWeeks later, 1,200 names from Hollywood, including Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik and Debra Messing, signed an<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/global/liev-schreiber-mayim-bialik-reject-israeli-industry-boycott-letter-1236528982/\"> open letter denouncing the boycott</a> of Israeli film institutions. The letter stated that “to censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective and a form of collective punishment.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a>‘s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-fate-of-ophelia/\">The Fate of Ophelia</a>” has premiered online on YouTube, just a little over 48 hours after it had its first bow on the big screen in theaters nationwide. The elaborate music video for the lead single from her new album is joined as a YouTube exclusive by the lyric videos for all 11 remaining tracks from her smash “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-life-of-a-showgirl/\">The Life of a Showgirl</a>” album.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ko70cExuzZM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\tThe “Fate of Ophelia” video, directed by Swift herself, features Swift and her dancers and other participants from the Eras Tour moving exuberantly through a variety of costumes and settings. The star’s looks in the video include her being pictured as as a classic showgirl with Marilyn Monroe-style platinum-blond tresses; a brunette go-go dancer out of the 1960s; an Esther Williams-style bathing beauty in a Busby Berkeley/MGM musicals tableu; and a raven-haired actress walking a pirate’s plank in an old-school theater setting. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tTheater owners often complain about short theatrical windows, and they don’t come any shorter than the barely-more-than-two-days that “The Fate of Ophelia” and the lyric videos were exclusively on cinema screens this weekend as part of the program dubbed “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift-the-official-release-party-of-a-showgirl/\">Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</a>.” But you won’t see many of those cinema operators complaining, in this case. “Release Party” was always advertised as a three-day-only affair, and while Swifties knew in advance that much of the material in “Official Release Party” would go online on Sunday night, they <em>still </em>flocked to theaters anyway. The theatrical presentation landed with a boffo<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/box-office/taylor-swift-release-party-showgirl-box-office-debut-smashing-machine-bombs-1236540485/\"> $33 million U.S. box office gross</a> for its Friday-through-Sunday limited run. (Furthering the incentive to flock to theaters, “Release Party” did include elements that are not going up on YouTube, at least at present, like behind-the-scenes footage and spoken introductions to each new song.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThose who saw “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl” in theaters got plenty of context for the making of the “Ophelia” music video and the intent behind it.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The idea I came up with for this music video was sort of a journey throughout all these different ways in which over time periods, historically, you could be a showgirl,” Swift <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-official-release-party-showgirl-what-we-learned-1236538556/\">said after premiering the video in the theatrical presentation</a>. “Like, how you would be in the public eye back during the 1800s, when you’d sit for a Pre-Raphaelite painting. Or you could be a showgirl by being a cabaret burlesque club performer. You could be a theatrical actor putting on a performance. You could a Vegas showgirl. You could be one of the girls in the Busby Berkeley screen-siren era of the ‘30s and ‘40s. You could be a pop singer on the Eras Tour.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/So-Glamorous-Cabaret.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/So-Glamorous-Cabaret.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/So-Glamorous-Cabaret.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/So-Glamorous-Cabaret.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Taylor Swift</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTAS Rights Management\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tOne of the reasons for her excitement over the “Ophelia” video is that “is that we got everybody back together from the Eras Tour,” she said. “All of the performers that you saw on that stage are back in this music video, as well as so many of the people who worked behind the scenes to create the Eras Tour.” That includes everyone from the dancers to production designer Ethan Tobman and choreographer Mandy Moore.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no appearance from Travis Kelce, but a football does make a cameo, as, during the lines “Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes,” Swift catches a ball thrown her way and then immediately tosses it behind her. (In the BTS footage in the movie, Swift is heard worrying about her lack of football experience, before pulling the move off with aplomb.)</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s not a big spoiler to say that the music video ends with a recreation of the album cover image of Swift mostly submerged in a tub in full glam attire. What many fans may not know is that this was all borrowed from a classic painting.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the denouement of the “Ophelia” video, Swift “wanted to match the framing ideally to the album cover and kind of just frame it exactly like that, so that people are like, ‘Oh, so the cover is a reference to the Ophelia painting, and this ending is a reference to the cover.’ So, art history for pop fans!” The painting she’s referring to is a circa-1850 painting of the Shakespearian character Ophelia by British artist Sir John Everett Malais, which portrays the doomed woman floating and singing in the water before she drowns herself, as described by Gertrude but not directly portrayed in “Hamlet.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Ophelia drowned because Hamlet just messed with her head so much that she went crazy and she couldn’t take it anymore, and all these men were just gaslighting her until she drowned,” Swift explained. But in her version, “what if the hook is that you saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia? Like. basically you are the reason why I didn’t end up like this, tragic, poetic hero girl, who passed away in a fictional world?”</p>\n<p>\n\tAdmitting that it might sound like “a stupid thing to say,” Swift goes ahead and declares: “I love Shakespeare… It holds up. It’s actually not overhyped! And I love those tragedies so much. I fall in love with those characters so much that it hurts me that they die. … This is now the second song where I’ve gone back in and (am) like, ‘Yo, what if they got married instead of they die?’” (The other one she’s referring to is, of course, “Love Story,” which lets Romeo and Juliet off the double-suicide hook.)</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s deeper meaning to some of the other imagery in the music video than might first be intuited by viewers. For instance, that classic movie-musical scene in which she and all the dancers are wearing bathing caps and carrying life preservers… it celebrates the famously swimming movie star Esther Williams, cineastes will now, but it’s also, yes, an Ophelia reference. “Right now we are sitting on the set of what we’re kind of calling our Busby Berkeley-inspired, MGM, screen queen 1930s and ‘40s” motif, she says, “and we’ve got it looking kind of a little bit like a beach/swim/pool thing. And <em>that’s</em> a play on Ophelia.” The Shakespearian character drowned herself, as previously noted, but in her movie-musical homage scene, “we’ve got these lifesaving devices, which could have prevented that from happening,” she pointed out, with tongue firmly in cheek.</p>\n<p>\n\tViewers also learned, in the movie presentation’s behind-the-scenes footage, how a certain very handsome bread came to make a cameo. She is seen going over the shots planned for the next day and remembering that some loafing around is planned. “Oh, I can bake the bread… Can it be my bread? Can my bread be in the music video?” she says. The next day, she is delighted to personally add that to the set design. “This is a really exciting day for me as a baker,” she says, “because my bread is actually a music video star as of today.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOne point that comes up as the dancers learn their choreography: “The Fate of Ophelia” was not actually played on-set, to avoid leaks. And so the dancers required extra direction because of that. “We’re in secret sauce,” she said, between takes, as she directed on-set. “No one’s hearing this track. All anyone’s hearing in the room is just click. So I also have to be able to inform the dancers, ‘You need to feel this in this moment.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tYouTube views will go some small way toward the massive consumption total that her “The Life of a Showgirl” album has been racking up prior to the video’s online release. Luminate reported Saturday that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-album-sales-first-day-billboard-million-showgirl-1236540366/\">new album had sold 2.7 million copies on its first day</a> (including pre-orders). That one-day tally gave it the second-best sales total for any full week since the advent of Soundscan in 1991, trailing only the first-week total for Adele’s “25.” With six days of sales yet to come after that opening day, not to mention a full week of streaming numbers — including this new video — Swift may be poised to break Adele’s all-time record in the days to come.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 11 lyric videos — which are rolling out on YouTube one by one, starting with “Opalite,” following the “Ophelia” online premiere — have the onscreen lyrics backed by repeating video loops of Swift that were shot on the “Ophelia” set.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3PJC6uPIekc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tDuring a recent appearance on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0B0SrmyTQ&t=179s\">MSNBC</a>, Oscar-nominated director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rob-reiner/\">Rob Reiner</a> issued a call to action against Donald Trump. He said it is “our job now” as influential voices to fight against the president’s insertion of the National Guard into major cities, as well as his attacks on free speech. He added that Trump’s efforts to “commandeer the election” through redistricting must be stopped before the 2026 midterms.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s beyond McCarthy era-esque,” Reiner said. “That feels quaint compared to what’s going on in America right now. The Hollywood community is very much aware of their First Amendment rights being infringed. So, we’re well aware of what’s happening. But our job now, as communicators, is to start communicating to the rest of the country, to let them know what is going to happen to them.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added that “the two big things” an “autocrat” needs are “control of the media” and “military control of the streets.” For the first, Reiner cited ABC’s recent suspension of Jimmy Kimmel after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fcc-chairman-brendan-carr-downplays-role-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236526391/\">an alleged threat from the FCC</a>. For the second, Reiner is most likely referring to Trump’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/california-newsom-trump-administration-national-guard-deployment-rcna235726\">recent deployment</a> of 300 California National Guard troops to Oregon. The Trump administration has already deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Make no mistake; we have a year before this country becomes a full-on autocracy, and democracy completely leaves us,” he added. “And we’re looking at the election in 2026, and Donald Trump knows that in a free and fair election, he will lose. He will lose the House, the House will flip and will become in Democratic hands. There will be committee chairs who will be able to hold meetings, and this is the last thing he wants.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the entire conversation below. </p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yR0B0SrmyTQ?start=179&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-great-north/\">The Great North</a>” has been canceled at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fox/\">Fox</a> after five seasons, <em>Variety</em> has learned. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re so grateful for everything Wendy, Lizzie, Loren and the amazing cast and crew put into ‘The Great North,’” said Michael Thorn, President of Fox Television Network. “It’s difficult to say goodbye, but we’re thankful for the five hilarious seasons ‘The Great North’ brought to the iconic Animation Domination lineup.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe animated comedy originally debuted on the broadcast network in January 2021 and wrapped up its fifth, and now final, season in September 2025. The series was created and written by “Bob’s Burgers” executive producers Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin, as well as writer Minty Lewis. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Molyneux sisters served as executive producers and showrunners. “Bob’s Burgers” creator Loren Bouchard was also an executive producer. The series was a 20th Television Animation production, and animation was produced through Bento Box Entertainment.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series starred Nick Offerman, Jenny Slate, Will Forte, Paul Rust, Aparna Nancherla, Dulce Sloan, Megan Mullally, and Alanis Morissette. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe official logline for the show stated that it followed “the Alaskan adventures of the Tobin family, as single dad Beef (Offerman) does his best to keep his bunch of kids close – especially his only daughter, Judy (Slate), whose artistic dreams lead her away from the family fishing boat and into the glamorous world of the local mall. Rounding out the family are Judy’s older brother, Wolf (Forte), and his wife, Honeybee (Sloan), middle brother Ham (Rust) and 10-year-old-going-on-50 little brother Moon (Nancherla). While their mother is not in the picture, Judy seeks guidance from her boss, Alyson (Mullally), and her imaginary friend, Alanis Morissette (voicing herself), who appears to her in the Northern Lights.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFox announced in April that it had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-simpsons-family-guy-bobs-burgers-american-dad-renewed-four-seasons-1236355159/\">renewed Animation Domination stalwarts</a> “The Simpsons,” “Family Guy,” and “Bob’s Burgers” for four more seasons each. In addition, “American Dad” is officially returning to Fox for the 2025-2026 season, likewise with a four-season pickup. Other Fox animated shows include “Krapopolis,” “Grimsburg,” and “Universal Basic Guys.” </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tJames (Jim) Mitchum, a film and television actor and son of Robert Mitchum who appeared in over 35 titles between 1949 and 1994, died on Sept. 20 at his home in Skull Valley, Ariz. He was 84.</p>\n<p>\n\tBorn in 1941, Mitchum grew up in Los Angeles, where the young family is said to have lived in a converted chicken coop behind his grandmother’s West Hollywood bungalow before his father became successful enough to rent a house nearby. When Jim was born, his family recounted that Robert Mitchum was appearing as a Russian peasant in a small theater production and rushed to the hospital in full make-up, where he paced the floor with the other expectant fathers. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jim-mitchum/\">Jim Mitchum</a> entered the industry at an early age, getting his first movie role in a Western at age eight. By 16, his striking resemblance to Robert got him cast as Robert’s brother in the 1958 movie “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/thunder-road/\">Thunder Road</a>,” directed by Arthur Ripley. Robert also produced the film, which followed a group of Southern whiskey runners getting into chases and conflicts with federal agents. Jim’s character was a mechanic, and while getting into the role, he learned enough about engines to briefly become a stock car racer and real mechanic, notably working on Elvis Presley’s vehicles.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPresley inspired Mitchum to consider a career as a singer, and he signed a contract with 20th Century Fox, where he recorded the single “Lonely Birthday” in 1961.</p>\n<p>\n\tThough Mitchum’s singing career did not blossom beyond the single, his acting career continued to grow. He appeared in 11 film and television titles in the 1960s, notably acting alongside George Peppard, Albert Finney and George Hamilton in “The Victors,” Fabian and Shelley Fabares in “Ride the Wild Surf,” John Wayne and Kirk Douglas in “In Harm’s Way” and Hugh O’Brien and Mickey Rooney in “Ambush Bay.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMitchum was cast in Dennis Hopper’s “The Last Movie” in 1971. The film shot in Peru and Jim made a short behind-the-scenes documentary about the experience working with Hopper, Peter Fonda and Kris Kristoffrson on the notorious project. The documentary was titled “The Last Movie Movie.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFour years later, Mitchum starred in “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/moonrunners/\">Moonrunners</a>,” a film with a premise similar to “Thunder Road” that was later redeveloped into the hit TV series “The Dukes of Hazzard.” </p>\n<p>\n\tMitchum was married three times, first to late actress Wende Wagner in 1968. They had one son, Will Spence Mitchum, in 1969 and the marriage ended in 1978. He remarried to Vivian Ferrand in 1985 and they had two children together; Brian Price Mitchum was born in 1988 and Caitlin Ann was born in 1989. They divorced in 1995. He met his third wife, Pamela K. Smith in 1993 in Arizona, and the couple married earlier this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tMitchum moved to Arizona after retiring from acting in 1994. He helped manage his parents’ horse ranch, overseeing breeding and racing operations. He also developed lines of premium moonshine, traditional corn whiskey and “Robert’s Rye Whiskey” in homage to his father and his iconic moonshiner roles.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe is survived by his wife Pamela, brother Christoper Mitchum, sister Petrine Day Mitchum, daughter Ana Liljeback, son Will Spence Mitchum (Els), stepdaughter Tiffany Mitchum Greene (Doug), son Brian Price Mitchum, daughter Caitlin Ann Mitchum (Blaine Muir), grandsons Jack Durham Mitchum, Wagner Bernard Maximus Mitchum, and granddaughters Paige Mitchum and Winnry Marie Mitchum Muir.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT: </strong><em>This story contains spoilers from “Like a Keith in the Night,” Episode 7, Season 2 of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/peacemaker/\">Peacemaker</a>,” now streaming on HBO Max.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAfter being fired from her high-level position at A.R.G.U.S, Emilia Harcourt (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jennifer-holland/\">Jennifer Holland</a>) is frustrated with a world that has seemingly abandoned her, even after she helped save humanity from being taken over by butterfly-like aliens. As Season 1 teased the growing attraction between Harcourt and Christ Smith (John Cena), the second season revolves around the fallout between the two, and how it has affected the people around them. When Chris discovers a device that allows him to transport to a different dimension, he finds himself falling in love with a different version of Harcourt inside an alternate reality, Earth X, where he is well-respected as an American hero.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s until we learn in Episode 6 the truth about the different dimension Chris has found solace in, revealing that the alternate dimension is what it would’ve been like if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/peacemaker-lex-luthor-cameo-nazi-twist-no-superman-1236530679/\">Nazis had won World War II</a>, and a world where no minorities are allowed to exist. As the 11th Street Kids open the doorways between dimensions to find Chris and bring him back home, Harcourt grapples with her feelings for him, forcing her to confront everything that she has been running from.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHolland spoke to<em> Variety </em>about Harcourt and Chris’ interrogation room confession, why she chooses to attempt to kill Keith (David Denman) in the final moments of Episode 7 and fighting off Nazis in Season 2.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow early in the pre-production process did you learn about what would be happening with Harcourt for Season 2? Did you discuss it with James Gunn — the show’s creator, and your husband — or is that something that he kept as a secret?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI obviously have a close relationship with James, and he’ll share different plot points with the story and run it by me. I learned a lot of what was going on with Harcourt’s story early on, but not everything. Sometimes, James holds things close because he’s afraid something might change in the writing process. From the very beginning, he had very rough early outlines of the show that were completely different. We had early conversations about Harcourt’s relationship with Rick Flag Jr., and that being the genesis of her deep vitriol and hatred towards Peacemaker [in Season 1]. \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThroughout this season, Harcourt gets herself into two pivotal fight scenes: In Episode 1, she gets into a bar fight with a group of men, and then in Episode 7, she fights back against A.R.G.U.S, who are revealed to be Nazis in their respective dimension. What was it like to shoot both of those scenes?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt’s pretty different, such as the bar fight scene. We rehearsed for weeks and it was really draining. It was a difficult two days, but I had an incredible time with the best stunt and fight coordinators. The bar fight was incredibly emotionally charged, because it has things about Harcourt that we haven’t explored yet are coming out in that aggression. The fight scene in A.R.G.U.S. [in Episode 7], I walked onto set, and learned that I was going to learn a fight sequence that I had never learned before. Fortunately, with the stunts team, they had worked with me with multiple other fights prior to this one in this episode so I knew what to expect. It was so fun, because I got to throw a “Mein Kampf” at a Nazi’s face. It was pretty amazing.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tChris and Harcourt finally get to have a conversation about their feelings in the interrogation room, where he confesses his love for her. Harcourt can’t bring herself to say it back to him, but you can tell that everything she feels for him has been shown throughout the season as she’s actively fighting to get him back to their dimension. \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tShe doesn’t want people to know she’s feeling all kinds of emotions. She still doesn’t want Chris to know how vulnerable she is, and what’s really going on inside. I think we as human beings have a hard time expressing our feelings, because we’re always stuffing them down and not allowing ourselves to feel our feelings on a daily basis. It’s why she’s having a hard time throughout her life right now, because she’s not allowing herself to feel anything. In some ways, she’s faced with this do or die situation to tell him now or he’s not going to come back, and yet she still can’t tell him how she truly feels. </p>\n<p>\n\tIf I look at it from Harcourt’s perspective, she’s basically saying what Chris wants her to say, even though she can’t say the three words he’s looking for. She can’t be as good on the surface with her emotions as he is. She’s thinking, “Isn’t it enough that I’m telling you that I want you to come home? I’ve come all the way to this other dimension to tell you I want you back.” He needs her to say it, and she just can’t. It’s a well-written scene from James, and I had an incredible time performing that scene with John, because he was so available and present throughout filming. \n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDo you think Harcourt’s decision to protect Chris by killing Keith is her way of making her feelings for Chris known?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWhen I read that scene, I was like “She’s doing this,” even though she knows that if Chris ever finds out that she killed him, he will never forgive her. It’s the one thing that he cannot accept. He found his brother alive, which is something that when you don’t have someone throughout your whole life, you think about the idea a lot. With my mom who passed away and my dad who passed when I was very young, sometimes I wish I could pick up the phone and call them. You daydream about the ability to have a relationship with them, and Chris has gotten that with his brother, even if he’s from a different dimension. He can’t watch Keith die again in front of him.</p>\n<p>\n\tHarcourt makes that decision despite the fact that she knows that it’s not what Chris wants, but she has to do it to protect him, and to make sure that she doesn’t have to watch over his shoulder all the time wondering if Keith would kill him. It’s a crazy decision for her to make, even though she’s not able to go through with it because she has to make the decision between her life and taking his.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAs we lead into the Season 2 finale, where does Harcourt find herself in the crossfire between A.R.G.U.S. and Chris?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tAt this moment, she’s just feeling like he’s given up. They have avoided his capture this long, and she’s put herself on the line [for him] multiple times, especially with her job. He’s not just giving up on himself, but he’s sacrificing himself for the rest of the team. She’s faced with this question in her own mind about what she will do from here. Chris is taking the fall for everyone, so are they all just going to stand there and see if maybe they can fix it in the future? She’s panicking a little bit, because she just can’t believe that he’s [throwing everything away] after, even though she gave him everything he was asking for in the interrogation room. A lot of questions are answered in the finale, and the finale poses more questions to be answered soon.</p>\n<div>\n\t<p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p></div>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT: </strong><em>This story discusses plot developments from “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/monster-the-ed-gein-story/\">Monster: The Ed Gein Story</a>,” currently streaming on Netflix. </em></p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/vicky-krieps/\">Vicky Krieps</a>‘ role in “Monster: The Ed Gein Story” is a result of the series’ often fantastical storytelling. In the season premiere, Ed (Charlie Hunnam) is shown a comic book by his love interest Adeline (Suzanna Son) that features the deadly exploits of “The Bitch of Buchenwald,” Ilse Koch. Koch was a real-life Nazi war criminal, played here by Krieps, whose sick specialties include flaying the skin off of Jewish people and making objects out of it like lampshades. But taking the role was not an easy choice for Krieps, until co-showrunner Ryan Murphy explained how the two killers’ stories came together. Krieps spoke to Variety about why she came around on the controversial role and her family’s personal connection to the Holocaust.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat research on Ilse did you do before you took the role?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tFor me to accept the role was actually part of the journey. I wasn’t ready to play such a role, because my grandfather was in a concentration camp. This part of history is very close to me and my family, and so I was very worried to do that on TV, whether it would be done respectfully. It scared me: What would happen to me if I would revisit this? So the research was the easy part for me, because since I was eight years old, I had read all the books on the Holocaust that you can find. What helped me was knowing that it’s based on a comic character, and therefore Ed Gein’s fantasy of her is through the comic. That was freeing to me, and why I felt I can do this, because this is actually clearer, portraying someone who’s larger than life. To me, she was like a mix of an old Hollywood star and a ’50s housewife who wants to be perfect. Because she wants to be so perfect, she doesn’t realize that what she’s doing is going over dead bodies.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMy research was more, “How do I embrace being the actress who’s just portraying a fantasy, a comic?” And then obviously knowing how her story ends made me feel like we have something here. We never saw Hitler or any of them really realize what they’ve done. It’s not like she really understands and there’s real remorse, but there’s definitely something, and it goes into becoming crazy. She goes crazy in the end by understanding what she did, and I thought this was very important that many people can see one of those people actually go down. Then I just went for it.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhen you’re playing somebody so evil, do you have to work to find a shred of humanity that you can hold on to?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think what helped me to get in, the final piece of the puzzle, was when I understood that she is very much like some people today, and all she wants is to be perfect. She wants to be the perfect woman and have the perfect life and the perfect house and the perfect husband. If she has to cure for that, then this is what she will do, this sick perfectionism. That was really what helped me into the character and into her evilness. It also immediately made me think of Hannah Arendt. She wrote this <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1963/02/16/eichmann-in-jerusalem-i\" target=\"_blank\">important piece</a> about the evil in everyday life. The evil is in the kitchen, it’s in the house, it’s in private, that is the most human kind.</p>\n<p>\n\tI feel like I understood very much what Ryan wanted. It’s a whole question of, “What is the monster?” The monster may be us, because a lot of evil in the world is done because we believe that we know who’s the bad guy, or we think we know <em>what</em> the monster is. Obviously, the monster and the bad guy is always the other, and I think the only way to move forward as a society is accepting that <em>we</em> are the other and we are the monster, and we are the bad guy. All of us. This is how I understood it, and this is how I tried to approach it. It was important for me to give her so much humanity that you ask yourself, “Why do I like this woman now? Why do I feel sorry for her when she’s bad, bad, bad?” I just find this whole question fascinating because of my family and my background. But I didn’t expect it to be so fun and really freeing to portray.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYour character is weaved into Ed Gein’s story in a complex way. Was it difficult to visualize how the two stories mixed at first?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI really had to trust Ryan. And I think this is why it took me 3 emails to finally say yes, because I needed to trust him. Reading the script, I was like, “This is so crazy. I don’t really understand how this is going to go together.” From the moment on the donkey, I was really like, “What? I have to sit on a donkey in my underwear, really? How is that supposed to be serious?” And all the way to the ham radio, which is something they wrote as we were shooting. I hadn’t read the ham radio episode when I started it, and when it came, I didn’t understand anything because there is nothing to be understood. It just doesn’t work. We live in different centuries, so it’s all in his mind. Ryan and [co-showrunner] Ian [Brennan] and [director] Max [Winkler] really want to create something artistic. If you want to create artistic stuff, you have to, at some point, just give up and trust whatever, your intuition. So we really just trusted it to be crazy, but it makes sense in the end.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow familiar were you with Ryan Murphy’s universe before signing on to “Monster”?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI hadn’t seen too much TV. I have two little kids, and I was always busy with that, so I hadn’t seen his work. I had seen “Hollywood,” but didn’t know it was related to him. People told me, “Oh, it’s Ryan Murphy,” you know. So we had a Zoom call. He explained it to me, and I liked the person I was speaking to. I had the feeling there’s someone who’s intelligent and who really wants to tell something and who really needs me to help him tell that world. So that was always an important factor. Then I went to watch his stuff, and I was so amazed and happy that I got to see “Feud” — I loved it. I couldn’t believe when it ended. I just wanted to continue watching these two women, or the Capote one, all these worlds. It’s just so beautiful. That was one of the reasons why I said yes, because I had the feeling that he would take care and he will make it so that this part of history is not going to be just used to create sensation. Now I’m a fan.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou’re in the upcoming Lizzie Borden season of “Monster.” What can fans expect?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThey can expect that it’s, again, going to be one of these worlds that you just want to dive into and stay with these people. It will be a feminine world. And I think this has not yet happened in that way in Ryan Murphy’s universe. In his universe, this will definitely be the feminine planet. We will have fun playing on it, and I hope the fans will have fun watching it.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>",

    "description": "<div><p>\n\tIn “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift-the-official-release-party-of-a-showgirl/\">Taylor Swift: The Official Releas",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIn “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift-the-official-release-party-of-a-showgirl/\">Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</a>,” the preeminent pop star of our time introduces the 12 tracks on her 12th album, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-life-of-a-showgirl/\">The Life of a Showgirl</a>.” Seated before a painted forest backdrop (very Shakespeare), she takes a few minute to sketch in the background of each song, describing each one of them like the kind of artist who regards everything she writes with total and equal love, as if the songs were her children — though in this case, she has a clear favorite. That would be “The Fate of Ophelia,” which opens the album and is its obvious standout track. As soon as I heard it I thought: This one’s going to kick in and last. It opens with what sounds like Coldplay piano chords, which then expand into a dance groove of infectious maximalism that isn’t too far from the wheelhouse of Lady Gaga. It all builds to a hook that won’t quit — the exultant way that Swift lets loose on “Oh-<em>feel</em>-ia…”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tYou can tell Swift knows what a terrific song it is, because in “Official Release Party…” she shows the complete video for it (which she wrote and directed) not once but twice, she includes an extended backstage clip of herself at the computer coming up with visual ideas for it, and she sprinkles scenes from a “Making of ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ video” throughout, so that we keep returning to the song.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe song’s video, which envisions Tay as “showgirls” from different historical eras (a cabaret burlesque performer, a Busy Berkeley bathing beauty, an artist’s model posing for a pre-Raphaelite painting, a Vegas showgirl), is an elaborate multi-set fusion of analog and digital, with intricate sets that feed into each other, as Swift hops through identities and eras. Near the end of “Official Release Party…,” she then comes on and talks about what the lyrics mean to her. Ophelia, driven mad by the unstable actions of Hamlet, could almost be a character out of a Taylor Swift song — a romantic martyr dealing with a suitor who has more troubles than she does. But as Swift explains it (and maybe this is what accounts for why it’s such an ecstatic song), Ophelia, in “The Life of a Showgirl,” is the anti-Taylor — the lost soul who Swift sees she could have been had she not chosen a healthier and happier way, which as she describes it is something that The Eras Tour helped her do. Hence the happiness of the whole record.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBut “Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” like the album this 90-minute, in-theaters-for-only-two-days Taylor Swift special has been designed to market, can’t come close to sustaining the high of “The Fate of Ophelia.” You leave the theater with that song buzzing in your head. The rest of the numbers have an airy dance-pop shimmer and a winning clarity of message, but most of them don’t quite make it up the stairway to hook heaven.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe video for “Ophelia,” too, is unlike the others, which are lyric videos. They feature Taylor, and Taylor alone, against digitally enhanced art backdrops that are skewed and fractured through what looks like a rectangular-lensed kaleidoscope. It’s a kind of cut-rate psychedelic effect, and not a bad one, but it’s a bit puzzling to see it used for every one of the videos. Between that and the fact that Swift, in costume, is the only figure in them (though she’s often multiplied), there’s a samey-sameness to the presentation that starts to make the effect into that of a single extended video.</p>\n<p>\n\tI couldn’t help but notice that the showgirl idea, which makes “The Life of a Showgirl” sound like a concept album à la Madonna’s “Confessions on a Dance Floor,” is there in Swift’s costumes and music-video demeanor, but with the exception of the song “Elizabeth Taylor” (“If you ever left me high and dry, I’d cry my eyes violet”), it isn’t actually reflected in many of the album’s lyrics.</p>\n<p>\n\tI raise the issue because “Official Release Party…,” which is launching “The Life of a Showgirl” as a kind of fan-friendly theatrical weekend bash (let there be no doubt that Taylor Swift has the power to bring people into movie theaters), is less of a cornucopia of imagery than you might expect. The “Fate of Ophelia” video is irresistible, and it’s fun to see Tay, in one sequence of the “Making of” video, decked out in a frosty platinum-blonde wig as a Marilyn/Jean Harlow Hollywood chorus girl, dancing on chairs backstage with her comrades. But as the lyric videos glide along, the effect of that kaleidoscope (there’s actually an opening title warning viewers about the stroboscopic quality of it) becomes more like animated wallpaper. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe stories the lyrics tell can be compelling, and a couple of the choruses approach hook status, like “Opalite” (in which Swift uses man-made opals as a metaphor for the idea that you have to create your own happiness), or her scathing reconfiguration of George Michael’s “Father Figure,” or “Wood,” a double entendre (about knocking on wood for good luck, but also…the other kind of wood) that had the audience I saw it with laughing out loud. As the latest in the series of confessional/accusatory pop cantos that are Taylor Swift’s albums, “The Life of a Showgirl” has what it takes to connect with her galaxy of fans, but “Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” while it may become a prototype for how Swift releases albums in the future ($35 million worth of tickets sold in two days can’t be wrong), is at once a punchy celebration of Swift’s artistry and a piece of promotion that just exposes aspects of the album that may not wear so well over time.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe third season of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ryan-murphy/\">Ryan Murphy</a>’s “Monster” anthology series arrives on Netflix on Oct. 3. The eight-part miniseries, this time titled “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/monster-the-ed-gein-story/\">Monster: The Ed Gein Story</a>,” focuses on the eponymous serial killer, who confessed to killing two women in the 1950s and was the culprit in a long list of additional depravities that shocked the nation and redefined notions of American violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tPortrayed by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/charlie-hunnam/\">Charlie Hunnam</a> in the series, Ed Gein was born in La Crosse, Wis., in 1906. The son of an alcoholic named George and a religious zealot named Augusta, Gein was raised alongside his brother Henry in a disturbingly strict household. The family moved to a farm in Plainfield, Wis., when Ed and Henry were children, where Augusta hardly let them leave the property besides going to school. She read them the Bible and taught them to fear the outside world as a sinful and dangerous place.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGeorge died in 1940, leaving Ed and Henry as the family’s breadwinners. Both started working jobs off of the farm, and Henry eventually married a woman from town. Ed, meanwhile, only grew more attached to his mother with age.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFour years later, Henry died in a brush fire on the family farm. Ed was attempting a controlled burn that got out of hand and Henry’s body was found after firefighters put out the flames. Heart failure was determined as the cause of death, as Henry’s body was not burned or injured, though some have since suspected intentionality on Ed’s behalf.</p>\n<p>\n\tShortly after Henry’s death, Augusta suffered two paralyzing strokes, intensifying her and Ed’s isolated, co-dependent relationship before her death in 1945.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAfterwards, Ed boarded up his mother’s rooms in the farmhouse, keeping them pristine as he began living in squalor. He took odd jobs around Plainfield, even babysitting local kids. In his isolation, though, he developed a fascination with pulp magazines and violent stories about Nazis and cannibals. He was particularly interested in Ilse Koch, the Nazi wife who made lampshades out of Holocaust victims’ skins.</p>\n<p>\n\tGein was relatively enigmatic for these years, until 1957, when he was suspected and subsequently arrested for kidnapping Bernice Worden: a local hardware store owner who disappeared shortly after Gein made a purchase at the store. When law enforcement searched Gein’s property, they found Worden’s body skinned and decapitated, hanging in Gein’s barn. In the house, they found her severed head and heart preserved in bags. Around the property, they discovered additional bones, body parts and human skins fastened into masks, furniture and other trinkets.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring questioning, Gein not only confessed to murdering Worden, but admitted that he had exhumed bodies from various nearby cemeteries. He led investigators to the desecrated gravesites, which corroborated the evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Gein’s house, investigators also found the skull and severed face of Mary Hogan: a tavern owner who had gone missing in 1954. Gein admitted to having shot her.</p>\n<p>\n\tGein said that he was motivated by the desire to make a full-body suit out of these women’s skins, planning to occupy them and become his mother reincarnated.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther than Hogan and Worden, Gein’s subjects were all exhumed cadavers, though he is suspected to have been involved in the disappearance of additional women and girls from the area. Particularly, some suspect him of having kidnapped and killed 8-year-old Georgia Jean Weckler and 14-year-old Evelyn Grace Hartley, neither of whom have ever been found. Nevertheless, no substantial evidence has ever proved Gein’s culpability.</p>\n<p>\n\tGein’s trial was just as dramatic. One of the officers questioning Gein assaulted him during the interrogation, making his initial confessions inadmissible in court. When the trial eventually happened, Gein was tried with first degree murder and pled guilty by reason of insanity. He was arraigned, diagnosed with schizophrenia and found unfit for trial.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe spent the next 11 years in state hospitals for the criminally insane before finally going to trial in 1968. He was ultimately deemed not guilty by reason of insanity, but was forced to spend the rest of his life in a mental hospital before dying of respiratory failure at the age of 77 in 1984.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore the trial, the Gein farmhouse was destroyed in a fire and his case became infamous. So much so that Alfred Hitchcock implemented elements of the story into “Psycho.” He based Norman Bates, the film’s murderous, oedipal antagonist on Gein, solidifying Gein as the new image of a serial killer in the American zeitgeist.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter the trial, Gein also served as the inspiration behind Leatherface in Tobe Hooper’s “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” and since his death, has inspired Buffalo Bill in “The Silence of the Lambs,” Garland Greene in “Con Air” and Dr. Oliver Thredson in Ryan Murphy’s very own “American Horror Story: Asylum.” Other films have been based on Gein’s story more directly, including 1974’s “Deranged,” 2001’s “Ed Gein,” 2007’s “Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield,” 2010’s “Ed Gein, The Musical,” 2003’s “House of 1000 Corpses” and 2005’s “The Devil’s Rejects.”</p>\n<p>\n\tEvidently, “Monster” is far from popular culture’s first attempt at recreating Ed Gein’s story, but like Murphy’s previous “Monster” installments about Jeffery Dahmer and Eric and Lyle Menendez, the series will explore the man with unprecedented depth, intensity and (for better or worse) entertainment value.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlongside Hunnam, the show also stars Laurie Metcalf as Augusta Gein, Lesley Manville as Bernice Worden, Vicky Krieps as Ilse Koch, Tom Hollander as Alfred Hitchcock, Olivia Williams as Hitchcock’s wife and collaborator Alma Reville, Joey Pollari as Norman Bates actor Anthony Perkins and Will Brill as Tobe Hooper.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe show also features Suzanna Son as Gein’s romantic partner Adeline Watkins, Robin Weigert as Adeline’s mother Enid, Charlie Hall as Worden’s son, Tyler Jacob Moore as the Sheriff that assaulted Gein, Mimi Kennedy as Perkins’ notorious psychologist Dr. Mildred Newman and Addison Rae as Evelyn Grace Hartley.</p>\n<p>\n\tEvidently, the show spans more than just the events of Gein’s gristly crimes. It dissects the origins, impact and aftermath of this true American horror story.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tViolence and sexuality walk hand-in-hand in “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bone-lake/\">Bone Lake</a>,” a new thriller now playing in theaters via Bleecker Street. In fact, the film opens with a nude couple running away from certain death through the forest, an attention-grabbing opening. </p>\n<p>\n\tThat wild spirit is what attracted director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mercedes-bryce-morgan/\">Mercedes Bryce Morgan</a> to Joshua Friedlander’s twisty script about two couples who accidentally double-book an Airbnb. As they get to know each other, dark and sinister secrets start to emerge.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’s something that wasn’t afraid to be extreme,” she says of the script. “I’ve been so excited about thrillers coming back and the fact that this movie doesn’t shy away from sex. But I’m also attracted to the fact that it’s like a European relationship dramedy. We start off, and you really care about these characters, because the relationship is the mechanism that the horror goes through later. To be able to have that but then actually pay it off and go big or go home in the end made me go, ‘OK, this is what I’m interested in.'”\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mercedes-Bryce-Morgan-BTS.jpeg 1363w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mercedes-Bryce-Morgan-BTS.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mercedes-Bryce-Morgan-BTS.jpeg?resize=300,214 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mercedes-Bryce-Morgan-BTS.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Bone Lake” director Mercedes Bryce Morgan on set.</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Bone Lake\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWhile Gen Z has been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/sex-on-screen-ucla-study-gen-z-teens-young-adults-1235768046/\">oddly outspoken</a> about wanting less sex in their entertainment, Morgan thinks that most audiences will be able to ride the film’s wavelength.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Everything is 180, right?” she says. “Either we think skinny jeans are cool and then we’re like ‘Baggy pants are cool’ — I’m pretty sure skinny jeans are going to be cool again. So I think it’s a generational thing. As a millennial, we’re like, ‘Sex in movies … of course.’ I think younger generations probably go, ‘You guys fucked up so many things. Why are you doing this?’ The thing that I say is the people who love this movie are the people who are going to come and see it. And if it’s not for someone, that’s okay. But it makes the people who love our movie just a stronger fan base.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, Morgan was sure to make the sexuality safe and comfortable on set by setting some ground rules.</p>\n<p>\n\t“First of all, if there’s female nudity, I make sure that there’s male nudity. It’s either everyone’s nude or no one’s nude, to equal it out,” she says. “It was also talking about, ‘What’s the story reason behind why we’re seeing something?’ Nudity is almost even more fun or interesting sometimes if it’s not used in a sexual context.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother key to making an erotic thriller is to make sure the cast has chemistry, and Morgan was able to amp that up with a decidedly G-rated exercise.</p>\n<p>\n\t“One of the first things I did is when Alex Roe and Andra Nechita got to set to play Will and Cin … It might sound silly, but I had them just dance to fun, silly music together because you’re able to get comfortable with someone physically fast,” she says. “That’s a really easy way to do it. They probably thought, ‘Man, Mercedes, this is like in kindergarten. Why are you having us do this?’ But I go, ‘We need to break down these barriers and just integrate with each other.'”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat sense of play kept Morgan energized during the indie film’s shoot, as well as its long road to theaters. “Bone Lake” first debuted at Fantastic Fest in 2024, making it over a year from its world premiere to wide release date. She remains energized and excited for audiences to see it.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Whenever I choose a movie, I need to love it so much that I expect to carry it around for years of my life,” she says. “So one could be like, ‘Man, it’s been so long,’ but also we wanted to wait to do it the right way, because the right way is for us to release it in theaters. Also, my job is getting to talk about sex and silliness. So just being able to continue to do that with this, I go, ‘All right, I’m fucking here. Let’s go.’ That’s awesome.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the “Bone Lake” trailer below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQy7BuW-R6c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>",

And by Dec. 22 at 8 a.m. they were like, do not move.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBy January, he was performing a tango and a Bob Fosse number for director Bill Condon. Shortly after, he was cast for the dual role of Luis Molina and Kendall Nesbitt in the musical adaptation of Manuel Puig’s novel, a role that earned William Hurt an Oscar in the 1985 film version. The part required extreme physical transformation. Coming off the Netflix hit “Carry-On,” Tonatiuh had to drop nearly 50 pounds in just over a month.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn this Season 12 episode of the <em>Variety </em>Awards Circuit, Tonatiuh opens up about landing his breakout role in musical which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In addition, he shares stories about how he’s navigated the industry, how his Latino identity is his superpower and what he wants people to know about him.

I also get to play Kendall Nesbitt in the secondary world,” he notes. “If Molina is somewhere in the middle, I want Kendall to be traditional masculine aesthetic and energy, and then there’s an opportunity for us to explore full femininity within the show as well.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the film’s most powerful sequences, the musical number “Where You Are,” created an unexpectedly emotional moment for the actor when his mother visited the set. “Here I am next to Jennifer Lopez as she’s singing these words to me, and my mom is watching it,” he recalls. “I’m like, what meta, realness is happening in this moment?”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe scene features Lopez’s character, Aurora, pulling Molina into a movie fantasy — art imitating life for an actor whose own dreams were once considered impossible. When his mother met Lopez on set, she went up to her and thanked the superstar for giving her son the opportunity. Lopez’s response stuck with him: “I didn’t give him an opportunity. He earned it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTonatiuh has grown frustrated with conversations that treat Latino success in Hollywood as surprising or exceptional. Armed with statistics, he’s ready to flip the narrative.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We are in a Latino Hollywood Renaissance. Latinos are Hollywood. I am not a Latin actor. I’m a great actor. Jennifer Lopez is not a Latin talent. She is a great talent,” he declares. “Latinos are 24% of the U.S. moviegoing audience, that’s one in four tickets. In 2023 alone, $2.7 trillion was created and spent by Latino audiences. That’s more than New York and Texas economy.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe continues: “I don’t want to participate in that anymore. This puts greatness back on our name.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe role of Molina represents a breakthrough performance. Moreover, it marks a return to authenticity after years of making himself “palatable.” In fourth grade, when his family moved to West Covina, a teacher looked at his name and said she couldn’t pronounce it.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I changed my name to Matt, from fourth grade to junior year (of high school). I self-colonized. I even forced my own parents to change my name to Matt.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLater, as he pursued acting professionally, industry advice pushed him to alter his presentation. “I was told by a person who I think was trying to help me that the way I presented, and moved throughout the world, would never get me the career that I wanted. And so I changed everything about me.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThat strategy worked — he landed a series regular role and a studio film. However, something was lost.</p>\n<p>\n\t“With Molina, I returned to the totality of my being,” he says. “It wasn’t compartmentalization any longer. It was a remembrance that from my most feminine to my most masculine — is me. My Latinidad and my Americanness is me. My love for cinema and love for musicals is me.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHis message for anyone who can’t accept that? “They can choke on all of who I am.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen informed that only five Latino men have been nominated for best actor in Oscar history, with just one winner, Tonatiuh admits he didn’t know the statistic. The revelation clearly moves him.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It would be pretty great and I want my work to speak for itself, and if I become a part of that, then incredible, but I want it to be because of the craft, not my identities,” he says.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe sees the current moment as critical: “Especially because Latinos and queer people everywhere are being asked to make themselves small. And I’m like, we come from a long line of resilient and beautiful people in history. I think it’s time to remember our dignity and to remind people of our worth.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the Oscar buzz surrounding “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” which opens in theaters Oct. 10, Tonatiuh remains focused on what’s next. “I’m looking for job security, boo. I’m like, let’s get, let’s go. Let’s find another one.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe’s particularly interested in Broadway, hinting at a specific play he’s been working to option. And when someone recently suggested he could play a villain in a Bond movie, his response was characteristically bold: “Yeah, but what if I was Bond? Yeah. Why not? What if I was born to be Bond?”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yes, he can do a British accent.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor now, he’s content to let audiences discover — or rediscover — him through Molina, a character who refuses to be diminished even in the darkest circumstances. “Let me reintroduce myself,” he says with a smile.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Also on this episode, Oscar nominee <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/hailee-steinfeld-sinners-viral-scene-mcu-spiderverse-1236534420/\">Hailee Steinfeld, one of the stars of “Sinners” from writer and director Ryan Coogler</a>.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

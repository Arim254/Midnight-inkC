    "body": "\n\tA first wade into feature filmmaking for L.A.-based indie Mexican American music label Rancho Humilde, “Clika” recalls the low-budget films that first cashed in on the newfangled rock ’n’ roll craze of the mid- to late 1950s … or the hip-hop-centric ones that arrived a quarter-century or more later. Like them, its rags-to-riches-to-near-ruin storytelling is simplistic, the celluloid craftsmanship B-grade, the acting nothing to write home about. Still, there’s a sense of a fertile cultural moment being captured for posterity, however routinely. \n\t\n\n\tStarring frontman JayDee of the trap corridos outfit Herencia de Patrones as an aspiring singer-songwriter in north-central California, the modest enterprise was originally scheduled for release months ago, then delayed till the doldrums of January instead. As that might lead you to expect, there’s not much to be wildly enthused about here, past the representational plane. But if director Michael Greene’s sophomore feature shortchanges the musical performances that should be its main selling point for a pedestrian crime-drama arc, this nonetheless emerges a painless diversion, one likely to become a guilty-pleasure favorite for fans of the acts showcased. \n\n\n\tIn agriculturally-focused Yuba City (which is near state capital Sacramento), red-bearded JayDee’s protagonist Chito is doing what his family has done for generations, since they first emigrated from Mexico: working in the fruit fields. It’s peach harvest season, so he’s toiling in the heat every day alongside mates Flaco (guitarist Uziel Pantoja) and Blunt (comedian Daniel “DoKnow” Lopez), a jester who is serious about producing his friends’ original music. But no one here has any industry connections. \n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Chito’s family home is at urgent risk of bank foreclosure, with his proud mother Mari (Nana Ponceleon) currently unemployed and sibling Chuy (Josh Benitez) deep in med-school studies. Forever stressing “There is no shortcut to your dreams, mijo,” his mom has written off her long-absent husband’s brother Alfredo (Cristian “Concrete” Gutierrez) as a bad influence, even if the marijuana he traffics is now legal. But since peach-picking isn’t covering the bills, Chito has little choice but to accept Uncle’s offer to make “runs” with these smokable goods to far-flung dispensaries. \n\n\tIt is work that exists in ethical gray zones, involving some dubious strong-arm personalities and operations. But it is lucrative, such that soon Chito has paid off the bank, equipped Blunt’s home studio and splashed conspicuous cash in other directions. He’s also shot a casual music video that goes viral, making those dreams of music-biz success look like they might come true after all. It won’t take long before these factors stir suspicion from disapproving Mari and our hero’s churchgoing new girlfriend, Candy (Laura Lopez). Nor will the consequences be pleasant once his new cockiness leads to conflict with Uncle Alfredo, as well as perilous paths-crossings with bigger honchos played by the omnipresent Eric Roberts, recently deceased fave screen villain Peter Greene and rapper Master P.\n\n\tJayDee has an amiable, stonerish presence. But he is no actor, certainly not enough to carry even this unchallenging script. Internal changes we’re meant to register are beyond his expressive range, so they get rotely articulated instead via on-the-nose dialogue and some like-minded supporting turns. \n\n\t“Clika” is a big step up from Greene’s 2018 narrative feature “Live,” an ersatz found-footage thriller that was exasperating and dull even by that subgenre’s typically low standards. Still, he doesn’t have the finesse to draw much out of non-professional actors or to get more than predictable, sometimes broad notes from his professional ones. The film wants to evoke a strong sense of place and culture, but numerous aerial shots alone can’t dimensionalize a community. They definitely do not make up for a lack of texture and nuance in the team-hatched screenplay, or in an uninspired overall cinematic style. Emotional depth and suspense both seem out of reach in a story that moves along briskly enough, without ever feeling like more than a formulaic outline. \n\t\n\n\tWhat’s curious is that “Clika” spends so much time on things it doesn’t know how to do well, and so little on the most enjoyable element here: any scene where JayDee is singing. Even a concert sequence toward the end, which you’d expect to comprise the climax, is over very quickly. \n\n\tHerencia de Patrones fans may find that choice frustrating, while viewers hoping for a proper introduction to an unfamiliar musical scene will likewise go away disappointed. Beyond Michael “Nomad” Ripoll’s original backing score, “Clika” soundtracks no less than 36 cuts by Rancho Humilde artists. That is fodder for further, home-listening study — as utilized, they don’t get much chance to make an impact. Nor does anyone onscreen have anything illuminating to say about whatever fresh developments in Música Mexicana that JayDee & co. represent. \n\n\tStill, there is something to be said for the fact that this watchable if largely innocuous, ineffectual drama leaves you feeling it’s onto a good thing … just a thing the movie itself doesn’t showcase particularly well. \n",

    "body": "\n\tFor Indonesian filmmaker Wregas Bhanuteja, trance rituals aren’t about the supernatural or exotic — they’re about joy, community, and the many different ways humans find happiness. In “Levitating” (Para Perasuk), his latest feature competing in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition at Sundance, the director explores these themes through the story of a young musician’s obsessive quest to become a spirit channeler, even as outside forces threaten his village. \n\t\n\n\tVariety is exclusively debuting a clip from the film.\n\n\tSet in an Indonesian village where trance parties led by shamans and spirit channelers are common practice, the narrative follows Bayu, a 20-year-old musician aspiring to become a spirit channeler, as he navigates a selection process to save the village’s sacred spring from outside interests.\n\n\n\tBhanuteja graduated in film directing from Jakarta Institute of Arts in 2014. His short film “Lembusura” competed at the Berlinale in 2015, followed by a best short film win at Cannes Critics’ Week with “In the Year of Monkey” in 2016. His short “No One is Crazy in This Town” competed at Sundance in 2020. His feature debut, “Photocopier,” premiered at Busan in 2021 and swept the Indonesian Film Festival with 12 Citra Awards. His sophomore feature, “Andragogy,” had its world premiere at Toronto in 2023 and played Busan.\n\n\t“I grew up with a younger sibling who, as a child, claimed he could see spirits in our house, be it giant creatures with tails, bats, frogs. I couldn’t see any of them, and I remember feeling oddly jealous,” Bhanuteja says. “While I was stuck in the ordinary world, he seemed to be playing with something invisible, warm, and alive.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director emphasizes that in his childhood environment, spirits weren’t treated as frightening. “They lived alongside people, coexisted with daily life,” he says. “And as I began researching more, I realized this wasn’t unique to my childhood or even to Indonesia. In different parts of Indonesia – and in many places across Asia and the world – there are communal gatherings where people dance, enter trance, and leave feeling lighter, satisfied, released.”\n\n\tRather than depicting trance as exotic or mysterious, Bhanuteja wanted to explore it as an everyday communal experience. “What interested me was something much simpler: how many different ways humans find joy in life,” he explains. “Trance and sambetan [healing ritual] in this film are shown as everyday communal experiences, moments where people step out of their routines, let go of pressure, and reconnect with others.”\n\n\tThe film also examines what happens when one version of happiness becomes dominant. “When people become obsessed with their own standards of success or progress, they often end up dismissing or even harming other ways of living,” Bhanuteja says. “In the film, that tension takes the form of an outside force trying to take away Latas Village from its people.”\n\n\tFor the trance choreography, Bhanuteja collaborated with choreographer Siko Setyanto to create original movement rather than replicate existing traditions. “All of the choreography in the film is fictional. It isn’t taken from any specific cultural dance or ritual,” the director notes. “From the start, I wanted to avoid pointing the movement toward one tradition and instead create a physical language that felt intuitive and universal.”\n\n\tThe team selected specific animal spirits – deer, buffalo, leeches, fleas, ants, and softshell turtles – which Setyanto translated into movement. “We then imagined that each animal spirit opens a different hallucinatory environment. So the choreography was designed to respond to that world,” Bhanuteja explains. “For example, in a realm where everything tastes intensely pleasurable, the movement centers on the mouth and hands. In a realm where people feel weightless and able to fly, the choreography shifts toward the legs and jumping.”\n\n\tThe choreography developed organically from composer Yennu Ariendra’s music. “Siko responded to the music instinctively, where his body moving first, without overthinking. That instinctive process was essential,” says Bhanuteja. “Authenticity for us didn’t came from sensation rather than explanation.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director sought actors willing to embrace physical transformation. Lead actor Angga Yunanda “already had Bayu’s intensity inside him,” according to Bhanuteja. “He trained for months, learned a traditional wind instrument, reshaped his body for animal-based movement, and pushed himself very hard, which mirrored Bayu’s obsession in the story.”\n\n\tFor the spirit channeler role, Bhanuteja cast Anggun, whom he felt was instinctively right. “Her voice carries authority, but also intuition. We didn’t ask her to ‘act’ the chants. She responded to music in real time, creating mantras instinctively, in single takes. That rawness couldn’t be rehearsed,” he says.\n\n\tActor Maudy “entered a completely different space, learning to express emotion through movement rather than words, exploring vulnerability through animal-inspired dance,” the director adds.\n\n\t“The process was not about reaching perfection, but about letting go of control, filters, and performance habits,” Bhanuteja explains. “Only through that kind of surrender could something more honest emerge – a desire that isn’t acted, but felt. When that happens, I believe the audience can sense it immediately.”\n\n\tDespite the film’s specific cultural context, Bhanuteja believes its core emotion is universal. “That emotion is obsession,” he says. “Bayu’s obsession with becoming a perasuk (spirit-channeler) slowly pulls him away from the true essence of the trance party – which is joy, connection, and being present. And that’s something many of us recognize.”\n\n\t“At a festival like Sundance, where audiences come from many different backgrounds, I hope the film resonates not because of its cultural details, but because of that shared feeling,” Bhanuteja says. “The reminder that when we chase something too hard, we risk losing the simple human connections that matter most.”\n\n\tWatch the clip here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tScentbird is stepping onto the runway. The fragrance subscription platform has signed on as the first-ever scent brand to integrate directly into “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”\n\n\tThe partnership will debut with the Jan. 23 episode, which will introduce a Scentbird fragrance wall in the Werk Room — the series’ creative hub — with a dedicated mini challenge slated to appear later in the season. \n\n\n\tAlongside the on-air presence, Scentbird is launching the “Yasss Queens! Collection,” a curated lineup of scents inspired by this season’s cast members and available exclusively through the platform. The assortment includes fragrances from Confessions of a Rebel, Heretic, DS & Durga, Phluid Project, Moodeaux and additional niche labels, “each selected to reflect the individuality, self-expression and boundary-pushing ethos that have long defined ‘Drag Race,'” according to a statement.\n\n\n\tThe “Drag Race” integration builds on a growing slate of entertainment-driven activations from Scentbird. In recent years, the brand has partnered with major studios and IP holders on pop culture–forward collaborations, including a fragrance collection tied to “Agatha All Along,” and even experiential cinema, teaming with Sony Pictures and Regal Cinemas on immersive movie activations that incorporated curated fragrance moments into theatrical screenings.\n\n\tMeanwhile, beauty partnerships have long been embedded in the DNA of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” which has served as a launchpad for makeup brands looking to tap into drag’s outsized influence on mainstream beauty culture. Earlier seasons famously spotlighted Anastasia Beverly Hills, whose brow products became a recurring fixture (sculpted arches are a drag staple). The franchise later aligned with NYX Professional Makeup as a long-running sponsor, integrating product placement into challenges, Werk Room usage and prize packages. More recently, Morphe has stepped in with high-visibility integrations, supplying brushes and palettes for challenges.\n\n\n\tNew episodes of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” airs on MTV every Friday at 8 p.m., and streams on Paramount+ the next day.

    "body": "\n\tOlympians were bundled in cashmere and vintage wool on the opening night of Sundance, courtesy of J. Crew’s new U.S Ski & Snowboard collection. \n\n\tTeam USA skiers Nick Page, Tess Johnson and Lauren Macuga found reprieve from the sub-30 degree weather on Thursday night at Main Street’s Firewood restaurant for a dinner hosted by Variety and J. Crew celebrating the brand’s partnership with Team USA ahead of the 2026 Olympics. \n\n\n\tVariety On the Road to Cortina Presented by J. Crew took place in the restaurant’s darkly lit, cabin-esque downstairs dining room, where guests sipped on specialty Alpenglow cocktails before being ushered to their seats, topped off with J. Crew gift bags. For dinner, attendees enjoyed a cozy meal consisting of Tenderloin steak, a Winter Gourd dish and an assortment of sweet treats and coffee for dessert.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSundance serves as a homecoming of sorts for both Macuga and Page, who attended high school together in Park City — a longtime pipeline for elite U.S. ski talent. Both have emerged as two of Team USA’s most compelling young winter sports standouts. However, Macuga, who suffered a torn ACL in late November, will not be able to compete at this year’s Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, where she had been considered a medal hopeful in downhill and super-G. The injury required surgery and forced her to miss the remainder of the 2025-26 World Cup season.\n\n\t“I’m just a little bit saddened,” Macuga said through tears during a panel hosted by Variety editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh. “But I get to go there and cheer on my teammates and hopefully watch them win some medals.”\n\t\n\n\tAlso in attendance was iconic U.S. alpine skiier Picabo Stree,  who told Page that both her sons have his autograph “on the wall in their rooms.” “I have to get yours next,” he quipped from stage.\n\n\tLater, Libby Wadle, CEO of J. Crew; Sophie Goldschmidt, President and CEO of U.S Ski & Snowboard; and Kelvin Ulrich, Chairman of the Board of J. Crew, took the stage to discuss their three-year partnership, which they say they already plan on expanding.\n\n\t“It was one of the most authentic fits,” Goldschmidt said about their joining forces. When asked about her first impression of the collection, she admitted that she “normally has an opinion on everything.” “It’s really annoying actually,” she joked. But when she saw the new pieces, “I literally had nothing to say. It was like, ‘Check, check, check!’ It was exactly what we dreamed it would be.”\n\n\tRooted in J.Crew’s longtime connection to alpine life and après-ski dressing, the collection spans refined knitwear, elevated loungewear and essential cold-weather accessories for women, men and kids, finished with exclusive vintage-inspired patches. Creatively, the collection draws heavily from the brand’s archives. The partnership also expands into performance territory via a ski capsule developed with Kappa, U.S. Ski & Snowboard’s official on-mountain partner, featuring technical jackets for women and men that blend high-performance functionality with polished mountain style.\n\n\tSo, how do you break through in the fashion world? Setoodeh pointed out that similar to indie film, it has become difficult to stand out in an increasingly saturated landscape. “It’s about authenticity” Ulrich said, adding that plopping a celebrity in a campaign isn’t effective if not done intelligently. “Just having someone who looks great on a billboard isn’t necessarily going to sell clothes.”\n\n\t“People want to be inspired,” he continued. “It’s hard to find inspiration. How do you do that? Partnering with inspiring organizations. For us, that’s Team USA Ski & Snowboard.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDiane Sawyer and ABC News Studios are behind “The Turpins: A New House of Horror – A Diane Sawyer Special Event,” which will air on ABC on Feb. 3 at 10 p.m. ET. The one-hour interview will be available to stream the next day on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\n\tThe Turpin case made headlines in 2018 when 13 children and adult dependents, ranging in age from two to 29, were rescued from their biological parents’ home in Perris, California.\n\n\n\tSawyer first interviewed two of the Turpin daughters in 2021, including Jordan Turpin, who initially reported the case to the police. The upcoming special will cover the stories of three more Turpin siblings speaking out for the first time about their experience in the foster care system, facing abuse again after their parents’ imprisonment.\n\t\n\n\tIn January 2018, then 17-year-old Jordan Turpin escaped and called 911 after overhearing her parents discuss moving the family to Oklahoma. The police raided the residence and uncovered disturbing evidence, including human excrement, decaying garbage, dead pets, and moldy food, in addition to the other 12 children, who were found with bruises on their arms, appearing frail, and caked with dirt, with some shackled to their beds.\n\n\tParents David and Louise Turpin were both sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years in December 2019. The couple was charged with 12 counts of torture, 12 counts of false imprisonment, seven counts of abuse of a dependent adult, and six counts of child abuse, with David receiving an extra charge of a lewd act on a child under 14.\n\n\tSawyer’s first interview, “Escape From A House Of Horror,” drew more than 7 million viewers in its initial airing. “The Turpins: A New House of Horror – A Diane Sawyer Special Event” is produced by ABC News Studios. David Sloan is senior executive producer and Christina Ng is executive producer.\n\t\n\n\tHere is the key art for the special:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHere’s a first look:\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSam Asghari is speaking out against dog ear cropping.\n\n\tBritney Spears’ model and actor ex-husband stars in a new PETA campaign urging people to stop cropping their dogs’ ears.\n\n\tAsghari appears shirtless in the ad, alongside his dog Porsha, underneath a message that reads, “Listen Up, Never Crop Your Dog’s Ears.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn a video accompanying the ad, Asghari says, “Ear cropping involves hacking off the majority of the ear, which is full of nerves and extremely sensitive, and taping up the remnant into the unnatural shape.”\n\t\n\n\tThe procedure, also known as otoplasty, is commonly performed on Dobermans, Great Danes, boxers, pit bulls and other breeds.\n\n\n\tAs the same time, Asghari is sending a letter to the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show calling for the event to ban dogs with cropped ears.\n\n\tThe 150th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show takes place on Jan. 31 and Feb. 2-3 in New York City.\n\n\t“Five years ago, I welcomed a sweet Doberman named Porsha into my family, floppy ears and all,” he wrote in the letter, which is addressed to Kennel Club president Donald Sturz. “When presented with the option to crop her ears, I was horrified. I couldn’t imagine voluntarily putting her through excruciating pain, many long-term health risks, and the inability to fully express herself—all for the sake of ‘a look.’ I love Porsha exactly as she is.\n\n\t“It saddens me to see so many dogs of the same breed with mutilated ears, which is why I’m asking you to prohibit cropped ears in the Westminster Dog Show,” he continued. “It’s impossible to justify a cosmetic procedure that causes real suffering and provides zero benefit to the dog.”\n\t\n\n\tUrging Sturz to “bring this cruelty to an end,” Asghari’s letter also reads, “Westminster is one of the most influential stages in the dog world. What happens in that ring doesn’t stay there; it shapes public behavior. Allowing this inhumane practice sends the message that cropped ears are normal and even desirable. You don’t have to perpetuate this harm. Please protect dogs and celebrate them as they are by removing cropped ears from the breed standards and banning them from competition.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe SCAD TVfest is back for its 14th year, with big honors and all-star casts. The Atlanta festival, taking place Feb. 4-6, will highlight both unscripted and scripted series, as well as new and returning programs.\n\n\t“We are truly living in a golden era of television — one where the bar continues to rise and storytelling grows bolder and more ambitious every year,” says Christina Routhier, senior executive director of SCAD Theaters and Festivals. “It’s an honor to bring some of the most popular and influential series in television today to SCAD TVfest in Atlanta, from cultural touchstones like ‘The Pitt,’ ‘Abbott Elementary’ and ‘Bridgerton,’ to beloved returns such as ‘Scrubs’ and ‘The Comeback,’ along with reality television royalty including ‘Survivor’ and ‘The Great American Baking Show.’”\n\t\n\n\tShe adds, “There is something for everyone, and most importantly, for our SCAD students specializing in film and television — who are gaining a front-row seat to learn directly from their mentors and future collaborators.”\n\n\n\tShows that will have presence in panels and discussions include “Rick and Morty,” “Neighbors,” “The Pitt,” “Deli Boys,” “56 Days,” “Cross,” “The Great American Baking Show,” “For All Mankind,” “Primal,” “Bridgerton,” “Abbott Elementary,” “Survivor,” “Best Medicine,” “Hal & Harper,” “Scrubs” and “The Comeback.”\n\n\tAdditionally, multiple awards will be given out during the event. Quinta Brunson will receive Variety’s Creative Showrunner Award, an honor previously given to the Duffer brothers, Charlotte Stoudt, Jen Statsky, Paul W. Downs and Lucia Aniello, and Sterlin Harjo. Brunson will be the first actor to receive the honor, as both the star and creator of the ABC hit “Abbott Elementary.”\n\t\n\n\tIn 2022, she became the first solo Black woman to win the Emmy for comedy writing; the following year, she became the first Black actress to win lead comedy actress in over 40 years — and the second ever. In 2025, she continued breaking records, becoming the first Black woman to earn three comedy-writing noms for a single series.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tElsewhere at the festival, “Bridgerton” will receive the Outstanding Achievement in a Series accolade, accepted by Golda Rosheuvel (Queen Charlotte) and Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury).\n\n\tAttendees will get a first look at “Survivor” 50, plus host and showrunner Jeff Probst will be honored with the Legend of Television award. The Luminary Award will go to “Cross” star Aldis Hodge.\n\n\tBest known for her roles in “Riverdale,” “Hal & Harper”,” “Hustler” and “Chemical Hearts,” Lili Reinhart will be presented with the Spotlight Award. Ali Larter, currently starring in Paramount+’s “Landman,” will be given the Distinguished Performance Award. “Tell Me Lies” actor Jackson White will be awarded the Rising Star honor.\n\n\t“Scrubs,” set to return with its 10th season 16 years after its initial run ended, will be honored with the Cast Award with stars Zach Braff, Donald Faison and Sarah Chalke, as well as creator Bill Lawrence, accepting the award.\n\n\tEmmy-winner “The Pitt” will be honored with the Impact Award. Amielynn Abellera (Perlah Alawi), Laëtitia Hollard (Season 2 nurse Emma Nolan) and Brandon Mendez Homer (Donnie Donahue) and writer Cynthia Adarkwa will accept the honor.\n\n\t“TV lovers, prepare to swoon! At this year’s SCAD TVfest, [the SCAD] Bees bask in the limelight alongside the industry’s brightest stars, on screen and on set, with Emmy winners, showrunners and casting visionaries,” says Paula Wallace, SCAD president and founder. “Fan favorites like ‘Bridgerton’s’ Golda Rosheuvel and Adjoa Andoh, ‘Survivor’s’ Jeff Probst and ‘Abbott Elementary’ mastermind Quinta Brunson take centerstage at SCAD Atlanta for top honors and masterclasses nonpareil. With every pitch, every panel, every premiere, SCAD students leap from script to screen, ready to steal scenes, command credits, and fly to the top of the call sheet.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWriter and director Ashley Avis, best known for the Disney+ adaptation of “Black Beauty” and the upcoming film adaptations of “City of Angels” and “American Wolf,” has launched a new initiative through her nonprofit, the Wild Beauty Foundation (WBF).\n\n\tThe Lost Horses campaign hopes to harness the power of film and Hollywood storytelling to spotlight the tens of thousands of horses who disappear into the slaughter pipeline each year—and to rally public support for the Save America’s Forgotten Equines (SAFE) Act (H.R. 1661/S. 775), which would  ban horse slaughter in the United States and the export of horses for slaughter abroad.\n\t\n\n\tThe campaign PSA debuts on Jan. 23 and is set to Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?” It features Olympians Jessica Springsteen and Karl Cook, actors, Mackenzie Foy, Beth Behrs, Zosia Mamet, Pom Klementieff, Dermot Mulroney, singer and songwriter Dewey Bunnell of America, the New York Times bestselling poet Atticus and the community-based collective, Compton Cowboys.\n\n\n\t“The story of America’s horses is one of both profound beauty and heartbreak,” said Avis, founder and president of The Wild Beauty Foundation. “My hope is that through the emotional language of cinema, we can shine a light on this national tragedy—and remind people that compassion for all living beings is both powerful and necessary.”\n\n\tThe SAFE Act is endorsed by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), Animal Welfare Institute, EQUUS Foundation, Humane World for Animals (formerly the Humane Society of the United States) and The Cloud Foundation. \n\t\n\n\t“Storytelling has the power to change hearts and change laws. As Co-Chairman of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus,” Congressman Vern Buchanan (R-Florida) said, he is “proud to lead the bipartisan effort to pass the SAFE Act, legislation already supported by more than half the House that would permanently end horse slaughter in the United States and stop the export of American horses for slaughter abroad. Horses helped build this nation and continue to serve as athletes, companions and therapy animals today. I commend the Wild Beauty Foundation for using the power of cinema to shine a light on this cruelty and highlight the need to protect America’s horses.”\n\n\tOver the coming year, The Lost Horses will roll out a series of short-form films, digital and traditional PSAs, and live events, highlighting everything from wild mustangs and rescue horses to lesson ponies and Olympic athletes. \n\n\t“As Co-Chair of the Congressional Wild Horse Caucus, I’ve seen how deeply Nevadans care about safeguarding our wild and domestic horses,” said Congresswoman Dina Titus (D-NV). “The SAFE Act will finally close the loopholes that have allowed thousands of equines to be exported for slaughter. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation and grateful to organizations like the Wild Beauty Foundation for helping the American public understand what’s at stake.”\n\n\t“Wild horses and burros are part of our national heritage,” added Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9). “As a co-chairman of the Congressional Wild Horse Caucus and a co-sponsor of the Save America’s Forgotten Equines (SAFE) Act, I am dedicated to preventing these animals from being sold into the slaughterhouse pipeline. A humane and compassionate approach is the best way to save them.”\n\n\t“Horses have been our partners for centuries,” Avis added. “They are woven into our culture — and into who we are. They helped build this country on their backs, stood beside us in battle, and continue to serve today as athletes, companions, and therapy animals. I am proud to combine storytelling with advocacy to help protect them.”The Wild Beauty Foundation & Saving Gracie Equine Foundation will be hosting a special Sundance event Friday, January 23rd at the Blue Sky Ski Lounge to debut its inaugural PSA set to “What Was I Made For?” by Billie Eilish.\n\n\tHere’s the PSA:\n\t\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Maybe the Messiah will come back. Even you came back. That’s even more unbelievable,” twin brother Bror tells Jana in “My Brother” Episode 1. \n\n\tAny viewer of the four-part mystery thriller soon gets his drift. Sold by TrustNordisk and from “The Bridge” and “Caliphate” producer Filmlance International, part of Banijay Entertainment, “My Brother” sees the increasingly renowned Swedish screenwriter Karin Arrhenius (“Rebecca Martinsson,”“Blackwater”) adapt the first novel by Karin Smirnoff who shot to fame when she was invited to write a new book in Stieg Larssen’s “Millennium” series. If Lisbeth Salander embodies Nordic Noir in psychological terms, “My Brother’s” Jana Kippo is even noirer. She returns home to remote Smalånger in rural to save her brother Bror, drinking himself to death after heartbreak in love. \n\t\n\n\tInevitably, Jana gradually confronts her own ghastly past – domestic violence, psychological and sexual abuse, attempted homicide then murder, religious fanaticism, and a community which knew what was going on and just crossed its arms, or made up hearsay – as she takes an interest in what happened to María, the woman she replaces as a home help in Smalånger and the dead wife of John, the silent brooding neighbor she falls in love with. \n\n\n\tBror is “half my soul,” Janna confesses. Otherwise, her relation with John is carnal, her reactions brutal. “I hope she’s in pain now she’s dying,” Jana says of her mother. \n\n\t“I suppressed everything in those days,” Jana admits to John, but memories gradually come back, teased skilfully by Arrhenius, so raw that in many flashbacks, Jana picture sher late-thirties self, not her teen counterpart, in the past.\n\t\n\n\tIf the series begins asking why she’s come back, it goes on to question whether victims of such abuse can ever really rebuild their lives. It delivers some sort of answer in its final stretches. \n\n\t“Not only does ‘My Brother’ capture the essence of its bestselling novel, but it also invites viewers to confront the complexities of family, memory, love and hate,” TrustNordisk Managing Director Susan Wendt told Variety, introducing the title at Mipcom 2024.  \n\n\t“My Brother” has a top notch above the line package, with Sanna Lenken (“Thin Blue Line”, “Pressure Point”) directing. “Thin Blue Line” actor Amanda Jansson plays Jana, alongside Jakob Öhrman (“Helsinki Syndrome”, “Rebecka Martinsson: Arctic Murders”) and Rasmus Johansson.\n\n\tProduced by Filmlance Intl. and SamProduktion with Filmpool Nord, and four Nordic public broadcasters – Norway’s NRK, Denmark’s DR, Finland’s Yle and Iceland’s RUV – as well as Belgium’s Lunanime – “My Brother” is a big swing by Swedish pubcaster SVT, bowing all four episodes on Dec. 26 on SVT to fairly spectacular results of 1.5 million views (980 000 on free-to-air TV and 309 000 SVT Play), by early January, according to audience measurement company MMS.   \n\n\t“My Brother” also marks the second Nordic Script Award nomination in three years for Arrhenius, increasingly renowned for “Rebecca Martinsson” (2017-20) and “Blackwater,” the latter up for the award in 2023 and a Series Mania International Panorama best series winner. \n\n\tArrhenius fielded questions from Variety soon after the five Nordic Script Award finalists were announced:\n\n\t“My Brother” is your third recent series in which a heroine confronts her past in remote Sweden, after “Rebecca Martinsson” (2017-20) and “Blackwater.” Does this reflect a personal affinity or maybe this context reflects in hyperbole something about the human condition? Or both?\n\n\tArrhenius: It’s mostly a coincidence on my behalf, since these are adaptations of other writers’ books that landed in my lap. But of course there was something in them that intrigued me. And it is a classical trope, a protagonist returning to their roots to confront their past and discover something about themselves. It says something about the human condition, as it seems like a story you can return to and relate to. I think we all constantly deal, to some degree, with balancing our past and present.\n\t\n\n\tWhen adapting Karin Smirnoff’s novel, did you make any major changes and, if so, why? \n\n\tYes. In order to transform a story like this from the page to the screen, I had to both add and remove a lot of things to get to the core of the story. The literary world is much more forgiving than film and TV, where plot, relations, and characters have to work and make sense in real time. In a book you are freer to use language as you like, tell the story in contradictory and incoherent ways. This book also contains  a heavy amount of darkness and misery, and extreme relations and characters, that would not have worked in the series as it does in the book. So I had to look at the story world and its soul as a whole and try to recreate that feeling rather than the book’s scenes for themselves. \n\n\tThe series has been called a Northern Western. That’s a reflection I sense of not only the rural context but the elemental passions, articulated in brutal but laconic style… But would you agree?\n\n\tYes that’s an interesting description. However, I don’t really write in genres. I’m focused on characters, their relationships and the actual world that is real to them. It’s important that they are true and real, grounded in their world. Writing a story is a lot about creating a world for the audience to enter. Then of course the story can be set in a more genre-specific world as in this case.\n\n\tThe structure is carefully calculated in that Jana’s lack of total recalls about her traumatic past grounds psychologically a suspense build where her way forward and relation with John is only revealed to the audience as it is to Jana herself. Could you comment?\n\n\tPrecisely, Yes that’s how the story is built.  By slowly unfolding and revealing the mysteries within and around Jana. In both the past and the present\n\n\tCongratulations on “My Brother” being a “huge success” on SVT Play, as one Swedish website put it! Does the success suggest anything for you about Swedish audience interests? \n\n\tThank you. Maybe there is a request and interest for complex stories. That don’t have to be so easily digested, thematically or in how they are told.  But I don’t really know. A good story is always a good story. And I think one should never underestimate the audience. \n\t\n\n\tOver your getting on for 25-year career, have you noted changes in what producers or broadcasters are asking for in terms of screenplays?  \n\n\tHm, probably yes. But I haven’t really thought about or analyzed it. And I just keep doing my thing, I am not really capable of adapting too much, even if I sometimes try to. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWill Pouter and Odessa Young have joined the cast of “Rabbit, Rabbit,” a Netflix hostage thriller series starring and executive produced by Adam Driver.\n\n\tPer the official logline, Driver plays an escaped convict who “is cornered by law enforcement at a truck stop” and “takes hostages in an effort to bargain for his freedom. But the standoff soon escalates into an unmanageable social experiment with his captives, as well as an emotional poker match with a veteran FBI crisis negotiator trained in ‘tactical empathy.’” Previously announced star Regina Hall plays the crisis negotiator.\n\t\n\n\tOn TV, Poulter’s best-known credits include playing Luca in “The Bear” in FX and Billy Cutler in “Dopesick” on Hulu, with both roles earning him Emmy nominations. In film, he has appeared in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010), “We’re the Millers” (2013), “Midsommar” (2019), “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” (2023), “Warfare” (2025) and more. Up next, he’ll be seen in the Boots Riley film “I Love Boosters.”\n\n\n\tYoung most recently starred as Faye Romano in the 2025 film “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” and Gen in the 2025 Netflix limited series “Black Rabbit.” \n\n\tPeter Craig is the creator of “Rabbit, Rabbit” and serves as showrunner. Executive producers include Craig and Bryan Unkeless through their Night Owl Stories banner; director Philip Barantini and Samantha Beddoe through their It’s All Made Up Productions banner; and Driver. MRC, where Craig and Night Owl Stories are under a first look deal, is the studio.\n\n\tDeadline was first to report Poulter and Young’s casting.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the “Variety Culture & Storytelling presented by World of Hyatt” event at the Sundance Film Festival, a panel of creatives in the film industry sat down with Variety senior entertainment and media writer Matt Donnelly to discuss the role of cultural experiences in shaping creative work. The group included Molly Ringwald (“Run Amok”), Danielle Brooks (“If I Go Will They Miss Me”), Ali Ahn (“Take Me Home”), Rain Spencer (“Big Girls Don’t Cry”), and Dawn Porter (“When a Witness Recants”).\n\t\n\n\tThe panel explored how immersion in different locations and cultures on set influenced the direction of their projects and them as people.\n\n\tBrooks, who filmed “If I Go Will They Miss Me” in Los Angeles’ Nickerson Projects, described the filming process as intense. “It’s so beautiful seeing the kids playing outside who don’t have much, but they’re so connected to the world,” said Brooks. “They’re just open in a way that we are not always, because we might be afforded a lot more.”\n\n\tAhn had a different perspective filming “Take Me Home” in Orlando, stating, “We don’t live in a country where there’s a system built for us to step in in any other way than families to take that burden. But you can feel that stuckness in the place.”\n\n\tPorter found herself challenging the stereotypes in her mind when filming in an Alabama abortion clinic, saying that it was “really fulfilling” to see people being taken care of.” Ringwald reflected on her very first movie, which filmed in Europe when she had never been outside California before, and how it opened up her world and shaped her life. The only American on a New Zealand set, Spencer also travelled internationally and was captivated by the country’s natural beauty, calling it “healing.”\n\t\n\n\tThe group also discussed the various media that had inspired them to travel. Ringwald said “Reds” made her want to learn about history, while Porter was inspired by Gallipoli, Turkey. Ahn was drawn to “Kevin Costner and those mountains” in “Dances with Wolves,” and Spencer referred to “Brokeback Mountain” and “Napoleon Dynamite.” A self-proclaimed theater girl, Brooks found Brandi Carlile’s “Cinderella” to invoke a sense of wanting to transport, but to a stage instead of a country.\n\n\tTraveling the world also resulted in some painful experiences, as Ahn revealed she was injured after a fall in Scotland.\n\n\t“They have a tradition in Scotland where you jump into the lakes, and I am not a cold plunge girly. But I’m here, let me do as the locals do. As I was heading back to my pile of clothes that were on the rocks, I fell hard. I get back into my room to take a hot shower, and I’m looking at the bathtub, and there’s pink everywhere,” said the actress, referring to her bleeding.\n\n\tSpencer went rock-climbing in Iceland in the middle of a strong wind, while Ringwald got her fruit stolen by monkeys in Africa, and Porter suffered from food poisoning in the middle of making a movie.“I’m gonna beat everyone — shooting on a plantation,” Brooks quipped. “You weren’t ready for that one, were you?”\n\n\tThe panel also revealed ways they stay in touch with their own culture and heritage when filming.Brooks, who comes from a family of “big cookers,” likes to bake and bring in banana pudding for the crew; Spencer brings candles to help her feel grounded and at home; and Ringwald is often accompanied by her cat.\n\n\t“I’m the child of Korean immigrants, so what I bring to set is work ethic, discipline, and a really strong ability to take criticism,” joked Ahn. Porter stated it was important for her crew on a Baltimore shoot to be “majority Black” when filming at a majority-Black school, so the children could see themselves represented.\n\n\tClosing out the panel, the group discussed their dream locations to film someday. Brooks wants to revisit a church-turned-Airbnb in Atlanta, while Ahn, Porter, and Spencer chose the tropical locations of Tahiti, Bora Bora, and Kauai, respectively. Ringwald chose the Galapagos Islands because she “really want[s] to see those giant turtles.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLove, sex and death loom over the suburbs of Missouri in HBO’s upcoming comedy series “DTF St. Louis,” starring Jason Bateman and David Harbour as middle-aged dads caught in a love triangle.\n\n\tThe seven-episode limited series kicks off on March 1 at 9 p.m. on HBO and will also stream on HBO Max.\n\n\tThe trailer opens with Harbour’s dead body. Bateman has been having an affair with Harbour’s wife, played by Linda Cardellini, and so it appears he introduces Harbour to a sex app called DTF St. Louis — that’s “Down to Fuck,” for the uninitiated — to sabotage his marriage.\n\t\n\n\tThe kinky, darkly funny trailer sees Bateman telling Cardellini one of his sexual fantasies: “I would like for you to go about your business — do tasks on your phone — while you sit on my face.”\n\n\n\t“DTF St. Louis” also stars Richard Jenkins, Joy Sunday, Arlan Ruf, Peter Sarsgaard and Chris Perfetti. The showrunner is Steven Conrad (creator of “Patriot” and “Ultra City Smiths”), who executive produces alongside Bateman and Harbour. EPs also include Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal and Steve Tisch for Escape Artists; Molly Allen; Bruce Terris; Michael Nelson; Michael Costigan for Bateman’s Aggregate Films; KC Wenson for Bravo Axolotl; Jennifer Scher for Elephant Pictures; James Lasdun; and MGM Television. \n\n\t“DTF St. Louis” was originally announced as being in development back in 2022 with Harbour and Pedro Pascal attached to star. The series was initially based on a New Yorker article before evolving into an original idea with no connection to the piece.\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “DTF St. Louis” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRachel Keller has landed a lead role opposite Mike Colter in the upcoming CBS legal drama “Cupertino,” Variety has confirmed. \n\n\tAlong with Colter and Keller, the cast of the series also includes Renee Elise Goldsberry and Ella Stiller. The logline states that the show is “a David vs. Goliath legal drama set in the heart of Silicon Valley that follows a lawyer (Colter) who is being cheated out of his stock-options by his former employer, a tech start-up. Refusing to back down, he joins forces with another recently fired attorney (Keller) to represent those taken advantage of by the tech elite, and help them fight back in a high-stakes battle against the Goliaths controlling Silicon Valley.”\n\t\n\n\tKeller’s character is named Olivia, who is described as ” “a Midwestern recent law school grad who finds herself fired by a Silicon Valley start-up, and joins forces with Michael to form an underdog law firm to take on the tech giants.” \n\n\n\tKeller recently starred in the HBO Max series “Tokyo Vice” and previously starred in shows like “Dirty John,” “The Society,” “Legion,” and “Fargo.” She has also been in films like “A Man Called Otto” opposite Tom Hanks and “Butcher’s Crossing” with Nicholas Cage and Fred Hechinger.\n\n\tShe is repped by UTA and Suskin/Karshan Management. \n\n\tThe show hails from Robert and Michelle King, who will write, executive produce, and co-showrun the series under their King Size Productions banner. Robert will also direct the pilot, with Liz Glotzer also executive producing. The Kings are executive producing under their overall deal with CBS Studios, which they recently renewed. \n\t\n\n\t“Cupertino” was formally picked up to series at CBS in October 2025. The Kings originally set the show up for development at CBS in 2024, with the network then commissioning a full writers room and a 13-episode script order in 2025. \n\n\tDeadline first reported Keller’s casting. \n",

    "body": "\n\tFast weight-loss methods have never been easier or more readily available, but they come at a cost — and for the young, dangerously experimenting protagonist of “Saccharine,” that’s higher and more damaging than a monthly Wegovy subscription. The third feature from writer-director Natalie Erika James is a timely one, tapping into a current medical phenomenon while also aligning itself with a run of recent genre fare (most notably the 2024 sleeper “The Substance”) predicated on female body insecurity. Real-life horror of one’s own body is the most insidious kind of body horror at play here, though James’ film offers a measure of the gorily fantastical stuff too.\n\t\n\n\t“Saccharine” marks a homecoming for its Australian helmer, who broke out in 2020 with “Relic,” an unusual and unexpectedly devastating horror film that located its humane terrors in late-stage dementia — before heading to the U.S. for the sleekly crafted but inevitably less distinctive “Rosemary’s Baby” prequel “Apartment 7A.” Set and shot in Melbourne on a seemingly modest but well-used budget, “Saccharine” proves James’ gifts are better served by more independent means, even if it falls short of the emotional and dramatic heft that gave “Relic” equal genre and arthouse appeal. Following festival dates at Sundance and Berlin, it’s set to be released as a streaming original on home turf, with IFC and Shudder partnering for its Stateside release.\n\n\n\tSporting a credible Aussie accent, former “Grey’s Anatomy” regular Midori Francis once more dons a set of scrubs as Hana, a Melbourne medical student whose requisite pledge to first do no harm doesn’t appear to have extended to herself. Tormented by the perception that her perfectly healthy-looking body is severely overweight, she bounces between phases of binge-eating and self-punishment, eventually signing up for an intensive 12-week transformation program pitched by svelte gym trainer Alanya (Madeleine Madden) — though her attraction to Alanya may be the main motivating factor there. \n\t\n\n\tAround the same time, however, she thrown off course by a chance reunion with a former school friend: once plus-size, now unrecognizably skinny, and a pushy advocate for an exclusive new weight-loss pill she calls simply “The Gray.” Tempted but reluctant to fork out the money, Hana runs some tests on the drug, and finds — in what one hopes is just a grim horror-film twist — that its composition comes down pretty much entirely to human ashes. Somehow not sufficiently horrified to halt matters then and there, she resolves instead to make her own Gray, stealing and cremating flesh from the cadaver she and fellow student Josie (an underused Danielle Macdonald) have been assigned for research.\n\n\tSure enough, the pounds start falling off, at a rate that concerns the increasingly interested Alanya. But it turns out that ingesting incinerated human remains is a bad idea for reasons beyond even the many glaringly obvious ones. Before long, the spirit of the cadaver — an obese cancer victim, crassly nicknamed Big Bertha by the students — is raised, seemingly angered not just by this macabre violation of her corpse, but by the increasingly drawn and sickly Hana’s new regimen. The ensuing fallout is less frightening than it is queasy, though there are some jolts courtesy of expert gross-out prosthetics and old-school ghost-story effects. That “Bertha” is only visible to Hana in spoons and other such concave reflective surfaces is a neat, witty visual touch.\n\n\tHowever, the fact that the cadaver’s large, decaying form is used to increasingly monstrous jump-scare effect, haunting Hana’s dreams and causing physical havoc in her waking hours, is a device that risks undermining “Saccharine’s” generally body-positive message — though one could argue for that depiction as a manifestation of the protagonist’s own most extreme bodily neuroses. Also questionably handled is a psychologically illuminating subplot around Hana’s family history of weight problems, teased with some needlessly shadowy ambuigity ahead of a surprise reveal. There’s a fine, touching performance, however, from Showko Showfukutei as Hana’s loving but fretful mother, desperately concerned for her daughter’s well-being but inclined to show love only through unrequired domestic service.\n\n\tFrancis gives warm, vulnerable grounding to a character whose choices are frequently, on the face of it, inexplicable: “Saccharine” functions as a cautionary tale for the mania caused by a relentlessly body-conscious culture, tainting everything from friendly conversation to punitively aspirational Instagram feeds. “Saccharine,” for its part, does much to deglamorize its gaze, beginning with the scuzzy lighting and seasick palette of DP Charlie Sarroff’s lensing. \n\t\n\n\tBut it’s aurally that the film is most disquieting. Hannah Peel’s inventive score merges gasping vocal expressions with grinding, dehumanized mechanical instrumentation, while sound designer Robert Mackenzie eerily amplifies shortened breathing, groaning physical exertions and, of course, the regular chomp and smack of chewing. It all amounts to a kind of anti-ASMR — if anything, you leave “Saccharine” craving some sensory underload. \n",

    "body": "\n\tHip-hop superstar Nicki Minaj doubled down on her controversial support for President Donald J. Trump with a short speech at a “Trump Accounts Summit” session on Wednesday, telling the assembled audience that Trump is being “bullied” and “smeared” and declaring herself “probably the president’s No. 1 fan.”\n\n\t“Well, I don’t know what to say,” Minaj began, after clasping hands with the president at the Washington, D.C. event, “but I will say that I am probably the president’s no. 1 fan. And that’s not going to change. \n\t\n\n\t“And the hate with what people have to say, it does not affect me, at all,” she continued. “It actually motivates me to support him more. And it’s gonna motivate all of us to support him more. We’re not going to let them get away with bullying him. The smear campaigns, it’s not going to work. He has a lot of force behind him, and God is protecting him. Amen?”\n\n\n\n\tWith that, she whispered a question to someone off-stage of whether she should go, and made her exit. \n\n\tTrump said to her, “We did pretty well with your community,” apparently speaking of his Black supporters.\n\n\tHe also joked about her wealth, saying about how $16 billion in contributions to “Trump Accounts” was a figure that would make even as rich a rapper as Minaj sit up and take notice.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWASHINGTON, DC – JANUARY 28: A detailed view as musician Nicki Minaj (L) and U.S. President Donald Trump hold hands on stage during the Treasury Department’s Trump Accounts Summit at Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium on January 28, 2026 in Washington, DC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMinaj has announced that she will contribute between $150,000 and $300,000 to fund her fans’ Trump Accounts, although how those contributions would be diverted specifically to fans has not been explained.\n\t\n\n\tTrump Accounts is the name given to Section 530A individual retirement accounts, as part of recently passed tax and spending legislation in which the federal government has pledged to deposit $1,000 into investment accounts for all chidlren born between 2025 and 2028, if parents sign their children up in the course of filing their income taxes.  \n\n\tSaid Trump in his remarks, “Decades from now I believe Trump Accounts will be remembered as one of the most transformative policy innovations of all time.”\n\n\tMinaj had advertised her appearance at Wednesday’s event in advance, tweeting four days ago that Trump Accounts represented “the true meaning of paying it forward. Early financial literacy & financial support for our children will give them a major head start in life.”\n\n\tMinaj has made no secret recently of her love for the president, to the dismay of many of her “Barbz,” who have been sharply divided over the rapper’s pronounced turn toward the right.\n\n\tIn December, the rapper made a surprise appearance at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest conference, sitting down with Erika Kirk for an interview in which she effusively praised the current administration and called Trump “handsome and dashing.” At that gathering, she also called MAGA partisans “the cool kids”; suggested that white women have been the victims of reverse discrimination as the beauty of Black women has been elevated; and made an awkward reference to the vice president as “the assassin JD Vance” (a misspeak for which Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow, excused her).\n\n\tMinaj’s primary cause, of late, has been her antipathy for the adult support of trans youth, which has been the foremost bone of contention in her repeatedly attacking California governor Gavin Newsome, whom she calls “Newscum.”\n\n\tIn her conversation with Kirk, Minaj took on the cloak of evangelical Christianity, something she has not often been associated with in her frank-talking past as a rapper. “I truly feel that there are people out there who felt good about chastising Christians right here in our country. And it’s kind of really, really sick,” she said. “We can’t let people like that be in power, you guys. That’s the truth. I can sugarcoat it and laugh and tee-hee, but the truth is, I am here today to tell you guys that we absolutely cannot let people who have a problem with us worshipping God… we cannot have them in power.”\n\t\n\n\tMinaj indicated that, even beyond her beliefs about trans youths, she feels boys are discouraged from being masculine. “Boys, be boys,” she said. “It’s OK. Be boys. There’s nothing wrong with being a boy… How powerful is that? How profound is that? Boys will be boys and there’s nothing wrong with that.” “Amen,” Kirk responded, repeatedly, as Minaj laughed and stretched her arms out in a pose of triumph.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrooke Nevils, the former NBC employee who accused Matt Lauer of sexual assault, is releasing a new book next month titled “Unspeakable Things” in which she goes into greater detail about her relationship to the former “Today” anchor. Nevils first went public with her story in Ronan Farrow’s 2019 book “Catch and Kill,” in which she accused Lauer of rape at the 2014 Sochi Olympics where she was working with Meredith Vieira. Lauer has denied all the allegations against him.\n\t\n\n\t“Despite the rounds of vodka shots, the overwhelming power differential, and the bloody underwear and sheets, I would never have used the word ‘rape’ to describe what had happened,” Nevils now writes in the book (via The Cut). “Even now, I hear ‘rape’ and think of masked strangers in dark alleys. Back then, I had no idea what to call what happened other than weird and humiliating. But then there was the pain, which was undeniable. It hurt to walk. It hurt to sit. It hurt to remember. One strikingly clear thought crossed my mind and then was instantly struck from my consciousness: If anyone else had done this to me, I would have gone to the police.”\n\n\n\tNevils writes that one reason she did not immediately call the police to report the alleged rape is “because I was in freaking Russia. Who would I call? Putin? The KGB? There was only NBC, and Matt Lauer was ‘Today’s’ longest-serving anchor with the biggest contract in the 60-year history of morning television, worth a reported $25 million a year. In the news business back then, his point of view was reality, and if you disagreed with it, you were wrong.”\n\t\n\n\t“The whole thing had to have been my fault,” she continues. “I had given him the wrong idea, failed to be clear, failed to convince him, failed to stop him, failed to find a graceful way out of the situation without embarrassing him. I certainly should not have bled. The only thing to do was to smooth it over, and smoothing things over for the talent was my actual day job. That, at least, I knew how to do.\n\n\tNevils recalls feeling “totally alone, drowning in plain sight” after the incident. She writes that Lauer emailed her after saying something along the lines of: “You don’t call, you don’t write — my feelings are hurt! How are you?” After a few days, she emailed him back asking “if he had time for a quick chat” to discuss the encounter. Nevils then sent a second email “literally begging him to call me.”\n\n\t“I was crying uncontrollably, working my way through vodka, and then at 10:30 or 11 — who even knows what time it was — I used my NBC burner phone to call Matt’s NBC burner phone,” Nevils writes. “He answered right away. He’d obviously been sound asleep. In tears, I said I really needed to talk before I left [Sochi] because I didn’t know what to do. He seemed to have no idea what I was talking about. Then he said — as though he were trying not to wake all the way up — ‘Come see me when we’re back in New York.’ Then he hung up.”\n\n\tWhen the two finally met in person at the “Today” offices the following week, Nevils writes that Lauer was “all smiles” and “so sorry he hadn’t seen my emails.” He allegedly invited her to “come to his apartment that night. The look on his face was pleased, flattered, almost boyish. To him, apparently, those emails [I sent] had been a proposition. Another opportunity. I was just relieved he wasn’t mad.”\n\n\t“When I arrived, he ushered me quickly through a palatial apartment into a kitchen, where he offered me a drink. It was vodka, handed to me with a grin,” Nevils writes. “I was there to block out a memory, to erase it, to replace it with one less humiliating. Matt’s objective, it seemed, was the opposite. His point, apparently, was to re‑create that memory. To reinforce it. To repeat it. The shame flooded over me as I drank, realizing uncomfortably late that Matt was not drinking anything at all but watching me intently, the way a parent administers medicine to a child.”\n\t\n\n\tThe night ended with a sexual encounter, Nevils writes. Lauer allegedly brought an “armful of towels” into his bedroom, which she figured was in reference to the blood that caused a mess during the Sochi incident after Lauer had allegedly forced her to have anal sex. When she pushed back on having sex again with Lauer, the “Today” host allegedly told her: “You said you liked it in Sochi.” Nevils ultimately gave in and had sex with Lauer that night and writes that “in the months that followed, there would be four more instances” of similar encounters.\n\n\t“Once Matt summoned me to his dressing room and I went; two other times I ended up there in the course of my day-to-day job,” she writes. “One encounter I even initiated, telling myself I wasn’t the same naïve idiot I’d been in Sochi or some girl Matt could just summon to her knees in his office, always thinking that this would be the time I took back control. But I never did. I just implicated myself in my own abuse.”\n\n\t“Why, if an alleged victim was really sexually assaulted, would they continue a relationship with the perpetrator? Why would they go back? This is the question I have been asked too many times to count, including by Matt himself,” Nevils writes, referring to the open letter Lauer published in 2019 in which he said “Brooke’s story is filled with contradictions.”\n\n\t“If I am walking home at night and a man in a ski mask jumps out and sexually assaults me in an alley, obviously I am not going to chase him down the street afterward and ask if he wants to go get a cup of coffee,” Nevils writes. “Since the assailant is a stranger, neither his opinion of me nor his relationship to me matters. He can’t cost me a job or harm my reputation. No one in my life will blame me for getting him in trouble. But now assume that this happens as most sexual assaults actually do, within the context of a preexisting relationship. I will be much less likely to immediately recognize it as an assault. I have to consider not only whether anyone will believe me but how the allegation will impact everyone else in my life. If that means losing a job, a church, a school, or part of my family, then that’s all the more reason to convince myself that it wasn’t a sexual assault in the first place.”\n\t\n\n\tNevils recalls how Lauer “was perfectly nice” in work settings during this period of time and that “except for when I was alone with him, he was not monstrous at all but charming and charismatic, powerfully wielding the talent that all great interviewers have of making you feel as though you’re the only person in the world,” which is another reason his alleged behavior confused her and made it harder to speak out. \n\n\tNevils filed a complaint to NBC in November 2017 accusing Lauer of sexual misconduct. He was fired within 24 hours. After he lost his job, Variety published a story that detailed other allegations of misconduct by Lauer at Today. When Lauer originally responded to Nevils’ rape accusation with the open letter, he denied any wrongdoing but admited to having an extramarital affair with Nevils. \n\n\tVariety has reached out to comment from Lauer’s representative regarding Nevils’ new book.\n\n\tHead over to The Cut’s website to read Nevil’s full book excerpt. “Unspeakable Things” publishes Feb. 3. \n",

    "body": "\n\tNoomi Rapace discussed her “angry” public image at Sweden’s  Göteborg Film Festival.\n\n\t“The first time I went to the U.S., well, the Americans can be blunt. They would say: ‘Oh, you are funny. You are not angry and aggressive.’ I went: ‘Why would I be?’ Everyone thought I would be silent and grumpy, ready to fight and argue about everything, and I never recognized myself in that description,” she laughed. \n\n\n\t“I used to have a lot of rage towards myself when I was younger, and then because of ‘Millennium’ and my experimental stage plays [people saw me in a certain way]. My characters are on fire and on the edge of madness, and that’s me – but that’s not only me.”\n\t\n\n\t“I listened to an interview with Jim Carrey once. He said that some people will cover and disguise their pain with laughter and smiles. And I’ve been doing that more in real life.” \n\n\tRapace met with the audience after the screening of Teona Strugar Mitevska’s “Mother,” in which she played Mother Teresa.\n\n\t“Sometimes you allow the character to move into your heart and your mind. They will put a mark on you and some remains of them will stay. Some stay forever, and she’s one of them. There’s a before and after.”\n\n\tOther characters she loved?\n\n\t“Lisbeth Salander, definitely, because she was one of the first ones that lived in me and that really defined me. Maybe Elisabeth Shaw in [Ridley Scott’s] ‘Prometheus’ and Maria in ‘Lamb’. And my character in ‘Constellation’. It was about motherhood and being away for too long, and realizing your child is not really your child anymore. It has been my biggest fear: chasing you dream and having a child waiting for you.” \n\t\n\n\tShe said: “They are all challenged by themselves and the world, and it’s an eternal battlefield.” \n\n\t In an interview with Variety at the Venice Film Festival, Strugar Mitevska said she wanted to “demystify the perfect saint.” \n\n\t“Noomi’s strong and audacious, and it’s evident. But nobody is just strong and ferocious, and nobody is just a saint. We had to find her fragility and her imperfections. Her human side, her imperfect side, her childish side, her obsessive side.”\n\n\tThese days, Rapace is practicing “being in the present.”\n\n\t“Am I restless? Yes. What is satisfaction, anyway? Satisfaction is when you have a peaceful mind and you’re having your coffee in the morning. It’s hard to find peace and stillness. I can have moments of satisfaction when I achieve something that was scary to do. It has been, possibly, a fear: if you get too comfortable, you lose your drive. I’ve been always pushing myself, because I don’t want to be comfortable.”\n\n\tShe decided to perfect her English after initially feeling like a “target” at international events.\n\n\t“I’m restless, as I said, and I have good focus. I was so embarrassed at the first press conference for ‘The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo’, because I didn’t understand the questions. I felt so weak.”\n\n\t“It’s a shift when a language becomes yours. You start to feel there’s no distance. You can’t really act if you’ve just learned the lines in a foreign language because you have no freedom. It’s not yours. It was a silent and secret journey I went on.”\n\n\tStill, at one point, she felt tired of “big studio system” and started to “crave” European cinema again.\n\n\t“When I landed in Iceland [for ‘Lamb’], I was like: I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be. On the second day, I was waiting in my trailer for the farmer to come and give me a sign when the lamb was coming. He was like: ‘When you see the head, you just put your whole hand inside of the sheep and pull out the lamb.’ I asked: ‘Inside of the sheep’s vagina? Without gloves?’ That was me reconnecting with European cinema,” she joked.\n\n\t“I could smell the inside of her for weeks. I thought: ‘I’m back’.”\n\n\t“You don’t always need to hit those heavy numbers. You don’t always need to attract a huge audience. You can actually have the freedom to explore.”\n\t\n\n\tShe’d like to make a project in Swedish soon, however, and to see more local projects getting support despite ongoing challenges with financing. \n\n\t“Give us more money!” \n\n\t“It’s really quite simple. If you look at Norway or Denmark, and how they embrace their talent, they have movies at Cannes, Venice, Sundance. They are nominated for Oscars. We have that talent in this country, too. It’s heartbreaking that they don’t get more support. It’s frankly stupid.” \n\n\t“We’re proud of our Swedes, so let’s get them on the world stage. Let’s give them tools so that they can make more noise. It’s time for it.” \n\n\tAccepting the award, Rapace dedicated it to her son. \n\n\t“This morning, I was thinking that 28 years ago, I passed this very building. I went to school a couple of hours outside of Goteborg, but I used to come here to watch movies, dreaming of a life as an actress. And here I am” she said. \n\n\t“This award is so much bigger than me. There are  so many people behind me: My teachers, my mentors, and those around me. Directors, actors, producers – the list is so long. I can’t speak about everyone, so I decided to speak about one person today: my son Lev, who has been my closest witness and my truth-teller. Who has grounded me and guided me, and who has been the person I learnt from the most. He always holds me accountable, makes me want to be braver and go further.”\n\n\tGöteborg’s artistic director Pia Lundberg said that Rapace “has shaped a body of work defined by presence, courage and uncompromising authenticity.” \n\n\t“Across genres, languages and cinematic traditions, she has portrayed characters driven by necessity rather than convention. Whether in intimate arthouse dramas or large-scale international productions, Noomi Rapace brings a rare physical and emotional commitment to her roles. Her work does not seek comfort, but understanding.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere isn’t only one moment that stands out as Role Model reflects on scaling the pop mountain over the past few years. Opening for Gracie Abrams on “The Secret of Us” tour was one of them; playing to massive crowds at New York’s Madison Square Garden and Los Angeles’ Greek Theatre were two others. Then there were the viral moments after performing his breakthrough hit “Sally, When the Wine Runs Out” at various shows, inviting a different “Sally” to dance with him (Charli xcx, Natalie Portman and Niall Horan to name a few).\n\t\n\n\tFor the 28-year-old Maine native, born Tucker Pillsbury, it was also proving his chops as a live performer, having learned how to play guitar from YouTube video tutorials, and bringing songs from his two albums to life on his “No Place Like Tour.”\n\n\n\t“I have a guitar in my hands for 80% of the show now. And for me, that was my goal, because it just makes it so much more fun,” says Pillsbury, chatting from Berlin at the tail end of the tour. “I think it helped people see me as a musician and get a slightly better look into how involved I am in the music and in the studio. It helps solidify myself as a proper musician.”\n\n\tThat hasn’t been much of an issue offstage, as his fan base swelled in the wake of his 2024 sophomore album, “Kansas Anymore,” and its deluxe version, which was released on Valentine’s Day this year. The project was an evolution of sorts for Pillsbury, once a budding rapper who went by Dillis. He subsequently ventured into light electro-pop as the rechristened Role Model with his 2022 full-length “Rx” — an album that valorized love and his relationship with Emma Chamberlain. But the dissolution of that romance led him to make “Kansas Anymore,” an album that paired often upbeat, Americana-tinged tunes with melancholy lyrics.\n\t\n\n\t“I think it all started with me finding a sound for myself that worked and felt authentic finally, and I felt like I’d settled into the type of music that I wanted to make,” he says. Pillsbury also saw his stock rise on social media, where he leaned into viral memes and collaborated on videos with Renee Rapp and Laufey. The fervor around him caught the attention of Lena Dunham, who cast him in her Netflix rom-com “Good Sex” alongside Natalie Portman and Mark Ruffalo, and brought him to New York this summer to make his acting debut.\n\n\t“She is truly one of a kind,” he says of Dunham, who gave him a list of rom-coms to watch as homework. (He only watched one, “When Harry Met Sally.”) “They all made me feel extremely like a part of that family, and it was fun. It just felt like a summer camp, and that helps with any nerves.”\n\n\tHe even found time to start working on his third album, which he’s been recording with songwriter-producers Mason Stoops and Taylor Mackall. He has a visual mood board on his phone and a playlist of music from the 1970s as inspiration.\n\n\t“I had the world [that the album would exist in], and then as soon as we got in the studio, it was more progress in the first two weeks than I made in a year and a half on the last album,” Pillsbury says. “So I’m very happy. There’s a weight off the shoulders. There’s no pressure. And it’s already better than the last album. So I’m feeling good.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt takes a detour from a pilgrimage to Mecca to uncover true enlightenment in “Hijra,” Shahad Ameen’s compelling sophomore feature, in which the sudden disappearance of one of the two young women in the care of their devout grandmother upends their sacred ritual of Hajj. Selected to represent Saudi Arabia in the Oscars’ international feature race, the intelligently crafted drama shows that in order to find the missing young woman, Sitti (Khairiah Nathmy) and her remaining grandchild Janna (Lamar Faden) must develop greater faith in themselves as they make their way across the country. The writer-director takes a refreshingly less well-trodden path to illustrate cultural strictures that shape their experience.\n\t\n\n\tAmeen’s inspired approach can be seen from the film’s very first frames, as snow is wiped away from the windshield of a bus headed to the holy land, yet the effort to clean only obscures the image. It’s a sneakily appropriate introduction to Sitti, who appears to demand piety from others, eternally cloaked in a pristine white abaya, yet will do what’s convenient for her when the situation calls for it. The director sets the film in 2001 ahead of any upheaval in the country after the U.S. invasion, but “Hijra” imagines a conflict of another kind already stirring when Westernized fast food chains and waxing salons have become a part of a society where camels can still be seen roaming around on thoroughfares. \n\n\n\tThe sands don’t seem to be shifting quite fast enough for 18-year-old Sarah (Raghad Bokhari), whose headphones — which she uses to tune out any noise on the bus — are a clue that she may not be around for the whole ride. At one point, she disappears into the crowd of worshippers that overwhelms the younger Janna. Later, it is revealed she had plans to cross the border with a boyfriend.\n\t\n\n\tAt first, it could seem a little too convenient that Sitti and Janna have no trouble finding a driver to help them search for Sarah, as Ahmed (Nawaf Al-Dhufairy), a salesman Sitti spots in the streets of Taif, quickly comes to their aid, asking for whatever Sitti wants to pay. But when his kindness isn’t rooted in any profound belief — he thinks nothing of selling water promoted as holy that he got from a tap — Ameen slyly sets the stage for a religious journey where everyone has to come to define the principles they want to live by on their own.\n\n\tThe director refrains from forcing any grand epiphanies on the characters, instead exposing the oppressive systems that form their decision-making and complicate even the most basic of interactions. There shouldn’t be much tension in a scene where Ahmed finds himself stuck in traffic awaiting a checkpoint, but one little white lie after another begins to mount up in his truck to create incredible anxiety. First, he asks one of the women to sit up in the front, since looking like a family will make it easier for guards to wave them through. At the same time, not wanting to answer the girls’ father, Sitti hands her cell phone off to Janna and asks her to say she’s with her aunt. These seem like minor trespasses, but when no one feels comfortable telling the truth, the influence such behavior has on the 12-year-old Janna becomes concerning.\n\n\tBringing that more psychologically treacherous road to mind over the practical obstacles that Sitti, Janna and Ahmed might typically be expected to face as they try to locate Sarah keeps “Hijra” engaging. Although the film slightly loses some of its momentum after its central mystery is mostly wrapped after its first hour, Ameen still finds intrigue in the characters’ search for who they are, separate from who they aren’t allowed to be. \n\n\tNathmy, Al-Dhufairy and Faden all deliver fine performances where the subtlest changes in attitude register as major moments and Nathmy, in particular, gives a moving turn as Sitti, appearing to break new ground for herself as she reflects on pilgrimages she’s made decades before. The idea of making a run for the border may be incomprehensible to the grandmother, but Ameen imagines many different paths to freedom, opening up all the more opportunities to attain it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains details about Episode 3 of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tWhen François Arnaud read the script for the third episode of the hit queer sports drama “Heated Rivalry,” he had the same reaction many viewers are having now after watching it. Instead of more sexcapades between Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie), the episode follows a fast and furious romance between Arnaud’s hockey player character Scott Hunter and a smoothie shop clerk named Kip (Robbie G.K.).\n\t\n\n\t“It completely came out of left field,” Arnaud tells me. “And it’s a real tonal shift.”\n\n\n\tWhereas Shane and Ilya’s story revolves around their hookups over many years, Scott and Kip actually start dating. In several scenes, Scott grapples with being in the closet. He runs from an art gallery because he fears being seen with Kip; he asks Kip to be patient, because he thinks he could come out years down the line. The two end up going their separate ways after Scott refuses to join Kip at his birthday celebration at a gay bar.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrançois Arnaud as Scott Hunter and Robbie G.K. as Kip Grady in “Heated Rivalry.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsabrina lantos\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“There’s something sad about this guy, because in so many ways he’s completely emotionally available for what’s going on with this new person,” Arnaud says. “He’s completely there, and ready for it, but he just can’t make it fit with everything — all the sacrifices he’s made up until that point. He wants to, and he just can’t. There’s something truly paralyzed about him.”\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” is an adaptation of Rachel Reid’s “Game Changers” novel series. Written and directed by Jacob Tierney, the series was created for the Canadian streamer Crave, and now plays in the U.S. on HBO Max. Since the two-episode season premiere dropped on Nov. 28 — giving viewers Thanksgiving weekend to watch it — “Heated Rivalry” has become a viral sensation, with clips and memes of Williams and Storrie flooding social media. “It’s like ‘Normal People’ on ice,” Arnaud says, referring to the Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones Hulu series that garnered similar attention when it premiered during the COVID pandemic in spring 2020 .\n\t\n\n\t “I had not read the books. I had not even heard of the books,” Arnaud says. “Jacob was like, ‘I didn’t write this for you, but I keep hearing your voice. I can’t hear anybody else doing it.’ He was like, ‘Can you read these six episodes today? There’s not much in the first two of Scott, but 3 is all yours, and then there’s more later on.’”\n\n\tSo what did Arnaud think?\n\n\t“At first, I was a bit overwhelmed, I guess, by the intensity of the sex scenes, but I knew Jacob had something that he would turn on its head,” says Arnaud, who is best known for Showtime’s “The Borgias,” “Midnight, Texas” on NBC and guest starring on “Schitt’s Creek” as David’s ex-boyfriend. “People are hooked by the smutty aspects of it, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I think Jacob really uses that to peel away layers. I think the end of it is quite emotionally affecting.”\n\n\tArnaud is no stranger to coming out. In 2020, he publicly revealed he was bisexual in a post on Instagram.\n\n\t“The only reason I said something…is because I did not feel ashamed of it,” he says. “I felt hiding it, concealing it actively, which I would have had to do at that point, was an act that indicated shame. I was like, ‘That’s not how I feel.’ I said it because I didn’t want to hide. But I’m not particularly interested in talking about my relationships, or all that. I don’t want to invite people into my home.”\n\n\tJust days before Arnaud and I talked, Tierney made headlines when a reporter asked whether the sexualities of Williams and Storrie are relevant to the show. “I don’t think there’s any reason to get into that stuff,” Tierney said. “I’ll tell you something about the casting of both of these roles: You can’t ask questions like that when you’re casting, right? It’s actually against the law. So what you have to gauge is somebody’s enthusiasm, and willingness to do the work.”\n\n\tArnaud agrees. “It’s absurd to think that you should be allowed to ask about someone’s sexuality when they’re trying to get hired for a job,” he says. “It’s crazy, like we’re only going to hire you if you’re gay? And then it’s, like, how gay are you? It’s a spectrum.”\n\n\tArnaud and G.K. didn’t meet until their first day working together. “The first time I met him was with the intimacy coordinator,” he recalls. “I don’t think we shared a meal before.”\n\t\n\n\tThey worked closely with intimacy coordinator Chala Hunter for their sex scenes, which they filmed over two days, but the awkwardness did lead to some laughs. “We were making dick jokes before the sex scenes, but as soon as the cameras were rolling, we were clocked in and tuned into the reality of these characters, and we didn’t feel like laughing,” Arnaud says.\n\n\tOne particular moment was “retooled,” he says. “Scott, the superstar hockey player, was obviously the top and the smoothie boy was the bottom, but then we really wanted to reverse that dynamic in a surprising way,” Arnaud says. “I think that shows a sign of a vulnerability for [Scott], which I think is much more relatable then just confining him to a box.”\n\n\tAnd there there’s the nakedness of “Heated Rivalry.” “Hockey players aren’t as ripped as these characters,” Arnaud says. “They’re thicker. They have these thick thighs like tree trunks. That is not my body type. But I wanted to look like someone who’s a professional athlete. So I worked out a lot. But then, as usual, on the actual day where I’m supposed to be naked, I kind of panicked and ate a bunch of donuts at craft services.”\n\n\tKip gives Scott a pair of blue socks imprinted with bananas to remind him of the blueberry and banana smoothies he first ordered from him at the shop. Scott wears them during his games for good luck.\n\n\t “They did give me a pair with hockey sticks on them but I don’t have the banana socks,” Arnaud says. “Maybe they hold onto them for a potential Season 2?”\n\n\tNo, Arnaud does not know if a second season has been greenlit: “But’s a massive hit — I can’t imagine not. I just don’t know how involved I would be.”\n\n\tPerhaps a Scott spin-off? “I’ve heard talks about that,” Arnaud says with a smile.\n\n\n\tFor now, he teases the season finale. “There’s a big moment, the emotional climax of the season involving all the characters that we’ve gotten to know,” Arnaud says. “I hadn’t seen anything, and Jacob had told me it was good, but then I went to do some ADR for a few lines. Jacob was like, ‘I’m going to show you the whole sequence.’ \n\n\t“I watched it, and I started crying. Jacob came into the room, and he was crying. Then we just held each other. It’s really powerful.”\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tVans is stepping directly into the global Kpop wave with a new capsule inspired by “Kpop Demon Hunters,” the breakout Netflix juggernaut. The footwear collection, which spotlights the fan-favorite girl group HUNTR/X and their demon-slaying counterparts, launches in stores Dec. 5 and online Dec. 8.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe line brings the show’s signature neon-tinged aesthetic onto some of Vans’ most recognizable silhouettes, alongside the brand’s iconic checkerboard motif. Characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey of HUNTR/X appear across the Classic Slip-On and Sk8-Hi, while their guardians Derpy Tiger and Sussie animate bold graphic placements. The rival demon boy band, Saja Boys, anchors the edgier Old Skool and Old Skool V styles, which incorporate demon-inspired patterns. \n\n\n\tSince the show’s breakout release, the franchise has rolled out a robust slate of partnerships, quickly cementing its place in the increasingly competitive K-content licensing space. Limited-edition character figurines sold out in minutes over the summer, followed by a streetwear capsule with Korean label A.C.D.C. that dominated TikTok for weeks. A beauty crossover with Etude House — driven by Mira’s signature “Moonlit Orchid” eye look — was one of the category’s top K-beauty launches of the year, while an official Saja Boys tour hoodie drop crashed servers in multiple regions. Even fast-casual chains got in on the excitement, offering themed meal kits timed to key plot arcs.\n\n\tNetflix also announced that Mattel and Hasbro, which are fierce rivals, have each been named a global “co-master” toy licensee for “KPop Demon Hunters.” Products from Mattel and Hasbro will be available at retail beginning in the spring of 2026. Such a dual co-master toy license structure for one property or franchise is believed to be unprecedented in the industry — and reflects the strong demand Netflix expects for “KPop Demon Hunters” merch.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Netflix strikes an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. — including its film and TV studios, plus HBO Max and HBO — many subscribers are wondering what that might ultimately mean for their streaming services.\n\t\n\t\tWill Netflix combine with HBO Max?\t\n\n\tConsumers currently paying for both Netflix and HBO Max might be wondering if the two might combine to create one giant streamer full of content from both services. And if that happens, will HBO Max go away as a standalone streaming service?\n\t\n\n\tAt least for now, the answer appears to be “no.” As Variety reported when the deal was announced, “In the near term, Netflix signaled it would keep HBO Max as its own service, while it also touted the addition of HBO and HBO Max content to its lineup.”\n\n\n\tUntil the acquisition is completed — which could take more than a year, depending on legal and regulatory challenges — consumers will continue to pay one subscription fee to Netflix (betwen $7.99 and $24.99 per month) and a separate fee to HBO Max ($10.99-$22.99 per month).\n\n\tWhat HBO Shows are on Netflix?\n\n\tNetflix had already added numerous shows from HBO and HBO Max, including “Ballers,” “Insecure,” “Six Feet Under,” “Sex and the City” and “True Blood.”\n\n\tNetflix said in its announcment of the deal, “By adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose. This also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers, enhancing viewing options and expanding access to content.”\n\n\tBut until the deal is closed sometime next year, series such as “Friends” that are available only on HBO Max won’t immediately be available on Netflix.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWill the two streamers be combined?\t\n\n\tThe Warner Bros. deal means that many more shows from HBO and HBO Max will end up streaming on Netflix at some point, so why not combine the two services and charge one (undoubtedly higher) price?\n\n\tFor now, Netflix is proceeding with business as usual — keeping the two streaming services separate, but continuing to add HBO Max programming to the Netflix app.\n\n\tBut in the long term, will HBO wind up as a tile on Netflix? Will the HBO Max service ultimately be sunsetted, and will there be a gradual merging of the two (much like Disney slowly rolling Hulu into Disney+)? That would seem to be a likely ultimate goal, as Netflix said it ultimately see $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings by the third year after the WB deal closes. Part of those savings would likely come from a merged streaming service. Should Netflix take in HBO Max, that would likely come at a price increase for consumers.\n\n\tAs a corporation, Netflix will now own some of the most profitable and most popular franchises in entertainment, from “Game of Thrones” to the Harry Potter series to “The Sopranos,” the DC Universe, “Casablanca” and “Citizen Kane.” But that doesn’t mean Warner Bros.’ entire vast library will be available to steam on Netflix.\n\n\t“Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a statement. \n\n\tFor now, consumers will have to keep a close eye on their subscriptions to figure out just what he meant by “together.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tOn paper, “Oh. What. Fun.” has the makings of an attractive holiday feature that encourages Prime Video subscribers to click play: Michelle Pfeiffer leading a company of instantly recognizable actors directed by a notable filmmaker, a heartfelt story about the harried holidays from the vantage point of an egregiously underrepresented POV in the genre (mothers) and a soundtrack littered with festive songs covered by musical artists with household names. However, director Michael Showalter’s yuletide anthem for unheralded matriarchs fumbles severely, delivering bland comedic hijinks, insufferable characters and generic conundrums. It makes audiences wish for the slightly darker version simmering beneath the surface, instead of the one with a Norman Rockwell-esque, shellacked sheen and rushed resolutions.\n\t\n\n\tHouston housewife Claire Clauster’s (Michelle Pfeiffer) favorite holiday is Christmas. She eats, breathes and sleeps all things Saint Nick, dreaming year-round about how to make the season perfectly jolly. Her husband Nick (Denis Leary) supports her obsession to an unhealthy degree, as he’s completely unbothered by any of her needs. She’s the type of person who genuinely delights in hosting the annual familial festivities for their three now-grown children. \n\n\n\tFirst to arrive is eldest daughter/mousy novelist Channing (Felicity Jones), along with her long-suffering husband Doug (Jason Schwartzman) and their tween twins, Lucy (Rafaella Karnaby) and Ben (Drake Shehan). They’re followed by the youngest, newly heartbroken slacker Sammy (Dominic Sessa), and finally middle child/lesbian love-bomber Taylor (Chloë Grace Moretz), who’s brought home the latest (Devery Jacobs) in a long line of girlfriends to meet the Clauster clan.\n\t\n\n\tHowever, Claire’s world is rocked upon discovering that none of her ungrateful kids has given her the only gift she’s ever hinted at wanting: a from-the-heart letter entry in a Best Holiday Mom contest. The altruistic gesture would mean that they appreciated her yearly efforts to go above and beyond, and winning would mean an all-expenses-paid trip to Burbank to meet her idol, self-help guru Zazzy Tims (Eva Longoria). Claire’s discontent is palpable, manifesting in a passive-aggressive gift exchange with adversarial neighbor Jeanne Wang-Wasserman (Joan Chen), and escalating dramatically once her family forgets her on an excursion into the city. Havoc and a modicum of hilarity ensue.\n\n\tShowalter, who’s no stranger to directing powerhouse leading ladies (including Sally Field, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain) in female-driven films (such as “Hello, My Name is Doris,” “The Idea of You” and “The Eyes of Tammy Faye”), keeps the focus locked on Claire’s anxieties and external societal pressures, primarily through voiceover narration. We can also easily spot the ample reasons why she cracks, showcased in subtle reactive moments and overt dialogue-heavy slights. Pfeiffer shapes her miffed mother into someone with an interesting internal dynamic that drives the action, even when the logistics of her change baffle and appear antithetical to her character’s initial setup as a stereotypically perfect, subservient wife, mother and human being.\n\n\tThat said, the lackluster material (which Showalter cowrote with Chandler Baker, who also gets story credit) unfortunately lets a luminous Pfeiffer down too early on, undercutting her performance prior to the midpoint. The filmmakers fail to give tangible meaning to Claire’s crumbling psychosis as her tightly wound life unfurls and her conspicuous character flaws take hold. She fat-shames Channing (giving her carrots instead of homemade cinnamon buns), shoplifts and sneaks onto a studio soundstage, but rarely suffers any consequences for her actions. \n\n\tClaire’s emotions motivating her mental breakdown are dealt short shrift once her unappreciative family inevitably comes crawling back in the 3rd act. Her self-reflection, acknowledging the toxic role she played in her own demise, is missing the punch it desperately needs. Outside of Channing, none of these people are truly held accountable for their selfish actions in any significant way. They all move on without sincere apologies and earned emotional change.\n\t\n\n\tComedic shenanigans are heavily orchestrated, awkward and quickly wear down one’s patience. The mall security pursuit, the abrasive delivery driver (played by Danielle Brooks) with whom Claire is forced to bunk while out on the road, and Zazzy Tim’s unburdening session over booze and weed aren’t nearly as hilarious as the filmmakers want us to believe. Doug’s preoccupation with being besties with Taylor is the most cringey of the sibling storylines, narrowly edging out a random choreographed dance sequence between Sammy and girl-next-door Lizzie (Havana Rose Liu). The lone segment that does elicit a few chuckles plays off the tired joke that dads struggle putting together complex kids’ toys, as Nick enlists his construction employees to help him build an overly complicated, plastic Dreamhouse for the twins.\n\n\tWhile “Oh. What. Fun.” is far from being any fun as the title even sarcastically promises, it excels when it favors its progressive genetic makeup. Leaning into the darker undertones of the material, albeit all-too-fleetingly, helps color and shade our heroine as an antiheroine. Including ’80s songs (Talk Talk’s “It’s My Life”) and yacht rock classics (10cc’s “The Things We Do For Love”), as well as their hipster cover versions, adds a delightfully unconventional vibe to the seasonal soundscape.\n\n\tThough it hopes to resonate in a way similar to the Christmas-themed escapades in “The Family Stone” and “Happiest Season,” Showalter’s stab at a holiday staple is more akin to a belabored offshoot of the Christmas Bathrobe skit on “Saturday Night Live.” A fed-up mom experiencing a psychotic break and abandoning her family to meet her TV idol is a great premise for an indie comedy. It’s a shame they’ve refurbished the concept into an upbeat, feel-good presentation for a high-profile streamer, shoehorning false notes of poignancy into the proceedings and giving it all a “heartwarming” conclusion.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn honor of “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” turning 25, Fathom Entertainment and Warner Bros. are bringing all three extended edition films from Peter Jackson’s trilogy back to theaters next year. The films will screen in DBOX presentation from Jan. 16-19 and then in standard formats from Jan. 23-25.\n\n\tIn addition to bringing the extended films back to the big screen, limited-edition “Lord of the Rings”- themed concession items will be available at select participating theaters. AMC moviegoers can look out for limited-edition popcorn buckets featuring maps of Middle Earth, while Regal and local cinema patrons can get buckets with a “One Ring” design.\n\t\n\n\tFathom and Warner Bros. have also released a new logo and trailer for the trilogy’s 25th anniversary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNew Line Cinema first released the three “Lord of the Rings” movies in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Based on the epic fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien, the three films were shot back-to-back in New Zealand. Peter Jackson directed the films and wrote the screenplays with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. Cumulatively, the series grossed nearly $3 billion worldwide and won 17 Academy Awards. The third film, “The Return of the King” earned 11 Academy Awards: the highest number of any film, tied with “Ben-Hur” and “Titanic.” Peter Jackson returned to Middle Earth to direct “The Hobbit” trilogy in 2012, 2013 and 2014.\n\n\tWhile the original theatrical cuts of the “Lord of the Rings” movies come in at a little over nine hours in total, the extended editions are cumulatively 11 and a half hours long. Each extended edition was released on home video a year after its respective theatrical cut hit cinemas.\n\t\n\n\tFathom and Warner Bros. previously rereleased 4K Ultra remasterings of the extended editions in theaters in 2024.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Geena Davis Institute has unveiled a new study showing how menopause and aging are portrayed in the 100 top-grossing domestic films from 2009 to 2024 that prominently feature women ages 40 and older on screen.\n\n\tKey findings in the study called, “Missing in action: Writing a new narrative for women in midlife on the big screen,” showed how menopause is nearly invisible: Of the 225 films prominently featuring a 40-plus female character released between 2009 and 2024, only 6% (or 14 films) mentioned menopause. These mentions were usually side comments. Only one film featured a prominent menopause storyline.\n\t\n\n\tFurthermore, menopause was often used as a comedic device. When featured, it was used as a joke to explain women’s anger or mood swings, and even non-menopausal characters were assumed to be menopausal when they expressed anger. \n\n\n\tThe study also revealed that 40-plus female characters were appearing in fewer comedies, pointing to a strong link between menopause mentions and comedy.\n\n\tThe findings showed how general aging narratives were more frequent. Yet the narratives between men and women aging were vastly different. Women ages 40 and older on screen were twice as likely as men to have a narrative focused on physical aging (15% vs. 7%). Overall, 23 characters shown engaging in cosmetic treatments, 17 (74%) were women. Male characters’ treatments were minor (i.e., dye for graying hair, nose-hair trimming, Botox), while women’s treatments often involved surgery or fantastical interventions to restore youth (i.e., vaginal rejuvenation, brow lifts, liposuction).\n\t\n\n\tAnother finding showed the sad widow trope and how Hollywood narratives centered on grief and loneliness. In the 225 films that were analyzed, 19 featured “sad widows,” compared with eight featuring “sad widowers,” suggesting aging is more often framed as a story of loss for women than for men.\n\n\tFindings showed there was a desire for better representation. Overall, two in three respondents (67%) agree on the importance of realistic portrayals of menopause on screen (72% men, 63% women). This signals a broad audience appetite for menopause stories that move beyond jokes or silence.\n\n\tThe report concluded that the absence of women over 50 in Hollywood, especially as romantic leads, likely reinforces negative stereotypes about women, aging and sexuality.\n\n\tThe study found that audiences across age, gender, and race want more realistic portrayals of menopause. \n\n\tMadeline Di Nonno, President & CEO of the Geena Davis Institute said Hollywoood needs to do better. In a statement, Di Nonno said, “Womanhood is more than reproduction. One of the more damaging narratives about menopause is that it ‘feels like the finish line for women, whose value in society is being reduced to motherhood.'”\n\n\tShe went on to say, “Avoid characterizations of menopause that conflate womanhood with fertility, and work to provide a more nuanced and less reductive portrayal of womanhood that treats older women as multidimensional, fully fleshed-out characters. Laugh with menopausal women, not at them.”\n\n\tThe report will be unveiled at the Impact+Profit25 conference hosted by the SIE Society and Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs on Friday afternoon.\n\n\tActress Constance Zimmer, a panelist on at the conference commented on how menopause storylines almost never appear unless they’re comedic — and even then, they’re often inaccurate or dismissive. Zimmer called for Hollywood storytellers to be more authentic to female storytelling. In a statement, she said, ‘If we take my beloved character Quinn King for example, an unapologetic, revenge driven, crisis loving bad bitch who was clearly and silently going through perimenopause – I now know – having gone through it myself – that we missed so many layers to her story line. She wasn’t simply filled with rage – she was witnessing her entire life shift from the inside out. Menopause is not the side character – she is the leading lady.”\n\t\n\n\tDominique Debroux, producer of the documentary, “Wise Women” said, “The Geena Davis Institute’s data exposes these gaps, and the ‘Wise Women’ documentary adds the science showing that women’s contributions have always been far broader, strategic, communal, and essential to our successful evolution.” She went on to say, “The real barrier now is investment. There is no shortage of powerful stories about women’s identity, purpose, and wisdom. What’s missing is the willingness to finance them, somehow overlooking the size of the audience (70 million 50-plus women just in the U.S. & Canada). Hollywood needs to support stories that reflect women’s true range, not just their appearance.”\n\n\tThe study is published here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVariety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety chief awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\tGolden Globes Awards Commentary (Updated: Dec. 5, 2025): Up is down, left is right, and — somehow — the Golden Globes’ comedy races are far more competitive than their drama counterparts. The unpredictability of this awards season continues to defy precedent.On the film side, the Globes are looking to be one of the most volatile stops on the circuit. But this year brings a twist few saw coming: the comedy/musical categories are suddenly more stacked, prestigious and aggressively contested than the drama races, overturning long-held assumptions about Hollywood’s “fun” categories.Traditionally, the Globes’ comedy/musical fields were where lighter crowd-pleasers or less awards-centric films found a comfortable landing — think “Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.” The drama races, by contrast, were reserved for the big Oscar hopefuls. Not this year.Leading the genre shift is Universal’s “Wicked: For Good,” which has dominated the box office and reviews, placing it in a heated three-way matchup with Warner Bros.’ “One Battle After Another” and A24’s “Marty Supreme.” In Josh Safdie’s ping-pong dramedy, Timothée Chalamet finds himself in prime position for his first Globe win — if he can fend off fellow heavyweights such as Leonardo DiCaprio (in “One Battle After Another”), George Clooney (“Jay Kelly”) and a resurgent Ethan Hawke (“Blue Moon”).Yorgos Lanthimos continues his blistering Globes momentum with Focus Features’ “Bugonia,” following previous nominations for “Poor Things” and “The Favourite.” Stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons are poised to make strong bids in the acting races. Add to that Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man,” the third entry in the “Knives Out” franchise and Park Chan-wook’s South Korean dark dramedy “No Other Choice” and the comedy/musical field becomes even tighter.With six nominees per category — and eight for the Globes’ box office and cinematic achievement race — the competition remains fierce from top to bottom.In lead actress (comedy/musical), Cynthia Erivo emerges as the clear front-runner for returning as Elphaba in Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked: For Good.” Her co-star Ariana Grande is also a major player in supporting actress. Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Chase Infiniti (“One Battle”), Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”) and Amanda Seyfried (“The Testament of Ann Lee”) are all vying for the remaining spots, with Dakota Johnson (“Materialists”), Pamela Anderson (“The Naked Gun”) and Globe darling Olivia Colman (“The Roses”) looking for an opportunity to sneak in.On the lead actor side, Chalamet may have the edge — he’s earned four Globe acting nominations already. But DiCaprio — already a three-time Globe winner — remains a formidable challenger for “One Battle After Another.” Plemons continues to rise with “Bugonia,” and veterans Clooney, Hawke and Daniel Craig (“Wake Up Dead Man”) aim to secure the remaining slots. And there’s another musical in the mix: the filmed version of the Broadway production of “Merrily We Roll Along,” which is eligible for Globes, but not Oscars.Still, the drama categories remain prestigious, even if more settled. “Sinners” leads the dramatic field, with “Hamnet” and “Sentimental Value” close behind. The latter has a surefire contender with Stellan Skarsgård looking to embark on the road to the Oscar. In drama actress, his co-star Renate Reinsve looks to take on Jessie Buckley, a locked and loaded contender for “Hamnet.”“Sinners” star Michael B. Jordan looks strong in drama actor, bolstered by the film’s overall chances and, hopefully, Ryan Coogler’s directing and screenplay bids.A compelling subplot comes from Brazil’s Wagner Moura in the thriller “The Secret Agent.” The “Narcos” star could mirror last year’s breakout Fernanda Torres, who won for “I’m Still Here” and then scored a surprise Oscar nomination. That film even landed a best picture nod, raising the question: Can “The Secret Agent” continue Latin American cinema’s award-season surge?As voting begins, the comedy/musical categories’ rise mirrors a broader realignment in Hollywood’s awards landscape. No longer the Globes’ consolation bracket, these races now contain some of the season’s most exciting contenders — and genuine Oscar hopefuls. Which film will pack the hardest punch?\n\tThe final Golden Globes predictions in film and TV are below.\n\t*** = PREDICTED WINNER(All predicted nominees listed below are in alphabetical order)",

    "body": "\n\t“Emily in Paris” has grown up. The series celebrated its anticipated Season 5 at a big premiere at the Grand Rex theater in Paris, with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and the series creator Darren Star, just a few hours after receiving the prestigious Legion of Honor from French President Emmanuel Macron. \n\n\tSarandos and Star were joined by the hit show’s dashing cast dressed in full fashion, including Lily Collins, Ashley Park, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Lucas Bravo, Lucien Laviscount, Eugenio Franceschini and series newcomer Minnie Driver and Michele Laroque. The rest of the cast, Samuel Arnold, Bruno Gouery, William Abadie, Paul Forman and Arnaud Binard were also there. \n\t\n\n\tWhile the first two episodes that screened at the premiere unfold in Rome – where Emily (Collins) has just moved to run the Grateau office and live the dolce vita with her Italian beau Marcello — Star told the crowd to rest assured that the show returns to Paris later on. \n\n\n\tCollins, radiant in a black Armani gown, joked about the playful feud that sparked between Macron and Rome mayor Roberto Gualtieri after the French president vowed to “fight hard” to keep the show in Paris upon hearing that it would relocate to the Italian capital. \n\n\t“I never expected in a million years we would be a part of a European political love triangle,” Collins said with a laugh. \n\n\tAfter Brigitte Macron, the French first lady, who made a cameo in Season 4,  Emmanuel Macron could be next, Star teased. “I asked him, so let’s see what happens!” he said. \n\n\tWhile on stage to kick off the premiere, Sarandos spoke about the “Emily in Paris” journey since its launch in the thick of the pandemic in 2020 and the ways in which it’s turned into a cultural phenomenon. \n\t\n\n\t“When Emily first came on the scene, the world was a very different place. We were stuck at home. We were looking for a connection. We were looking for a little escapism. And ‘Emily in Paris’ was just the ticket,” Sarandos said. “This incredible show from Darren Star arrived just in the right moment to remind people why they love Paris and inspired many people to dream of their own Paris adventure,” he continued, admitting that his wife Nicole was “one of Emily’s biggest fans.”\n\n\t“And since then, Emily in Paris has become a global sensation. It’s igniting conversation about culture and fashion and friendship,” he said, before adding, “The fruit of remarkable is how ‘Emily in Paris’ has deepened the cultural conversation between France and the world — It even sparked a very friendly rivalry with Italy over which country would claim the heart of Emily.”\n\n\tBefore coming on stage, Collins also talked about the show “growing up” beyond escapism and seeing her character becoming more mature. \n\n\t“Every year it really does feel like Emily learns more and more and grows as a person,” Collins says. “She has the inner confidence that maybe she lacked in season one in terms of stepping into a new job and a new city and new friends,” she said. “This year was really special to see her taking on new challenges and also being okay with vulnerability more, which I think is a real strength of Emily. So this year was really fun letting go of the perfection more.”\n\n\tLeroy-Beaulieu, whose character Sylvie reveals more emotional fragility this season, welcomed the shift in tone. “It’s about breaking the armor,” she said. “Under the comedy, there’s loneliness, doubt, insecurity — and strength. That paradox is beautiful.”\n\n\tAshley Park, wearing custom Dolce & Gabbana with Chopard jewels, agreed. “The writers outdo themselves every year,” she said. “There’s more love, more drama, and it’s really unexpected. The stakes are higher because these characters have history now.”\n\n\tThis season is also racier than previous ones, bringing the show closer to “Sex and the City.” Lucien Laviscount, who plays Alfie – Emily’s British on-and-off boyfriend — teased, “This season’s sexy. Things get steamy.” \n\n\tEugenio Franceschini, who plays Marcello, recalled a whirlwind audition opposite Collins with whom he appears to have a strong chemistry. “I flew from the Alps to Paris overnight,” he said. “She was amazing — kind, humble. The perfect partner.”\n\t\n\n\tBravo, who plays hunky French chef Gabriel, promised a lighter, sexier version of his character in this new season. “We wanted fun,” he said, looking swank in a Brioni suit. “That’s what people want when they watch this show.” As for Emily? “I always root for love,” he added. “But maybe everyone ends up alone. That’s the modern world.”\n\n\tStar, meanwhile, said Season 5 was his favorite so far. “There’s a lot of story this season,” he said. “There’s a strong storyline that continues throughout, with surprising turns and new relationships. Emily really grows as a character. The show grows up a little bit.”\n\n\t“Emily in Paris” is executive produced by Tony Hernandez, Lilly Burns, Andrew Fleming, Stephen Brown, Alison Brown, Robin Schiff, Grant Sloss and Joe Murphy. Co-executive producers are Stephen Brown, Grant Sloss and Murphy. Producers are Ryan McCormick, Raphaël Benoliel, Collins, Jake Fuller. \n\n\tAll 10 episodes of “Emily in Paris”‘s Season 5 are launching on Dec. 18. \n",

    "body": "\n\tBangkok-based Benetone Films and Fearfolks are ramping up their 2026 slate with K-horror title “Perfect Girl,” serving as executive producer and production company and Thai distributor, respectively, on the K-pop-themed thriller.\n\n\tThe film features an ensemble of international Asian talent bridging music and film, including Arden Cho and May Hong from Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters.” The cast also includes K-pop artists Jeon Somi, Nancy from Momoland, Siyoon from Billlie and Chaerin from Cherry Bullet, alongside Thai singer-actor Ally (“The Believers”), Adeline Rudolph and John Kim. Veterans Peter Lee Jae Yoon (“12:12 the Day”) and Samantha Cochran round out the lineup.\n\t\n\n\tDescribed as “‘Scream’ meets ‘Black Swan,'” the film follows a K-pop super group preparing for their debut. With only four spots available and the final cut a week away, the arrival of a mysterious new member triggers a series of deadly attacks.\n\n\n\tThe 2023 Blacklist script by Lynn Q. Yu is directed by Hong Won-ki, founder of Korean production company Zanybros and director of K-horror anthology “Goedam.”\n\n\tProducers include Badlands, Thunder Road (the “John Wick” franchise), Cho and Desert Bloom, with Scott Strauss leading production. The film will feature six original songs, including a new track from Jeon Somi and The Black Label, which also produced the “KPop Demon Hunters” soundtrack.\n\n\t“Perfect Girl” wrapped filming in Thailand in earlier this month.\n\n\t“The film is tapping into the worldwide phenomenon of K-pop, which signals a growing trend of bringing vibrant Asian narratives to global cinema stages,” said Benetone Films CEO Rachvin Narula.\n\t\n\n\t“Thailand’s competitive advantage stems from world-class crews, diverse locations and robust incentives, including a tiered cash rebate system that provides up to 30% for high-budget productions,” added Benetone Films COO Kulthep Narula. \n\n\t“This coordinated effort to bring this one-of-a-kind horror film illustrates the distinct capabilities of BFG to bring stories to life, from co-financing, production, and distribution. We are excited for both horror fans and K-pop aficionados to see this film,” said Fearfolks CEO Hans Audric Estialbo. \n\n\tFearfolks’ distribution slate has previously included titles such as “Good Boy,” Neon’s “Shelby Oaks” and A24’s “Eternity.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tInternational Film Festival Rotterdam has revealed the lineup of films selected across the Tiger, Big Screen and Tiger Short competitions for the festival’s 55th edition, running from Jan. 29-Feb. 8.\n\n\tIFFR will open with the world premiere of the Portuguese feature “Providence and the Guitar” by João Nicolau, which festival director Vanja Kaludjercic described as “a generous and witty film which places the present alongside echoes of the past.”\n\t\n\n\tInspired by a short novel by Robert Louis Stevenson, the film follows Leon and Elvira, two performers trying to keep their stage careers afloat. The film marks the acting debut of Salvador Sobral, one of Portugal’s best loved musicians and the winner of the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Providence and the Guitar”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of IFFR\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe festival will close with the world premiere of crime comedy “Bazaar (Murder in the Building)” from French filmmaker Rémi Bezançon, and starring Laetitia Casta, Gilles Lellouche and Guillaume Gallienne. Kaludjercic said the film had “style, intelligence and a sense of fun.”\n\n\tThe film follows an enthusiastic Hitchcock scholar who becomes convinced that the neighbor across the courtyard has murdered his wife. With her husband, a successful thriller novelist, she launches an investigation that is by turns risky, absurd and revealing.\n\n\tKaludjercic said: “The 2026 edition of IFFR unites new voices and returning artists whose works explore belonging, reinvention, humor, fear, beauty and the persistent human effort to understand our place in a changing world.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Bazaar (Murder in the Building)”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of IFFR\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTiger Competition“La belle année,” dir.

    "body": "\n\tUPDATED: The BBC has responded to President Donald Trump‘s lawsuit.\n\n\tA BBC spokesperson said: “As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”\n\n\tPREVIOUSLY: President Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to sue the BBC over the U.K. broadcaster’s documentary that edited his comments during the rally leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\t\n\n\tThe lawsuit was filed Monday by Trump’s lawyers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami, alleging defamation and violation of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Trump’s lawsuit demands no less than $5 billion in damages for each of the two counts, amounting to more than $10 billion total.\n\n\n\t“This action concerns a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump, which was published in a BBC Panorama documentary, that was fabricated and aired by the Defendants one week before the 2024 Presidential Election in a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence the Election’s outcome to President Trump’s detriment,” the 33-page complaint reads. (A copy is available at this link.)\n\n\tThe Trump lawsuit says, “The BBC, faced with overwhelming and justifiable outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, has publicly admitted its staggering breach of journalistic ethics, and apologized, but has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses. Accordingly, President Trump brings this action for compensatory and punitive damages for the extensive reputational harm inflicted upon him by the Defendants.”\n\t\n\n\tThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump’s lawsuit.\n\n\tBBC chair Samir Shah last month told staff in an email that the broadcaster was “determined to fight” any Trump lawsuit. “There is a lot being written, said and speculated upon about the possibility of legal action, including potential costs or settlements,” Shah said in the email, as reported by Sky News. Shah wrote, “I want to be very clear with you — our position has not changed. There is no basis for a defamation case and we are determined to fight this.”\n\n\tThe episode of BBC’s “Panorama” documentary program in question, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?”, aired in Oct. 24, 2024 — but only erupted into a firestorm after a leaked memo published in early November 2025 by The Telegraph accused the broadcaster of editing Trump’s speech to make it sound like he encouraged the Jan. 6 riots.\n\n\tA BBC review found that “Panorama” edited Trump’s Jan. 6 speech to be: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not gonna have a country anymore” — and that the part beginning with “and we fight” came 54 minutes after “we’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be with you.”\n\n\tTrump’s lawsuit cited the BBC’s internal review, which concluded that there had been “a string of incidents that demonstrate serious bias in the corporation’s reporting.”\n\n\tThe resulting scandal led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and CEO of news Deborah Turness. \n\n\tA previous letter from Trump’s lawyers to the BBC demanded a full retraction of the documentary, an apology and payment to “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.” Last month, the BBC issued an apology to Trump but refused to offer compensation. In a Nov. 14 statement, the corporation said, “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.” The BBC also said it has no plans to rebroadcast the “Trump: A Second Chance?” documentary on any BBC platforms.\n\n\tIn seeking to establish the U.S. District Court’s jurisdiction over the matter, Trump’s lawsuit notes that the U.S. president is a citizen of Florida while all defendants “are citizens of the United Kingdom.” However, the suit claims, “during the operative period alleged in this Complaint,” the BBC “engaged in substantial and not isolated business activities in Florida” — including through the bbc.com website and the U.S.-based BritBox streaming service. The “Panorama” episode in question was available via BritBox; in addition, Florida residents likely used VPN software to access the documentary via the BBC iPlayer (normally restricted to access in the U.K.), the lawsuit alleges.\n\t\n\n\tMoreover, “as plainly seen in the very beginning of the Panorama Documentary, the BBC’s producers and a film crew contracted by the BBC’s producers traveled to Florida to film significant portions of the Documentary at and around President Trump’s home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida, spending substantial amounts of time in Florida and capturing extensive footage on and around the grounds of Mar-a-Lago, and surrounding areas, that the BBC ultimately used in the Documentary,” the Trump lawsuit alleges.\n\n\tTrump has a long history of suing news outlets alleging defamation and attacking the media.\n\n\tTrump recently sued the New York Times, alleging its reporting about his finances and business career defamed him, in a lawsuit seeking at least $15 billion in damages. (Trump lawyers refiled the suit in October after a judge had dismissed the original complaint for being “tedious and burdensome.”) The New York Times said Trump’s lawsuit was without merit and called it “merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate PR attention.”\n\n\tSeparately, Trump this summer sued the Wall Street Journal, its parent companies Dow Jones and News Corp, Rupert Murdoch and two Journal reporters, alleging defamation over a WSJ story that described details of a birthday letter Trump sent in 2003 to Jeffrey Epstein. According to the lawsuit, Trump is demanding “not less than $10 billion” on two counts of defamation, for at least $20 billion total. Lawyers for the Wall Street Journal filed a motion to dismiss the suit, saying that Trump’s suit should be thrown out because the WSJ article in question “is true,” noting that in response to a congressional subpoena, “Epstein’s estate produced the Birthday Book, which contains the letter bearing the bawdy drawing and [Trump’s] signature, exactly as The Wall Street Journal reported.”\n\n\tIn 2024, Trump also sued ABC News and CBS News’ “60 Minutes.” Disney (parent of ABC News) and Paramount Global (parent of CBS) each paid $16 million to settle the cases. Trump sued ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos after Stephanopoulos falsely asserted on air that Trump had been found liable in a court case for raping writer E. Jean Carroll; in fact, a jury found Trump guilty of sexual abuse of Carroll. In the “60 Minutes” case, Trump had alleged a pre-election interview with former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was deceptively edited and thereby interfered with the 2024 election.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJerry Seinfeld has paid tribute to Rob Reiner following the beloved filmmaker’s shocking death alongside his wife Michele Reiner on Sunday.\n\n\tFor the comic, while Reiner is mostly being celebrated for movies such as “This is Spinal Tap,” “The Princess Bride” and “When Harry Met Sally,” he also offered crucial support for what would become the  hit, genre-defining NBC show “Seinfeld” in its troubled early days. \n\n\n\t“Next to Larry David and George Shapiro, Rob Reiner had the biggest influence on my career,” Seinfeld wrote in an Instagram post. David, of course, was his “Seinfeld” co-creator and executive producer, while longtime manager Shapiro also executive produced the sitcom.\n\t\n\n\t“Our show would have never happened without him. He saw something no one else could. When nobody at the network liked the early episodes, he saved us from cancellation,” added Seinfeld. “That I was working with Carl Reiner’s son, who happened to be one of the kindest people in show business, seemed unreal. I was naive at the time to how much his passion for us meant.”\n\n\tReiner’s Castle Rock Entertainment produced “Seinfeld,” but the 23-minute pilot — then titled “The Seinfeld Chronicles” — famously fell flat with both NBC executives and test audiences. When it eventually aired on July 5, 1989, it ratings were better than anticipated, prompting NBC to budget for four more episodes — described as the smallest sitcom order in TV history at the time. Castle Rock looked for other networks, but when no buyer emerged, accepted the order. TV history would — eventually — be made.\n\t\n\n\tSeinfeld also discussed Reiner’s wife Michele in his Instagram post. \n\n\t“Rob and Michele married right as our show was starting and they became an imprint for me of how it’s supposed to work, each one broadening the other,” he wrote. “Their death, together, is impossibly sad.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBritain’s Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy kicked off the government’s once-a-decade examination of the BBC‘s Royal Charter on Tuesday, setting in motion a process that will reshape the public broadcaster’s governance structure, revenue streams and editorial oversight before its current operating agreement expires in late 2027.\n\n\tNandy released a Green Paper detailing proposed changes aimed at preserving the broadcaster’s editorial autonomy while addressing financial sustainability and public confidence. The consultation period extends through March 10, with a policy White Paper slated for 2026.\n\t\n\n\tThe timing is particularly sensitive for the BBC, which is currently embroiled in a major legal dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump. On Monday, Trump filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the broadcaster over a “Panorama” documentary that edited his Jan. 6, 2021 speech. BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News CEO Deborah Turness resigned in November following the controversy, which saw the broadcaster apologize for what it called an “error of judgment” in editing the documentary.\n\n\n\t“We want the BBC to continue to enrich people’s lives, tell Britain’s story and showcase our values and culture at home and overseas, long into the future,” Nandy said in a statement. “My aims for the Charter Review are clear. The BBC must remain fiercely independent, accountable and be able to command public trust.”\n\n\tThe review arrives as the BBC navigates technological upheaval that has transformed content consumption patterns over the past decade, with audiences increasingly migrating from linear television to on-demand streaming services.\n\t\n\n\tAs Britain’s largest content investor and a major creative industry employer, the BBC contributes £5 billion ($6.7 billion) annually to the U.K. economy while maintaining a workforce exceeding 20,000. The corporation’s programming reaches 453 million viewers globally each week.\n\n\tThe consultation document outlines three interconnected priorities. First, enhancing the broadcaster’s editorial autonomy and standards, with potential changes to how government participates in board selection and revisions to the BBC’s core mission that would elevate accuracy to the same level as impartiality. The proposals include assigning the BBC new duties in combating false information alongside expanded public education efforts around digital literacy.\n\n\tSecond, the review examines financial model alternatives. Officials are weighing adjustments to the license fee structure, reassessing existing fee exemptions, and exploring how the broadcaster might expand its commercial operations. The consultation addresses funding mechanisms for the BBC World Service and minority language services, including S4C.\n\n\tThird, the government wants the BBC to serve as an economic catalyst across British regions. Recommendations include mandating the broadcaster to bolster the creative sector, distributing commissioning authority and resources beyond London, and establishing the BBC as a frontrunner in responsible technology adoption while enabling research and development investments.\n\n\tThe review additionally proposes enabling BBC investment in new technology research while fostering alliances with creative sector organizations and regional news providers.\n\n\tAlongside the Green Paper, officials published Framework Agreement modifications implementing recommendations from last year’s Mid-Term Review. The updates simplify media regulator Ofcom’s competitive evaluations, broaden regulatory scope to cover the BBC’s digital public service offerings, and strengthen the BBC Board’s oversight of audience grievance procedures.\n\n\tOfficials are soliciting public feedback through structured questions that will shape upcoming policy decisions. Parliament will debate a draft Charter before the existing agreement lapses, with new governing rules taking effect in 2028.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichelle Obama revealed on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” that she and Barack Obama were meant to see Rob and Michele Reiner on Sunday night, before hearing that the couple had been found dead in their home. \n\n\t“We’ve known them for many, many years and were supposed to be seeing them that night — last night,” Michelle Obama told Kimmel on Monday. “And we got the news.”\n\n\tRob and Michele Reiner were found dead inside their Brentwood home on Sunday afternoon around 3:40 p.m. and had reportedly been stabbed to death. On Monday, their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, was booked on suspicion of murder. \n\t\n\n\tThere was an outpouring of shock from Hollywood at the deaths of the legendary director, who helmed “The Princess Bride” and “When Harry Met Sally,” and his wife, a celebrated photographer and producer. However, Donald Trump took to Truth Social to say that Rob Reiner — a harsh critic of the president — had died “due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.” The statement prompted a harsh backlash from those on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\n\tSeemingly responding to Trump’s post, Michelle Obama told Kimmel: “Let me just say this: unlike some people, Rob and Michele Reiner are some of the most decent, courageous people you ever wanna know. They are not deranged or crazed, what they have always been are passionate people. In a time when there’s not a lot of courage going on, they were the kind of people who were ready to put their actions behind what they cared about. And they cared about their family and they cared about this country and they cared about fairness and equity. And that is the truth; I do know them.” \n\t\n\n\tEarlier in his Monday night show, Kimmel also slammed Trump for his remarks about Rob and Michele Reiner. \n\n\t“It’s so hateful and vile,” Kimmel said of the post. “When I first saw it, I thought it was fake. My wife showed it to me this morning. I was like, ‘Even for him, that seemed like too much.’ But nothing is ever too much for him.”\n\n\tWatch Michelle Obama’s full interview on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesian filmmaker Joko Anwar has been awarded the Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government, receiving the prestigious cultural honor at a ceremony held at the French Ministry of Culture in Paris.\n\n\tFrench Minister of Culture Rachida Dati presented the award, recognizing Anwar’s two-decade career and his impact on both Indonesian and international cinema. The honor places the director among a distinguished list of recipients that includes Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Tim Burton, Pedro Almodóvar, Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett and Miyazaki Hayao.\n\t\n\n\t“He established a unique artistic signature, exploring collective fears, social tensions, myths, and beliefs that shape our collective imagination,” Dati said. “His filmography spans a wide range of genres with rare freedom. He reinvented these genres with deep narrative vision and a singular aesthetic – blending traditional culture, social commentary, and gripping suspense.”\n\n\n\tDuring his acceptance speech, Anwar reflected on his approach to filmmaking. “Through stories packaged in horror, thrillers, or comedies, I try to talk about things that are often difficult to discuss directly: injustice, power, humans and the environment in which they live,” he said, noting that many of his works emerge from concerns about social and ecological issues.\n\n\tThe award arrives as Anwar prepares to release his twelfth feature, “Ghost in the Cell,” a horror-comedy co-produced by Barunson E&A, which is also handling worldwide sales. Set for release in 2026, the film uses a prison setting as a metaphor while addressing themes of environmental degradation, power and moral responsibility.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Ghost in the Cell’ is part of the same conversation I’ve always wanted to build through my films,” Anwar said. “Using genre to entertain, but also to encourage audiences to think about the world we live in.”\n\n\tThe Ordre des Arts et des Lettres represents one of the highest cultural honors bestowed by the French government, recognizing significant contributions to arts and literature internationally.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Woods, who has been vocally pro-Donald Trump, is speaking out against the “distasteful” comments made about Rob Reiner.\n\n\tWoods, who starred in Reiner’s “Ghosts of Mississippi” in 1996, opened up about his late friend during an appearance on Fox News on Monday night, revealing that he was at a low point and landing that job turned it around.\n\n\t“Rob literally saved my career and really put me back on track in a way that was so important and rewarding in my life. He really fought for me when a studio didn’t want me in a movie,” Woods said. “I went from really being basically out of a job to getting an Academy Award nomination, and I give all the credit to Rob.”\n\t\n\n\tGetting choked up multiple times during the interview with Jesse Watters, Woods explained that friends would often ask him how he could be friends with the director, despite their opposing political views; Reiner was a liberal activist, while Woods has been outspoken about supporting Trump.\n\n\t“I judge people by how they treat me, and Rob Reiner was a Godsend in my life. We got along great, we loved each other… He was always on my side,” Woods said. “When people would say to me, ‘What do you think of his politics?’ I would say, ‘I think Rob Reiner is a great patriot. Do I agree on many of his ideas on how that patriotism should be enacted, to celebrate the America that we both love? No. He doesn’t agree with me either, but he also respects my patriotism. We had a different path to the same destination, which was a country we both love.”\n\n\tHe added, “Because you disagree with people doesn’t mean that you have to hate people.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter noting that Reiner was “a real thinker” and “a lot of people just don’t think anymore,” Woods brought up how Reiner spoke about Charlie Kirk after he was assassinated in September. (In his last interview, Reiner was asked about Kirk’s death, and he called it “horrible,” adding, “I don’t care what your political beliefs are. That’s not acceptable. That’s not a solution to solving problems.”)\n\n\t“I knew Charlie Kirk, I supported him… people said some such horrible things, and Rob did not,” Woods said on Monday night. “When people say horrible things about Rob right now, I find it, quite frankly, infuriating and distasteful. Did I agree with his politics? I did not. Did I love him as I friend, as an artist, as an icon of Hollywood, and as a patriot? I most certainly did, and I am just absolutely devastated.”\n\n\tReiner and his wife, Michele Reiner, were murdered on Sunday, December 14, in their home in Brentwood, Calif. Following the deaths, Trump posted on TruthSocial that the director “passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”\n\n\tIn a press conference later that day, he added, “I wasn’t a fan of his at all. He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned. … I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\n\tWatch Woods’ segment below:\n\n🚨 MUST WATCH: Legendary Actor JAMES WOODS gets EMOTIONAL when talking about ROB REINER’S MURDER 🚨“Rob literally SAVED my CAREER and really put me back on track in a way that was so important and rewarding in my life” 🤯“People would go, ‘How is it that you and Rob Reiner… pic.twitter.com/XTCc0LYkfR— Jesse Watters (@JesseBWatters) December 16, 2025\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel slammed Donald Trump during his Monday night broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for saying Rob Reiner died “due to the anger he caused others” through his “Trump derangement syndrome.”\n\n\t“What we need at a time like this, besides common sense when it comes to guns and mental health care, is compassion and leadership. We did not get that from our president, because he has none of it to give. Instead, we got a fool rambling about nonsense,” Kimmel said. “For Rob and Michele Reiner, we got this post.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel then recited Trump’s Monday morning Truth Social post, which read, “A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”\n\n\n\tThe president continued, “He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\n\n\t“It’s so hateful and vile,” Kimmel said of the post. “When I first saw it, I thought it was fake. My wife showed it to me this morning. I was like, ‘Even for him, that seemed like too much.’ But nothing is ever too much for him.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel then turned his attention to an Oval Office press conference, where Trump was given “the chance to take another shot to act like a human being” and take back his post on Reiner. Trump instead doubled down.\n\n\t“I wasn’t a fan of his at all,” Trump told reporters Monday. “He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned. He knew it was false. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. He said I was a friend of Russia, controlled by Russia. You know, the Russia hoax. He was one of the people behind it. I think he hurt himself career-wise. He became like a deranged person. Trump derangement syndrome. So, I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\n\t“That corroded brain is in charge of our lives,” Kimmel said. “If you voted for that, it’s OK to reconsider. It’s perfectly fine. I have to say, I know from my personal interactions with Rob Reiner that he would want us to keep pointing out the loathsome atrocities that continue to ooze out of this sick and irresponsible man’s mouth. So we’re going to do that over and over again until the rest of us wake up.”\n\n\tKimmel wasn’t the only late-night host to discuss Reiner. Colbert opened his Monday night broadcast with a preface in light of Reiner’s death, as well as the shootings at Bondi Beach and Brown University.\n\n\t“Hello, everybody,” a somber Colbert said at his desk. “Normally, we start the show with a short cold open about a major news story of the day. But after the terrible news this past weekend, the horrifying Hanukkah massacre at Bondi Beach, the tragic shootings at Brown University and the heartbreaking deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner, all of the major stories are too dark for that. Other people’s tragedy is sacred ground, and we try very hard not to walk there. But we are going to do a comedy show tonight, in light of and in spite of the darkness.”\n\n\tReiner, a prolific filmmaker who broke into Hollywood starring in “All in the Family” before directing films like “Stand by Me,” “When Harry Met Sally…,” “This Is Spinal Tap” and “A Few Good Men,” was found stabbed to death Sunday afternoon in his Brentwood home alongside his wife of 36 years, Michele Singer. Reiner was 78 and Singer was 68.\n\t\n\n\tNick Reiner, the son of Rob and Michele, was arrested on Sunday at 9:15 p.m. and booked on Monday at 5:05 a.m. on suspicion of his parents’ murder, per the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department online records.\n\n\tLAPD Chief Jim McDonnell confirmed during a Monday morning press conference that Nick Reiner had been “booked for murder.” He added that it was a “very, very tragic incident.”\n\n\tCharges have not been filed. The LAPD said in a press release that investigators are expected to submit the case to the DA for filing on Tuesday.\n",

His check-in came hours after he got into a heated argument with his father at Conan O'Brien's Christmas party.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Eyewitnesses who saw Nick check in say he seemed \"tweaked out\", but there were no visible signs he had been in a violent confrontation -- we're told definitely no blood stains or cuts on his body.\n      \n\n          The reservation was made for just a day, but Nick never formally checked out.\n      \n    \n          When the staff came into his room later Sunday morning, they found the shower \"full of blood\" and blood on the bed.

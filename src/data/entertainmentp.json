    "body": "\n\tGary Shapiro is exiting as CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, the owner and producer of the annual CES confab in Las Vegas, after more than 35 years at the helm.\n\n\tShapiro, 69, will step down as CEO of the CTA May 1, 2026, at which time president Kinsey Fabrizio will take over the chief executive role. Shapiro will continue to serve as the trade group’s executive chair, a position he has held since Jan. 1. \n\n\n\tAs executive chair, Shapiro leads the executive board. He will continue to serve as a spokesperson for CTA and CES.\n\t\n\n\t“There is a time for everything, and I’m pleased with the new opportunities for CTA and for my next chapter,” Shapiro said in a statement. “This transition is part of a long-planned succession. It strengthens our long-term vision and ensures stability as we move forward. I’m excited to continue to partner closely with Kinsey to keep driving progress for the tech industry and CES. Our future is bright and I look forward to championing Kinsey, the important work of our entire organization, and pursuing new ventures.”\n\n\tOver his more than 35-year tenure as head of CTA, Shapiro “expanded the association’s influence and impact alongside the growth of the technology industry,” according to the trade group. He began his affiliation with CTA in 1978 as a law student working for a firm representing a part of the Electronic Industries Association before joining the association in-house in 1981. \n\n\tShapiro began leading what is now known as the Consumer Technology Association in 1991. During Gary’s tenure, CTA became an independent association, created the CTA Foundation focused on tech for older people and those with disabilities, and created a $15 million equal-opportunity fund focused on funding underrepresented founders, entrepreneurs and diverse leadership teams.\n\t\n\n\tShapiro also is credited with growing CES to be the largest annual U.S. trade show and attracting more non-U.S. attendees than any other event in the country, according to the CTA.\n\n\t“Today marks an important moment for CTA,” Pat Lavelle, industry executive adviser to the CTA executive board. “The Executive Board is proud of the strength and continuity this transition brings, and deeply excited for how it sets CTA up for continued success. With Gary and Kinsey in their new roles, we move forward with confidence, focus, and a shared commitment to our future.”\n\n\tFabrizio joined the CTA in 2008. As president, she serves on CTA’s executive board and has driven strategy and growth for the association and CES, overseeing the organization’s core business units and operations. In 2025, she testified before Congress advocating for a federal framework for AI. As senior vice president, she oversaw CES conferences and show operations, led an expansion of CES products, and spearheaded a modernization of CTA’s membership infrastructure and categories. Fabrizio also created CTA’s Health Division, launched a healthcare provider program for doctors at CES 2015. She also supported the Video Division Board’s 4K and 8K TV initiatives, founded the Content and Entertainment Council, and played a key role in recruiting emerging gig-economy and internet companies into CTA’s membership, the association said.\n\n\tBefore joining CTA, Fabrizio worked with SmithBucklin and Northern Virginia Mediation Service. She is a member of the George Mason University Costello College of Business Dean’s Advisory Council and the Washington Economic Club. Fabrizio holds a BA from George Mason University and an MBA from the University of Maryland Global Campus.\n\n\t“I am thankful to have spent most of my career at CTA, learning the organization and working alongside its most important resource, our people,” Fabrizio said in a statement. “Most importantly, I am grateful for the last 18 years I’ve spent learning from Gary, seeing firsthand how he advocates for our industry, our members, and CES. I’m excited to take on this new role and appreciate that he will continue to mentor me.”\n\n\tShapiro is a bestselling author of books including “Ninja Future: Secrets to Success in the New World of Innovation” (HarperCollins, 2019), “Ninja Innovation: The Ten Killer Strategies of the World’s Most Successful Businesses” (HarperCollins, 2013) and “The Comeback: How Innovation will Restore the American Dream” (Beaufort, 2011). His newest book, “Pivot or Die: How Leaders Thrive When Everything Changes,” was published by HarperCollins in October 2024. He has written over 1,500 commentaries on innovation, competition, and technology.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“I Want Your Sex,” a kinky thriller about a renowned provocateur artist and her naive new gallery assistant, has sold U.S. distribution rights to Magnolia Pictures. \n\n\tDirected by Gregg Araki, “I Want Your Sex” stars Olivia Wilde as the dom to Cooper Hoffman’s sub in the boundary-pushing provocation that follows the two as they engage in a sadomasochistic relationship. The film was one of the talks of Sundance due to its racy nature; their on-screen affair is complete with ball gags, stilettos, whips, chains and a cornucopia of dildos, strap-ons and a comically disastrous threesome.\n\t\n\n\t“I am over the moon and so grateful for the incredible reception at Sundance and Magnolia’s unadulterated passion for ‘I Want Your Sex,’” Araki said in a statement. “This has been a pure labor of love from day one and everyone at Magnolia is as pumped and excited as I am to get the film out there for audiences across the country to enjoy, react to and talk about.”\n\n\n\tMagnolia landed the project for seven figures after a bidding war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. The indie company has yet to formalize the release plans. Black Bear produced and financed the film in addition to handling international sales. John Von Thaden and Miranda Hill brokered the deal on behalf of Magnolia, with CAA Media Finance on behalf of the filmmaker.\n\n\t“’I Want Your Sex’ is a wild romp that represents all the reasons we love going to the movies,” said Magnolia Pictures co-CEOs Eamonn Bowles and Dori Begley. “As huge fans of Gregg Araki, we’re thrilled to unleash his widest theatrical release yet.”\n\t\n\n\tAraki wrote the script with Karley Sciortino and produced with Seth Caplan, Teddy Schwarzman, Michael Heimler, Courtney L. Cunniff and Sciortino. Co-producers are Beau J. Genot, Ezra Venetos and Tom Lee. Executive producers are Joanne Roberts Wiles, John Friedberg and Andrew Golov.\n\n\tAt the film’s Park City premiere, Wilde said she wished “more people made movies like [Gregg].”\n\n\t“I was so excited by Gregg’s enthusiasm for the medium, for the process,” Wilde told the crowd at the Eccles Theater. “[He] just said, ‘Let’s do it. Let’s get cool people together who want to tell a story, and let’s just do it. It doesn’t have to be a whole thing, and it doesn’t have to feel like this corporate project. It has to just come from the heart.’ I wanted to be a part of something like that.”\n\n\t“I Want Your Sex” is Araki’s 11th feature at Sundance, having previously debuted such films as “Mysterious Skin” and “The Doom Generation” over the years. Meanwhile Wilde had another film at the mountain festival in “The Invite,” another sexually charged comedy which she directed and stars in alongside Seth Rogen, Edward Norton and Penelope Cruz. A24 bought “The Invite” for more than $12 million after an old-fashioned, all-night bidding war.\n\n\tOtherwise, only a handful of Sundance titles have found buyers in the weeks since the final Park City edition has wrapped. Conversion therapy thriller “Leviticus” sold to Neon for a price tag that’s reportedly in the seven-figure range, while “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” landed at Sony Pictures Classics. Meanwhile, buzzy projects like “Wicker,” a fantasy comedy with Olivia Colman, Peter Dinklage and Alexander Skarsgard, as well as the harrowing drama “Josephine” starring Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan, have generated plenty of interest but have yet to sell.\n\n\tIn Variety’s review of “I Want Your Sex,” chief film critic Peter Debruge was mixed but praised Wilde’s “pure-camp performance.” \n\n\t“Hoffman and Wilde’s commitment makes the film feel more important than it is. It’s better to think of this either as pure, irreverent escapism or a guiltless pleasure,” Debruge wrote. “There’s no important message or perceptive social insight to be gleaned from ‘I Want Your Sex,’ beyond Araki giving the kids enthusiastic permission to test their own boundaries. Once you get past the shock, the plot falls apart. But that hardly matters, since Araki’s achieved his main goal: getting a repressed generation to loosen up about sex by pushing the boundaries between profound and profane.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCharles Darwin once noted that the species that survives “is the one that is the most adaptable to change.” As indie film buyers and sellers prepare to come together at the European Film Market in Berlin, there is a sense that, although the arthouse market is fragmented and not a little divided, the leaders in the field are adapting to the ever-evolving complexities of the specialty world.\n\n\tThere is a shift in the arthouse market away from straight drama. “Specialty has become a lot more genre-friendly. My term is we look for the ‘genre-teurs,’ for the auteurs of genre,” says Scott Shooman, head of IFC Entertainment Group. “While drama doesn’t perform the way it used to, we know the numbers and build our business model around the realities of the marketplace.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Match Factory has four films in competition at Berlin — “Queen at Sea,” “Home Stories,” “Rosebush Pruning” and “Rose” — that Thania Dimitrakopoulou, VP, international sales, says are jokingly referred to internally as all being family films. But in reality, “they could not be more different, one from the other,” although the one thing that unites them is that they are all about “identity and belonging,” she says.\n\n\n\tThe key is to know the audience for each film. “We’re trying to figure out each time who our target is,” says Gabrielle Stewart, CEO at HanWay Films. “There are definitely talent and stories that appeal to the streamers and that audience.” Then there is the question, “What makes a film theatrical?” Originality, the genre and which stars are attached are three considerations among many.\n\t\n\n\t“There is the talent that appeals to the theatrical distributors, and it’s not always the same [as the streamers],” she says. “And there’s also a real discrepancy sometimes between what appeals to the U.S. market, as opposed to the international market.”\n\n\tThe division between the U.S. and international territories is also noted by Olivier Barbier, a former MK2 Films executive now heading Paris-based sales company Lucky Number, which is handling the Berlinale opener, “No Good Men,” an Afghan romantic comedy.\n\n\t“Almost all of our films sell in the U.S., but the price gap is extreme. You have huge battles at Cannes with crazy prices for international rights, and alongside that you have prices that are extremely low for the U.S. We sometimes sell cheaper in the U.S. than in Bulgaria — and I’m hardly exaggerating,” he says.\n\n\tWhatever the market landscape, the important question is: “How do we get people interested again in going to the cinema?” according to Mark Gooder, co-president of Cornerstone. “Our answer to that is: We have to go back to where we all started, which is with material that came out of nowhere, that people started to talk about and then what they went to see. So we think it is those films that are bold, original, innovative … the fresh take, the reinterpretation, whatever you want to call it, anything that’s not generic, right? I think ‘Pillion’ is a great example of what might have looked scary and a little bit ‘Ooh!’ has turned into something that people are embracing.”\n\n\tZach Glueck, co-CEO of recently launched Manifest Pictures, adds, “The worst thing you could be in this market is boring. I’d rather be out there with something that is aggressive and divisive than something …” and co-CEO Yvette Zhuang completes his thought, “that you’ve seen 10,000 times before.”\n\n\tAnother disjuncture in the market is between English- and non-English-language films, Tassilo Hallbauer, Beta Cinema’s executive VP of sales, acquisitions and international co-productions, says. The former, fueled by “private investors and gap and equity investments and so on, are having an incredibly difficult time at the moment to close financing,” he says. The latter, “where you have five, six countries co-producing and financing entirely out of soft money and [public] funds and so on” is faring better. It is London-based Hallbauer’s mission to bridge that divide with films like “500 Mile,” starring Bill Nighy and Maisie Williams, which has its market premiere at EFM.\n\t\n\n\tThen there is the split in the audience based on age. “Anglo-Saxon distributors are much less afraid to seek out younger audiences for arthouse cinema,” says Barbier. “In Western Europe, as soon as a film targets younger audiences, there’s a reflex to say: We don’t know how to address them, so we don’t go there. Arthouse cinema needs to be revisited by younger audiences. There’s no reason why it shouldn’t be.”\n\n\tAlthough in an ideal world the audience for a film will be drawn from all four quadrants, that’s not a common occurrence. The star of HanWay’s “Billion Dollar Spy,” Russell Crowe, appeals to a more mature crowd, while Christopher Briney, who appears in “The Julia Set,” is an example of an actor better known to the younger demographic, thanks to Amazon Prime series “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” Stewart says. HanWay is selling both in the EFM.\n\n\tAnecdotally, it would appear that older audiences have returned to theaters at almost pre-COVID levels. “They’re back, and if anything, that’s the growing market again,” Janina Vilsmaier, senior VP of sales and distribution at Protagonist Pictures, says. “You can see that in all these territories. Some are faster, some are not, but it is going back to the levels that it was before.”\n\n\tBarbier points to a schism between auteur films. “We started the company with a very basic idea, which was to counter a discourse that was becoming widespread and a little depressing, a discourse that was partly true, based on the polarization of sales between certain auteur films that would do very well and others that would not find their audience,” he says.\n\n\t“If you look at the big festivals today, you have what we call first-week films – not only films that premiere in the first week, but films that are negotiated in the first week of the market,” he says. “Regardless of their size, distributors all go after the same films, even if it means losing them. The question is: How second-week films can exist?”\n\n\tMovies are taking longer to sell, he says. “What I call the long term is actually selling films in several markets and not just at the time of the premiere. There is this belief that a film is marketed at the time of its arthouse premiere, and either it goes very well and wins everything, or it doesn’t and we move on to the next one. Our company’s philosophy was created to counteract this. We’ve had films that were successful over the long term,” Barbier says.\n\t\n\n\tShooman also says dealmaking is taking longer. “We end up talking about films for a long time. It doesn’t have to be that a movie is announced in a marketplace and it closes in 24 hours. This is a relationship business.”\n\n\tBut, notes Dylan Leiner, Sony Pictures Classics’ executive VP of acquisitions, production and business affairs, Berlin’s director, Tricia Tuttle, is playing her part in bridging indie divisions. “What Tricia is doing is moving Berlin in the right direction,” he says. “It’s a good mix of auteur and commercial, and she’s programming according to the zeitgeist of the culture.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tParis-based international sales banner Charades has boarded “In a Violent Nature 2,” the sequel to the 2024 horror hit, and is getting ready to give it a big market push at the EFM in Berlin.\n\n\tThe first film, “In a Violent Nature,” had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2024 and quickly became a cult slasher after being released theatrically by Independent Film Company (formerly known as IFC Films) and Shudder. \n\n\n\tThe sequel, which started shooting in Canada in September and is now in post, brings back Ry Barrett as Johnny, a vengeful, undead killer who embarks on a bloody rampage after a group of teens steal a golden locket that awakens his spirit. In the second film, Johnny heads to a summer camp, where he crosses paths with a young, outcast camper who is forced to spend the night with his counselor sister and her friends at their annual end-of-season party. Lucas Nguyen, Olivia Scriven, Laurie Babin, Fionn Laird, Donald MacLean Jr. and Evan Marsh complete the cast.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is written by Chris Nash. Producers are Peter Kuplowsky, Shannon Hanmer, with Nash and Michael James Regan, alongside co-producer Liane Cunje.\n\n\tIndependent Film Company and Shudder first announced the sequel during the Bold Voice of Contemporary Horror panel at San Diego Comic-Con. Upon premiering at Sundance, the movie garnered solid reviews, including in Variety.\n\n\t“‘In a Violent Nature 2‘ is a first feature, driven by a new vision, with more kills, more blood, hopefully even more iconic,” said Charades’ co-founders Carole Baraton, Pierre Mazars and Yohann Comte.\n\t\n\n\tKuplowsky pointed out that his “history with Charades dates back to ‘Psycho Goreman.'” “We are thrilled that they continue to have a taste for our gory genre delights,” said Kuplowsky, before adding that “with this sequel, fans can expect an exponential increase of the ol’ ultraviolence with a distinct hook, but one that still collides with storied slasher traditions.”\n\n\tCharades will also be attending the European Film Market with Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s first-ever period drama “Kokurojo: The Samurai and the Prisoner“; as well as Louis Paxton’s debut feature “The Incomer,” which played at Sundance; and Yoshitoshi Shinomiya’s “A New Dawn,” set to compete at the Berlinale.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA massive, modern new studio is headed to New Jersey.\n\n\tAlan Mruvka, a real estate developer and the co-creator of E! Entertainment Television, announced today the launch of Filmology Labs: Content Creation Studios. The $250 million studio complex will be located in Paterson, New Jersey, and will focus on next-gen content creation like vertical micro-dramas, digital series, podcasts and AI-driven media.\n\n\n\tThe complex will also house Mruvka’s vertical micro-drama platform Verza TV, which plans to produce more than two vertical micro-dramas per month, alongside projects from other micro-drama producers, production companies and independent content creators.\n\t\n\n\t“Paterson is one of the most extraordinary cities in New Jersey and a vibrant community,” Mruvka said in a statement. “Our goal is to engage local schools to help train young people for careers in this fast-growing industry, while drawing investment into Paterson and showcasing the city to the world. Filmology Labs is about creating opportunity—creatively, economically, and culturally.”\n\n\tFilmology Labs will be located in Paterson’s historic Reinhardt Building at 61 State Street, which once served as a silk mill. Known locally as the Padded Wagon Building, it will become a 250,000 square foot production hub that is close to New York City but can also take advantage of New Jersey tax credits.\n\n\t“We are thrilled to welcome Filmology Labs to Paterson,” said Paterson Mayor André Sayegh in a statement. “This significant investment will create jobs, spark innovation, and help position our city at the forefront of the evolving media and entertainment economy. Projects like this generate new opportunities for residents, support local businesses, and accelerate Paterson’s continued growth and revitalization.”\n\t\n\n\tPer the press release, “Designed by celebrity architect Conrad Roncati of Architectura, Filmology Labs will differ fundamentally from traditional big-box sound stages. Built as Content Creation Studios, the campus is designed for speed, efficiency, and scale. Filmology Labs will feature 21 production sound stages with pre-built, fully lit, permanent standing sets optimized for vertical storytelling and creator-driven production. This approach eliminates the time and cost typically associated with set design, construction, and lighting — allowing micro-dramas and digital content to be produced quickly and economically.”\n\n\tThe resources and amenities in the complex will also include sound stages, AI studios, podcast studios, a green-screen stage and an LED Volume Wall stage, which is comparable to the one used on “The Mandalorian.” The campus will also include creative office space, a commissary capable of serving 200 people and a fitness and yoga studio.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHot off the release of his latest album and with a tour planned for this summer, Nick Jonas is now getting back in front of the camera. \n\n\tThe popstar-turned-actor is set to star in upcoming action-thriller “Bodyman,” which is launching at the European Film Market in Berlin with A Higher Standard. \n\n\tThe film will be directed by Gary Fleder (“Homefront,” “Kingdom,” “Reacher”) from a script penned by Byron Balasco (“Kingdom”). Principal photography is scheduled to commence in June 2026.\n\t\n\n\t“Bodyman” follows a violent struggle for power and, ultimately survival, that ensues during a family Christmas when an eccentric billionaire unexpectedly signs over his nepo-baby children’s expected inheritance of his private military company to his longtime bodyguard (Jonas). Who will make it out of their remote family estate alive?\n\n\n\t“Working on ‘Kingdom’ with Byron Balasco and Nick Jonas was one of the highlights of my career,” said Fleder. “So I’m thrilled to jump back in with them on ‘Bodyman’ —a smart, lean, high-voltage action thriller that gives Nick the chance to show every side of what he can do: the physicality, the intensity, and the emotional depth.” \n\n\tSpencer Berman and Jonas will produce for Powered by Jonas, alongside Nickel City Pictures’ Mark Fasano and A Higher Standard’s Jeffrey Greenstein.\n\n\t“We are always looking for compelling stories that elevate the action genre,” says Greenstein. “And it’s even more exciting when you pair a talent like Nick Jonas, with his deep commitment to the craft, alongside an incredible creative team to deliver a grounded and gripping film that audiences crave.”\n\t\n\n\tJonas added: “I’ve been developing this project for a while and I’m excited to see it come to fruition. Re-teaming with Byron Balasco and director Gary Fleder also makes this project more special to me.”\n\n\tA Higher Standard is handling worldwide sales. Jonas is repped by UTA and Shreck Rose Dapello Adams Berlin & Dunham. Fleder is repped by IAG and Brecheen Feldman Breimer Silver Thompson. Balasco is repped by CAA.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWould James Cameron ever bid adieu to Pandora? \n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash,” the director’s third otherworldly adventure, is nearing the end of its box office run with $1.4 billion globally. It’s an enormous sum (ranking as Hollywood’s second-biggest release of 2025), but still considerably behind 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” both of which soared above $2 billion. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s a feat for any movie to clear $1 billion these days. For cinema operators, who get a cut of revenues, “Avatar” is a gift because these are the rare films that remain draws for weeks on end. Disney has more at stake: The studio spent roughly $500 million to produce and promote “Fire and Ash,” meaning the threequel can be insanely popular yet barely profitable. Any dwindling interest in Pandora is problematic because Disney has committed to two more installments, which are slated for 2029 and 2031.\n\n\n\tCameron, meanwhile, has expressed doubts about the series’ long-term health. He joked last December that he’d host a press conference to determine the franchise’s fate after assessing the financial results for “Fire and Ash.” In other words, he’s aware that diminishing box office returns would make the film’s exorbitant production costs harder to justify.\n\n\tIt’s admittedly bizarre to question the viability of a billion-dollar property. What studio wouldn’t want that kind of windfall? But back in 2022, Cameron told GQ that his “Avatar” blockbusters represent the “worst business case in movie history” given their break-even points of roughly $1.5 billion. Although “Fire and Ash” will fall just short of that theatrical benchmark, the tentpole will recoup costs through Disney+ and other avenues. The company also is banking on the film inspiring visits to the Pandora area in Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s one thing to say, ‘This was profitable, not massively so, but the property benefits us in other ways, especially theme parks,” says Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s film school. “It’s another to say, ‘We’re going to invest another $500 million twice,’ if you’re on this downward trajectory.”\n\n\tCutting costs would be the obvious fix. \n\n\t“I imagine Disney is doing a lot to put the brakes on budgets — and that may eventually lead to a breaking point,” Galloway says. “James Cameron makes expensive films.” \n\n\tThat’s a fact. Cameron, a man of many talents, isn’t thrifty. Nearly every one of his movies, from “Terminator 2” to “Titanic” to all things “Avatar,” was at the time the most expensive ever made.\n\n\tThrough those films, however, Cameron has become a brand unto himself. He’s the only director to boast four consecutive billion-dollar hits (three of which also generated above $2 billion). He’s notorious for going over budget and falling behind schedule, but Cameron possesses an innate understanding of what audiences want to see on the biggest of screens. There’s a reason that “Don’t bet against James Cameron” has become a mantra in the exhibition community.\n\n\tIn the case of “Avatar,” a common sentiment is audiences go for the visual spectacle rather than the story. Box office watchers believe that’s a factor in the drop off-for “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” The threequel relinquished its crown after its fifth weekend. Meanwhile the first two films each ranked No. 1 at the box office for seven consecutive weekends on their path to $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. \n\n\tA criticism was the three-hour-17-minute feature felt too narratively similar to the second film, without introducing the kind of technological advancements that turned “Avatar” and “The Way of Water” into phenomena. Moreover, analysts suggest that not enough time passed between installments. “Fire and Ash” debuted just three years after “The Way of Water,” a short gap compared with the previous decade-plus wait. \n\t\n\n\t“There’s a massive built-in fanbase,” acknowledges Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese. “However, there wasn’t anything spectacularly different from the technology or storyline. If you saw the second and were pleased, you may have gone to see the third. But you might have heard from others that it wasn’t as necessary.” \n\n\tMeanwhile Disney in 2025 fielded two other billion-dollar smashes, “Lilo & Stitch” and “Zootopia 2,” that were much more profitable. Not only were those kid-friendly films far less expensive to make, costing $100 million and $150 million respectively, but they were consumer product juggernauts. “Lilo & Stitch,” for instance, ranks among Disney’s best-selling franchises with retail sales of over $2.4 billion in 2024, the year before the Hawaiian-set remake ventured to theaters.\n\n\t“’Avatar’ is not a children’s property, so Disney isn’t going to have quite as much in the way of consumer products,” Reese says. “And it doesn’t need the franchise to continue to benefit from the experiences side.”\n\n\tGiven his track record, Cameron is unlikely to hear a no from Hollywood. He’s equally unlikely to economize; the process of incorporating visual effects is enormously expensive. So industry observers emphasize creative direction. They think Cameron needs to find a fresh take on the Na’vi to reverse the downward commercial track.\n\n\t“If Cameron can build upon the story, the fourth is going to be spectacular,” Reese says. “And he is certainly capable of this. Look at ‘Titanic.’ Look at ‘Terminator.’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tStarring Gael García Bernal (“Y tu mamá también,” “Mozart in the Jungle”) and Natalia Oreiro (“Iosi, the Regretful Spy,” “Santa Evita”), romantic comedy “Nada entre los dos” (“Nothing Between Us”) has been picked up by HBO Max Latin America and Latido Films.\n\n\tVariety has also accessed in exclusivity a first look image of the feature which they describe as “a story of awakened desire and unexpected connection.” “The movie combines with and emotion as it reflects on the challenges and opportunities that come with a desire to break with the direction of one’s life,” said a press statement.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Juan Taratuto (“Resurrection,” ) “Nada entre los dos” will be introduced at this week’s Berlin’s European Film Market by Latido Films which has acquired world sales rights outside Latin America where the film will be released theatrically this year and later be available exclusively on HBO Max in Latin America.\n\n\n\tWeighing in as one of the EFM’s most commercial packages from Latin America, “Nada entre los dos” allies not only some of its biggest stars but also some of its most muscular companies. \n\n\tCimarrón Cine, the film arm of high-flying production-services company Cimarrón, part of The Mediapro Studio, produces with Taratuto’s Buenos Aires-based label Concreto Films in co-production with Particular Crowd, for Warner Bros. Discovery Latin America.\n\n\t“I was interested in questioning the authenticity of certain bonds and depicting the freedom of being able to connect with someone untethered by mandates or structures, in contrast with the rigidity that often sets in for an established couple,” said Taratuto. “Sometimes those random sparks hold more truth than some of the more formal life choices. And sometimes those sparks allow us to re-signify the present and attempt a rescue move on it.”\n\t\n\n\tWritten by Taratuto and Matías Scartascini, “Nada entre los dos” charts disruptive passion. Living in Mexico City, Guillermo (García Bernal) and Mechi (Oreiro), in Buenos Aires, are separated by over 4,000 miles and their marriages, both having structured family lives. Working for the same multinational food manufacturer they meet by chance at a corporate offsite. The attraction between them proves immediate and irresistible. “The sudden spark makes them face their own desires and changes them in deeper ways than they thought possible,” the film’s synopsis ends. \n\n\t“Nada entre las dos” offers a fresh take on the romantic comedy genre, narrated from a thoroughly contemporary perspective. It has been a tremendous privilege to work with a director like Juan Taratuto and international stars such as Gael García Bernal and Natalia Oreiro – a privilege we hope audiences will enjoy just as much,” said Santiago López, head of Cimarrón.\n\n\t“We are very proud of how every creative decision – big and small – served the film’s honest, intimate voice, and I look forward to audiences encountering how Gael García Bernal and Natalia Oreiro approached their roles in this romantic comedy,” added Concreto Films Head Dolores Llosas. \n\n\tPeter Bevan, head of Particular Crowd, said that ‘Nada entre los dos” is exactly the bold, emotionally resonant storytelling that Particular Crowd is proud to support. “With Juan Taratuto’s distinctive voice and the extraordinary pairing of Gael García Bernal and Natalia Oreiro, the film offers a fresh, honest take on modern relationships that will strongly connect with audiences across Latin America,” he added.\n\n\t“We are grateful to the producers for trusting us to take this movie to market. It is not often we see a movie that is so open, so well-directed and can boast of such a stellar cast. ‘Nada entre los dos’ has all the elements to reach every corner of the world,” he added.\n\n\tBreaking out with 2004’s “It’s Not You, It’s Me” and 2007’s “Who Says It’s Easy?” which underscored his flair for romantic comedy,  Juan Taratuto has directed eight films. “The Reconstruction” (2013) screened in Venice Days and won the Critics’ Choice Award at Spain’s Valladolid Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter a tumultuous debut edition set against the tense backdrop of German elections and the escalating war in Gaza, Berlin Film Festival director Tricia Tuttle returns for her sophomore year with rock solid determination. If last year was about weathering the storm, this year is about reaffirming the Berlinale’s core mission to put cinema first and champion the indie film industry.\n\n\t“I feel like having fighting words, but in a really positive way,” Tuttle says. “There is something for every buyer, every audience in that competition. Each film deserves to be there because the filmmakers are working at the top of their game.”\n\t\n\n\tThat breadth is central to this upcoming 76th edition of the Berlin Film Festival, the world’s second-largest film festival after Cannes by size. The European Film Market, which runs concurrently with the fest, will once again lure thousands of distributors, sales agents and financiers to the city. With 336,000 tickets sold to the public, 2,429 media representatives from 78 countries and 17,135 industry professionals, including 1,314 buyers, in attendance in 2025, Berlin remains both a public-facing cultural event and a key market where packages and completed films are sold.\n\n\n\tThe festival is also on a solid footing for now, Tuttle says, having secured a balanced budget and around 60% of income self-generated through ticket sales, sponsorship and market activity.\n\n\tAn American who ran the BFI London Film Festival for five years, Tuttle took over Berlin in 2024 from Carlo Chatrian and Mariette Rissenbeek with a mandate to re-energize the Berlinale and edge it closer to Cannes’ global prestige without sacrificing its auteur-driven DNA or its political conscience.\n\t\n\n\tThat balance plays out in this year’s competition, which mixes intimate European films and some eye-catching entries headlined by U.S. and U.K. talent, such as Karim Aïnouz’s starry “Rosebush Pruning” with Riley Keough, Callum Turner and Elle Fanning; Beth de Araújo’s “Josephine,” starring Channing Tatum and Gemma Chan; and Kornél Mundruczó’s “At the Sea,” toplining Amy Adams and Brett Goldstein.\n\n\tEuropean stars will also be out in force, including Juliette Binoche opposite Tom Courtenay in Lance Hammer’s “Queen at Sea,” while German actor Sandra Hüller — who broke out internationally with her roles in “Anatomy of a Fall” and “The Zone of Interest” in 2024 — leads Markus Schleinzer’s black-and-white 17th century drama “Rose.”\n\n\tTuttle admits she started chasing “Rosebush Pruning” even before it was finished. “I knew it would be something special,” she says, singling out Fanning for a performance she calls “smart, sinister and quite satirical.”\n\n\tThe film underscores a broader trend across the lineup at the Berlinale, as well as other festivals, that sees Hollywood actors gravitating toward European directors.\n\n\t“American producers and actors are building stronger links with European industries,” Tuttle notes, pointing to companies like Plan B, which is expanding its footprint in the U.K. “It’s the kind of independent cinema Hollywood used to make more often, films that take risks and aren’t culturally rooted in just one territory.”\n\n\tThe festival chief is also keen to steer buyers toward discoveries. She highlights Teodora Ana Mihai’s “Heysel 85” and Anke Blondé’s “Dust.” “These are beautifully made European films that could reach much broader audiences,” she says.\n\n\tIndeed, Tuttle isn’t just about the art; she also understands the business. In her presentation of the lineup, she highlighted the fact that several movies in competition have not yet secured distribution. “We really want the Berlinale to join the two sides of the brain: the European Film Market and our public program,” she says. “We need to prove to buyers and to filmmakers that we can help them launch bigger films and help them find the right press and right distributors.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Berlinale will welcome back several acclaimed alumni such as Angela Schanelec, İlker Çatak and Fernando Eimbcke with their new works, underscoring the Berlinale’s long-term relationship with filmmakers across generations.\n\n\t“It’s lovely to see people come back,” Tuttle says, before adding, “If the film doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. But festivals like Berlin do play a role in helping talent develop over many years.”\n\n\tPolitics, inevitably, remains part of the Berlinale’s identity, although Tuttle resists the notion that Berlin is uniquely political. “We get labeled that more than we label ourselves,” she says. “Berlin is a political city, and it’s a very engaged audience. Often it’s the conversation around the films as much as the films themselves.”\n\n\tLast year’s edition was plagued by geopolitical tensions that spilled into screenings and Q&As. Tuttle says her team spent months “re-anchoring” the festival, supporting programmers and moderators, and lowering the temperature without shying away from challenging work.\n\n\t“There’s a confidence about the festival now,” she says. “We’re not afraid of films with strong points of view, but we also remind people of everything else we’re here to do.”\n\n\tThat includes resisting cultural boycotts.\n\n\tWhile some festivals, like the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, have taken a hard line against Israeli films and producers, Berlin has invited some of that country’s filmmakers, including Assaf Machnes, a Berlinale Talent alum, whose film “Where To,” produced out of Germany and made with Palestinian collaborators, will play in the Perspectives section.\n\n\t“The Berlinale doesn’t boycott culture workers,” she says. “Artists are the people who can hold a mirror up and ask difficult questions. Isolation is not the answer.”\n\n\tBeyond geopolitics, Tuttle is increasingly concerned by what she calls the Berlinale’s “biggest political battle”: the future of cinema itself.\n\n\tIndependent distributors are struggling, arthouse cinemas are closing and even strong films are failing to break through. “We have infrastructure problems to solve,” she says. “How do we keep independent cinemas alive? How do distributors who take risks get a return? How do we reach younger audiences?”The festival is experimenting with different initiatives — from low-cost tickets for 18- to 25-year-olds to a stronger presence on TikTok and Letterboxd — to lure younger viewers, but Tuttle admits there are no easy fixes. “We need to create a virtuous circle where people expect films to succeed.”\n\t\n\n\tTuttle applied that mantra in choosing Afghan director Shahrbanoo Sadat’s “No Good Men” as the opening night film. A German co-production set in a Kabul newsroom before the Taliban’s return to power, “No Good Men” was totally under the radar.\n\n\t“We want to surprise people,” Tuttle says. “It’s a deeply touching film. There’s no one else doing for Afghan cinema what Sadat is doing.”\n\n\tUltimately, “that’s what festivals do,” she says. “We help the industry and we help audiences discover new talent. If we don’t do that, who are the next generation of filmmakers?”\n",

Most of them are striking various poses or mimicking models walking a runway.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Considering Epstein's reputation, there's an obvious reason for concern ... but the feds say there were no crimes committed in these videos. In a 2025 memo, an FBI agent wrote they confiscated videos and photos from Epstein's electronic devices at his residences in NYC and Palm Beach.\n      \n\n          After reviewing all the content, the FBI found no evidence the women were abused in the videos or in the pics. It's not clear how old they are, but the FBI agent on the case wrote ... some of the females could be in their late teens.\n      \n    \n          Earlier this month, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche voiced similar rhetoric about the files, in general, telling CNN's Dana Bash, the DOJ \"reviewed the files, the quote Epstein files, and there was nothing in there that allowed us to prosecute anybody.\"\n      \n    \n          Almost everyone else disagrees with Blanche and the DOJ, believing Epstein's alleged accomplices should all be prosecuted and sent to prison. As you know, Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's cohort, is the only Epstein associate to be convicted for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors. She's currently serving her 20-year sentence in federal prison.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jeffrey Epstein\n              \n                          \n                Ghislaine Maxwell\n              \n                          \n                Epstein Files\n              \n                          \n                Politics\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Bottom line: she needs more time to \"rest and rehearse\" so she can actually make it through the entire run.\n      \n\n          The cities on Demi's chopping board include Charlotte, Nashville, Atlanta, Las Vegas, and Denver. The Disney alum apologized to her fans and laid out exactly how and where they can get refunds.\n      \n    \n          Those fans will be understandably bummed ... especially since Demi hasn’t toured since 2022 and this new tour was meant to follow the release of her ninth album last October. Now, they'll just have to regroup, grab refunds, and start booking flights to the cities that survived the cut!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Demi Lovato\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                Disney\n              \n                          \n                Concerts and Tours\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

The adult content creator reportedly had unprotected sex with around 400 men, setting a world record.\n      \n    \n          That's right ... While the Winter Olympics wage on in Italy, the bedroom Olympics raged in the UK over the weekend. Us Weekly reports Bonnie -- real name Tia Billinger -- had men waiting in line for up to 7 hours at Lord Davenport's mansion on February 7 for the chance to \"breed\" her.\n      \n    \n          According to Us Weekly, the previous record was 65 men. That achievement was reached by Ariana Jollee in 2004.\n      \n\n          Bonnie, 26, told the publication, “I was concerned I’d drown with the amount of fluids I had planned to consume, and did consume by the end of the day. I wanted the men who wanted to be a dad the most, with the strongest swimmers, to get a fast pass to the front of the queue.”\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          We don't know if those \"swimmers\" swam breaststroke, backstroke or freestyle ... but it looks like they all, uh, swam the race to completion.\n      \n    \n          But it's unlikely any of this would result in a new life being brought into the world. Bonnie has previously gone public about her fertility struggles.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          “I tried to get pregnant for years with my ex-partner and really, really struggled and I’d have to go down the IVF route,” she told Us Weekly in June 2025. “So I wish I could say I might get pregnant, however, I’m not in that position where I can fall pregnant naturally.”\n      \n    \n          This marks Bonnie's second record-setting feat. She claimed to have slept with 1,057 men in 12 hours back in January 2025. Sadly, OnlyFans star Lily Phillips beat the brakes off that record when she allegedly slept with 1,113 men within the same time constraint.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Bonnie Blue\n              \n                          \n                Lily Phillips\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                OnlyFans\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” stuffed the box office competition over Thanksgiving. \n\n\tDisney‘s animated sequel, a buddy-cop comedy about anthropomorphic animals, debuted to $156 million in North America and $400 million overseas, delivering a stunning $556 million global tally. The family film, which opened on Wednesday, cemented several records including the fourth-biggest worldwide debut in box office history (following “Avengers: Endgame,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home”), as well as the largest global launch of all time for an animated film.\n\t\n\n\t“The incredible response to ‘Zootopia 2’ reflects both its worldwide appeal and the remarkable work of our filmmakers and cast,” says Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman. “It’s a proud moment for Disney Animation and all of us at Disney, not to mention a great way to start the holiday season.”\n\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” is turbocharging the box office, which has been majorly struggling since the summer. This was the second consecutive weekend that movie theaters were booked and busy after “Wicked: For Good” arrived ahead of Thanksgiving with $147 million. The initial turnout for “Zootopia 2” is also a needed win for Disney, which has fielded a string of theatrical misses including Marvel’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” Pixar’s “Elio,” “Tron: Ares” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” After a rocky stretch, the studio will dominate through the rest of the year with “Zootopia 2” and December’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”\n\n\tDirected by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, the PG-rated “Zootopia 2” follows a rabbit police officer (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist fox (Jason Bateman) as they reunite to pursue a mysterious new reptilian resident (Ke Huy Quan) in the city. The original “Zootopia” opened in March 2016 with $75 million in North America and became a massive hit with $341 million domestically and $1.02 billion worldwide. With stellar reviews and excellent word-of-mouth, “Zootopia 2” is poised to deliver a similar result — and should easily become the second movie of the year to surpass the $1 billion mark after Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” in May. \n\t\n\n\t“‘Zootopia 2’ has a perfect release date, built-in brand recognition and a PG rating,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends Paul Dergarabedian.\n\n\tHere are all the records from opening weekend:\n\t\n\t\tGlobal\t\n\n\nHighest animated global opening of all time (based on current rates) \nFourth-biggest global opening of all time after “Avengers: Endgame” ($1.2 billion), “Avengers: Infinity War” ($630 million) and “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($587 million)\nBiggest global debut of 2025\nHighest global opening for an animated sequel ever \nLargest global opening ever for Walt Disney Animation Studios\nHighest global opening for any animated film in Disney’s 102-year history\nBiggest opening weekend increase from original to sequel for any animated franchise (239%)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDomestic\t\n\n\nSecond-biggest Thanksgiving Day after “Moana 2” ($28 million)\nSecond-highest Thanksgiving opening ever (three-day and five-day) behind “Moana 2” ($139 million over the three days and $225 million over the five days)\nSecond-largest Black Friday ever with $38.9 million behind “Moana 2” ($54.3 million)\nSecond-highest domestic Wednesday before Thanksgiving of all time with $39.3 million after “Moana 2” ($57.5 million)\nSecond-biggest preview gross for Walt Disney Animation sequel with $10.2 million, behind “Moana 2” ($13.8 million) and ahead of “Frozen II” ($8.5 million)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tChina\t\n\n\nSixth highest debut of all time, including local and Hollywood titles\nSecond best non-local film opening of all time behind “Avengers: Endgame” ($632 million)\nHighest animated opening ever for a non-local title\nTop-grossing non-local film since 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” \nHighest non-local animated film of all-time after five days of release\nFourth-highest grossing animated film \nAlready surpassed the total cume of Zootopia ($236 million) in five days\nHighest single day gross of all-time for an MPA film with $104 million on Saturday, surpassing “Avengers: Endgame” ($79 million)\nBest opening for a Hollywood release in 2025\n\n\n\t\n\t\tInternational\t\n\n\nFourth highest international opening of all time\nBiggest Walt Disney Animation international opening of all time (based current rates in the same suite of markets)\nHighest international animated opening of all time (based current rates in the same suite of markets)\nLargest Hollywood international opening of 2025\n\n\n",

This episode has it all: A very horny Angela (Ali Larter) doing everything she can to get in a car wreck; Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) fumbling with his speakerphone; a gas leak; dead poachers; and the return of Gallino (Andy Garcia) making big threats. It’s a fun and exciting hour! Let’s dive in:\n\t\n\n\nWhat is killing those cowardly big-game hunters? I’m not mad at it!\n“Life pulled out its big dick and beat me over the head with it.” — Tommy, forever a poet.\n“You know car rides make me horny.” — Angela, saying something no woman has ever said before.\nOf course, Tommy and Angela would get pulled over less than 30 seconds into her trying to give him road head against his will.\nFor someone who’s constantly on speakerphone, Tommy sure is a fuddy-duddy about using it correctly.\nSide note: Does anyone else get distracted when Tommy delivers a line exactly like fellow fuel-obsessed Texan Hank Hill of “King of the Hill”? It makes some of the show’s NSFW dialogue all the funnier.\n“Oh, fuck,” indeed! This gas leak is scary!\nRespectfully, why are we still following Ariana (Paulina Chávez) on her journey? You’re either in the family circle or you’re not on the show…\nThat randy patron Johnny (Mike Harkins) was out of line, but Ariana — you’ve been on the job for five minutes. Stick with it!\n“That’s why God created tits.” The scripture, via Angela.\nI like how Gallino puts on such corporate airs despite being a big cartel boss. His office looks so swanky!\nTommy, dude, Gallino gave Cooper (Jacob Lofland) a sweet deal and doesn’t want to mess with you. Be kind!\n“I bet on your son, which is something you could have done.” Ouch, point to Gallino.\nLove Gallino getting pissed at Tommy, slamming the table and calling him “Thomas.” Good baddie acting from Garcia!\nDamn, all this hacking up and spitting is disgusting!\nWow, an effective horror scene is Jerrell (Elijah Collins) stuck up on the tank, the effects of the gas leak not hitting him until the wind shifts and he can taste it as his device goes crazy.\nDale (James Jordan) once again proves he’s the best character on the show by somehow saving his team.\nI’m worried that Cooper has a legitimate body odor problem — it comes up ALL of the time!\nI’m no accountant, but Monty’s money strategy sounded absolutely outrageous.\n“Frog’s ass watertight?” These southern expressions never fail to surprise a Yankee like me…\nR.I.P. Bonner (Shawn Carter Peterson). Welcome to the show, Bob!\n“Nobody likes a tattletale, Bob!” I mean, Tommy’s right — this is what clubs are for!\nOK, now I want to go to Cattlemen’s Club. I bet the steak prices are outrageous, but Alan (Jim Meskimen) can take care of it. (By the way, after Googling it, I realized that it’s a real club opened by “Landman” co-creator Taylor Sheridan. Love that synergy!)\nBella (Stefania Spampinato) and Angela’s appreciation for each other is a beautiful thing.\nAww, Cami (Demi Moore) delivers a speech about love that is surprisingly sweet, considering we’re breaking bread with a scary drug kingpin.\n“You think life has a big dick? Wait until I hit you with mine!” Ok, Angela, love the spirit, but maybe it’s not your best retort.\nDid Angela just trick Tommy into proposing to her?\n“It’s a popsicle, not a snow cone.” I didn’t need to hear Thornton ever describe a sex act like that, but alright!\nHaunting last scene with Cami and the coyotes wailing in grief. What a performance!\n\n\n\n\tUntil next time, comment below with your favorite southern saying from “Landman.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSee Limp Bizkit Pay Tribute to Sam Rivers at First Show Since Bassist’s Death\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis Rare and Unrestored 1969 Corvette Could Fetch $1 Million at Auction\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhitecaps in Rare Territory With Playoff Run While for Sale\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPriya Ahluwalia Creates Mini Collection Using New Epson Fabrics Made From Textile Waste\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tSafe to say James Cameron will never cast Tilly Norwood in a movie. \n\n\tDuring a recent interview with CBS’ Sunday Morning, the director of “The Terminator” explained that even before the invention of generative AI, some Hollywood insiders thought he would use computer graphics to replace actors as he was developing the first “Avatar” film in 2005.\n\n\tHe recalled, “For years, there was this sense that, ‘Oh, they’re doing something strange with computers and they’re replacing actors,’ when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we’re doing, it’s a celebration of the actor-director moment.”\n\t\n\n\tCameron said now that generative AI is invading the industry, the idea that the technology could substitute for a performer is “horrifying.”\n\n\t“Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character,” Cameron added. “They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It’s like, no. That’s horrifying to me. That’s the opposite. That’s exactly what we’re not doing.”\n\n\tIn September, comedian and producer Eline Van der Velden introduced AI performer Tilly Norwood to the world at the Zurich Summit, boasting that her team had already received interest from multiple talent agencies. The presentation sparked immediate backlash from industry leaders.\n\n\tIn a sit-down with Variety, Van der Velden said, despite the overwhelming backlash, the presence of AI is only going to grow in filmmaking.\n\n\t“I think it will be a slow progression,” she said. “I’m sure in the coming year, there’ll be plenty of effects that will be made with AI. There’ll be some establishing shots, there’ll be some second-unit shots with AI, and then slowly, we’ll progress to a full AI film. And whether people will pay for an AI film or not — I don’t think they’ll know the difference. It’s good storytelling that will be the reason why people will pay for it or not.”\n",

Sprinkled between them are the Film Independent Spirit Award nominations (Dec. 2), the Critics Choice film nominations (Dec. 5) and the occasional smaller regional critics’ citations — all adding to the noise as the season ignites.\n\n\tWhile each group has its own identity, influence and taste profile, three of them — NYFCC, NBR and LAFCA — are considered part of the so-called “Big Four” critics’ awards (the National Society of Film Critics completes the quartet when it announces on Jan. 3). Only three films in history have swept all four: “Schindler’s List” (1993), “L.A. Confidential” (1997) and “The Social Network” (2010). Only “Schindler” went on to win the Oscar for best picture.\n\n\tThis coming week could also determine how Paul Thomas Anderson’s action epic “One Battle After Another” settles into the season. As the assumed frontrunner, its performance across these groups will be watched closely — though a miss (or even multiple misses) would hardly render it “dead.” Instead, depending on who emerges victorious, it could clarify the shape of a spoiler. That might be Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” anchored by presumed best actress leader Jessie Buckley; Ryan Coogler’s gothic horror drama “Sinners,” featuring a transformative Michael B. Jordan; or Josh Safdie’s wild-card period comedy “Marty Supreme,” showcasing Timothée Chalamet.\n\n\tThis marks the third year since the Gotham Awards — hosted by the Gotham Film & Media Institute — eliminated its $35 million budget cap. The change has broadened its slate and, occasionally, its Oscar impact. Past Gotham best feature winners include “Spotlight,” “Moonlight” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” all of which ultimately won the Academy’s top prize. Still, the Gothams often set the tone rather than foretelling destiny, signaling which titles are entering the conversation with heat. PTA’s $130 million-plus vehicle set the all-time Gotham noms record with six (much to the disdain of indie filmmakers who are trying relentlessly to garner some notice). Many believe the film will clean up. However, with jury of five people, there’s no telling what they’ll select.\n\n\tThe NYFCC is among the industry’s most prestigious critics’ groups, though its choices rarely mirror the Academy’s ultimate victor. The membership gravitates toward deep, textural narratives — think Todd Haynes’ “Carol” — and often sidesteps the presumed Oscar frontrunner. The group has aligned with the Academy’s best picture winner only once in the past decade, with Michel Hazanavicius’ “The Artist.” The group is also vulnerable to recency bias, memorably selecting “American Hustle” in 2013 just one day after screening it. That could bode well for James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” the third installment in his franchise which will screen for critics for the first time on Monday. Many of the NYFCC membership have been publicly euphoric about PTA’s starry ensemble joint. That could kick things off accordingly.\n\n\tThe National Board of Review often manufactures early-season momentum that evaporates by the time Oscar voting arrives. Historically, NBR has favored Warner Bros. films, particularly those directed by Clint Eastwood. Over 40 years, most NBR best film winners have gone on to earn at least an Oscar nomination for best picture — exceptions include “Gods and Monsters” (1998), “Quills” (2000) and “A Most Violent Year” (2014). The 1980s included two notable misses: “Empire of the Sun” (1987) and “Betrayal” (1983), the latter tying with “Terms of Endearment.”\n\n\tSince the Academy expanded the best picture lineup in 2009, NBR and the Oscars have intersected only once with “Green Book” (2018).\n\n\tAnd last year was a particularly rough one for NBR’s predictive power. Of its major winners, only Kieran Culkin (“A Real Pain”) went on to win the Oscar. Best film winner “Wicked” and adapted screenplay winner “Sing Sing” secured nominations, but the rest — director Jon M. Chu, Daniel Craig (“Queer”), Nicole Kidman (“Babygirl”), Elle Fanning (“A Complete Unknown”) and the original screenplay “Hard Truths” — failed to materialize with the Academy.\n\n\tThe Los Angeles Film Critics Association tends to favor bold filmmaking, and its best picture winner can often becomes a significant awards-season force. Last year’s pick, “Anora,” joined a lineage of LAFCA champs that later triumphed at the Oscars, including “The Hurt Locker” (2009), “Moonlight” (2016) and “Parasite” (2019). LAFCA’s choices for best director often intersect with the Academy as well, with six winners since 2009 — including Kathryn Bigelow, Bong Joon Ho and Jane Campion — eventually taking home the statuette.\n\n\tSelected by roughly 575 voting members, the Critics Choice Awards tend to reflect broader industry consensus. Last season, “Anora” used a Critics Choice best picture win to reassert itself after being shut out at the Golden Globes and SAG Awards — momentum it carried all the way to the Academy Awards. Three acting winners — Adrien Brody, Kieran Culkin and Zoe Saldaña — also repeated at the Oscars.\n\n\tAll this speculation also comes with a word of warning: early rarely equals most accurate. The earliest precursors can deceive. Before Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water” won best picture, it failed to crack NBR’s top 10 and was omitted by other early groups, leading many pundits to declare the film finished. Could a similar pathway present itself with his newest effort, “Frankenstein?”\n\n\tAlso noteworthy, none of the “The Lord of the Rings” films ever made NBR’s top 10 lists either. And early critics’ citations can convince awards watchers that a contender is emerging — only for the Academy to pass on it entirely, as seen with Regina Hall in “Support the Girls” and Rachel Weisz in “The Deep Blue Sea.”\n\n\tAs these five organizations roll out their selections next week, industry watchers will begin parsing patterns, tea leaves and perceived momentum.

    "body": "\n\tJudi Dench recently shared that she “can’t recognize anybody” due to her eye condition.\n\n\tWhen asked by ITV why she’s stepped away from acting, Dench told the outlet, “I can’t see anymore. I’ve got, you know, that thing.” Ian McKellen, who appeared alongside her in the interview, joked that her vision hasn’t stopped the audience from seeing her. Dench then responded, “Yes, and I can see your outline, and I know you so well. But I can’t recognize anybody now. … I can’t see the television, I can’t see to read.”\n\t\n\n\tMcKellen then quipped, “But do you go up to total strangers and say, ‘Lovely to see you again?'” Dench joked back, “Sometimes.”\n\n\n\tThis isn’t the first time Dench opened up about her sight. She shared in a 2023 interview with “The Graham Norton Show” that it has become “impossible” to learn her lines due to her eye problems.\n\n\t“It has become impossible and because I have a photographic memory, I need to find a machine that not only teaches me my lines but also tells me where they appear on the page,” Dench said. “I used to find it very easy to learn lines and remember them. I could do the whole of ‘Twelfth Night’ right now.”\n\n\tDespite the struggles, Dench remains in good humor about her situation and the sometimes awkward moments that occur as a result. She recalled, “I was doing the ‘Winter’s Tale’ with Kenneth Branagh a couple of years ago, playing Paulina, and after we had been running for three weeks or so at the Garrick he said to me — I have a long speech at the end — he said: ‘Judi, if you were to say that speech about eight feet to your right, you’d be saying it to me and not to the pros.’ I rely on people to tell me!”\n",

    "description": "\n\tRobert De Niro may be one of the most respected actors in the world, but when Jodie Foster first met him on the set of Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Drive",
    "body": "\n\tRobert De Niro may be one of the most respected actors in the world, but when Jodie Foster first met him on the set of Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” at just 12 years old, she wasn’t so impressed.\n\n\tSpeaking during a career-spanning conversation at the Marrakech Film Festival on Sunday after receiving a tribute award, Foster recalled how De Niro “took me under his wing” and would bring her to coffee shops to run lines for the film. But since De Niro was taking a Method approach to his character, she found him quite boring.\n\t\n\n\t“We’d run the lines and run the lines a second and third time. And I’m sure maybe some of you have been here when Robert De Niro was here. One of our greatest American actors, so proud to have worked with him — not the most interesting person on earth,” Foster continued. “And at that time, he was very much in character, the way he was in those days. So he was really uninteresting and I remember having these lunches with him and being like, ‘What is happening? When can I go home?’ And he wouldn’t really be able to talk to me, so I would talk to the waiters and the people in the restaurants.”\n\n\n\tBut Foster and De Niro had a breakthrough when he let her into his preparation process. “He finally walked me through improvisation by the time we had our third lunch together, and it opened my eyes to what acting could be,” Foster said. “And I realized at 12, ‘Oh, it’s my fault because I haven’t brought enough to the table.’ I’ve just been saying lines and waiting for my next line and acting naturally, but building a character is something different. And I remember how excited I was, I remember being kind of sweaty and excited and giggly and coming back up into the hotel room to meet my mom and saying, ‘I’ve had this epiphany.’ And I think from there, everything changed.”\n\t\n\n\t“Taxi Driver” took Foster to the Cannes Film Festival for the first time, though she revealed that “nobody wanted to bring me because they didn’t want to spend money on me.” However, her mother — who was also her manager and enrolled her at a French school in Los Angeles — pushed for her to go. \n\n\t“My mom said, ‘No, it’s really important. She speaks French. This is Cannes!'” Foster said. “And so we paid for our own flights.”\n\n\tFoster had a laugh remembering that De Niro, Harvey Keitel and Scorsese “were really paranoid” because there was some buzz around the Croisette around the film being too violent and perhaps needing an X rating. \n\n\t“We all did the press conference together, but then after the press conference, they all got too scared, and they wouldn’t leave their rooms at the Hotel du Cap,” Foster said. “So I ended up doing all the interviews in French for the entire team of ‘Taxi Driver’!”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJodie Foster at the Marrakech Film Festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe 63-year-old, who appeared in commercials from the age of 3 and made her feature film debut at 6 years old, also spoke at length about the fact that the profession is not something she picked for herself.\n\n\t“I would never have chosen to be an actor, I don’t have the personality of an actor. I’m not somebody that wants to dance on a table and, you know, sing songs for people,” she said. “It’s actually just a cruel job that was chosen for me as a young person that I don’t remember starting. So right there, it makes my work a little bit different because I am not interested in acting just for the sake of acting. If I was on a desert island, I think probably the last thing I would ever do is act. So I was just trying to survive.”\n\n\tPerhaps for this reason, Foster finds herself “reaching out to the young child actors of this era,” she said. “I feel like, wait, where are their parents? And why is nobody telling them that they should stop doing so many movies or maybe not be so drunk on the red carpet? I want to take care of them because I know how dangerous it is.”\n\n\tShe added: “I don’t know why anyone would want to be an actor now, if they knew that in order to be excellent they would have to contend with being robbed of their life in a way. I don’t know how you make sense of that except to have what my mom helped me do, which is to have this very firm delineation between your private life and your public life.”\n\t\n\n\tDespite not choosing to become an actor, Foster said she was always “drawn to very strong characters” and sought only “central” roles in movies.\n\n\t“I didn’t want to be the sister of, the wife of, the daughter of, the girlfriend of. I just wanted the movie to be about me,” she joked, before adding that she was also “reacting to a second wave feminist interest of saying, ‘I want to matter. I want to make movies that matter.'”\n\n\tThough Foster addressed the fact that she did not work for many female directors for the first part of her career, she exclaimed: “Then in the last four films, they’ve all been women!”\n\n\t“I mean, really up until 15 years ago, when you look at the list for mainstream movies and you go down the director’s list, I never saw a female name,” she said, before highlighting the glass ceiling that female directors face when they’re courting bigger-budget movies.\n\n\t“If you’re making a movie that has a certain risk attached to it … they would say, ‘Wow, there’s no woman that’s directed a movie that cost $125 million,'” she pointed out. She said “the idea was not to give women these huge mega movies if they had not had any experience. How about giving women the experience first?”\n\n\tWhile Foster has primarily worked in film, she made a critically acclaimed comeback to television in HBO’s “True Detective: Night Country,” which earned her tan Emmy and Golden Globe. Foster praised streaming for giving storytellers a broader canvas to tell important stories such as the journey of Native Americans.\n\n\t“I’m embracing this idea of there being these two opposite ends of the industry — one which is mainstream Hollywood, mainstream distributor films and more independent films on the other end … and then streaming, which has really taken up the mantle of narrative. You’re able to take up eight-hour stories or five-season stories where you can explore every angle in a way that you could never in a feature.”\n\n\tFoster brought up Scorsese’s 2023 film “Killers of the Flower Moon” as an example of this, saying that “what we had was a very interesting movie about two guys who go back and forth and they talk to each other.”\n\n\t“I think everybody was excited that the Native story was going to be told. And what they found was like, ‘Wow, all the Native women are dead,'” she continued. “What they said was, ‘Well, it’s a feature, we didn’t have time!’ But there was time. There was an eight-hour limited series that was not made, that could have been made, where if you really needed to explore all of that male toxic masculinity, you could have done that, but you could have had Episode 2 actually center the Native story.”\n\t\n\n\tThe two-time Oscar winner is also on hand at the Moroccan fest to present her latest film, Rebecca Zlotowski’s French comedy thriller “A Private Life.” During the conversation, Foster revealed that she is looking to make more films in French.“Of course, because I do feel like it’s a part of my personality that I just never get to use, and half my culture, because I went to a French school,” Foster said. “I love the global family of making films. It feels like they’re the same people wearing the same jeans and complaining about coffee at 3 in the morning. But it also allows me to open up and learn a new culture, too.”\n\n\tFoster ended the conversation by saying that she still has much she wants to accomplish in her career. “I’ll be making films until I die,” she said proudly. “You can’t get rid of me that fast.”\n\n\tThis marks Foster’s first appearance at Marrakech Film Festival, which kicked off on Friday night with a slew of stars in attendance. Alongside “Parasite” filmmaker Bong Joon Ho as president, this year’s jury includes “Wednesday” star Jenna Ortega, “Furiosa” lead Anya Taylor-Joy and “Past Lives” director Celine Song.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVirginie Efira picked up a new skill when working with Ryusuke Hamaguchi: She learned Japanese for the just-wrapped shoot.  \n\n\tRecently, she’s been heard to test it out — especially when bolstered by a bit of liquid courage. “[I can start speaking] after a few drinks,” she jokes. “Though someone recently told me it sounded more like Hungarian!”\n\n\tSet for release next year, Hamaguchi’s Paris-shot “All of a Sudden” will also boast a three-hour run-time and more “astonishing formal choices,” per Efira. “He has a pretty unusual way of shooting,” she says. “We did a huge number of table reads in a space where you had to stay completely focused. I had to imagine a heavy stone in my stomach and direct everything toward it. It created a really unique atmosphere.”\n\t\n\n\tEfira shared these reflections during a wide-ranging, nearly two-hour conversation with Chiara Mastroianni at this year’s Marrakech Film Festival. The two actresses swapped stories, shared working habits, revisited career milestones, and hinted at what’s next. Efira is heading back to Paris soon to finish Asghar Farhadi’s “Parallel Tales,” while Mastroianni will appear in Nicolas Pariser’s “Un Peu Avant Minuit” (“A Bit Before Midnight”), starring alongside her longtime collaborator Melvil Poupaud. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“We’ve known each other for ages and have worked together in so many ways,” Mastroianni laughs. “We’ve played siblings, spouses, cousins—pretty much every dynamic imaginable. He hasn’t played my son yet, but that won’t take long. At the pace things are going, by next year he’ll be my little baby!” \n\t\n\n\tIndeed, Poupaud has been intertwined with Mastroianni’s journey for nearly as long. A childhood friend, he was the one who first nudged her toward acting, helping her carve a path beyond the dazzling legacy of her parents, Marcello Mastroianni and Catherine Deneuve. “My mother wasn’t very enthusiastic about the idea, while my father was delighted,” Mastroianni recalls. “It was complicated, and for a long time, I didn’t know what I truly wanted—or even how to admit it to myself. Melvil really helped me break through that taboo.” \n\n\tThe two actresses began their careers on opposite trajectories: Mastroianni cut her teeth on rigorous arthouse fare from directors like Raul Ruiz and Manoel de Oliveira before exploring looser, more playful tones with Christophe Honoré, while Efira transitioned from a VJ on Belgian TV to a series of crowd-pleasing—if not strictly highbrow—comedies, culminating in her dramatic breakout in Justine Triet’s “In Bed With Victoria.” \n\n\t“Justine brings chaos into her own film,” Efira recalls. “You watch a scene, and it’s chaotic, but her mind—and even her apartment—mirrors that chaos. She was disrupting her own film; it was like being both a mischievous student and the teacher at the same time. There was a vaguely communist atmosphere on set—not dictatorial, not Putin-like. Everyone had a voice; people didn’t just stick to their roles. We always followed the script, but it felt like constant improvisation.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMastroianni, by contrast, experienced the opposite approach working with Manoel de Oliveira.\n\n\t“His method was rigid and mathematical, treating actors not as collaborators but as elements in a composition, like the folds of a curtain in a painting,” she explains. “At first, it felt like a straitjacket—but looking back, it was a magnificent gift. That demanding ‘mathematics’ of performance forged a muscle I never knew I had: the ability to concentrate, to embrace silence and stillness, and to truly love the long take.” \n\n\tThe two stars finally shared the screen in Rebecca Zlotowski’s “Other People’s Children,” with Efira navigating step-parenting and Mastroianni playing the child’s mother. Both praised Zlotowski for capturing a new-partner–ex-partner dynamic that is common in life but rarely depicted in cinema. \n\t\n\n\t“These characters shared a powerful connection,” Mastroianni says. “They didn’t apologize for men, and they weren’t in conflict. In real life, that’s actually more common than people think. It’s not always war between an ex and the new partner. And even two women sharing a man—Rebecca shows it can bring them closer, not tear them apart.” \n\n\t“She manages to explore a certain kind of feminism,” Efira adds. “Not one of loud protests, but one that operates in a broader, more precise, personal, and powerful way.” \n\n\tThe exchange was made all the more remarkable by the filmmaker’s presence in the audience. As luck would have it, Zlotowski had flown in to Marrakech for the previous evening’s gala screening of “A Private Life,” and sat beaming in the crowd throughout the conversation.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Other People’s Children’ \n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” unleashed a box office stampede as Disney’s animated sequel raced to $556 million in its global debut. \n\n\tThose ticket sales rank as the fourth-highest global debut of all time after “Avengers: Endgame,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” putting the family-friendly adventure in elite company at the box office. After all, “Endgame” and “Infinity War” eventually surpassed $2 billion globally while “No Way Home” got incredibly close with $1.9 billion. “Zootopia 2,” which earned a staggering $400 million internationally and $156 million domestically, set several other opening weekend records, including the largest global and international animated launch in history as well as the biggest worldwide start of any 2025 release.\n\t\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” was especially massive in China, earning $272 million since Wednesday to stand as the biggest non-local animated opening ever, second-biggest non-local debut after “Avengers: Endgame” and sixth-largest start of all time, including local titles. After just five days of release, the sequel already surpassed the lifetime grosses of “Zootopia” ($236 million) in China. The first film was beloved in China, but the property has exploded in popularity ever since a Zootopia Land opened at the Shanghai Disneyland theme park. Following China, the top territories were France ($14.6 million), Korea ($13.7 million), Mexico ($10.4 million) and Germany ($8.8 million).\n\n\n\tDirected by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, “Zootopia 2” follows a rabbit police officer (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist fox (Jason Bateman) as they reunite to pursue a mysterious new reptilian resident (Ke Huy Quan). With excellent reviews and positive word-of-mouth, “Zootopia 2” will remain a box office force through the rest of the year. \n\t\n\n\tThough “Zootopia 2” towered above the competition, “Wicked: For Good” scored again in its second weekend of release with $29 million overseas and $92 million worldwide. So far, Universal’s musical extravaganza, based on the second half of the hit Broadway show, has earned $393.3 million globally, including $122 million internationally and $270 million domestically. Like the first half, the second installment has been a much bigger draw with North American audiences.\n\n\tWith the joint success of “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good,” Imax delivered its biggest Thanksgiving in the company’s history with $40.8 million in global ticket sales over five days. That’s 70% higher than last year’s holiday frame, which previously held the Imax record with help from “Wicked,” “Moana 2” and “Gladiator II.” Imax, which boasts special projectors that offer a bigger picture and better sound, has been a powerhouse since the pandemic as moviegoers opt for enhanced viewing experiences as an incentive to leave the home. With $32 million globally, “Zootopia 2” became Imax’s biggest Thanksgiving release, as well as the company’s largest debut for a November release and best start for an animated title. Those ticket sales include $7.6 million in North America and $24.5 million overseas, a majority of which ($20.5 million to be exact) came from the Chinese box office. Meanwhile, “Wicked: For Good” added $7.2 million from Imax in its second outing, bringing its tally to $31.3 million worldwide.\n\n\t“’Zootopia 2’ and ‘Wicked: For Good’ delivered a phenomenal one-two punch for the Thanksgiving holiday — hitting the sweet spot for family audiences and sending our global box office soaring well past expectations,” said Imax CEO Rich Gelfond. “Disney and Universal are to be commended on an excellent weekend for moviegoing around the world — a great indicator that fans of all ages are seeking distinctive cinematic entertainment this holiday season.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHollywood is giving thanks for “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good,” two Thanksgiving offerings that kept movie theaters stuffed over the holiday weekend.\n\n\tDisney’s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” towered over the domestic box office with a mighty $156 million from 4,000 venues since Wednesday, including $96.8 million over the traditional weekend. Those ticket sales rank as the second-best Thanksgiving launch of all time, behind another Disney sequel, 2024’s “Moana 2,” which earned $225 million over the five days, and above another Disney sequel, 2019’s “Frozen II,” which generated $125 million over the five days. The original “Zootopia” opened in March 2016 with $75 million and became a massive hit with $341 million domestically and $1.02 billion worldwide.\n\t\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” was an even bigger force at the international box office with $400 million, including a record-setting $272 million in China. In total, the second “Zootopia” earned a massive $556 million globally to stand as the fourth-biggest opening weekend in history. \n\n\n\t“The incredible response to ‘Zootopia 2’ reflects both its worldwide appeal and the remarkable work of our filmmakers and cast,” says Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman. “It’s a proud moment for Disney Animation and all of us at Disney, not to mention a great way to start the holiday season.”\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” wasn’t the only big-budget tentpole to satiate audiences around Turkey Day. Universal’s “Wicked For Good” dazzled with $93 million in its second weekend of release. Although the second half of “Wicked” was bigger in its debut, the follow-up isn’t holding as well as the first film. To compare, last year’s “Wicked” earned $118 million over the five-day holiday frame after debuting to $112.5 million during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend. However, “Wicked: For Good” remains a juggernaut with $270.4 million domestically and $393.3 million globally after 10 days in theaters.\n\t\n\n\tDespite a healthy turnout with roughly $293 million across all films, this year’s Thanksgiving lineup didn’t come close to the record established in 2024 with $422 million in total, led by “Moana 2,” “Wicked” and “Gladiator II.” This ended up ranking as the fourth-biggest Thanksgiving of all time behind 2018’s haul of $315 million (from “Ralph Breaks the Internet,” “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” and “Creed II”) and 2014’s bounty of $294.2 million (powered by “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”).\n\n\t“Thanksgiving represents one of the most important moviegoing periods of the year,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian. “This is a welcome result in the wake of what has been a very tumultuous post-summer season for the industry.”\n\n\t“Zootopia 2,” a buddy-cop comedy about anthropomorphic animals, is benefitting from several factors, including great reviews and word of mouth (a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes and “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls), as well as pent-up demand for family-friendly entertainment (as there’s been no kid-centric animated film since “The Bad Guys 2” in August.) The property is especially popular in China, where a Zootopia Land recently opened at the Shanghai Disneyland theme park. Directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, “Zootopia 2” follows a rabbit police officer (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist fox (Jason Bateman) as they reunite to pursue a mysterious new reptilian resident (Ke Huy Quan). \n\n\t“China has been trouble for American films during the last five years — very little has worked there — but the opening is breaking records,” says analyst David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. “The film is on track to gross more money in China than in the U.S.”\n\n\tTwo indie films, Chloe Zhao’s Shakespearean drama “Hamnet” and A24’s afterlife comedy “Eternity,” also opened this weekend, although on far fewer screens than “Zootopia 2.” \n\n\tAt No. 6, “Eternity” launched with $3.1 million from 1,348 cinemas over the traditional weekend and $5.2 million since Wednesday. The film, starring Elizabeth Olsen as a woman who must choose between two men (Miles Teller and Callum Turner) with whom to spend the afterlife, will expand to theaters nationwide next weekend.\n\t\n\n\t“Hamnet,” a tragedy about the death of William Shakespeare’s son, cracked the top 10 with $880,000 from just 119 theaters over the weekend and $1.35 million during its first five days of release. The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, is expected to be a major Oscar contender. Focus Features will slowly roll out the film over the next few weeks to build momentum. \n\n\tElsewhere, Netflix’s “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” earned an estimated $4 million from 600 theaters since Wednesday. The murder mystery, directed by Rian Johnson and starring Daniel Craig as the Southern detective Benoit Blanc, isn’t playing at the nation’s three largest theater chains, AMC, Cinemark or Regal. Netflix, which doesn’t report grosses, will debut the third “Knives Out” installment on the streamer in December. \n\n\t“Netflix isn’t interested in box office,” says Gross. “This release is done for the filmmakers, who want to see their movie on the big screen.”\n\n\tAfter this weekend, domestic grosses have reached $7.5 billion and stand a mere 1.3% ahead of 2024 — which means there’s mounting pressure on “Zootopia 2,” “Wicked: For Good” and December’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” to salvage the up-and-down year and power the overall box office above $9 billion.\n\n\t“With about five weeks to go, Thanksgiving sets the stage for a December that’s loaded with big franchises and awards contenders,” Dergarabedian says. But in order to reach the $9 billion threshold, he notes, “every movie has to pull its weight.”\n",

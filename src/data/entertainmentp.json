    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\t“The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is getting the golden treatment. \n\n\tTo celebrate the cult classic’s 50th anniversary, Ode Records has reissued the original movie soundtrack as a deluxe edition 180g red-in-gold vinyl, housed in a heavyweight gold-foil jacket. The collector’s release includes a newly designed inner sleeve, never-before-seen production photos and diary excerpts from producer Richard Hartley — offering fans a rare glimpse behind the curtain of one of cinema’s most subversive creations.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe reissue arrives amid a full-blown cultural revival for “Rocky Horror.” Over the past month, Los Angeles has hosted a string of celebratory events and a 4K HDR restoration hit theaters.\n\n\tAdapted from Richard O’Brien’s 1973 stage musical, the 1975 film shattered conventions with its flamboyant characters, gender-bending performances, and anthemic rock soundtrack. Its interactive midnight screenings — complete with shadow casts, costumes and audience call-backs — transformed moviegoing into performance art and secured its status as the longest-running theatrical release in history.\n\n\t“When it opened on Broadway a quarter-century ago, Variety succinctly and colorfully described ‘The Rocky Horror Show’ as ‘a garish, ear-assaulting musical put-on of pseudo-science and ambi-sex porno entertainment.’ Sounds fun, no?'” Variety film critic Charles Isherwood recalled in his review of the 2000 film adaptation. “Twenty-five years on, Christopher Ashley’s revival of O’Brien’s garish, ear-assaulting musical put-on of pseudo-science and ambi-sex porno entertainment is still quite a lot of fun — but it’s not likely to send Mayor Rudolph Giuliani into a tizzy. Today, the musical nearly qualifies as wholesome family entertainment.”\n\n\n\tBuy the “Rocky Horror Picture Show” deluxe vinyl here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Simon Wiesenthal Center will bestow its Humanitarian Award on Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav at its annual gala set for Oct. 30 in Beverly Hills.\n\n\tThe kudo that ranks as the Wiesenthal Center’s highest honor will be presented to the veteran media CEO by Steven Spielberg. The award recognizes Zaslav’s long history of supporting a wide range of philanthropic causes, notably his support of efforts to fight antisemitism and hate as well as environmental concerns and public health issues. \n\t\n\n\t“David is one of the rare, extraordinary individuals who uses his influence as a force for good,” said Jim Berk, CEO of the Wiesenthal Center. “In his life and his work, he demonstrates the power of storytelling to educate, transform how we see the world, and spark empathy that drives change. His dedication to truth, compassion, and the fight against intolerance embodies the very spirit of this award.”\n\n\n\tZaslav has been at the helm of WBD since 2022. The company is now in the midst of a public sale process as it plans to separate into two separate entities. Paramount Skydance and others are circling for the chance to pounce on sui generis entertainment assets such as Warner Bros. and HBO.\n\n\tZaslav cited the power of storytelling as a vehicle for combatting the discrimination and violence that the Wiesenthal Center seeks to address. \n\n\t“One of the most powerful antidotes to hatred is storytelling — the kind that opens eyes, shifts perspectives and reminds us of our shared humanity,” Zaslav said. “With antisemitism on the rise in America and around the world, it is more important than ever to stand up against hate in all its forms. I’m deeply honored by this recognition and proud to continue my support of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and its Museum of Tolerance, whose essential work continues to make a profound impact in confronting prejudice and inspiring understanding.”\n\t\n\n\tDana Bash, chief political correspondent for CNN, will be feted with the center’s Jewish Heritage Award. And two survivors of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza — Aya Meydan and Omer Shem Tov — will be honored with the center’s Medal of Valor.\n\n\tThe event is sure to draw a who’s who of entertainment leaders. The Wiesenthal Center will take advantage of that powerful room by detailing the expansion of its Moriah Media production arm. The company recently launched the drama series “One Day in October,” about the Oct. 7 attack. Moriah is working on a number of projects including a biopic of David Ben-Gurion, known as the founder of Israel who served as the country’s first prime minister.\n\n\t“We intend to use storytelling as a force for unity and change. The expansion of Moriah Media presents extraordinary opportunities to tell powerful stories and shape culture in ways that overcome hate and division,” Berk said. “We have so many influential platforms to elevate content that focuses on stories that inspire tolerance, empathy and respect.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaika went small for its latest film — the short “ParaNorman: The Thrifting.”\n\n\tDirected by Laika’s lead character designer Thibault Leclercq and written by Chris Butler, the CG short (a first!) will be shown with the rerelease of the studio’s 2012 classic stop-motion animated feature “ParaNorman.” They both hit theaters Oct. 25 in partnership with Fathom Entertainment.\n\n\t“The Thrifting” sees Norman (voiced by Brayden Gleave) and his sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick, reprising her role from “ParaNorman”) and his best buddy Neil (TKTKT) enter a spooky thrift shop, where Courtney flirts with the edgy, cute clerk (Finn Wolfhard) while Norman encounters a mischievous young spirit looking to make a whole lot of trouble. It’s colorful, propulsive story that’s full of horror movie Easter eggs.\n\t\n\n\tButler, who wrote and co-directed “ParaNorman,” says that while converting the 3D characters of the original film to 2D was a “gargantuan undertaking,” doing the short in CG was “an easy choice.”\n\n\n\t“And even though I think Laika is first and foremost a stop-motion studio, I think we’ve always had an interest in animation in general. And, certainly for me, I came from a 2D background, so when I first started imagining ‘ParaNorman’ — probably like last century, in fact — in my head, it was a 2D thing, the first sketches. Because that’s just how I think of things,” Butler says. “But also, we did already dip our toe into 2D with the credit sequence in the original movie, which was in the style of horror movie posters, really kind of gaudy primary colors, the big, dripping letters, and we had a lot of fun doing that. It was a really painterly aesthetic. And so it seemed like that was our starting point. It was like, let’s have some fun with this.”\n\t\n\n\tIt was important for Leclercq to preserve the hand-made and graphic look of “ParaNorman” in the short.\n\n\t“No matter what the technique is going to be, I knew that we’re going to have this kind of 2D organic, handmade feel that’s going to reconnect to the original stop motion,” he says. “And then there was the idea that ‘ParaNorman’ is a very cinematic, a very immersive world that they’ve built in stop motion — the lighting, the camera approach to it feels extremely real. And I wanted to make sure that we’re going to preserve that even though we’re not going to be stop motion, we’re not going to have a real camera, real light. I think the medium” that was the closest to capturing that stop-motion look is “CG to help me build things that feel dimensional and immersive.”\n\n\tButler says that doing a seven-minute- and-some-change short was challenging, but drilling down on certain characters and telling a short story – not a gag-filled reel – helped distill narrative choices. Setting it in one building also set off ah-ha moments. “I thought, OK, this is a potentially really cool location to set a short in, because it’s finite, but it’s also full of cool stuff. It’s basically like the cellar in the ‘Conjuring’ movies. It’s a building full of potentially haunted, creepy objects. So, you know, plenty of fun to be had there,” Butler says.\n\n\tLeclercq knew he was responsible for a continuation of the “ParaNorman” world, and that was important stylistically. “We didn’t want it to step on the movie, story wise, but also, in terms of style and look, I wanted to make sure this is more of an homage to the original feature,” he says, adding that “the film, at its core, is a love letter to horror movies.”\n\n\tLeclercq adds that they also went back to look at original horror movie posters and create a stylistic connection. The result is a “bold, painterly style,” he says, with the artists leaning into a singular direction “that feels connected to the original, but doesn’t step on what the film is, and live on its own.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRebecca Kutler, president of MSNBC, has been diagnosed with breast cancer but she has a good prognosis for recovery and expects to be away for only a few weeks, the network confirmed.\n\n\tKutler informed MSNBC staff of her diagnosis on the network’s editorial call Wednesday morning. She had previously shared the news with NBCUniversal and MSNBC execs as well as MSNBC’s top anchors.\n\n\tKutler’s cancer diagnosis was first reported by CNN. Kutler, who has three kids, “also urged her team to take care of themselves and their health — to prioritize their own health even in the midst of an unprecedented news cycle,” per CNN’s Brian Stelter.\n\t\n\n\tKutler a CNN alum who was named president of MSNBC in February, succeeding Rashida Jones, who had led the progressive news network since 2021.\n\n\n\tMSNBC is in the midst of several major changes: It’s set to be part of Versant, the spin-off company that will house most of NBCU’s cable TV networks, in a transaction slated to be completed by the end of 2025.\n\n\tAs part of the split, MSNBC will change its name to “MS NOW” (My Source for News Opinion and the World) and drop the peacock from its logo. In addition, MSNBC and NBC News have started to separate their operations; starting Oct. 6, domestic and international NBC News will no longer appear on MSNBC. NBC News correspondents based in Washington, D.C., will continue to make appearances until Oct. 20, after which MSNBC will be managing its own independent news coverage and editorial standards.\n\n\tVersant CEO Mark Lazarus, in announcing Kutler as MSNBC’s president earlier this year, said she “has the big-picture strategic view and the right leadership skills to ensure MSNBC delivers on its brand promise and is positioned for growth during a time of industry change.”\n\t\n\n\tKutler joined MSNBC as senior vice president of content strategy in 2022, after a long run at CNN. During her time at CNN, she worked as an executive producer for Don Lemon and John King, among others, and also played a role in establishing personalities such as Abby Phillip, Van Jones, Chris Wallace, Audie Cornish and Kasie Hunt at the network. She was poised to have a senior role at CNN+, the streaming outlet that was scrapped shortly after launch by CNN corporate parent Warner Bros. Discovery.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA “Bosch” prequel has been greenlit at MGM+, with Cameron Monaghan set to play the title role. \n\n\tVariety has learned that MGM+ has ordered “Bosch: Start of Watch” to series. Monaghan will play Harry Bosch in his rookie days in the LAPD, with Omari Hardwick set to play veteran officer Eli Bridges. \n\n\tThe series is based on Michael Connelly’s Det. Harry Bosch books, which spawned the original series. Production will begin in Los Angeles in 2026.\n\t\n\n\t“We are thrilled to expand the Bosch universe with this compelling origin story that showcases how one of television’s most beloved detectives became the man we know today,” said Michael Wright, head of MGM+. “With Cameron Monaghan and Omari Hardwick bringing these complex characters to life, and the creative vision of Michael Connelly and our talented executive producers, Bosch: Start of Watch promises to deliver the gritty, authentic storytelling that honors the franchise’s legacy while opening an exciting new chapter.”\n\n\n\t“Bosch: Start of Watch” will take place in 1991 Los Angeles. The official logline states, “The series will explore a city on the edge, teeming with racial tension, gang violence, and a fractured LAPD. Amid routine calls and growing unrest, Bosch finds himself drawn into a high-profile heist and a web of criminal corruption that will test his loyalty to the badge and shape his future as the detective who lives by the code, ‘Everybody counts or nobody counts.'”\n\n\tTom Bernardo (“Bosch,” “Bosch: Legacy”) and Brian Anthony (“Bosch: Legacy,” “FBI”) are the co-creators and executive producers on the series, with Bernardo also serving as showrunner. Connelly, Henrik Bastin, Jamie Boscardin Martin, and Jasmine Russ also serve as executive producers. Theresa Snider serves as co-executive producer for Hieronymus Pictures. Fabel Entertainment produces. \n\t\n\n\t“I’m deeply grateful to Michael Wright and the team at MGM+ for championing this next chapter in Bosch’s journey with such remarkable care and integrity,” said Connelly. “Being able to see how Harry Bosch became the man we have loved for 10 seasons is a gift to me and his many fans. I can’t wait to dig in with Cameron and the writers to explore this uncharted character territory.”\n\n\tThis is now the fourth series in the “Bosch” universe. In addition to the original Amazon Prime Video series, which ran for seven seasons, lead actor Titus Welliver led the spinoff “Bosch: Legacy” for three seasons. Most recently, the spinoff “Ballard” starring Maggie Q. as cold case detective Renée Ballard debuted on Amazon Prime Video in July and was renewed for a second season in early October. \n\n\t“It’s a terrific privilege to be able to explore both the origins of this iconic character and the Los Angeles that formed him in the early 1990s,” said Bernardo. “In telling the story of a young Harry Bosch, we want to honor the faith of Michael Connelly’s legion of readers and the amazing audience that tuned into ‘Bosch’ and ‘Bosch: Legacy’ over the years. We’re excited to embark on this journey.”\n\n\tMonaghan is best known for his role in the hit Showtime series “Shameless,” in which he starred as Ian Gallagher throughout the show’s 11-season run at the premium cabler. He is also noted for his work on “Gotham,” where he played twins Jerome and Jeremiah Valeska. His film work includes “Tron: Ares,” “Amityville: The Awakening,” and the Adam Sandler comedy “Click.”\n\n\tHardwick is best known for starring in the popular Starz Crime drama “Power.” He played James “Ghost” St. Patrick on the series throughout its six-season run at the network. His other TV credits include “Pieces of Her” and “Star Trek: Section 31,” while has has also starred in films such as “The Mother,” “Fantasy Football,” and “Army of the Dead.”\n\n\tMonaghan is repped by UTA, Amplified, and Goodman Genow. Hardwick is repped by UTA and Sloane Offer. Bernardo is repped by Verve. Anthony is repped by Brant Rose Agency. \n\n\t“To get the opportunity to produce this show and shoot it on the streets of Los Angeles is a rare privilege these days,” said Bastin. “By filming in LA, we’ll be able to tap into the best creative talent this industry has to offer – and in doing so deliver a story about Harry Bosch that fans have longed for.

    "body": "\n\tTwenty years ago, Laika decided to re-invent stop-motion animation from its boutique-style studio in Portland, Ore. “Here we are 20 years later, and during that period, we’ve transformed ourselves into a global storytelling powerhouse,” says David Burke, the studio’s chief marketing officer and chief operating officer. Laika’s lineup of beloved and innovative stop-motion features started with 2009’s “Coraline” and was followed by other hand crafted delights such as “ParaNorman,” “The Boxtrolls,” “Kubo and the Two Strings” and “Missing Link.”\n\t\n\n\tBut things are changing at Laika, as the studio has set its sights on expanding. It’s ramping up development in both the animated and live-action spaces. Its live-action division was launched in 2023. Laika has also expanded into television, exhibitions and publishing (“Laika: The Magic Behind a Stop-Motion Dream Factory” will be released in March), and they’ve dropped merchandise on their newly redesigned website.\n\n\n\t“That’s how it’s evolved, so audiences don’t have to wait years between projects,” Burke says. “Wildwood,” their sixth animated feature film, will be released next year and is currently in the final stages of production.\n\n\tAmong other projects in development are “The Night Gardener,” which will be directed by Laika CEO Travis Knight. Described as a gritty neo-noir folktale, the film is set in rural Missouri and turns on a young man who struggles to keep his family together in the midst of a tragedy. When the news of the film was announced, Knight said, “‘The Night Gardener’ is a beautiful and timeless story that quickens the pulse as often as it breaks the heart.” “Ozark”’s Bill Dubuque is on board as screenwriter. Said Knight, “He’s crafted a lyrical world layered with complex characters, provocative ideas and keenly felt emotion.”\n\t\n\n\tThere are several other projects greenlit in the live-action space. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, Lulu Wang and Jon Spaihts are some of the filmmakers attached to projects.\n\n\t“We’re always looking for new talent. We’re working with and looking for people who want to bring unique, bold, original stories,” says dsevelopment lead producer Peter McCown.\n\n\tSeeking those projects as a development team means looking for books to adapt or unique spec scripts. Says McCown, “We’re turning over every stone to find these unique and impactful stories.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLaika’s epic action-adventure ‘Kubo and the Two Strings’ pushed the studio’s art and tech departments to new highs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Focus Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLaika’s stop-motion films have paved the way for this expansion, and those films still resonate with fans. Last year, “Coraline” was rereleased in movie theaters, and grossed $56 million, and this month, “ParaNorman” returns to theaters in a RealD 3D remastered print.\n\n\tOn the film’s lasting impact, Burke says, “That’s something we reflect on quite a bit. Ultimately, it’s the beauty of stop motion. It’s got the beauty of stop-motion and has the warmth of something that’s built by hand. I think audiences can sense that authentic connection.” He adds, “Laika has nurtured that art form, and brought it into the 21st century through innovation. And it’s the warmth that comes from the tactility of the artist and having a timeless appeal that is sensed and received by the viewer.”\n\n\tThe re-release also heralds the studio’s shift into the short film space.\n\n\tShort “ParaNorman: The Thrifting” is directed by Thibault LeClercq and written by Chris Butler. Anna Kendrick reprises her role as Norman’s older sister, Courtney, while “Stranger Things” star Finn Wolf- hard adds his voice talents to the cast.\n\n\tMcCown says “The Thrifting” also marks a move into the medium of CG. “It was a fun new challenge that everybody leaned into. We got to have a really good time getting back into this character and his world that we haven’t been into for a dozen years.”\n\n\tHe adds, “It was such a great opportunity to tie it into the re-release of the film, so that we could work with a partner studio, Passion Pictures and start to exercise what else can we do, and how else can we tell these stories.” \n\t\n\n\tLaika manages to remain inherently unique by telling bold and original stories. “That’s the crux of what we do and what we put out,” McCown says. “Even if we switch into a different medium, we’re always going to have the handcrafted DNA and the artistry that comes with that.”\n\n\tHow have they managed to stay relevant in a competitive space? “It’s by never standing still,” Burke says. “We’ve managed to fuse the timeless artistry of stop motion with constant innovation like 3D printing.”\n\n\tRegardless of medium, McCown notes the throughline of Laika projects is simple. “We’re always going to be telling stories that have heart. All our films are going to be deeply human and emotionally resonant. The films coming up expand upon that risk taking way of storytelling that we’re already known for. We’re just building upon that and taking that even further, with the goal of standing out from the mainstream.”\n\n\tLaika hasn’t just made its footprint in the world of stop-motion animation, it has also done wonders for Oregon, turning the state into their identity. “We’ve built [an] over-half-a-million- square-foot studio here that sustains hundreds of highly skilled local jobs. It nurtures craftsmanship. It brings global recognition to the Pacific Northwest as a hub for bold and handcrafted storytelling,” says Burke.\n\n\tAs a result, Portland isn’t just synonymous with Nike and Columbia Sportswear, Laika now factors into that equation. They’ve also established partnerships with Portland State University and Portland Community College to foster the next generation of artists, and “Wildwood,” is what Knight has called his “love letter to Oregon.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, McCown says the goal is telling more stories. “We want to find the best way of telling those stories. And cement Laika’s role as a global leader in cinematic storytelling.” He adds, “We just want more of that.”\n\n\tWith “The Thrifting” set within the ParaNorman universe, and “Wildwood” based on a trilogy of YA books, the studio has not ruled out the possibility of sequels.\n\n\t“I think ultimately it’s worth considering,” says McCown. “I don’t think we’re ever going to say no to any piece of existing IP or anything like that. I think what we lean towards, though, is where’s the original story? I did read Travis say he’s typically averse to sequels because you want to focus on the most singular, important moment of a character’s journey. And usually one film is what’s going to do that. It doesn’t mean that it’s off the table.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJosh Goldstine has officially joined Paramount Pictures as president of global marketing and distribution.\n\n\tHis appointment has been rumored since September, when Marc Weinstock exited his role as marketing chief amid the executive shakeup surrounding the company’s $8 billion merger with Skydance. Goldstine starts on Wednesday and will report to film bosses Josh Greenstein and Dana Goldberg.\n\n\n\t“Over his career, Josh has led marketing for franchise cornerstones and breakout originals,” Greenstein and Goldberg wrote in a note to staff. “He brings a sharp strategic lens to positioning, creative advertising, media, publicity, partnerships, analytics, strategy & research, creative content, and now, theatrical distribution.”\n\t\n\n\tBest known for orchestrating the pink publicity machine of “Barbie,” Goldstine is known as a skilled and passionate marketer with a reputation for strong filmmaker and talent relationships. He spent four years as president of worldwide marketing at Warner Bros. where he also oversaw the promotional efforts for commercial hits like “Dune,” “The Batman,” “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” and “Wonka.” He and international distribution chief Andrew Cripps were let go from Warner Bros. in January as part of a shakeup that was designed to streamline global theatrical efforts.\n\n\n\tOver his 30-year career, Goldstine also held top positions at Universal Pictures and Sony Pictures and launched the campaigns for major franchises like “Fast & Furious,” “Despicable Me” and “Fifty Shades of Grey,” as well as artsier fare like “Get Out,” “The Social Network” and “The Da Vinci Code.”\n\t\n\n\tIn his new role, Goldstine will be tasked with exciting audiences for Edgar Wright’s dystopian action thriller “The Running Man” and the animated “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,” as well as 2026 releases like “Scream 7” and “Scary Movie 6.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Ryan Coogler called on his go-to production designer, Hannah Beachler, to work on “Sinners,” she ended up building a deeply researched, meticulously crafted the world, filled with cultural references and Easter eggs. But the film is more than a great vampire movie; it spoke to folklore, spirituality, history and culture.\n\n\tBeachler is set to receive Variety’s Creative Impact in Production Design award at SCAD Savannah Film Festival on Oct. 28.\n\t\n\n\tThe vampire thriller is set in the Jim Crow-era Mississippi Delta. Michael B. Jordan plays dual roles as twins Smoke and Stack, who, after a run-in with the Chicago mob, return home. They rally the community to help with their new business venture, a juke joint. But  when the sun sets and opening night kicks off, vampires show up and cause havoc.\n\n\n\tFor Beachler, the heart and soul of the set was the home of Annie (Wunmi Mosaku), Smoke’s former love.\n\n\tThe set was inspired by a photograph that struck Beachler. “In some way, it’s one of the first images that I was looking at in the research, and it was the sharecropper home with this mound of cotton just on the porch. There was a woman standing outside, and there was just something about that image in that small home leaning to one side in this massive field that it just spoke to me immediately. It said everything to me about that time in that place, the hard life and the meager living situation,” Beacher says. “There was something about her that still had this dignity and beauty in front of all of this, what you would say is in abject poverty. Annie was strong, and I felt that from this woman in this image.”\n\t\n\n\t Annie’s home was painted haint blue, a protective light blue inspired by the Gullah Geechee people and enslaved Africans who used that shade to protect themselves from evil spirits. Annie is the community’s spiritual leader, a Hoodoo conjurer, herbalist and healer.\n\n\t“Annie served the community even though she was on a plantation … and as far as selling to the workers, and I wanted to make her feel like she was the protector in that place. She was the one that you could go to if you needed to heal,” says Beachler.\n\n\t As for the juke joint, where most of the action takes place, Beachler spent eight weeks building the set. It needed to look rusty, and to achieve that “we did levels of paint and actually used boric acid to rust the sheets of metal outside,” she explains.\n\n\tAdditionally, Beachler made sure every environment leading up to that set was represented inside. “There’s representation of Annie’s oak trees that protect and cover her home in the juke joint that protects and covers them. In the third act, the white wall where Mary (Hailee Steinfeld) bites Stack (Michael B. Jordan) is the representation of the white church, and there are horizontal lines above people’s heads, specifically Stack and the vampires, I should say, within that.”\n\n\tTo replicate what Clarksdale, Miss., looked like in 1932, dirt was laid on the roads around the train station and town sets. Over 1,200 plants were brought in for the cotton field. “We had people tying on these pieces of cotton, and each plant got 3,040 pieces of cotton,” she says.\n\n\tAs for the downtown set, Coogler wanted to divide the street with one side being for Blacks and one side for whites. The two grocery stores on the main street show the racial divide. With the Black grocery store, “it’s all working things to buy like hoses, brooms, buckets and mops. If somebody wanted you to be their maid, you had to be their maid. That was just the way that it was,” she says, adding, “The candy on the Black side is hard, but when you get to the white side, there are cakes, fruit and there’s more advertising.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor its next feature film, Laika gets back to its roots.\n\n\t“Wildwood” is based on Colin Meloy’s novels and directed by Travis Knight from a script by Chris Butler. Meloy is the frontman of Portland-based band the Decemberists, and the book is set in Portland, so the material is a natural for the Portland-based Laika.\n\n\t“Colin’s book ‘Wildwood’ is really inseparable from place,” says producer Sam Fell. “Forest Park, which is one of the largest urban forests in the U.S., is actually the Wildwood of the book. So it’s rooted in the real world.”\n\t\n\n\tFell adds, “Travis has himself described the film as a love letter to Portland.” In the film, young Prue must leave her home in Portland to venture into Wildwood on a quest to save her brother, who’s been stolen by a murder of crows. The voice cast includes Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Carey Mulligan, Mahershala Ali, Jacob Tremblay, Awkwafina, Angela Bassett, Jake Johnson, Charlie Day, Amandla Stenberg, Jemaine Clement, Tom Waits and Richard E. Grant.\n\n\n\tThe scope and ambition of the project, set for a 2026 release, matches the starry cast. Burke says that’s because Laika likes to top itself every time it creates a feature. It has added almost 200,000 square feet of floor space since it produced 2016’s “Kubo and the Two Strings.”\n\n\t“You hear people say, this is our most ambitious film yet,” says Burke. So, what does that mean exactly? “It means that we’ve got 136 locations in the feature, and many of them are so large that the crew can walk through them. We’ve really moved from that tabletop world into a grand, sweeping, kind of mythical epic. … There’s 231 practical puppets, 54 hero characters, and each and every one of them has been engineered and costumed like a bespoke work of art.”\n\t\n\n\tSix-time Oscar-nominated cinematographer Caleb Deschanel was recruited to shoot “Wildwood.” “There’s epic battle scenes in this movie, and obviously he’s well known for ‘The Patriot,’ and he brought that knowledge, and his knowl- edge gained ever since, to the project to realize Travis’ vision.”\n\n\tLaika has innovated with each film, including making advances on faces using 3D printers and now, armature and musculature for the puppets.\n\n\t“They’ve perfected a process that allows them to print the kind of skeletal form that enables the animators to coax even more lifelike, impactful performances,” says Burke. Fell adds, “You can see the tension in the characters because often, if you think of a stop-motion character, you think of basically an action figure. But these are more human and realistic than anything anybody’s ever done.”\n\n\tHe notes that repeatability is an important part of the craft. “When we started using 3D printed faces on ‘Coraline,’ every time we did it, on every feature, we learned something new and then found different ways to apply it. So it’s not just confined to the characters’ expressions anymore. It’s part of how we design the puppets themselves. It’s part of how we design our props. It’s how we can simulate the liquid activity in the film. We have these bubblers all over Portland, where they’re just water fountains in the cityscape, and we printed out a water cycle to simulate what the water looked like.\n\n\t“So, it’s become part of how we explore the ‘Wildwood’ world space and how we try and achieve practical effects for the film, rather than using VFX — although we do a lot of VFX touch-up work as well. It’s part of the complimentary aspects of how we accomplish this film.”Both Burke and Fell single out the General, a huge eagle, as a special character. “There are like 9,000 feathers on each [General] puppet — hand installed,” marvels Burke. “We also have a really terrifying antagonist in Maxim, played by Tom Waits, and just a still image of Maxim is terrifying,” laughs Fell. “He’s an incredibly graphic, intense character.”\n\n\t“Wildwood” really does seem to embody the Laika brand and Pacific Northwest location. “Our motto is that we walk a different path. And each one of our values is informed by each one of our films,” says Fell.\n",

Luigi can spend the money on some cheap goodies such as Nutella Hazelnut spread for just $4.90, summer sausage for a mere $2.10, or some oatmeal for just $3.65. If Luigi wants something spicy, he can splurge on jalapeno wheels for $3.20 and, if he has a hankering for a block of Velveeta cheese, he can shell out $3.70. Bottom line is Luigi's got much more money than he can spend -- but he has a cap of $160 per visit to the commissary.\n      \n\n          Then there's the mountain of letters Luigi receives behind bars— with our source putting the number at an eye-popping 100-to-200 each day. We're told the letters from the ladies can get hot and heavy at times. In fact, one woman, we're told, wrote to Luigi that she wants to \"bug out on his d--k.\"\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          But life in the Big House ain't just peaches and cream for Luigi, who is on garbage detail at the jail, which means he empties bags of trash each morning. Our sources say Luigi also spends his time connecting with his supportive parents during visits and with his lawyers on legal calls to prepare for his 2 trials — one in federal court and the other in state court.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          As you know, Luigi is charged by state and federal authorities with fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan on December 4, 2024. In the federal case, Luigi faces a possible death penalty sentence if convicted on the charge of murder with a firearm.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Luigi's lawyers, who declined to comment.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Luigi Mangione\n              \n                          \n                Money\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Shootings\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

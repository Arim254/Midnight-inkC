    "body": "\n\tElectric Entertainment, producer and distributor behind “Leverage,” “The Librarians” and “The Ark,” has received a $20 million investment from Content Partners Capital.\n\n\tThe Los Angeles-based Electric is the latest studio to secure financing from the company since Content Partners launched the investment private capital division in April 2024.\n\n\tPer CPC, which jointly announced the deal with Electric at Mipcom Tuesday during Electric  Entertainment’s 25th anniversary celebrations, “the deal reflects CPC’s continued momentum as it accelerates its investment strategy across content-driven businesses and entertainment assets.”\n\t\n\n\tLed by CEO Dean Devlin (pictured above, left), Electric Entertainment has been in business for 25 years and in the past year alone produced 36 episodes across three hit TV series. In 2024, it completed 22 episodes.\n\n\n\t“This investment will allow us to continue our rapid growth at the pace we’ve established over the years,” Devlin said. “We have been fortunate to produce, nurture, and expand a number of highly successful television franchises and beloved fan-favorite IPs, including Leverage, The Librarians, and The Ark, among others. We are ecstatic about our new relationship with Content Partners Capital and believe this partnership will be mutually rewarding for everyone involved.”\n\n\t“Electric Entertainment has proven itself a leader in the independent film and TV space, and it’s exactly the type of successful studio Content Partners Capital is looking to invest in,” CPC partner Alphonse Lordo (pictured above, right) said. “With this deal, we will support Electric Entertainment’s high-quality content while continuing to elevate Content Partners Capital as a major dealmaker in Hollywood, empowering independent studios with strategic capital.”\n\t\n\n\tElectric’s chief financial officer Jeff Gonzalez added: “I have known Alphonse for many years and am genuinely excited that we are working together. His leadership in providing capital to high-growth companies like Electric is invaluable, particularly as we expand our numerous IP TV series. This partnership with CPC will ensure we have the capital required to invest in current and new series, enabling us to continue delivering outstanding programming for our ever-growing loyal fanbase.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the twisted children’s novel “The Twits,” Road Dahl describes the repulsive state of Mr. Twit’s facial hair with relish, lingering on details like the “maggoty green cheese” and “slimy tail of a tinned sardine” you’d find tangled up in that unsanitary nest growing on his face. In a wonky toon retelling of the book now streaming on Netflix, it’s bedtime for the bugs living in Mr. Twit’s beard, and the adorable little larva won’t settle for “a boring old normal story.” That calls for a little extra creativity from its mom — and the movie’s narrator (Emilia Clarke) — who wriggles her mandibles and gets to work embellishing upon what Dahl imagined.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s not every (Minion-less) computer-animated comedy that can milk laughs from the opening credits, but “The Twits” wastes no time in tickling its target audience (youngsters who want butt jokes with their heavy-handed social commentary). Those who know the book well will immediately realize that the movie, the rowdy brainchild of “Ralph Breaks the Internet” co-director Phil Johnston, bears only a superficial resemblance to its source. And how could it be otherwise, since Dahl’s original story is far too slight (and much too mean-spirited) to support a feature-length movie? Mind you, Dahl’s work has adapted quite well in the past: Danny DeVito’s “Matilda” is closest in tone, while Wes Anderson’s “Fantastic Mr. Fox” shows how much fun animators can have with the material.\n\n\n\tAs we’ve established, “The Twits” is much thinner to start with — unless you’re referring to Mr. Twit, who’s actually quite paunchy, or his ugly wife, with hair the color of toilet-bowl cleaner and a broad-bottomed figure that suggests the Courtney character from Laika’s “Paranorman” after a lifetime of cheeseburgers and disappointment. Johnston sees the book’s anemic plot as an opportunity to take these lovably loathsome characters (voiced by Johnny Vegas and Margo Martindale) and invent an all-new narrative for them, one that’s true to the spirit but not quite so irredeemable — which, in this case, means tacking on a few feel-good lessons Dahl likely would have deplored.\n\t\n\n\tInstead of merely driving one another crazy (the book consisted of a series of disgusting pranks), the Twits now have a greater mission in life: to own and operate an amusement park, TwitLandia, with rickety attractions and a roller coaster shaped like someone’s intestines (a sickening snarl of pink tubes). Their creation comes across as a death trap — or a surefire way to get tetanus, at the very least. The whole place is powered by the magic tears of Muggle-Wumps, apelike creatures whom the Twits keep in captivity and force to stand on their heads for hours on end (though there are other fun critters too, such as Alan Tudyk’s backwards-talking Sweet-Toed Toad).\n\n\tJohnston and co-writer Meg Favreau have transposed the story from England to the unappealingly named American town of Triperot, inventing a full ensemble of supporting characters to irritate and provoke the Twits in the process. Taking a page from Dr. Seuss’ “The Grinch That Stole Christmas,” they channel the dynamic between a certain green meanie and the relatively upbeat residents of Whoville. In place of Cindy-Lou Who, we get the orphans Beesha (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and Bubsy (Ryan Lopez), who sneak around undermining the Twits’ schemes, while the bumbling Mr. Napkin (voiced by Johnston himself) ineptly tries to find these kids homes.\n\n\t“The Twits” adopts much the same manic energy of countless Nickelodeon and DreamWorks cartoons, while boosting the pink and blue color scheme (and asymmetrical character designs) Henry Selick introduced at Laika. It’s even got songs, courtesy of David Byrne, none of them catchy enough to live on beyond the confines of the film. Still, there’s humor in every detail, much of it skewing to the sordid, if not downright scatological end of the spectrum, from exploding buttocks to anthropomorphic hairballs (squealing lint creatures called “florbnorbles” coughed up by the Muggle-Wumps).\n\n\tNone of that is Dahl’s doing. And yet, the film’s irreverent tone feels largely in keeping with the author’s own politeness-be-damned approach to children’s entertainment. It’s there in the smudgy skin and ratty hair, as well as the rusty, run-down production design (which resembles the more derelict corners of a U.S. city like Detroit). While the main characters emote and move appealingly enough, corners must have been cut with the supporting cast, who look like the humans in animated eyesores like “Hoodwinked!” from the early 2000s. If anything, the artistically lit film isn’t as ugly as it ought to be.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s more than a little strange for such a film to have a conscience — especially when you consider what happens to Mr. and Mrs. Twit in the book — and yet, Johnston finds a way to shoehorn a few life lessons into Dahl’s creation. The film offers a child psychology tip for fiercely independent kids (like Beesha) about learning to accept help from others, plus some none-too-subtle critiques of lying leaders who sow division. If the Twits stand for something, it’s hatred of everything, and in this telling, it takes standing on their heads to realize that’s no way to succeed in the world. Here’s a Twit tip for ya: Don’t let Netflix cut the credits short, as you’ll find a glimpse of Loompaland hidden among all those names.\n\n\tNetflix will release “The Twits” on Oct. 17. \n",

    "body": "\n\tKeanu Reeves is remembering his “Something’s Gotta Give” co-star Diane Keaton, who died Oct. 11 at 79 years old. \n\n\t“Total pro,” Reeves told E! News of Keaton on Monday at a New York screening of his new film “Good Fortune.” “She was very nice to me. Generous, generous artist and a very special, unique person.”\n\n\tHe added, “It was cool to be able to see her and Jack Nicholson together. Just with the history they shared and the way the fondness and love they had for each other. It’s really cool.”\n\t\n\n\tReeves starred in “Something’s Gotta Give” as Julian Mercer, a strapping young doctor and a dedicated fan of Keaton’s retired playwrite Erica Barry. The two eventually develop a romantic relationship. The 2003 film also stars Jack Nicholson, Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand and Jon Favreau. \n\n\t“Something’s Gotta Give” director Nancy Meyers took to Instagram on Monday to pay tribute to Keaton. Along with a picture of her long-time friend and star, she wrote, “These past 48 hours have not been easy. Seeing all of your tributes to Diane has been a comfort. As a movie lover, I’m with you all – we have lost a giant. A brilliant actress who time and again laid herself bare to tell our stories. As a woman, I lost a friend of almost 40 years – at times over those years, she felt like a sister because we shared so many truly memorable experiences. As a filmmaker, I’ve lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of.”\n\n\tAnother close collaborator, Woody Allen, also recently paid homage to Keaton. In a Sunday night essay posted to The Free Press, he wrote, “It’s grammatically incorrect to say ‘most unique,’ but all rules of grammar, and I guess anything else, are suspended when talking about Diane Keaton. Unlike anyone the planet has experienced or is unlikely to ever see again, her face and laugh illuminated any space she entered.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnna Wintour has offered a vote of confidence for newly appointed CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.“Obviously, she’s a very accomplished young woman with a very strong personality and a strong point of view,” Wintour told Variety on Monday night when asked about Weiss’ appointment at Only Make Believe’s 25th Anniversary Gala in New York City. “And that usually makes for a great leader.”Wintour assumed control of Vogue’s U.S. edition in 1988 and held the role for 37 years. Chloé Malle, the daughter of actor Candice Bergen and director Louis Malle, succeeded her as head of editorial content for U.S. Vogue in September. “My days are pretty full,” said Wintour, who continues to oversee the fashion magazine’s worldwide output as chief content officer of Condé Nast and Vogue’s global editorial director.\n\n\tWhen asked if she could ever see a day where she stops working, the 75-year-old fashion icon replied, “That hasn’t arisen yet.”Only Make Believe honored Wintour with the James Hammerstein Award at the annual charity gala. Hosted by John Oliver at the Shubert Theater, the organization raised over $1.3 million to support their mission to bring interactive theater to children’s hospitals and special education facilities across the East Coast.A day earlier, Oliver dedicated the latest episode of his HBO series “Last Week Tonight” to a deep dive into Weiss’ career. The late-night host highlighted articles from her outlet The Free Press that he described as “pretty poorly fact-checked,” and questioned Weiss’ lack of traditional newsroom experience.\n\n\n\t“Of course I knew what they were doing at the Free Press beforehand, that’s fine,” Oliver told Variety. “When it jumps is when you’re in charge of a news organization without being a journalist.”Weiss made a career for herself as an op-ed staff editor at The New York Times before breaking off from the mainstream publication in 2020 and launching the Free Press. Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison announced last week that his company would acquire Weiss’ Free Press for $150 million, a move that’s sparked divisive reactions across the media industry.Although Oliver expressed deep concern for the future of CBS News, he emphasized wanting “to separate out” Weiss’ new role from the work being done by the journalists at the network.\n\t\n\n\t“The reason why it is so alarming is there’s amazing work being done at CBS,” Oliver told Variety. “They will continue to do that work until the worst case scenario, they are unable to do it anymore and people start getting fired or resigning. So up until that point, I’d want to defend very much the fact that great work is happening at CBS News. I hope it can continue to happen under these circumstances. I worry it’ll be different.”\n\nJohn Oliver on President Trump’s reaction to the power shifts happening at CBS News and Paramount: “He’s certainly happy about Ellison taking over Paramount and CBS. So this is more of that.” pic.twitter.com/HzUSvrLdyM— Variety (@Variety) October 14, 2025\n\n\n\tPres. Donald Trump said on Sunday that he thinks CBS News has “great potential” after the Skydance–Paramount merger, which put David Ellison in charge of the media company.\n\n\t“I’m sure he’s happy,” Oliver said. “I mean, he’s certainly happy about Ellison taking over Paramount and CBS. So this is more of that. So, I’m sure he’s happy — if happiness is something that he can ever fully get himself to.”Oliver concluded, “In general, if he’s really happy about something, you’ve got to question what that something is.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRajesh Mapuskar, the Indian National Film Award-winning director behind “Ventilator” and “Ferrari Ki Sawaari,” has been tapped to helm “Chiranjeevi Hanuman – The Eternal,” billed as one of India’s first theatrical films created using generative AI technology.\n\n\tThe Hindi-language project, which chronicles the tale of Hindu god Lord Hanuman, is being produced by Vikram Malhotra’s Abundantia Entertainment and Collective Media Network’s Historyverse. The film is slated for a worldwide theatrical release on Hanuman Jayanti, a festival celebrating the birth of the deity, in 2026.\n\t\n\n\tMapuskar brings considerable pedigree to the project, having also served as associate director on Rajkumar Hirani’s blockbusters “Munnabhai MBBS,” “Lage Raho Munnabhai” and the box office juggernaut “3 Idiots.”\n\n\n\tThe production is being supported by a team of more than 50 engineers from Galleri5, the technology division of Collective Artists Network, working alongside cultural scholars, literary experts and writers to ensure narrative authenticity.\n\n\t“I am a big fan of Rajesh’s work and have seen how, across films, he has brilliantly told emotionally deep stories that have connected with movie-watchers across the board,” said Malhotra, who also serves as CEO of Abundantia Entertainment. “Rajesh’s cinematic craft, his deep understanding of the story and curiosity to explore new creative paradigms make him the perfect choice to lead a film of this disruptive nature.”\n\n\tVijay Subramaniam, founder and group CEO of Collective Artists Network, added: “This project is about redefining how stories from our cultural legacy are told and experienced. We’re excited to push the boundaries of creativity and technology and present a version of Hanuman’s story that resonates across generations and geographies.”\n\t\n\n\tMapuskar said: “Taking on a project that so fearlessly embraces innovation is both thrilling and daunting. The story of Lord Hanuman is timeless, filled with strength, devotion, and purpose and it is a rare opportunity to steer a film that both honors India’s spiritual heritage and pioneers the future of filmmaking.”\n\n\tThe project represents a significant test case for AI technology in feature filmmaking, as the industry grapples with questions about the role of artificial intelligence in creative production.\n",

I feel such an overwhelming responsibility to give a full out, joyous, celebratory dance to the man who is responsible for THOUSANDS of people becoming teachers and who has helped raise multiple generations,” Fishel captioned her Instagram. “This dance is a dedication from me to Bill but I am representing ALL OF YOU who loved and appreciated him and his career for so many decades. Unfortunately, @rider_strong is working out of town but he will be missed.”\n\n\n\tFishel is dancing a jive during the Oct. 14 episode with her partner, Pasha Pashkov. Daniels, 98, will join the duo in the routine.\n\n\t“Saying it out loud feels crazy. But yes, we get to dance to the ‘Boy Meets World’ theme song, the one you all know and love,” she previously shared on her “Danielle With the Stars” podcast. “I’m so excited. It’s really a dedication to Bill and the role he has played in my life and the role ‘Boy Meets World’ has played in my life. I have really felt like ‘Dancing with the Stars’ has been a second act for me in my career and as a performer.”\n\t\n\n\tShe mentioned how much of an inspiration Daniels has been in her life and to many members of the TV family. She added, “To be able to say thank you to him and give him this kind of a platform for him to receive the love that he deserves is going to be very memorable. So I’m very, very excited about that. I can’t wait.”\n\n\t“Boy Meets World” aired from 1993 to 2000. The cast later reunited for a spinoff, “Girl Meets World,” which aired for three seasons on Disney Channel from 2014 to 2017.\n\n\t“Dancing With the Stars” dedication night airs on Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET. on ABC and Disney+ and is available to stream the next day on Hulu.\n\n",

This agreement works for the realities of these productions — their pace, their budgets, and their creative ambitions, while upholding the union’s core standards of actor protections,” said Chief Negotiator and National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland in a press release. “Verticals are more than just a new format, they open up more opportunities for new stories to be told, reaching new audiences every single day.”\n\t\n\n\t“Our members are always on the lookout for good work opportunities. As technology develops and our industry looks for creative ways to engage audiences, new formats emerge,” said Crabtree-Ireland. “SAG-AFTRA perceives the advent of so-called “verticals” as an exciting new space. This fast-evolving format is catching on and we are here to support our performers as they pursue their craft and engage this new business model. By offering a contract that is tailored to the unique needs of these projects, our union is meeting the moment. As the business of verticals experiences substantial growth, so too will our relationship with the producers.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety reported last month that microdramas generated $819 million in revenues in 2024, with revenues projected to climb to $3.8 billion by decade’s end. In China, microdrama revenues are expected to surpass theatrical box office this year.\n\n\tThe vertical agreement will be available later this month for members in the SAG-AFTRA union.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAMC Theatres is releasing 1977’s “Annie Hall” and 2003’s “Something’s Gotta Give” in 100 cinemas nationwide in tribute to the late Diane Keaton, Variety has confirmed. Screenings will run for one week, starting on Friday.\n\n\tKeaton died on Oct. 11 in Los Angeles after being rushed from her home to the hospital. The Oscar winner was 79.\n\n\t“Annie Hall” earned Keaton her first Oscar nomination — and eventual win — for best actress in a leading role. Starring alongside her long-time paramour and creative collaborator Woody Allen, the film became widely considered among the best of her career and one of the most revered comedies of all time. The film follows Allen as Alvy Singer, who, in a surreal retelling, examines his failed relationship with nightclub singer Annie Hall, played by Keaton.\n\t\n\n\t“Something’s Gotta Give,” which earned Keaton her fourth Oscar nomination for lead actress, was a box office smash upon its 2003 release, grossing $265 million worldwide against a budget of $80 million. Much like “Annie Hall,” the Nancy Meyers film boasted an A-list cast and tackled love and relationships in a nostalgic, romanticized cadence. The film follows Jack Nicholson as Harry Sanborn, an aging womanizer who falls for his much younger girlfriend’s mother, portrayed by Keaton, while vacationing together in the Hamptons.\n\n\tKeaton also earned Oscar noms for best lead actress for her roles in 1982’s “Reds” and 1997’s “Marvin’s Room.” Her other notable credits include “The Godfather,” “Father of the Bride” and “Baby Boom.”\n\n\tTributes from Hollywood poured out on Saturday upon news of Keaton’s death. Allen broke his silence on his most beloved co-star in a Sunday night essay posted to The Free Press. He wrote, “It’s grammatically incorrect to say ‘most unique,’ but all rules of grammar, and I guess anything else, are suspended when talking about Diane Keaton. Unlike anyone the planet has experienced or is unlikely to ever see again, her face and laugh illuminated any space she entered.”\n\t\n\n\tMeyers also paid tribute to her star in an Instagram post on Monday. Along with a photo of Keaton, the Oscar-nominated director wrote, “As a woman, I lost a friend of almost 40 years – at times over those years, she felt like a sister because we shared so many truly memorable experiences. As a filmmaker, I’ve lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe TiVo box, which sat at the cutting edge of television’s early 2000s time-shifting viewer revolution, is no more. The company confirmed to Variety that it officially got out of the hardware business on Oct. 1, when it stopped selling its physical DVR products. That means the TiVo hardware and accessories, which still had been sold both online and through agents until this fall, is officially off the market.\n\n\t“TiVo no longer manufactures hardware, and our remaining inventory is now depleted, though we will continue to offer support for the products going forward,” the company told Variety. “We are very proud of the TiVo DVR legacy, and the great experience TiVo has always provided lives on in our TiVo OS for Connected Televisions, which is available on televisions from Sharp in the US and multiple brands throughout Europe.”\n\t\n\n\tThe fact that TiVo will still offer support for these now obsolete boxes probably come as somewhat of a relief for users who bought “lifetime plans” for the service. \n\n\n\tTiVo’s most recent digital video recorder, dubbed “TiVo Edge,” was unveiled in October 2019. That device included 4K Dolby Vision HDR video playback capabilities with Dolby Atmos sound, and could be used to both record live TV and access a range of streaming apps. Versions included one for cable users (with six tuners and a 2TB hard drive) and cord cutters (with four tuners and a 2TB hard drive).\n\n\tThe TiVo Edge was the seventh generation TiVo DVR, and was manufactured by Arris. The original Series 1 TiVo, launched in March 1999, was manufactured by Philips.\n\n\tTV industry execs were initially concerned about the commercial-zapping capabilities of the then-nascent TiVo technology: “We’re in trouble, and we shouldn’t ignore the fact that it’s right around the corner,” then-Fox Entertainment prexy Gail Berman said at a 2003 Hollywood Radio & TV Society luncheon about the threat of DVRs. “This business is going to change, and it’s up to us to figure out how to do it.”\n\t\n\n\tUltimately, networks embraced TiVo and its rival DVRs as they saw how the devices actually helped increase regular series viewing. The Television Academy even awarded TiVo an Interactive TV Emmy in 2006 for “seamlessly connecting consumers to the digital entertainment they want, where and when they want it.”\n\n\tBut as cable operators began incorporating DVRs into their own set top boxes, TiVo struggled to sell its devices in the consumer market. It focused more of its efforts on licensing TiVo-branded software and tech to cable operators and other third-party devices. Later, the streaming revolution changed the way people consumed TV — as audiences turned to cloud-based on-demand options rather than recording and storing their own libraries.\n\n\tThe end of the TiVo Edge had been on the horizon for a while: TiVo stopped selling the antenna (“cord cutter”) version of the device on its website in February 2024. According to users, that was followed by the TiVo Mini LUX and the TiVo Stream 4K, until the last product — the TiVo Edge DVR for cable — ended its sales at the end of September.\n\n\tThe website Cord Cutters News was the first to note last week that TiVo’s official website had taken down references to its hardware DVR products, including the TiVo Edge. The website noted how streaming changed the game, while cable companies focused more on proprietary cloud DVRs — and then “regulatory changes, including the phased-out support for CableCARD technology—essential for TiVo’s cable compatibility—further squeezed the viability of consumer hardware.”\n\n\tTiVo’s website now gears users to two options: A pitch for smart TVs that license TiVo technology, and one for its DTS AutoStage video service for autos. \n",

    "body": "\n\tHaim‘s tour finale Saturday night at the Santa Barbara Bowl was full of reassurances. First of all, it was good to see for certain that Alana Haim’s head looks just fine, and completely intact, after, well, you know. Secondly, the band is sounding better than fine. The only squib marks left on anyone were on the almost 5,000 patrons who braved one of the most refreshingly moderate ocean breezes California has to offer to see maybe still the best homegrown group California has had to offer in any recent year. To paraphrase their frequent partner in crime, Paul Thomas Anderson: One banger after another! Seriously.\n\t\n\n\tIf there’s anything to add on the subject of reassurances that doesn’t have anything to do with head wounds, it would be how the band’s fourth and most recent album, “I Quit,” would translate live. If you were overthinking that sort of thing and trying to forecast it, you could be of two minds about how it might go. On the one hand, “I Quit” represents a new step for the sister trio in sounding as much like an actual rock band on record as they do in concert, with more guitars and less reliance on the electronics or loops of past albums. A recipe for further rocking out, as if Haim ever needed one before? It would have seem to have augured that way.\n\n\n\tOn the other hand, “I Quit” is an album that was given that title for a reason, and not just because it sounds a little funny. It’s largely about reckonings that feel like pathways to uncertain exits, so the tone is pretty contemplative. (Although they made sure to throw in a few danceable and/or lewd numbers to leaven things.) Simply put, in a year with a bunch of pretty solid divorce albums, this feels like it was that for principal singer-songwriter Danielle Haim. Never mind that she wasn’t actually married; the stakes of the songs, and the seriousness with which they address getting out of something long-term, are on that level. So maybe, just maybe, you could imagine a live set built around that new material feeling a little weightier than what we’re used to from the sisters.\n\t\n\n\tIt did not. Haim managed to put on a show that felt about 95% mirthful while still honoring the integrity of the new songs that dig emotionally deeper. We will probably not live to see the day when Haim is putting on anything other than a happy-go-gleeful concert, as long as the act still includes sister-on-the-left Alana acting as the designated cheerleader, and sister-on-the-right Este being expressive enough for an entire extended family. At the quieter center of that slight mayhem is the slightly more reserved Danielle, who “doesn’t talk,” as Alana amusingly declared at one point in some lopsided banter. Danielle is not really quite the Teller of the group — she does use her words — but you get the sense she would rather not be doing song intros that might require her to explain what her songs are about when she could just be singing them. And expounding on them with some nice face-ripping-off guitar leads. It’s all very comical in a way that still leaves room for real chops and actual emotional catharsis.\n\n\tMajor props are due to the tour’s clever production design, which has been conceived in a way that sometimes is played for broad laughs and sometimes more subtly sets up the themes of the material without the band members having to talk so much. It involved multiple screens, starting with a Times Square-style ticker going across the top of the stage that involved old-school red-block-letter messages scrolling from right to left. By the middle of the show, the ticker had developed its own personality and was engaging in conversation with the sisters as “the oracle,” offering Magic 8 Ball-style answers to questions about, like, whether they were going to party in Goleta later on. \n\n\tBut in the first and last portions of the show, the screen mostly flashed “I quit” messages that related to the songs about to be performed, or to a plethora of positive meanings that could be drawn out of such a negative-sounding phrase. Like: “I quit apologizing.” “I quit regret.” “I quit bad kissers.” “I quit envy.” “I quit saying I’m okay.” “I quit your shit.” “I quit lying to yourself.” And, on the wittier side, “I quit clothing,” right before Danielle sang “All Over Me,” an outlier on the new album that may count as the band’s lustiest song, which, in their sexually untimid catalog, is saying something. Also: “I quit winter,” which any fan would have known was a LOL segue into “Summer Girl,” their most feel-good song (which is also saying something).\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDanielle Haim and Este Haim of Haim perform on the Park stage during day four of Glastonbury festival 2025. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRedferns\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere were other nice touches involving the screens. Like a digital intermission clock of sorts that kept the audience abreast of what percentage of the time between sets had been used up. (The way it suddenly started racing to 100% right before the band came on suggested that the clock may not be fully Seiko-accurate, but it’s the funny idea that counts.) The screens were also used for some more pleasingly abstract purposes, like opening up a central window at the start of the first song to show Danielle singing and strumming in isolation, and then opening similar digital windows on either side for Alana and Este. A larger overhead screen allowed for black-and-white widescreen closeups, and also crowd shots of some of the ladies in the front of the pit exchanging mutually supportive middle fingers with the women on stage, as was appropriate to the song at the time. \n\n\tAs is customary, Danielle got the showier instrumental bits of the night, going from playing some serious fuzz guitar to the mid-show segment that has her kicking it on drums. (The trio has two supplementary players, identified as Nick and Ryan, who bolster and fill in on multiple instruments as needed.) Of the three of them, Este is the one most anchored to a single instrument, her thick-and-thicker bass, but even she set that down at the end of “In It” to join the inevitable number in any Haim concert where all three are pounding simultaneously on kettle drums. (It was their only synchronized move; this tour, they’ve dropped the choreographed dance moment they used to incorporate.) The sense that all three of them can and will trade up instruments is part of the fun: As they cheekily and definatly declared an album ago, they are women in music. For real.\n\n\tEste got a solo lead vocal number in the soul-emo mode with the latest album’s “Cry,” followed by Alana getting a whole number to herself — the first time that’s happened on a tour, she noted — with the disco-y “Spinning.” (Getting the older crowd in the fixed upper seats in Santa Barbara to do audience-participation moves was tough, but the young people on the floor were into following wherever Alana wanted to lead.) But it’s hardly as if we’d never hear Alana’s voice without that new spotlight slot for her. Haim has a few numbers in the show where they each trade lead vocals, like their acoustic sisterhood anthem “Hallelujah,” and the new, country-flavored “Blood on the Street.” Even fashioned as a group-sing, that latter number allowed Danielle one of her most expressive moments of the night. Following a quirkily bluesy guitar solo, when she got to her closing verse, she started riffing on the song’s lyrics, in mock-anger. “I was UNFAIR?… ME?” Having her set her usual cool aside and act out a little bit of the songs’ latent psychodrama for a few moments was a kick.\n\t\n\n\tFor all the fun and games at a Haim show, it’s good to have those few moments that reinforce that, especially on record, they’re not always kidding around. I appreciated the way the show was bookended with some of the tentative and yet tough-minded breakup songs from the latest album, even though the usual touring rule would be to begin and end with the greatest hits. As an opener, “Gone” was rabble-rouser enough, with its power cords and slow-burning eff-you attitude (and George Michael “Freedom” interpolation). Mid-show, Danielle used the acoustic segment to bring out a song the band doesn’t do every night, “The Farm,” which might be the best song off the latest album, if also the quietest and most relationship-weary.\n\n\tAnd it was surprising to see them close out the encore with “Down to Be Wrong,” a kind of mid-tempo slammer that comes smack in the middle of the latest album. When you heard it land there, it made sense: There’s something deeply and surprisingly anthemic about hearing Danielle, over some heavy electric strumming, singing the simple words: “Down to be wrong / Don’t need to be right.” Not needing to be correct at all times, when some kind of action needs to be taken — that might really count as some hard-earned, feisty wisdom to send a crowd home mulling as their parting earworm.\n\n\tThe name of this road show was, of course, the “I Quit Tour,” so maybe it had nothing to do with it being the end of the tour that, at the very end of the night, that ticker behind the stage brightly declared: “HAIM QUITS.” A good little gag, in a night that had a lot of them. But it underscored just how much they spent the final night of their outing sounding the very opposite of resigned.\n\n\tHaim setlist at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Oct. 11, 2025:\n\n\tGoneAll Over MeTake Me BackMy Song 5Cry SpinningDon’t WannaMillion YearsThe StepsGasolineBlood on the StreetThe FarmHallelujahSummer GirlWant You BackRelationshipsNow I’m In It\n\n\t(encore)The WireDown to Be Wrong\n",

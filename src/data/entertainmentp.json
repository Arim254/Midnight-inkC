    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent episode of the “Team Deakins” podcast, Kate Winslet discussed her debut in Peter Jackson’s 1994 drama-thriller “Heavenly Creatures,” which follows the Oscar winner and Melanie Lynskey as two teens who share a dangerously obsessive friendship. When asked how much of herself she brought to the role of Juliet, Winslet shared that her “first intimate experiences” as a teenager were “with girls,” which helped her understand the “really intense connection” at the heart of the film.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ll share something I’ve never shared before. Some of my first intimate experiences as a young teen were actually with girls,” Winslet said. “I’d kissed a few girls, and I’d kissed a few boys, but I wasn’t particularly evolved in either direction.”\n\n\n\tShe added, “At that stage in my life, I certainly was curious, and I think there was something about the really intense connection that those two women had that I profoundly understood. I was so immediately sucked into the vortex of that world they were in that obviously became horrendously damaging to both of them, and they had huge insecurities and vulnerabilities.”\n\n\tWinslet later explained that while she “couldn’t truly understand” the darker elements of the film, she connected with the deep personal connections someone can form when they are young and “vulnerable.”\n\n\t“Heavenly Creatures” was Winslet’s breakout role. She told “Team Deakins” that she “never held a film script” before auditioning for the film. It was also Jackson’s first foray into drama. Before helming “Heavenly Creatures,” his directing credits included horror films like “Bad Taste” and “Dead Alive,” and the dark comedy “Meet the Feebles.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the years after “Heavenly Creatures,” Winslet starred in “Sense and Sensibility,” “Jude” and “Hamlet” before landing “Titanic” in 1997.\n",

Sure, it ends with a romantic proposal, but was any fan mentally prepared for that first scene? Let’s just say the room service waitress wasn’t the only person who almost ran away screaming! Brace yourself as we walk through this week’s episode.\n\t\n\n\nOh man, it begins with Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) farting and showing an unblurred shot of his, um, lil’ landman? Holy moly!\nWhat a chaotic opening! Tommy didn’t even know he was traumatizing the hotel employee (Ana Ming Bostwick-Singer).\nTommy, could you maybe roll over or cover up more for this conversation? It’s distracting that you’re at full-mast.\n“Don’t you fuck my omelet!” Am I hallucinating this episode?\nThanks for that last shot of a fully erect Tommy.\nOverall, this is a pretty horny episode of “Landman” from the jump!\nRebecca (Kayla Wallace) is so gaga over Charlie (Guy Burnet)! It’s shocking to see her lovey-dovey facial expressions.\n“We’re eating breakfast on the ocean floor.” It’s helpful that he’s a hunk, but Charlie’s monologue about the geology of the area really sings because of Taylor Sheridan’s writing.\n“Wildcatting” seems too stressful as a non-gambler.\nOoh, spotting a metaphor! Just as she’s “wildcatting” finding oil, Rebecca is “wildcatting” by opening up her heart to Charlie!\nSo wait, Tommy did have sex with an omelet to make Angela (Ali Larter) mad? Jeez!\nDamn, who knew that Dale (James Jordan) was such a smooth talker?\nOh, no: Is Boss (Mustafa Speaks) talking about retiring soon foreshadowing that he’s going to die?\nT.L. (Sam Elliott) peeing on a snake? Sure, why not!\nGood advice from T.L. to Tommy over lunch. Tommy is annoyed all the time anyway … why not stop and smell the roses on occasion?\nI’m convinced Angela and Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) are gaslighting Cooper (Jacob Lofland) that he smells, and he actually doesn’t. They say it so often that something strange is at play.\nHow did Nate (Colm Feore) possibly guess that Rebecca and Charlie are hooking up? The name thing is not enough — does he have a miraculous sixth sense?\nNow we’re discussing cock rings? Gah, this episode!\nWas anyone else legitimately scared that T.L. died during the car trip?\nPulling on a man’s mustache is dirty business, Tommy.\nOh, Lord, what is actually happening at these “man camps”?\n“The whole place is a workplace violation.” Good call, Tommy.\n“You can eat it or fuck it, I don’t really care.” Ah, Angela, never change.\nAww, Tommy is taking T.L.’s advice and appreciating his family. Love to see it!\nWhere did Cooper get a zillion candles for this proposal? It’s a fire hazard.\nAll said, the proposal was pretty cute. Good job, Cooper!\n\n\n\n\tUntil next week, please discuss the emotions you felt seeing a full-frontal Tommy in the comments below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDavid Spade on ’25 Years’ Spent Getting Eddie Murphy to Forgive Him for ‘SNL’ Joke: ‘He Was a Hero’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaste Test: Michter’s New 20 Year Bourbon Tests the Upper Limits of Aging, But Comes Out On Top\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHeisman Runner-Up Pavia Seeks Court Order to Keep Playing\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDesigners, Dignitaries Remember French Icon Brigitte Bardot\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme,” now in theaters, Timothee Chalamet plays an ambitious young man from New York’s Lower East Side convinced that table tennis is the way forward.\n\n\tThe time period is 1952, and Marty is a hustler who works at the family shoe store, pretending not to have a size in stock so he can sell a customer a more expensive pair. On the side, he’s always looking for that next get-rich quick scheme.\n\n\n\tThe film stars Fran Drescher as Marty’s mother, Tyler, the Creator, Odessa A’zion, “Shark Tank” personality Kevin O’Leary and Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\t\n\n\tSafdie spent over six years writing the project. To bring that authenticity to the performance, Safdie didn’t just put Chalamet in prop glasses; he went one step further.\n\n\tSpeaking in front of a packed audience earlier this month at a Hollywood panel, Safdie said, “At the time, we said, we were going to put +10 contact lenses in your eyes, and we’re gonna put -10 prescription lenses in front of them so that when his glasses fall off, he can’t see shit.” When Chalamet tried on that combination, Safdie recalled receiving a call from the actor. “He calls me, and he says, ‘I’ve got the +10s in right now, I’m pretty dizzy.’”\n\n\tAccording to Safdie, Chalamet described it as feeling like “he was in a fishbowl.” But Chalamet was determined. Safdie said Chalamet told him, “I’ll do anything you ask me to do.”\n\n\tProsthetics artist Michael Fontaine applied pockmarks, freckles and nicks to Chalamet’s face. “You felt that with the scars and nicks, he’s been in fights, and he’s from the street,” Safdie said.\n\t\n\n\tThe makeup was so convincing that even co-star Paltrow believed it was real. Paltrow plays faded movie star Kay Stone, who is wooed by Marty. She admitted, “I had no idea.” She went on to say, “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, he’s got little acne scars,’ and was like, ‘I’m so surprised by how you never see that.’”\n\n\tWith Fontaine’s prosthetics and the glasses, and his hair in the 1950s style, Safdie says, “When he had them in, he was Marty.”\n\n\tChalamet also strived for authenticity in his performance and spent years preparing for the role. He took every opportunity to play table tennis because he wanted to appear like a professional player when shooting began. He also trained with table tennis expert Diego Schaaf to help coordinate and choreograph the games.\n\n\tIn the film, Marty faces off against Koto Endo, who is played by real-life table tennis champion Koto Kawaguchi. He loses to him during a tournament in London, then finds himself face-to-face with him during a match in Japan.\n\n\tAsked about playing against Kawaguchi, Chalamet said the pressure was “huge.” But he also needed to get it right and felt “a responsibility to that community and to the aficionados and people that are passionate about that sport.”\n\n\tSafdie added that during filming, Chalamet “would be so in character, he’s like, ‘I want to win the next points. We have to play.'” Kawaguchi was game. “At one point he said to me, it’s like, you know, I’m not an actor, you know, I’m a table tennis player. And you know, I’m doing a lot of acting right now.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJamie Lee Curtis is thankful her movie star mom made her wait to start acting in horror movies.\n\n\tDuring a recent appearance on “The Drew Barrymore Show” (via People), Curtis said that a producer wanted her to audition for “The Exorcist.” However, her mother, Janet Leigh, shut down the opportunity, protecting her then 12-year-old daughter from early fame and any potential trauma that came with starring in one of the scariest movies ever made.\n\t\n\n\t“He called my mom and said, ‘Hey, I’m producing the movie of the book “The Exorcist.” Will you let Jamie audition for it?’” Curtis recalled. “And at the time I was probably 12 and, like, cute and kind of sassy and I had some personality and I’m sure he saw me at a party and was like, ‘Oh, she’d be funny.’ And my mother said, ‘No.'”\n\n\n\tShe then told host Barrymore, “My mom really wanted me to have, thank God, a childhood, which I understand you didn’t get. You didn’t get that option.” Barrymore’s first role was in “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.” She was just seven years old playing Elliot’s younger sister. \n\n\tLinda Blair would ultimately be cast as the possessed child, Regan. She was nominated at the 1974 Acadmey Awards for best supporting actor for the role.\n\n\tCurtis would eventually become synonymous with the horror genre, first breaking out in the 1978 classic “Halloween” at age 19. In the coming years, Curtis starred in films like “The Fog,” “Prom Night,” and “Terror Train.” She most recently reprised her 1978 “Halloween” role, Laurie, for 2022’s “Halloween Ends.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” has surpassed $760 million globally after two weekends of release. \n\n\tOver the busy Christmas stretch, James Cameron‘s sci-fi epic collected $181.2 million from 51 overseas markets and $245.2 million globally. Those ticket sales mark a minimal 25% decline from its international opening weekend. So far, the Disney and 20th Century film has grossed $217 million in North America and $542 million at the international box office. Outside of the United States and Canada, top markets are China with $99.6 million, France with $54.4 million, Germany with $43.1 million and Korea with $32.1 million.\n\t\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is already the sixth-highest grossing Hollywood release of the year, and it’ll continue to climb above hits like “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” ($714 million), “Jurassic World: Rebirth ($869 million) and “A Minecraft Movie” ($958 million) in the coming weekends. Soon, “Avatar 3” should become 2025’s third blockbuster to surpass the $1 billion mark, following two other Disney behemoths, May’s “Lilo & Stitch” remake ($1.03 billion) and November’s “Zootopia 2” ($1.3 billion and counting). To underscore Disney’s box office dominance, none of its rival studios has fielded a single billion-dollar film since 2023. \n\n\n\tA key question for box office watchers is where “Avatar: Fire and Ash” will end its theatrical run. The third installment in the otherworldly franchise has a high bar to clear in terms of theatrical expectations because the first two trips to Pandora, 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” stand as two of the biggest movies in history with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. “Avatar 3” doesn’t necessarily need to hit the $2 billion mark to be considered a commercial success, though the mega-budgeted film does need to keep playing in theaters to justify its massive price tag for Disney. That shouldn’t be a problem, since “Avatar” films have become synonymous with box office staying power, meaning the visual spectacles are known to stick around in theaters.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s other juggernaut, “Zootopia 2,” remained a box office force with $67.2 million from 52 overseas territories and $87.9 million globally in its fifth weekend of release. So far, the animated sequel has generated a $321.4 million domestically and a stellar $1.099 billion internationally, bringing its global tally to $1.42 billion.\n\n\tIn other box office milestones, Universal’s big-budget musical “Wicked: For Good” finally crossed the $500 million mark. The film, starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, has earned $172 million overseas and $503.9 million worldwide. “Wicked: For Good” should turn a tidy profit against a $150 million production budget, but the movie has earned far less than its predecessor, 2024’s “Wicked,” with $758 million globally. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe filmmakers behind Yash‘s highly anticipated “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” have revealed the first look at Huma Qureshi as Elizabeth, unveiling a character that blends old-world glamour with unsettling gothic menace.\n\n\tThe newly released image captures Qureshi against a cemetery backdrop, her character positioned next to a classic black automobile. Her costume features a dramatic black gown with exposed shoulders and striking sleeve design, presenting a character whose refined appearance masks darker undertones. The funereal location and subdued color palette hint at a figure whose influence derives from composure and sophistication rather than explicit aggression.\n\t\n\n\tQureshi has built a formidable reputation across film and streaming platforms through acclaimed performances in Anurag Kashyap’s crime drama “Gangs of Wasseypur,” the black comedy “Dedh Ishqiya,” and revenge thriller “Badlapur.” Her work in streaming series includes the dystopian Netflix drama “Leila” and the SonyLIV political thriller “Maharani,” for which she received a Filmfare OTT Award. She was most recently in Season 3 of Netflix series “Delhi Crime” and the lead in Bikas Ranjan Mishra’s film “Bayaan,” which bowed at the Toronto Film Festival. \n\n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\t\n\n\t“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\t“Casting for this role was perhaps the trickiest,” said director Geetu Mohandas. “The character demanded a performer with high octane caliber and an undeniable presence. From the moment Huma entered my frame, I witnessed that she possessed something rare. She carried an effortless sophistication and intensity that immediately brought the character of Elizabeth alive for me. Huma is an actor who questions, probes, and challenges the artistic interpretation of a role and that dialogue became an essential part of our creative journey. She has always been known as a powerhouse of talent, but this performance will mark as a turning point for the arrival of an undeniable, commanding new presence on celluloid.”\n\n\tThe first look at Kiara Advani‘s character Nadia was unveiled recently. \n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "Actor, singer, sex symbol and style icon Brigitte Bardot, who retired from acting and became controversial for her right-wing politics in her later years, has died. She was 91. \n\nBardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals, who confirmed the news to The Associated Press. No cause of death was provided, and arrangements for funeral or memorial services have not yet been announced. She had been hospitalized last month.\n\nIn the 1950s Bardot ignited an international zeal for boldly sexual European movies, often directed by her first husband, Roger Vadim, such as “And God Created Woman.” \n\t\nThough Bardot’s reign as a major box office draw was relatively brief, and she retired from films in the early ’70s, her influence was far-reaching: She made youthful, pouty, nubile blondes a staple in cinema, particularly in American movies, as opposed to a more mature, womanly blonde like Marilyn Monroe. Between Bardot and Audrey Hepburn, the rage for youth in female sexuality became entrenched in movies — and all media — and has never subsided.\nBardot (and Vadim) also opened the door on sexuality, for which foreign films became famous in the uptight America of the ’50s. This boldness of approach (if not of substance) would eventually catch on in the U.S. and other countries and signal an end to decades of censorship. By then Bardot had tried to cross over and attain the mantle of a serious actress with such films as Jean-Luc Godard’s “Contempt,” but met with only limited success.\nHer breakthrough came with “And God Created Woman,” written and directed by Vadim and released in late 1956 while her marriage to him was breaking up. The movie was only modestly successful in France but it took off overseas, earning $8.5 million around the world. New and older films by Bardot such as “Mam’zelle Pigalle,” “Please! Mr. Balzac” and “The Girl in the Bikini” (from 1952) all washed up on U.S. shores, solidifying Bardot as a sex goddess. In France she climbed to the top of the box office with films like “The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful,” “La Parisienne,” which brought out her lighter side; “The Night Heaven Fell,” “The Woman and the Puppet” and “In Case of Emergency.” \n\t\nIn 1959, Simone de Beauvoir wrote a treatise called “Brigitte Bardot and the Lolita Syndrome.” But by then, Bardot’s girlish sensuality was so well entrenched in the culture that it was not about to be dislodged by serious studies.\nAlready the country’s highest-paid film performer, Bardot tried to further prove herself an actress in “Babette Goes to War,” as a member of the French Resistance; Louis Malle’s “A Very Private Affair” and Henri-Georges Clouzot’s “La Verite” in 1960. She continued to work for Vadim during this period, long after he’d moved on to other actresses and she to her second husband, actor Jacques Charrier.\nGodard’s “Contempt,” in 1963, exploited her reputation and brilliantly commented on it. She also appeared in American-made films such as “Dear Brigitte” (in a cameo), about an 8-year-old who desperately wants to meet Bardot; and “Viva Maria,” directed by Malle in English and pairing her with Jeanne Moreau (Bardot received a BAFTA Award nomination for best foreign actress). Later in the ’60s she appeared in the Western “Shalako” with Sean Connery.\nBardot’s last two films, both made in 1973, were Nina Companeez’s “The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot” and the sad “Ms. Don Juan,” another pallid Vadim attempt to exploit her sexuality. The latter was released in the U.S. in 1976.\nShe was born to an upper-middle-class Parisian family. Early on she evidenced talent as a dancer, studying ballet and attended the Hattemer’s private school and then the Paris Conservatory. At age 15, at the recommendation of a friend, she modeled for the cover of Elle magazine, where she was seen by director Marc Allegret, who was looking for a new face for his film “The Laurels Are Cut.”\nThough she didn’t get the part, Allegret’s assistant, Vadim, took her under his wing and got her small roles in small films before marrying her in a much publicized 1952 event that helped promote the young would-be actress. More small roles followed in films, the first of which to be released in the U.S. was Anatole Litvak’s “An Act of Love” (1953), which starred Kirk Douglas but was shot in France. She then appeared in Allegret’s film “Future Stars” and got her first lead in a chapter of the English Doctor series, “Doctor at Sea.” She next worked with legendary French director Rene Clair in “The Grand Maneuver” (1956) before starring in “And God Created Woman.”\n\t\nIn addition to her film work, Bardot also recorded some 80 songs, some quite popular, mostly in the 1960s and ’70s.\nShe did not, however, work in movies again, and in 2010 the former actress expressed outrage over rumors that an American-made biopic about her was in the works.\nBardot would nevertheless remain a media star, in part because of her numerous love affairs, advocacy for animals and zeal for right-wing politics. In 1986 she created the Brigitte Bardot Foundation. Her efforts in the service of animal rights brought her the French Legion of Honor (she refused it), and Bardot was not unwilling to protest or even be arrested to protect four-legged creatures. But she also drew fines imposed by French courts for inciting racial hatred after repeatedly making controversial remarks in which she criticized immigration to France and Muslims in particular.\nBardot was married to German playboy Gunter Sachs in the late 1960s, and she married wealthy industrial Bernard d’Ormale, a supporter of the far right in France, in 1993.\nBardot is survived by d’Ormale; a son from her marriage to Charrier; and two granddaughters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron’s sci-fi threequel “Avatar: Fire and Ash” remained comfortably atop the domestic box office over the Christmas stretch. Meanwhile a trio of new holiday releases, A24’s sports dramedy “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical tear-jerker “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s action comedy “Anaconda,” helped keep multiplexes bustling… but they weren’t enough to fend off the Disney animated sequel “Zootopia 2,” which returned to No. 2 in its fifth weekend of release.\n\t\n\n\t“Avatar 3” added a solid $64 million over the traditional weekend and $88 million since the Christmas holiday on Thursday. The three-day figure is a scant 28% decline from its $89 million domestic debut, a stronger hold than its predecessor, 2022’s “The Way of Water,” which dropped by 52% after a larger $134 million debut. So far, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” has generated $217.7 million in North America and $760 million worldwide after two weekends of release. Based on past precedent, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” should stick around at the top of box office charts well into the new year. After all, the first two “Avatar” films were No. 1 for seven consecutive weekends, eventually earning well over $2 billion each.\n\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” enjoyed the best debut among newcomers in third place with $17.4 million from 2,600 theaters over the weekend and $27.1 million through the four-day holiday frame. Domestic ticket sales stand at $28.3 million after a weekend in limited release. The three-day figure marks the second-biggest opening weekend to date for A24, the beloved indie behind “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “Hereditary” and “Lady Bird.” Alex Garland’s “Civil War” remains the studio’s best debut with $25 million over the traditional three-day weekend. \n\t\n\n\tFor “Marty Supreme,” the stellar start can be attributed to director Josh Safdie for making a movie that’s resonating with audiences, as well as star Timothée Chalamet, who plays a fictional tennis table champ and has been a one-man marketing machine, going to great lengths — and heights — to get out the word about the original film. A24 spent roughly $70 million to produce “Marty Supreme,” which is expected to remain a box office draw due to positive reviews and great word-of-mouth. Moviegoers — roughly 65% of whom were 35 or younger — gave the R-rated film a “B+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls. That’s a far better reception than the “C+” grade that was bestowed upon Safdie’s prior film, the deeply unsettling “Uncut Gems.”\n\n\t“Sports dramas are not big movies to begin with, but the right cast can elevate them,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. He’s referring to films like “F1: The Movie,” starring Brad Pitt, and “Air,” led by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. “Timothée Chalamet is making that kind of difference.”\n\n\t“Anaconda” landed at No. 5 with $14.6 million over the weekend and $23.7 million since Christmas. The movie also opened internationally with $20 million for a global start of $43.7 million. A $45 million-budgeted meta-reboot, “Anaconda” stars Jack Black and Paul Rudd as best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie, 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down. Critics and audiences were mixed on “Anaconda,” which has a 51% Rotten Tomatoes average and “B” grade on CinemaScore.\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue” opened in eighth place with $7.6 million over the weekend and $12 million through the four-day holiday frame. Craig Brewer directed the $30 million-budgeted movie, featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in the true story of two down-on-their luck musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band. Opening weekend crowds dug the film, which earned an “A” grade on CinemaScore, the best marks among the new releases. In terms of ticket buyers, 65% were female, while 53% of audiences were above the age of 55.\n\n\t“This is a crowd-pleaser, and word-of-mouth should build now among older moviegoers, who take their time getting to the cinema,” Gross says.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Disney’s animated juggernaut “Zootopia 2” outpaced the newcomers with $20 million over the weekend and $25.2 million since Christmas on Thursday. Since its debut around Thanksgiving, the PG film has generated $320 million domestically and $1.42 billion globally, making “Zootopia 2” the highest-grossing Hollywood release of the year.\n\n\tAnother holdover, Lionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid,” notched the No. 4 spot with $15.4 million over the weekend and $18.9 million through the four-day holiday period. The film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has earned an impressive $46.6 million domestically and $64.9 million worldwide to date.\n\n\tWith three days left in 2025, the overall domestic box office is sitting at $8.76 billion, just 1.5% ahead of last year and roughly 22% behind 2019, according to Comscore. Annual revenues through Dec. 31 are projected to wind up at $8.87 billion.\n\n\t“‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’ and ‘Zootopia 2’ and the impressive nationwide expansion of ‘Marty Supreme’ helped to power a very strong end of year push,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian.\n\n\tIn the end, though, the elusive $9 billion benchmark remains out of reach for yet another year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndian actor Sheena Chohan, who made her Hindi-language feature film debut in the biopic “Sant Tukaram” earlier this year, has been cast as the lead in “Arjunanin Allirani,” a Tamil-language drama centered on folk artists and caste discrimination.\n\n\tThe film, written by acclaimed Tamil author B. Jeyamohan and directed by Vino Vikraman Pillai (“Kafir”), will feature music by legendary composer Ilaiyaraaja. The project marks Chohan’s entry into Tamil cinema after acting across Malayalam, Hindi and international productions.\n\t\n\n\t“Arjunanin Allirani” follows two impoverished artists — a folk dance performer and a Dalit singer — whose relationship forms the heart of the narrative. The story traces the female lead’s journey through family tragedy and her eventual pursuit of justice through her art.\n\n\n\tIn the film, produced by Irfan Khan for EBG Films, Chohan will portray Rani, a character whose arc spans from her teenage years to middle age across four distinct life phases. The role requires extensive martial arts training, including Chilambattam, a traditional Tamil stick-fighting technique.\n\n\t“Rani is a young woman who spends her formative years immersed in devotion, singing hymns to God in temples,” Pillai tells Variety. “Beginning with the vibrancy and innocence of her twenties, her life unfolds across four distinct phases, tracing her journey from youth to middle age. To authentically portray this evolution, the actress taking on the role must master martial arts, including Chilambattam. As the narrative moves through different eras, the character undergoes significant physical and emotional transformations, requiring the actress to adapt her appearance and presence accordingly.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director says that casting Chohan was “entirely serendipitous.” “From our very first conversation, I was struck by her deep passion and dedication to her craft,” he says. “When I shared the story of Allirani, she showed a genuine and immediate interest. The character of Rani is a powerful and resilient woman, whose journey spans from her teenage years to middle age. The role also demands extensive martial arts sequences, a challenge Sheena is exceptionally well suited for, given her many years of training and experience in martial arts.”\n\n\tFor Chohan, the role aligns with her longstanding commitment to socially grounded material. “I did so much theatre and acting training, that it’s a waste to do a flat character,” she tells Variety. “Also, if you have your acting skills sharpened, you can, and should, give what appears to be a one-note character more depth – of course the most important thing is to be a blank page for your director and give them what they want for the story, but no real people are shallow and morally simple, so I don’t like any of my characters to be.”\n\n\tChohan, who serves as United for Human Rights South Asia Ambassador, adds that her human rights advocacy has directly influenced her project choices. “I turn down so many films because of derogatory or degrading roles,” she says. “But the good news is that the industry is changing – with all of the good work of women like the Women’s Collective in Kerala, and women and men across the country and world pushing against discrimination – new characters and stories are being written which show women as equal citizens – real-life, breathing, thinking humans, not just pretty Christmas tree decorations.”\n\n\tChohan’s recent work includes Aditya Om’s “Sant Tukaram,” in which she portrayed Avali Jijabai opposite the title character in the Hindi biopic. The film was widely described as showcasing her quiet power and emotional depth. She describes her performance approach as rooted in thorough character research and technique developed during intensive training at The Acting Center in Los Angeles while working on the Hollywood film “Nomad.”\n\n\t“What I learned was how to develop a character in terms of understanding their inner thoughts and motivations overall and in each scene,” she says. “So, while I read and watched everything connected to Avali Jijabai, including having the original 17th century historical texts read to me and working and eating with the village women who still work the fields Avali worked in, I then used all of that gathered information to truly understand and fit into her character, so that my reactions were natural.”\n\t\n\n\tReflecting on her Hindi debut, Chohan notes the significance of seeing the film play across theaters in Mumbai, where she is based. “After doing five years of theater, training in my craft, martial arts and dance in Kolkata, I shifted to Mumbai keeping it as a base but working pan India in different languages with legendary directors nationally and internationally,” she says. “But living in Mumbai, it was deeply special to see ‘Sant Tukaram’ playing across theatres here and release nationwide. Having friends and colleagues join me at the Mumbai – national premiere did feel like an arrival. But creatively, it was never a reset – it was a continuation.”\n\n\tThe actor has also completed J.D. Chakravarthy’s pan-India thriller “Jatasya Maranam Dhruvam,” in which she plays a police officer. “I literally followed a policewoman around into her dangerous job, in her home life – I did so much to get into the head-space of that character, and that too in such a dark, complex thriller, that I can only feel what I brought to the character gave the director an insight that he was desperate for,” she says.\n\n\tHer upcoming slate includes the VFX-heavy streaming series “Bhaayava,” in which she portrays Lilith. The platform has not yet been locked as the production team completes extensive visual effects work. “I went from playing the wife of a saint, to a devil, and perhaps that’s what made me take the role – it was so different – I went from the most simple scenes in fields where we’ve worked in saris for a thousand years, to being flung out of a car in a harness for a flying scene after five hours of prosthetics in front of one of the biggest green screens in Mumbai,” she says. “However, again, the character was so rich – Lilith was Adam’s first wife in the bible – she was banished from Eden for refusing to be dominated by and obey every word from Adam – so that was a character I had to sink my teeth into.”\n\n\tChohan’s international credits include “Ant Story” (2013) directed by Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, which played at the Shanghai and Dubai International Film Festivals. She has also appeared alongside Madhuri Dixit in Netflix series “The Fame Game” (2022) and Kajol in JioHotstar show “The Trial” (2023). \n\n\tHer career began with a debut opposite Mammootty in the Malayalam-language film “The Train” (2011), directed by Jayaraj. Reflecting on her work with renowned actors including Mammootty, Dixit and Kajol, Chohan notes how different directors have shaped her approach. “Acting in India has changed a lot since I was launched by Mammootty – what my director Jayaraj wanted in terms of restraint on the set of ‘The Train’ was quite opposite to what Suparn Varma wanted on the set of ‘The Trial,'” she says. “For Jayaraj I was much more expressive but for Suparn I had to keep it subtle and do so much character research to get into her mind and be my character, without ‘acting.’ What I learned from these legends in terms of command and screen presence in many ways tie in with professionalism – they are really there, doing what they’re doing while they’re doing it.”\n\t\n\n\tOn balancing wider reach through big platforms versus roles that leave a lasting cultural impact, Chohan says, “What I care most about is character and story, so that’s what matters most, but of course, a rich, nuanced character in a well-told, original, larger-than-life, rooted story, that reaches the whole world – that’s the dream – and I want to live the dream.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMarina Zenovich‘s “I’m Chevy Chase, and You’re Not” is not your average celebrity documentary. From the film’s outset, it is clear that the 82-year-old comedian had zero editorial control over the project.\n\n\tA minute into the CNN doc, Zenovich (“Lance,” “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind”) can be heard off camera saying to Chase, “I’m just trying to figure you out.”\n\n\tHis response: “No shit. It’s not going to be easy for you.”\n\t\n\n\t“Why is it not going to be easy?” Zenovich asks.\n\n\n\t“You’re not bright enough,” Chase deadpans. “How’s that?” Then the comedian grins.\n\n\tZenovich says that while she was taken aback by Chase’s response, she was also relieved.\n\n\t“I’d never done an interview where someone was so rude to me,” Zenovich tells Variety. “But I was so worried going into that first interview with him about how I was going to say to him, like, ‘Everyone thinks you’re an asshole.’ I thought if I did, he would throw me out of his house. So the minute he said that to me, I had a way in.”\n\n\tThe doc, premiering Jan. 1 on CNN, charts Chase’s rise from breakout “Saturday Night Live” to leading man, his three marriages, his addiction to cocaine and alcohol, heart failure that led to a coma, childhood abuse, depression, a failed talk show, and the star’s various on-set disputes with actors like Terry Sweeney and the entire cast of  the NBC comedy “Community.”\n\n\t“I wanted to figure out who was the real person behind the conflicted, guarded and somewhat fragile man we see on camera,” Zenovich says. “What was behind the surface of his slightly intimidating superstar bravado? Was there any self-awareness there? Having interviewed Chevy at length, I have to say that yes, it’s all there – and a whole lot of pain and heartache too.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Chase and his family, the doc includes revealing interviews with the star’s former collaborators and confidants, including Mike Ovitz, Dan Aykroyd, Beverly D’Angelo, Goldie Hawn, Lorne Michaels, Ryan Reynolds and Martin Short.\n\n\tVariety spoke with Zenovich and her husband, and long-time producing partner P.G. Morgan, about why Chase decided to make the doc and getting someone, anyone, from “Community” to give an interview.\n\n\tYou have worked together on quite a few docs about celebrities, including “Lance,” about Lance Armstrong, “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,” “Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic,” “Jerry Brown: The Disrupter,” and “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired.” Where does Chevy Chase rate on the difficulty meter?\n\n\tZenovich: When I first sat down with Lance Armstrong, he was sitting at the edge of a seat and ready to spar with me. That is exciting because you don’t know what you’re going get. Then I did Jerry Brown, whom I tried to do that wit,h but he had no interest whatsoever. So, each person is different. Chevy was willing to go there, but he would stop himself. He wouldn’t go all the way. The interviews with him were very hard.\n\n\tMorgan: There were a lot of unknowns going into the interviews. Chevy is incredibly quick-witted and always on, so you have to be able to go toe-to-toe with him. He’s a bit intimidating as well, and we had a lot of stuff that we wanted to talk to him about – the good stuff and the touchy stuff.\n\n\tWhen it comes to celebrity documentaries, the celebrity is usually promoting something like a tour, a fashion line or a book. Chase wasn’t promoting anything. Why do you think he wanted to make this film, which isn’t exactly a flattering portrait of him?\n\n\tZenovich:  Someone wrote a book about him, and I don’t think that [Chase’s] family liked it. I think they were trying to right a wrong. I don’t know if they think that they did because it has been hard. [The doc] was a hard watch for him and his family, but I think in the end they appreciate it.\n\n\tMorgan: I’m guessing that they felt as a family that he wasn’t getting his due. That there’s been a whole run of these documentaries about other people from his generation. I think it hurt that he hadn’t had the same recognition.\n\n\tDo you think that the people who said no to interviews, like Steve Martin and Christopher Guest, were really saying, ‘We don’t like the guy’?\n\t\n\n\tZenovich: I can’t answer for them, but I think that the absences speak for themselves. Whether it’s scheduling, personal, or saving it for their own doc. In the end, I think we got the right mix of people. I was initially disappointed that we didn’t get more people from “Community,” but there are things people don’t want to talk about.\n\n\tHow hard was it to get anyone from “Community” to sit down with you?\n\n\tEvery single person said no. I ran into (“Community” creator) Dan Harmon at a screening of “Deaf President Now!” and I got his number. I was so excited. I thought it was going to happen but then he declined. I was so lucky to get Jay Chandrasekhar (“Community” director). He has such an amazing delivery and he was willing to go there. If Jay had said no, I would have been screwed.\n\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase, and You’re Not” premieres Thursday, Jan. 1, on CNN. The film streams live for pay TV subscribers via CNN.com, CNN Connected TV and mobile apps on Jan. 1. \n",

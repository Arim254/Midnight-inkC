    "body": "\n\tCannes Critics’ Week has unveiled Next Step Studio Indonesia, marking a significant expansion of its talent development programs for 2026. \n\n\tThe venture, created in partnership with production companies KawanKawan Media and DW, revives the spirit of La Factory – a filmmaker incubator that ran at Directors’ Fortnight beginning in 2013.\n\n\tUnder the new banner, four pairs of directors will collaborate on quartet of short films, each running 15 minutes. The lineup splits evenly between Indonesian talent and international helmers, with each duo sharing writing and directing duties. Financing comes entirely from Indonesian sources, and the finished works will debut at Critics’ Week with a dedicated “Next Step Presents” showcase. The screenings double as a marketplace opportunity, with participating directors presenting their debut or sophomore feature concepts to acquisition executives, sales agents and potential co-production partners.\n\t\n\n\tThe model builds on a decade of global outreach that has touched multiple continents. Previous iterations visited locations including Taiwan, Chile, Finland, Denmark, South Africa, Lebanon, Tunisia, the Balkans, northern Portugal, the Philippines and Brazil’s Ceará region. The track record shows more than 80 directors passing through the program, with close to 50 going on to complete their first features.\n\n\n\t“Our goal is all about using collaboration as a framework to launch not only stories from Indonesia, but also to introduce Southeast Asia talents and voices who can grow in the international stage in the future,” said Yulia Evina Bhara of KawanKawan Media, who is co-producing the inaugural edition. “We are thrilled that our company KawanKawanMedia is representing Indonesia to convey this spirit and deeply energized that La Semaine de la Critique shares the enthusiasm. We feel honored to collaborate with DW and La Semaine in this inaugural edition.”\n\t\n\n\tFunding for the Jakarta-based production comes from municipal authorities and Indonesian cultural institutions, with support from the French Embassy in Indonesia and the Institut français d’Indonésie. Bhara shares producing responsibilities with Dominique Welinski of DW, who developed the original Factory concept and continues as the program’s creative architect.\n\n\t“Next Step Studio marks a new start for the Factory program. Critics’ Week is the home for first and second features in Cannes. It’s a natural move, thanks Ava Cahen, Thomas Rosso, Remi Bigot and the whole team who are welcoming us with a shared enthusiasm,” Welinski said. “This first edition in Indonesia is already on its way, thanks to Yulia Evina Bhara, her partners and team, who have been working hard for the program to happen.”\n\n\tThe initiative extends beyond pure production, positioning itself as networking infrastructure for emerging filmmakers. By coupling the Cannes premiere with structured industry access, organizers hope to create visibility for participants while connecting Indonesian production capacity with international distribution channels. Post-Cannes, the shorts typically travel to major festivals including Sundance, Toronto and Clermont-Ferrand, with television broadcasters and streaming services frequently acquiring rights.\n\n\tNext Step Studio represents an evolution of Critics’ Week’s existing workshop programs, which focus on shepherding directors through the transition from short-form to feature-length work. While earlier iterations centered on filmmakers already selected for the festival’s short film competition, the new model welcomes outside projects and emphasizes cross-cultural exchange. Several international participants will have previous Next Step experience, creating mentorship opportunities within the cohort.\n\n\t“After Next Step in 2014 and Next Step II in 2023, we are delighted to continue developing our workshops with Next Step Studio,” said Thomas Rosso, director of Next Step. “A different formula but the same goal, at the heart of Critics’ Week’s mission: to discover and support new talent in world cinema, specifically here on their journey from short to feature film. It is a pleasure to welcome Dominique Welinski to the Next Step family and to collaborate with the talented Yulia Evina Bhara for this first stop in Indonesia: a way to gradually open our program to new horizons and new proposals, always in a spirit of exchange and experimentation.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew Zealand-based genre sales outfit Black Mandala has boarded “Hollywood Hells,” a thriller that takes aim at the entertainment industry’s dark side, ahead of the upcoming American Film Market (AFM).\n\n\t“When a struggling actress attends an exclusive Hollywood party, she discovers a cabal of power brokers who produce real-life snuff films for the elite. As she fights for her life in the shadowy underbelly of fame, she turns their own cameras against them—becoming not just a survivor, but the director of their final cut,” reads the synopsis from Black Mandala. “‘Hollywood Hells’ promises to deliver a razor-sharp critique of celebrity culture – where fame and death are part of the same performance.” \n\t\n\n\tThe cast includes Fernanda Romero, known for “The Curse of Wolf Mountain,” alongside Brian Austin Green, whose credits span “Golden,” “Desperate Housewives” and “Beverly Hills 90210.” Comedian Jiaoying Summers (“Hot Girl Summers: Comedy InvAsian,” “American Bistro”) and producer-actor Bruna Rubio (“Vampiras: The Brides,” “The House”) round out the ensemble.\n\n\n\tU.S.-based Goldheart Productions is the production company, adding to its portfolio of boundary-pushing genre fare following Sitges Festival bows for “Vampiras: The Brides” and “Mermaid Killer.” The film has played HorrorHound, Cinema Scares and Bloody Mirror, with more festival stops on deck.\n\n\tThe collaboration signals an expanding relationship between the two companies, which are already at work on another feature, “Abominable.”\n\n\tMichael Kraetzer and Nicolas Onetti launched Black Mandala in 2017, building it into a leading player in independent horror and genre distribution. Operating from Auckland, New Zealand, the outfit handles north of 100 titles and maintains a presence at Cannes, Berlin and AFM, championing visually striking material and cultivating ongoing relationships with genre filmmakers globally.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSarah Schweitzman has been named co-head of CAA Media Finance. \n\n\tThe sales agent will run the department alongside veteran Roeg Sutherland, overseeing the packaging and representation of independently financed film, television and digital content.\n\n\tSchweitzman began her career as an assistant at CAA before leaving to work for filmmaker Alex Kurtzman’s production company, Secret Hideout. She later landed executive positions at 21st Century Fox and Vendôme Pictures, where she worked on several films including “Source Code,” “Kingsman: The Secret Service,” “Spy,” “The Greatest Showman” and more.\n\t\n\n\tShe returned to the agency in 2017. In the media financing department, she helped filmmakers secure financing and distribution deals. Some of her clients include Nadine Labaki, Jennifer Kent, Pamela Adlon, Rebecca Zlotowski, Ladj Ly, Karim Aïnouz and Dakota Johnson’s TeaTime Pictures. She played roles in the sales and financing of notable recent films such as “Bugonia,” “Conclave,” “Hit Man,” “Coda,” “My Old Ass,” “Challengers,” “The Holdovers,” “The Last Showgirl” and “May December.”\n\n\n\tIn an official announcement, Sutherland said, “Sarah and I have worked together in various capacities over the years. She is brilliant and has impeccable taste. I have always admired her creativity and fierce advocacy for artist. When she joined us nearly a decade ago, she fit right in and immediately became an essential member of our CAA team. I could not be prouder or more excited to see her step into this new role.”\n\n\tSchweitzman’s ascension comes as she and Sutherland’s longtime colleague Ben Kramer departed CAA this year to pilot a new distribution division at indie mainstay Black Bear. \n",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Walter Hauser will soon play Chris Farley in Josh Gad‘s biopic about the legendary “Saturday Night Live” cast member, and “The Naked Gun” star has called out who he wants to play Lorne Michaels.\n\n\tWhile speaking with Variety‘s Marc Malkinon Wednesday night at the AFI Fest opening night premiere of “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” Hauser said he wants Sam Rockwell to play the “SNL” mastermind.\n\n\n\t“I have some ideas for who to cast for Lorne,” Hauser said. “I really want Sam Rockwell to play Lorne Michaels, which I don’t think I’ve told anyone yet.”\n\t\n\n\tHauser then addressed his pitch directly to Rockwell.\n\n\t“Sam Rockwell, please play Lorne Michaels in my Chris Farley movie,” he added. “You love being around me when I do my Farley impression anyway, so I’ll do Matt Foley all day for you and make you laugh. It’ll be fun.”\n\n\tIf Hauser gets his wish, it would mark the second collaboration between Rockwell and himself after Clint Eastwood’s 2019 drama “Richard Jewell.”\n\n\tEarlier in the interview, Hauser shared that he recently received the “latest draft” of the script from “500 Days of Summer” screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, which he called “the best” yet. He added that shooting could begin as soon as “early to middle of next year” and that production is just waiting on that “elusive greenlight” from New Line and Warner Bros.\n\n\tThe Farley biopic was first unveiled in April of 2024. While plot details remain under wraps, the film is based on the New York Times best-selling biography “The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts” by Tom Farley Jr. (Farley’s brother) and Tanner Colby.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIreland’s submission for the Academy Awards will receive its London premiere at the opening night of the Women and the World International Film Festival, which kicks off Nov. 6 with a star-studded gala featuring Sophie Windsor, Duchess of Edinburgh.\n\n\t“Sanatorium,” directed by Gar O’Rourke, is Ireland’s entry for the best international feature film category. The documentary explores themes of memory and renewal within a former Soviet sanatorium near war-torn Odessa.\n\t\n\n\tThe Nov. 6-12 festival will open with a ceremony featuring Windsor, newly appointed as a festival ambassador, presenting the Women of Global Impact Award before the “Sanatorium” screening.\n\n\n\t“We are proud to announce that Lady Sophie Windsor is becoming an ambassador of the festival,” said festival director Ksenia Bugrimova. “We know Sophie as someone who deeply cares about social issues and uses her voice to support meaningful causes. As an actress, public figure and member of the British Royal Family, her values and work perfectly align with the mission of our festival, which celebrates and supports women in cinema. It is a great honour and joy for us to welcome Sophie to the festival.”\n\n\tThis year’s program features films from Ukraine, Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., Japan, China, Latin America and across Europe, exploring themes ranging from war and cancer to identity and domestic violence.\n\n\t“For us, it is not only about celebrating women’s creativity in cinema, but also about recognising women as agents of change and security. This mission is both personal and vital,” said co-founder Mariia Vynogradova.\n\t\n\n\tThe 2025 jury includes Peter Straughan (“Conclave,” “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy”), Daniel Ings (“The Gentlemen,” “The Crown”), Tamara Lawrance (“The Silent Twins,” “Time”), Victoria Emslie (“Downton Abbey,” “12 Monkeys,” “Grace”), Diem Camille (“The Wheel of Time,” “Alien: Earth”), Bugrimova and Elizabeth McIntyre (ScreenCraft Works, former Sheffield Doc/Fest director).\n\n\tThe festival is organized by Talented U Limited, a London-based cultural platform and production team founded by Ukrainian producers in 2022. The nonprofit connects filmmakers, journalists and creatives from more than 12 countries, presenting Ukrainian stories to British and global audiences.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA week after KCRW pink slipped long-running DJs Jason Kramer, Jeremy Sole, José Galvan, Travis Holcombe and Valida in a cost-cutting move, the station has announced shows from three new hosts.\n\n\tJoining the station are Luxxury, John Tejada and Peanut Butter Wolf, who premiere the weekend of Oct. 31. “They’re not just incredible DJs; they’re artists with their own creative worlds and communities, and they’re bringing that energy straight to KCRW,” said KCRW music director Alejandro Cohen in an email to listeners. \n\t\n\n\tThe switch comes as KCRW last week said it would cut 10% of its staff and adjust its schedule in light of the Trump administration’s elimination of public broadcasting funding — which has impacted all public radio and TV stations, like KCRW. \n\n\n\tLuxxury — real name Blake Robin — hosts the popular podcast “One Song” with Diallo Riddle. (He’s also known for whispering “INTERPOLATION” on TikTok.) The artist, producer and DJ is “known for blending classic songwriting with modern production,” KCRW noted. His show will air on a more rock-focused Friday night, which also includes a continuing show from legendary rocker Henry Rollins.\n\n\tTejada is described as “a globally respected DJ, producer, and composer” who “brings decades of influence in techno and electronic music. His refined style bridges the experimental and the familiar, connecting underground innovation with sounds that move listeners.” His show will air on Saturdays, along with DJ Silva and Jason Bentley’s “Metropolis,” as that night focuses on dance music.\n\n\tPeanut Butter Wolf, real name Chris Manak, is the founder of Stones Throw Records. His show will air on Sunday nights, which will be focused on soul, R&B, hip-hop and jazz. Manak’s Sunday show will air along with one from LeRoy Downs.\n\t\n\n\tHolcombe had hosted the weeknight show “Freaks Only”; with his departure, the station said Monday through Thursday nights will include rebroadcasts of some of the weekend shows mentioned above.\n\n\tKCRW president Jennifer Ferro had hinted at a change in another email to listeners last week: “These decisions were made after careful consideration of how best to position us against the twin challenges of needing to adapt to how people consume media today as well as the loss of federal dollars. You’ll notice some programming changes too,” she said. “Look for a new on-air music schedule in the coming weeks with new DJs and a new lineup.”\n\n\tHere’s Cohen’s email to listeners:\n\n\tKCRW has always been about exploration, that simple joy of stumbling upon a song or sound that opens up something inside you. That spirit of curiosity and connection is what’s driving our next chapter.\n\n\tWe’re evolving our programming to reflect the pulse of Los Angeles, a city that never stops creating, experimenting, and pushing culture forward. You’ll still hear the voices you know and love, like Novena Carmel, Jason Bentley, and Henry Rollins, alongside new shows from LUXXURY, John Tejada, and Peanut Butter Wolf. They’re not just incredible DJs; they’re artists with their own creative worlds and communities, and they’re bringing that energy straight to KCRW.\n\n\tWe’re always giving space to new sounds, new ideas, and new connections while staying rooted in what’s always made KCRW special: real people, real stories, and a deep love for music.\n\n\tWhile we are making these changes and introducing new voices and tastes to you, we want to give our heartfelt appreciation to the DJs who are departing. Jason Kramer, Jeremy Sole, José Galvan, Travis Holcombe, and Valida have dedicated years to KCRW and all of you who listen.\n\n\tWe are so grateful to be with you on this journey.\n\n\tAlejandro CohenKCRW Music Director\n",

    "body": "\n\tElectronic Arts will shut down “The Sims Mobile” next January, seven years and more than 50 updates after the game launched.\n\n\t“First, we want to say thank you,” the “Sims Mobile” team said in a blog posted to the EA website Sunday. “The Sims Mobile and The Sims community as a whole are full of creativity, kindness, and imagination. You’ve amazed us with your stories, builds, and Sims. We’re proud to have shared this journey with you, and as a token of our appreciation, we’ve prepared a few surprises as we head into TSM’s final chapter.”\n\t\n\n\tBefore the game is sunset on Jan. 20, EA is rolling out one final update for “The Sims Mobile” in the coming months. The first part of the update launched Monday. However, “The Sims Mobile” was delisted from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store on Tuesday, so it is no longer available for new downloads, only for users who already have “The Sims Mobile” installed or have previously downloaded it.\n\n\n\t“The Sims Mobile” shutdown comes on the heels of EA announcing it will be going from a publicly traded company to a privately held. The buyout deal, valued at $55 billion, is with several investors, including private-equity firms Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners. \n\n\t“The Sims” franchise as a whole is still alive and well at EA, with a new update for “The Sims 4” released in September and ongoing plans for a new “Sims” game that will explore online multiplayer features.\n\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.\n\t\n\t\tNEW RELEASES\t\n\n\t“Jurassic World Evolution 3” launched Tuesday from Frontier Developments in collaboration with Universal Products & Experiences across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. \n\t\n\n\tPer the official description for the title, “players can delve into a game franchise first that brings adorable juvenile dinosaurs and a comprehensive breeding system, take on an epic global campaign that spans multiple stunning locations around the world, and shape their parks like never before with powerful creative tools.”\n\n\n\n\n\t*\n\n\tThe Sandbox has unveiled “San Junipero,” a new simulated experience based off of Netflix’s “Black Mirror” episode of the same name. The experience will be released on Oct. 22 to play on PC and Mac. \n\n\tPlayers will immerse themselves through a first-person, interactive journey where unforgettable locations, mind-bending themes of simulated reality and emotional twists await.

    "body": "\n\tThe soundtrack of the Netflix rom-com “Nobody Wants This” is positively littered with Top 40 hits. Season 2 features instantly recognizable syncs from Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX — songs deployed not for their thematic resonance (XCX’s “Apple,” a song about generational trauma and mother-daughter relationships, plays over a group of friends goofing off at a bar), but for a blunt-force catchiness that keeps the mood light. This approach to music curation of course reflects the show’s status as a bona fide hit with the resources to match. It also encapsulates the series’ house style. For its follow-up, “Nobody Wants This” remains the TV equivalent of an earworm that gets stuck in your head, even if the song’s substance leaves no lasting impact and the melody itself is borderline irritating.\n\t\n\n\tAt least Season 2 removes some of the obstacles that made the original setup a guiltier pleasure than it had to be. In depicting the romance between narcissistic podcaster Joanne (Kristen Bell) and “Hot Rabbi” Noah (Adam Brody), a flirtation that unfolds across the eastern half of L.A., “Nobody Wants This” drew criticism for its depiction of Jewish women as adversarial foils. The deeply goyish Joanne starts to weigh religious conversion as her relationship with Noah gets more serious, an intriguing internal conflict the show illustrated with external obstacles like Noah’s mother Bina (Tovah Feldshuh) and sister-in-law Esther (Jackie Tohn). Esther refers to Joanne’s sister and co-host Morgan (Justine Lupe) as “Whore No. 2,” which tells you all you need to know about her and Bina’s characterization: as domineering bullies who nag the men around them into doing their bidding. “Nobody Wants This” is loosely based on the life story of creator Erin Foster, a quasi-influencer who’s a convert herself, and seemed to reflect a mismatch of empathy between Foster’s fictional surrogate and these stereotyped others.\n\t\n\n\tBut the new showrunners of “Nobody Wants This,” “Girls” alumni Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan, know a thing or two about making captivating TV out of self-centered urbanites. Over the first few episodes of Season 2, they recalibrate the show’s status quo: Esther gets to have a heart when her marriage to Noah’s brother Sasha (Timothy Simons) hits some bumps in the road; Bina is nudged into the background, albeit somewhat abruptly. (She gets a menacing, episode-ending line about her intent to drive Noah and Joanne apart that’s never really followed up on.) Joanne even gets a Jewish childhood frenemy, Abby Kaplan (Brody’s real-life partner Leighton Meester), retconning some basic familiarity with the tribe for a woman who previously claimed not to know what Shabbat was. It’s enough to cross “weird issue with Jewish women” off the show’s list of problems, even if that list still has some action items on it.\n\n\t“Nobody Wants This” also starts to spread the wealth of dysfunction a little more equally. Noah was at first an idealized fantasy. Now, his people-pleasing tendencies are developed into a full-on character flaw, one that presents both challenges and opportunities for growth. Joanne learns Noah has a history of making grand romantic gestures regardless of how he actually feels about who he’s dating, because it’s what he thinks boyfriends are supposed to do — a conflict with far more heft than the garden-variety miscommunication that tends to generate plot on these kinds of shows. In the professional sphere, Noah finally stands up for himself when he’s passed over for the head rabbi job at his longtime employer Temple Chai, quitting rather than agreeing to play second fiddle to a man who, adding insult to injury, is also Rabbi Noah (Alex Karpovsky — I told you this is a “Girls” reunion!). \n\n\tThese changes certainly give “Nobody Wants This” more depth than it had in Season 1, but that’s not quite the same as going deep. This is still a low-stakes sitcom designed for second-screening and handing out paychecks to an entire class of comedic actors. (Kate Berland, Seth Rogen and Lauren Weedman join Karpovsky and Meester on the cameo roster.) Morgan finally gets a romantic relationship of her own, with a boundary-challenged therapist she still reflexively calls Dr. Andy (Arian Moayed, Lupe’s former castmate on “Succession); her previous marriage and divorce still remain unexplored, which after two full seasons feels more like oversight than intentional mystery.\n\t\n\n\tWatching “Nobody Wants This,” I found it hard not to think about “Long Story Short,” another Netflix comedy with Judaism at its core. “Long Story Short” is unusual in how it treats being Jewish as a spiritual practice and not just fodder for, say, Purim theme episodes. (You’d expect the latter from the cartoon and the former from the show with an actual rabbi as co-protagonist, but it’s a wild world we’re living in!) Noah’s search for a new professional home gives “Nobody Wants This” slightly more to work with in defining his personal faith, and the cultural references in Season 2 are a little less surface-level than “shalom.” Yet the show’s largest question marks, over whether Joanne will convert and if Noah can accept that she may not choose to, still feel unmoored from any broader religious reckoning. They’re a setup for this particular couple’s teary goodbyes and stirring speeches — which isn’t a spoiler for Season 2, because it’s exactly how Season 1 plays out, too.\n\n\tAll the objections listed above, however, occurred to me as I was binging the season at the speed of light. The same issues that keep “Nobody Wants This” from being a nuanced, meaningful story are also the ones that keep it airy enough to gobble up like popcorn. You’ll never be emotionally overcome enough to need to take a beat between chapters, which keeps the engagement metrics right where Netflix likes them. Bell and Brody are pros who can make cutesy banter in their sleep; with Konner and Kaplan at the helm, they’re now supported by fellow veterans savvy enough to keep out of their leads’ way. “Nobody Wants This” is a more refined version of itself in Season 2. The self in question is just fundamentally slight and not especially ambitious. \n\n\tSeason 2 of “Nobody Wants This” is now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “If Then,” the sixth episode of “The Morning Show” Season 4, now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tLadies and gentleman, Stella Bak has left the building. And the country. And the show.\n\n\tIn the sixth episode of the” fourth season of “The Morning Show,” the tech genius turned news division leader at UBN played by Greta Lee saw the carefully curated and swiftly ascendant life she built for herself come crashing down on top of her –– in front of 200 journalists, her boss Celine (Marion Cotillard) and the rest of the world.\n\t\n\n\t“For me, this was that moment before an explosion,” Lee tells Variety. “It’s all of the centrifugal force that’s been piling up after years and years of having to operate a certain way. She has gotten quite savvy since the day she first arrived, but I think that it’s clear — or it was clear to me — that it’s not sustainable.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s been one stumble after another this season for the woman who was first introduced to audiences in Season 2 as an intimidating problem-solver who’d sold her tech business and carved out a place for herself at a leading news network where women didn’t often find themselves in the C-Suite. But this season, Stella put everything on the line for her supposedly groundbreaking AI program (mind you, this is taking place in spring 2024) that can translate UBN’s popular anchors into any language ahead of the network’s global coverage of the Paris Olympics. But in the sixth episode, Stella’s crisis of conscious over her decision to not promote her friend Mia (Karen Pittman) because of pressures to elevate her male counterpart; Mia’s defiant return in which she declares Stella to be an enemy of the very progress she has long championed; and her ongoing affair with Miles (Aaron Pierre), Celine’s husband, leave Stella adrift.\n\t\n\n\tIn her voiceover across the episode, she laments that she has given in to the toxic pull of her “inner straight white guy” by doing what he would do –– “I fell into bed with the one person who could blow up his life.” While Miles isn’t the only thing putting pressure on the detonator, it doesn’t help the situation when she and Celine take the stage to present their ambitious Olympics coverage plan to the media. Hoping to distract the headline-hungry press from the network’s various other scandals, Stella rolls out a demonstration of her AI program, using her own manufactured image, despite telling Celine it isn’t ready. Unfortunately, her worst fear comes true when it not only malfunctions on stage, but regurgitates all the hurtful, racist and damning things Stella had spoken into it (aka herself) the night before in a digital-age version of taking a look at the mirror and asking if you like what you see.\n\n\tThe PR nightmare leaves Stella no choice but to resign. She initially retreats into the arms of Miles, and they resolve to run away to Naples together. But when she arrives at the airport with a hopeful smile and more time on her hands than usual, he texts her a simple “I’m sorry.” She gets on the plane anyway, and even Lee doesn’t know what awaits her on the other side.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“This is the end for her, as far as I know,” Lee says, confirming her exit, at least from Season 4. “But of course, since the show is so prescient and a direct commentary on what’s happening, I would love to see what kind of world would exist where she comes back, and what she might have to say.”\n\n\tStella’s undoing wasn’t a spiral contained to Season 4, though. Lee is of the camp that her downfall (at least professionally) started last season when she endured an excruciating lunch with a pair of slimy corporate investors. In order to gain their support and money, they forced her to command a waitress (also a woman of color) to lick a spilled drink off the table to prove she was one of the boys. Lee says Stella never recovered from compromising her ideals so irreversibly in that moment.\n\n\t“But I’m hoping she will now get a chance to,” she adds. “I think that’s part of the problem for her. It’s like she hasn’t been afforded the opportunity to reflect or to forgive or even, in a lot of ways, acknowledge in a bigger way some of the things she’s endured and done in order to get to where she is. So I’m hoping she’s doing that on a beach somewhere.”\n\t\n\n\tThe implosion of Stella’s image, literally thanks to her own AI, is two-fold. It exposed her own deep concerns about the ways she has contributed to the company’s stunted progress for people and women of color at the network (Mia scolds her earlier for this, saying, “You’re not one of us — you never were.”). But her AI also talks about her affair with Miles –– right in front of Celine. The French CEO uses it to immediately take Stella out, corporately speaking.\n\n\tThe AI version of Stella presented in the series wasn’t quite the leap forward in technology that Hollywood fears and reviles, but rather just another task handed to Lee this season.\n\n\t“Initially, I had to read opposite myself,” she says of the filming process. “The reality of what we’re doing is we’re showing tech that is developing as we speak. You see all the pitfalls of it, and how dangerous it can be if these guardrails aren’t put into place. So when I was doing it, it was a mess. I was doing a combination of reading with someone on script, and then also an image of myself that was like not quite the final product. Then going back and seeing what they generated and being totally weirded out by it — because trying to have any sort of the timing, comedic or dramatic, with a non-sentient representation of yourself is very weird.”\n\n\tBut she couldn’t just play herself. Lee and the creative team worked to find ways to make the AI present as technologically perfect, but also make sure the imperfections of AI were still on full display.\n\n\t“We talked at length about how many blinks we were gonna do and blinking in the wrong place and how funny that is, because there are limits to the avatars,” she says. “That is what is so uncanny about them and why, arguably, they will never be good humans. There are certain qualities that are impossible to nail. So, yeah, we did get to play with a lot of that, and we had a lot of laughs.”\n\n\tWhen she is betrayed by her own likeness, Stella can only look out onto a shocked audience, and happens to find a familiar –– albeit, not friendly –– face among them. Mia is watching from the nosebleed seats, and Stella has to process that moment through her as well. The two have been apprehensive advocates for each other over the past two seasons, and this season Stella vowed to go to bat for Mia’s bid for news director. But when she recanted on that to further her own ambition with AI and the network, Mia became the embodiment of Stella’s failings, one that haunts this scene like a ghost of what might have been.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“That moment was so fully loaded because she knows that there’s a betrayal between them, the kind that you can’t come back from,” Lee says. “For each of them and for so long, the option to fail was something that just never existed. Like, it just wasn’t possible. So to experience the pinnacle of failure in such a public way and have Mia be a witness to that, is almost too much to bear. That exchange, that wordless exchange across that room, is like a hundred words being said between the two of them.”\n\n\tDuring the entire episode, Mia, Miles and Celine have all told Stella in one way or another why her decisions have set herself up for failure. With Miles especially, he admonishes her for choosing a man she could never truly have, despite their impassioned pleas to choose each other over his comfortable life and her career. However, his rejection of her at the airport in the execution of said plan may be the deepest cut in Stella’s no good, very bad day. She is left broken, unsure if she should still get on the plane or try to mend the wreckage in her wake.\n\n\tIn the final scene, Lee hesitates for a moment before letting Stella choose. \n\n\t“I think it’s a whole new sensation that she has literally never experienced before,” she says. “It’s a lot to process within a few moments. When she realizes Miles isn’t coming, she is taking stock and realizing she has nothing. But the surprising thing for her and someone like her is in that moment of realizing she’s got nothing, it sort of means she’s got everything. That’s the gift of the horrible circumstances that have fallen on her. She really is free. I think, arguably, that step toward the plane is the scariest thing she’s probably ever done in her life.”\n\n\tDon’t cry for Stella too much. Let’s not forget she sold her tech company for hundreds of millions, and had plenty of zeros on her paycheck before exiting stage left at UBN. So her next chapter will be very well-funded, even if her personal and professional lives are in shambles. But Stella has proven she is nothing if not resilient. The big question now is whether she will return to the show, as so many (maybe too many?) of UBN’s former execs have. Lee says she loves working with “The Morning Show” ensemble, and is always excited to spar with them over media jargon. But conversely, she’s also very protective of Stella and her journey, and she doesn’t think she should come back any time soon.\n\t\n\n\t“When I think about her and what I want for her, I don’t know if there’s a place for her that exists quite yet,” Lee says. “I think the world has to shift a little bit more to make room for her in the way that I would want to see her. Otherwise, we’ll just see her being a slave to this corporation. Being a slave to unfulfilled desires, and I don’t want that for her.”\n\n\tGiven that “The Morning Show” exists about a year and change behind our own timeline, audiences may be waiting a long time for our current world to be worthy of Stella Bak’s resurrection. Until then, Lee hopes she is spending some of those millions somewhere far from the 24-hour news cycle.\n\n\t“I want her to be completely taken by surprise by what’s out there for her,” Lee says. “If she ever comes back, I want her to be sort of like Matthew McConaughey as the beach bum, with bongos and the hair. I want her to really be roughed up a little bit by real-world living. Just to feed her soul a little bit, and become a person. Because I really do think it’s from that place that maybe she would have something ingenious to offer.”\n\n\tBut for those who watched the episode and momentarily thought Stella had suddenly died off screen, you weren’t alone. When Alex (Jennifer Aniston) announces Stella’s resignation on air, the reflective script on her career at UBN sounded an awful lot like a eulogy, so much so that some people even mentioned it to Lee.\n\n\t“Jen was crying when she came to set on my last day,” Lee says. “It was so sweet, and Mimi [Leder] had such beautiful words that day. We are a family, so it was really moving. But you’re not alone if you thought that was a eulogy. Some other people on our crew were like: ‘This is a eulogy. What’s happening?’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarning: This story contains spoilers from the Oct. 22 finale of “Love Is Blind” Season 9, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tThe last remaining couples ended their relationships during the final episode of “Love Is Blind,” making Season 9 the first time in the show’s history where none of the contestants got married. \n\n\tIn the finale, there were three couples left: Ali Lima and Anton Yarosh, Kalybriah Haskin and Edmond Harvey, and Jordan Keltner and Megan Walerius. Among the remaining couples, only the first two made it to the altar, with both women saying no at the altar.\n\t\n\n\tAs viewers braced themselves to watch what they thought would be a third wedding, the show cut to Jordan and Megan in their apartment instead. While the pair sat on the couch, a tearful Megan decided to call off the engagement, citing their fundamental differences in lifestyles and other reservations as to why she wasn’t ready for marriage at the moment.\n\n\n\tAmong the engaged couples, the duo appeared to be the strongest despite early hiccups regarding lifestyle and finances. Additionally, parenthood was a major topic of discussion between the couple, with Jordan being a single father to a five-year-old boy. \n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, Jordan admits he wasn’t “blindsided” by their conversation in the end, as the two had previously made a pact not to go to the altar if they weren’t both certain. \n\n\t“We wanted to be open, honest and transparent with each other,” he says. “My son was supposed to be at the wedding, and I never wanted him to go through something like that. We tried until the last possible second. She made the best decision for both of us and our families.”\n\t\n\n\tBelow, he shares more about his final confessional, viewers’ reactions to Season 9, rewatching the show more than a year later, and where he currently stands with Megan.\n\t\n\t\tHow has it been for you to relive this experience more than a year later?\t\n\n\tIt’s weird watching yourself fall so hard in love with somebody. We were compatible on so many levels. We finished filming almost a year and a half ago, and I haven’t seen her since. I’ve spent a lot of time processing, going to therapy about it and improving myself. It was hard to rewatch it because I don’t remember much of it. But I see why we fell in love. It sucked, but at the same time, so much time has passed. I loved my life before I went on the show, and I love it now. \n\t\n\t\tWhat has it been like seeing everyone’s reactions to the show?\t\n\n\tI’ve been diligent to stay out of the comments and not read them for the most part. But what I’ve seen has been humbling. I did not expect any of this to happen. I didn’t think it would affect the Type 1 diabetes community on this scale. I was just telling my story, and in a way, I was telling a bunch of people’s stories. I never thought about how relatable all our situations are. I didn’t expect any of this, and I feel undeserving of the love and attention. I’m so glad I get to be an advocate.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFrom a viewer’s perspective, it seemed like you two had a strong connection, but there were clear differences around lifestyle, finances and parenthood. Do you feel like the relationship was accurately represented on screen?\t\n\n\tI do. We spent hundreds of hours with each other. We had every conversation there was to have. We understood each other’s intentions. We live two different lives. I’m a single dad. I never wanted her to have immediate responsibility with my son. That was never a conversation. It was like, ‘Ok, I got this. All I need you to do is love that guy. That’s it.’ I have a very healthy relationship with his mom and stepdad. We operate as a unit. The expectations with her being involved were hanging out with us and loving him. That was all I wanted. Everything else was just icing on the cake.\n\t\n\t\tWhat type of new insight about the relationship have you gained while watching the show back?\t\n\n\tI watched myself in Mexico. As a single dad, I work a lot and go to the gym. There are very few times when I’m out and about. We’re with these people in this crazy, unique situation. We’ve been pent-up for a little bit, and then we go to Mexico and get super drunk. Do I have regrets about doing that? For sure. I was being annoying, but we were able to move past that quickly. I’ve grown further as a person from her expectations. Most of my past girlfriends let me do whatever I wanted. It was refreshing to be held accountable. It helped me self-reflect. My end goal was to be a good example for my son. I know he’s going to watch it one day. I would have navigated that situation a little bit differently, but I was just excited.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAt any point in the relationship, did you have a feeling that she would end the engagement?\t\n\n\tYes. I’m a regular, blue-collar guy. I was making decent money at the time, but she was just absolutely killing it. It seemed like every time she would hang out with her friends, she’d come back, and I could hear hesitation in her voice. That was off-putting for me because I want to get married to someone who wants to get married to me. I don’t want someone to have hesitations. That’s not fair to her. We had discussions about not wanting to annul our marriage. We didn’t want to get a divorce. We wanted this to be a forever thing. At the end of the day, she decided it wasn’t going to be a forever thing for her. She made the right choice.\n\t\n\t\tIn your confessional after the split, you mentioned that Megan ended things because your lifestyles weren’t compatible and suggested that money played a significant role. Do you believe that’s the reason she called off the engagement?\t\n\n\tShe kind of says that herself. I don’t want to speak too much for her, but she simply said the lifestyles weren’t compatible. We live completely different lifestyles, so she’s not lying. That was just the fact of the matter at the time.\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you think ultimately made the relationship not work out?\t\n\n\tIt was time. I’m a single dad. I was working a very demanding job at the time. When we were in the pods, I was able to dedicate 100% of my time to Megan. Then we go back to Denver, and half of that gets ripped off to work. With filming, there was not a lot of time to decompress. Luca and Megan are two people I should have committed most of my time and energy to, but I have to support my family. They both got the short end of the stick during that time. I asked Megan to hang on because I knew the load was going to be light eventually. But, she didn’t make the wrong decision.\n\t\n\t\tWould you have said “I do” if you two had made it down the aisle?\t\n\n\tMegan is very strategic in how she thinks. I’m not. She checked all my boxes, and I was good. She was dead set on not wanting a divorce. I’m a chronic under-thinker. So I was like, “Oh, we could get a divorce if we hate each other.” She made the choice that was right for her, which in turn, was the right choice for everyone.\n\t\n\t\tHow would you describe where you guys stand today?\t\n\n\tSince the cast announcement, we’ve been talking almost daily, but it’s just very fun banter. I have no interest in pursuing and trying to go back. We’re friends because we went through this unique experiment together. But it’s very casual. We didn’t talk to each other for a full year. But once everything started dropping, we were just checking in on each other. We think the memes are hilarious. There’s no bad blood between us.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIn your final confessional, you mention that you regretted introducing her to your son, Luca. What was going through your mind when you said that?\t\n\n\tI was going through every emotion known to man. I was so tired. I couldn’t communicate the way I needed to. My son is at this young, tender age where stability is very important. I was regretful that we brought Megan in like, “Oh, this is your stepmom,” and then ripped her out of his life. For a 5-year-old, that’s not fair. That was on me. Nobody signed anybody up for the experiment but me. It was unfair that Luca and my son’s mom got pulled into it in a very dramatic fashion. He doesn’t ask for a stepmom anymore. That was not a healthy thing for him to go through. All I can do is live and learn. I can’t see myself introducing Luca to anyone else unless I’m 100% sure we’re going to be together forever.\n\t\n\t\tDo you still regret introducing her?\t\n\n\tIt was never about Megan. It could have been anybody. Megan is an amazing person. She and Luca got along so great. It was more that it’s not healthy to bring a young child into a situation like that and be like, “Oh, Luca, this is going to be your stepmom. We’re getting married.” Then two weeks later, we didn’t. It’s not Megan’s or Luca’s fault. I brought everyone into the experiment. That’s what I meant by I regret introducing her to Luca because she’s an amazing person. He deserves a stable environment, and what I was doing wasn’t necessarily stable.\n\t\n\t\tHow was Megan’s meeting with Luca’s mother?\t\n\n\tWe went to dinner together. It was important to me because I knew her [Megan] for three or four weeks. I needed her approval out of respect for her. It was amazing. Everyone got along perfectly fine.\n\t\n\t\tHow did she feel about you going on the show?\t\n\n\tShe didn’t care that I was going on it. She was concerned that I was going to be villainized because of my tattoos. But I was like, “Everything will be ok. There’s a reason I’m going on here.” And then everything turned out cool.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does your dating life look like now?\t\n\n\tIt’s been casual. I haven’t introduced Luca to anybody. I haven’t even met anyone to introduce to my son. I’m not interested in dating seriously right now. Every once in a while, it’s nice to go out and go on a casual date. I don’t see myself doing anything serious anytime soon. But never say never.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYour season made “Love Is Blind” history as the first season when no couples got married. Why do you think that the experiment wasn’t successful for your group?\t\n\n\tIt’s a condensed experiment. Everyone was down to earth enough to be like, “This is my life, and I don’t need to get married to satisfy a bunch of fans.” It’s a real marriage. You get a real marriage certificate. Everyone made the right choice, because we’re not getting married just because it plays well on TV. We don’t care what the fans think because this is our life. We’re regular people.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat surprised you the most about his experience?\t\n\n\tMegan and my cast mates are the greatest people I’ve ever met. It’s hard to meet people when you’re an adult. Megan taught me a lot about how I needed to treat and speak to a woman. We brought out the best in each other. Going forward in dating, I’m looking for someone who brings out the best in me, not the worst.\n\t\n\t\tI have to ask about your now viral Crystal Light and chicken protein shake. How did you come up with that combination?\t\n\n\tI was on TikTok. I’ve tried to build my life around convenience, and I saw this bodybuilder doing that exact recipe. And I was like, “You know what? Fuck it. I’m going to give it a shot.” I’m sorry to say I don’t hate it, and I still do it every single day. I don’t think I’ll ever stop doing it. I don’t think it’s that gross. It’s not as gross as chugging 13 raw eggs.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your reaction to seeing audiences so fixated on your recipe?\t\n\n\tThere are a lot of people not doing the instructions right. You’re supposed to chug it, not drink it out of a straw. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. This is a free country. I’ve seen good and bad reactions. No one’s making you do it. It’s my thing!\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

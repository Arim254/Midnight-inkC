    "body": "\n\tAs awards season contenders continue to take shape, the Hamptons International Film Festival has delivered the winners of its 33rd outing in the luxurious beach haven.\n\n\t“The President’s Cake,” from filmmaker Hasan Hadi, won best narrative feature. From distributor Sony Pictures Classics, the feature follows a young Iraqi girl who is chosen to bake her school a celebratory dessert in observation of Saddam Hussein’s birthday. As she hustles to gather ingredients over a scarce landscape, the realities of a dictatorship become clear.\n\t\n\n\tHIFF, presented by Artemis Rising Foundation, awarded Hadi a $2,500 cash prize plus a film production package of in-kind goods and services valued at $92,500 from TCS, Neon Diesel Finishing, Hamptons Locations and On Location Education.\n\n\n\t“Through the eyes of a young girl torn between tradition and survival, Hasan Hadi’s expansive drama shows us what’s really at stake in a dictatorship led with violence and fear,” Narrative Competition Jury members Jody Arlington, Brian Burns and Variety’s Matt Donnelly said in a statement.\n\n\tIn the nonfiction program, “To The West, In Zapata” won best documentary feature. David Bim’s film looks at the egregious struggles Cuba suffered in the pandemic was awarded a $2,500 cash prize plus a film production package valued at $50,000 from Neon Diesel Finishing, TCS and Greenslate.\n\n\t“No film quite took this jury’s breath away” like Bim’s, said the documentary advisors Monica Castilo, Agnes Chu and Loren Hammonds. They called it a “black-and-white cinema verité-style masterpiece” and “a heartbreaking look at the struggle of everyday Cubans in the face of insurmountable odds.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the shorts program, Rein Maychaelson’s “Sammi, Who Can Detach His Body Parts” received best narrative short. “Correct Me If I’m Wrong” nabbed best documentary short.

    "description": "\n\tThree of Netflix‘s most popular documentaries in the last seven weeks have one thing in common: director Skye Borgman.\n\n\tKnown for her 2017 Netflix ",
    "body": "\n\tThree of Netflix‘s most popular documentaries in the last seven weeks have one thing in common: director Skye Borgman.\n\n\tKnown for her 2017 Netflix true crime doc “Abducted In Plain Sight,” Borgman signed a three-year deal with Netflix to produce and distribute her documentaries. In 2024 her doc “American Murder: Laci Peterson” debuted on the platform. That was followed by three 2025 docs – “Fit for TV: The Reality of The Biggest Loser,” “Unknown Number: The High School Catfish,” and “My Father, the BTK Killer.”\n\t\n\n\t“These projects were actually a lot more spread out than it seems,” says Borgman. “I started working on “About My Father” two years ago, before I started working on “Unknown Number” and The Reality of The Biggest Loser.” \n\n\n\tBorgman’s films, whether they focus on murder, catfishing, or the ethics of reality shows, have struck a chord with viewers.\n\n\tThe director, in part, attributes that to what attracts her to all of her projects: confusion.\n\n\t“If it’s a story like that confuses me, then it’s immediately interesting to me because it makes me want to figure out why or how or the reasons behind it,” Borgman says. “And I’m not sure I necessarily need to find out those reasons or know that I will find out those reasons. A lot of time, I know I could never find out exactly the reason for some things, but the stories that are confounding are definitely appealing.”\n\n\tBorgman’s three-part docuseries “Fit for TV: The Reality of The Biggest Loser,” which took an inside look at the making of the competition show that ran for 18 seasons, debuted on Aug. 15. Two weeks later, on Aug. 29, “Unknown Number,” about Kendra Licari, a mother who subjected her teenage daughter and her boyfriend to an endless barrage of abusive text messages, reached the platform’s Top 10 global film chart in its first week and instantly became watercooler fodder.\n\t\n\n\tThe overnight success and the intense social media interest that” Unknown Number” drew surprised Bormgan.\n\n\t“I knew that (the doc) would strike a chord because I mean, how could it not?” A mom is sending her daughter these terrible text messages.” Borgman says. “But I didn’t realize how much of a fire it would light under people.”\n\n\tLicari, who participated in “Unknown Number,” has been the butt of endless online jokes and is the subject of hundreds of memes. It’s unclear if Licari has any regrets about being part of the doc,\n\n\t“She hasn’t reached out to me, but it’s a lot,” Borgman says.\n\n\tOn Oct. 10, Netflix released the director’s most recent doc, “My Father, the BTK Killer.” After gruesomely murdering 10 people between 1974 and 1991, Dennis Rader/the BTK (blind, torture, kill) killer, an unassuming Kansas-based church congregation president and former Cub Scout leader, was arrested by authorities during his lunch break in 2005.\n\n\tWhile several documentaries have been made about Rader, Borgman’s film examines the crimes through a new lens via Rader’s daughter, Kerri Rawson. The 94-minute film weaves together interviews with the investigators who helped uncover BTK’s identity with Rawson’s personal reflections on her relationship with her father, both before and since his arrest and conviction.\n\n\tBorgman decided to make “My Father, the BTK Killer” after reading Kerri Rawson’s 2019 book, “A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love and Overcoming.”\n\n\t“I thought, a documentary about what it’s like to be a serial killer’s daughter? This is something that I haven’t really ever seen before.”\n\n\tIn the doc, Rawson combs through family photos of her, her brother, and her parents at various celebrations and vacations. The foursome appears to be a typical, unassuming family of four. Then there are pictures of Rawson’s station wagon decorated for a high school event. The same station wagon that Rader used to transport one of his dead victims.\n\n\t“He gave me that station wagon to drive in high school,” Rawson says in the doc.\n\n\tSince writing “A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love and Overcoming,” Rawson has been vocal about coping with her father’s brutal murders. Rader’s actions not only caused severe trauma but also forced Rawon to reevaluate her own childhood memories. This introspection led her to question the validity of her past experiences, which made her healing process arduous.\n\t\n\n\t“I think part of Kerri’s journey and part of her healing is with speaking publicly,” says Borgman. “She also gets a lot of backlash from speaking publicly, but it’s part of who she has become, and I think it’s part of what really drives her forward. So, the book was kind of the first step, and I think she felt like it was really necessary to do a documentary and to go that next step and to be even more public about what she has gone through.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy” premieres this Thursday, Peacock is already circling the story of another serial killer for its next installment. Variety has learned that the streamer is in discussions with anthology series executive producer Patrick Macmanus to focus the second “Devil in Disguise” season on the notorious “Night Stalker,” aka Richard Ramirez.\n\n\tEarly talks are under way to consider a new “Devil in Disguise” that would tell the story of Ramirez, the serial killer, rapist and burglar who became known as the “Night Stalker” as he terrorized Los Angeles and Southern California between 1984 and 1985. Ramirez is believed to have killed at least 15 people; because his victims varied in age, gender and background, that made Ramirez’s crimes extremely hard to predict. \n\t\n\n\tRamirez was finally captured in August 1985 and ultimately convicted of all 43 charges for which he was charged; the killer died in prison in 2013 while serving on death row.\n\n\n\tMacmanus (“Dr. Death,” “The Girl From Plainville”) would serve as showrunner for the Ramirez edition of “Devil in Disguise,” and also as executive producer, along with his team at Littleton Road Prods. Universal Studio Group’s UCP, where Littleton Road is based, is the studio.\n\n\tPeacock is already familiar with the story of Ramirez, having previously run the two-part NBC News Studios docuseries “Richard Ramirez: The Night Stalker Tapes.” Elsewhere on TV, Ramirez was the subject of Netflix’s 2021 documentary “Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer.”\n\n\tMacmanus and team have been busy at Peacock as of late. Macmanus recently opened his writers room for “Vigilante,” based on the podcast about Texas-based search-and-rescuer Tim Miller, who becomes convinced that he’s finally solved his own daughter’s murder. Peacock also purchased the true crime series “Crush,” about the “Jenny Jones” episode that led to a murder. Elizabeth Banks and Max Handelman’s Brownstone Productions and Elliot Page’s Pageboy Productions are producing “Crush” along side Littleton Road and Macmanus.\n\t\n\n\tAnd then there’s “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy,” which premieres Oct. 16 on Peacock. Macmanus and team are looking at turning “Devil in Disguise” into an anthology franchise, now that the Ramirez story is in the works as a follow-up.\n\n\tMichael Chernus (“Severance”), Gabriel Luna (“The Last of Us”), James Badge Dale (“Savant”), Michael Angarano (“Oppenheimer”), Chris Sullivan (“This Is Us”) and Marin Ireland (“The Irishman”) star in “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy,” which according to the logline “peels back the twisted layers of Gacy’s life while weaving in heartrending stories of his victims; exploring the grief, guilt, and trauma of their families and friends; and exposing the systemic failures, missed opportunities and societal prejudices that fueled his reign of terror.​​​​​​​”\n\n\tMacmanus is showrunner, writer and executive producer, while exec producers also include Noah Oppenheim (“The Maze Runner”), Sarah Bremner and Liz Cole (“The Thing About Pam”) for NBC News Studios; and Ashley Michel Hoban, Ahmadu Garba and Kelly Funke for Littleton Road Productions. \n\n\tMacmanus directed Episode 8 of the series; Larysa Kondracki, Ashley Michel Hoban, Maggie Kiley and Bille Woodruff also directed. The show comes from Universal Studio Group’s UCP, where Macmanus and Littleton Road have had an overall deal for the past nine years.\n\n\tMacmanus is repped by Josh Hornstock at UTA and Evan Corday at Gameplan Media.\n",

    "description": "\n\tPete Hegseth‘s Defense Department has threatened to revoke press credentials of news organization that do not agree to restrictive new coverage rule",
    "body": "\n\tPete Hegseth‘s Defense Department has threatened to revoke press credentials of news organization that do not agree to restrictive new coverage rules — and says it may bar journalists who don’t agree to abide by the rules from physical access to the Pentagon’s grounds. But more than three dozen news orgs have said they are refusing to sign on to the requirements.\n\n\tOn Tuesday, in a joint statement five major TV news outlets — ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News — said they were not agreeing to the new rules. The Pentagon has told reporters they must sign an agreement for the new rules by Tuesday or turn in their press passes by Wednesday.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the Defense Department’s press office, which outlined the new rules last month, reporters covering the Pentagon must sign a pledge not to obtain or use unauthorized material (even if the information is unclassified). If they do not, they will potentially be barred from the Pentagon.\n\n\n\t“Today, we join virtually every other news organization in declining to agree to the Pentagon’s new requirements, which would restrict journalists’ ability to keep the nation and the world informed of important national security issues,” the networks said in the statement. “The policy is without precedent and threatens core journalistic protections. We will continue to cover the U.S. military as each of our organizations has done for many decades, upholding the principles of a free and independent press.”\n\n\tThe five networks join a number of other news orgs that have already said they won’t agree to the new rules being imposed by Hegseth, a former Fox News host. Those include the New York Times, AP, Reuters, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and Politico, along with conservative-leaning outlets like Newsmax and the Washington Examiner.\n\t\n\n\tAt press time, only one outlet has said it plans to sign on to the new rules announced by the Pentagon, which the Trump administration has is calling the “U.S. Department of War”: pro-Trump network One America News Network (OANN).\n\n\t“Pete Hegseth has united the media! Fox joins the rest of legacy media in pushing back against his radical press censorship policy,” Chuck Todd, former host of NBC’s “Meet the Press” who now hosts “The Chuck ToddCast,” wrote in a post on X. “Congrats or something.”\n\n\tTo be sure, Fox News has pushed back against Trump’s punitive policies and actions toward the press before. In 2018, Fox News backed CNN’s efforts to restore Jim Acosta’s White House credentials; Trump’s White House did so shortly thereafter. (Acosta exited CNN earlier this year after Trump took office for a second term.) “While we don’t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people,” Fox News president Jay Wallace said in a statement at the time.\n\n\tHere’s the current full list of news outlets that have refused to sign the Pentagon’s new rules, as compiled by the Washington Post:\n\n\nABC News\nAL-Monitor\nAssociated Press\nThe Atlantic\nAviation Week\nAxios\nBloomberg News\nBreaking Defense\nC4ISRNET\nCBS News\nCNN\nDefense Daily\nDefense News\nDefense One\nThe Economist\nFederal Times\nThe Financial Times\nFox News\nThe Guardian\nThe Hill\nHuffPost\nMilitary Times\nMSNBC\nNBC News\nThe New York Times\nNewsmax\nNPR\nPBS NewsHour\nPolitico\nRealClearPolitics\nReuters\nTask & Purpose\nThe Wall Street Journal\nThe Washington Examiner\nThe Washington Post\nThe Washington Times\nWTOP\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tProduction in Los Angeles continued to be anemic over the last three months, falling below the level of activity recorded during the 2023 writers and actors strikes.\n\n\tThe decline in location shoots was led by a sharp drop in reality TV production, which recorded its second-worst quarter in the last 15 years. \n\n\tAny effects of the massive expansion of the California film and TV tax credit, which became law on July 1, have yet to show up in the production data. The total number of TV, film and commercial location shoot days fell to 2,631 for the quarter ending Sept. 30, according to FilmLA, which processes permits for most of the region. \n\t\n\n\tThat’s 145 fewer days than the fourth quarter of 2023, when SAG-AFTRA was on strike, which represented the previous low point since the pandemic.\n\n\n\tReality TV was not affected by the 2023 strikes, and accounted for nearly all TV production activity in Los Angeles during that time. Since then, it has represented about 50-60% of TV production in the region. In the third quarter, it declined by 42% compared to the April-June quarter, falling to 649 days.\n\n\tSince 2010, when FilmLA began tracking shoot days in this way, the only worse quarter for reality TV production was April-June 2020 — when nearly all production halted due to the pandemic. \n\n\tOther TV productions — comedies, dramas and pilots — dropped 33% compared to the prior quarter.\n\n\tFilmLA, an industry-backed non-profit, offered an optimistic take on the numbers, saying that productions are starting to line up permits for the fourth quarter, buoyed by the expanded state incentives.\n\t\n\n\t“We know that it will take a little while for new incentive-backed projects to get underway and be reflected in our data, so we were not surprised to see on-location production continue to slip this summer despite the state’s increased investment,” said Philip Sokoloski, a spokesman for the agency.\n\n\tLooking for a bright spot, FilmLA noted that feature film production increased from 476 days in the third quarter of 2024 to 522 in the same quarter this year. However, that was still 30% below the five-year average.\n\n\tCalifornia lawmakers increased the film and TV subsidy from $330 million a year to $750 million, while also expanding the amount that each production can receive to as much as 40% of eligible costs. The state also broadened eligibility to sitcoms, animation and large-scale competition shows — though not to game shows, talk shows or commercials.\n\n\tProduction has declined significantly around the world since the post-pandemic frenzy of 2022, including drops in Georgia, New York, Canada and the U.K.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKristin Cavallari is continuing her podcast, “Let’s Be Honest” with a new multi-year deal, Variety has exclusively learned. The new agreement with Dear Media exceeds eight figures.\n\n\tThe podcast focuses on all things relationships — from her personal stories about dating, friendships and families, to interviews with experts in wellness, career, food, fitness and spirituality. Over the last two years, guests have included Travis Kelce, Harry Jowsey, Rebecca Minkoff, Brie and Nikki Garcia, Bobby Flay and Nikki Glaser. She’s also currently rewatching “The Hills” and discussing her thoughts.\n\t\n\n\tThe “Let’s Be Honest” podcast launched in fall 2023 following Cavallari’s “Laguna Beach” rewatch podcast. “I was looking for a new challenge, and coming off of the enjoyment of the ‘Back To The Beach’ podcast, I thought doing my own could be really fun. I love having the freedom to talk about whatever I want and getting to choose guests who have great stories and can hopefully make people laugh, give them real takeaways, and/or inspire them,” she said at the time.\n\n\n\t“I’ve always kept the public at an arm’s length. I’m finally in a great place in my life to open up and share some of my experiences,” she continued. “Since my podcast will have a heavy focus on dating and relationships, I’m excited to bring on men as guests in order to shed real light on what they’re thinking and feeling so that women can have a better understanding of the dating world, and I’ll of course share my experience over the past few years being back in the dating world.”\n\n\tEarlier this year, she took the podcast on the road for a multi-city tour. In early 2026, Cavallari will be part of the official “Laguna Beach” reunion set at Roku Channel, both appearing and serving as an executive producer.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCheryl Hines appeared as a guest on “The View” Tuesday, where the co-hosts asked her several questions about her husband, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his role as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n\t“When I met Bobby, he was living in New York, I was living in L.A., and I had just been in this entertainment sort of bubble,” said Hines, who was on the talk show to promote her new memoir “Unscripted.” “And then I meet him, and he’s an environmental attorney, and he’s fascinating, and he’s interesting, and he’s smart, and he’s funny — and completely different from anyone I’ve met in my life.”\n\t\n\n\t“That’s for sure,” Joy Behar responded to Hines’ last remark about Kennedy. \n\n\n\tFollowing Behar’s quip, the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actor addressed the co-hosts’ past criticisms of her husband, including their repeated concerns about his qualifications for the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services position.\n\n\t“I know you ladies — I know you love to talk about him,” Hines said.\n\n\tCo-host Sunny Hostin later pressed Hines about Kennedy’s presidential campaign and his eventual decision to endorse now-President Donald Trump, despite their earlier clashes on the campaign trail.\n\n\t“By the way, that happens in a political campaign all the time,” Hines said. She then responded to Hostin’s question about whether she had expressed any concerns to her husband regarding his support for Trump.\n\n\t“I always share all of my concerns with my husband. I have not been a political person. I haven’t posted anything on social media other than go out and vote. I never told people who they should vote for,” Hines said. “With Bobby, that was a very difficult decision to make with President Trump. It was a crazy year-and-a-half with Bobby running.”\n\t\n\n\tHines added, “It was complicated, because it’s a big change politically. He starts out as a Democrat. When I first registered to vote, I registered as an independent, through the years, I changed to Democrat, now I’m back to independent. So, for Bobby, in the course of a year-and-a-half, two years, to go from a Democrat to now working with President Trump, that’s a long, that’s a leap.”\n\n\tBehar jumped back into the conversation by bringing up how Kennedy and Trump are “casting doubt on the efficacy of the vaccine, which makes Americans very nervous. So that’s the problem we’re having.” \n\n\t“So my question is, can we do better? Yes, to vaccines, yes they are important and an important part of our healthcare,” Hines said. “Can we do better? Can we make them safer? Can we listen to parents who say my child got the vaccine and changed and stopped hitting markers, stopped developing the way they were developing?” \n\n\tWhoopi Goldberg then expressed her concerns about Kennedy’s qualifications to lead a government agency on health issues, saying on “The View,” “I do want to say, you know he’s not a doctor and he’s not a professional? And oftentimes, when he’s speaking, he’s speaking not with the best information.” \n\n\tGoldberg added, “And some of the things he suggested take it out of the hands of my doctor and me or my OB-GYN and me. And I wonder, does it give you pause?”\n\n\tHines claimed that “90 percent of secretaries of HHS have not been doctors,” though she did not specify the source of that information.\n\n\t“But they’ve had a science background,” Hostin argued.\n\n\tIn response, Hines noted that “one of Obama’s secretaries was an economist.” \n\n\t“The problem, respectfully, is that your husband is the least-qualified Department of Health and Human Services head that we’ve had in history,” Hostin said to Hines. “I think that’s very dangerous.”\n\n\t“Less qualified than an economist?,” Hines replied.\n\n\tHostin then claimed that RFK Jr. has “spread a lot of misinformation, a lot of chaos, a lot of confusion.” As Hines began to respond, Hostin interrupted, pointing out, “He’s connecting circumcisions to autism,” prompting Hines to reply, “May I? May I finish?”\n\n\t“When people, Fauci, were saying when you get the vaccine, you cannot transmit COVID, it will stop COVID, that was disinformation,” Hines claimed. Alyssa Farah Griffin — who worked under the Trump administration during the pandemic — responded, “We were also still learning about it, it was a novel virus we’d never encountered before. Because now the doctors will acknowledge.” \n\t\n\n\tAfter some more tense back-and-forth between Hines and “The View” co-hosts, Behar wrapped up the interview by asking one final question about Kennedy: “Does he or does he not have a brain worm?” (Kennedy has admitted in the past that doctors found a brain worm in his body.)\n\n\t“It ate just a little bit of his brain and died, so don’t worry!” Hines joked.\n\n\tFollowing Hines’ interview, “The View” co-hosts addressed the tone of the conversation.\n\n\t“We want people to come and give their views, and everyone who comes here we try to be respectful to — and we ask tough questions because otherwise, we’d be speculating, so we can ask,” Goldberg said.\n\n\t“We should have more Republicans on the show, but they don’t want to come on. They’re scared of us,” Behar said, while Hostin added, “I do think it’s important that Robert F. Kennedy come on this show.”\n\n\t Watch a segment of Hines’ interview on “The View” below. \n\nCheryl Hines, author of the new memoir 'Unscripted,' reflects on her husband HHS Secretary Robert F.

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Reliance Animation has secured character IP rights to develop an animated series based on the life of soccer legend Diego Maradona.\n\n\tThe Mumbai-based studio, a division of Reliance Entertainment, will create a scripted series chronicling Maradona’s journey from his early years to international stardom for streaming and television platforms. The project is currently in development, with details on the creative team, distribution partners and launch timeline to be announced.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal was brokered in partnership with SATTVICA SA, the Argentina-based rights holder of Maradona’s IP, and mediated through Bridge Marketing Group Inc.

    "body": "\n\tLeading Indian filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani drew a full house at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) with a dynamic session unpacking how writing and editing shape a film’s emotional core, using examples from “3 Idiots,” “Lage Raho Munna Bhai” and his wider filmography to show how meaning, tension and character can shift entirely through the arrangement of shots, sound and structure. \n\n\tJoined by longtime collaborator Abhijat Joshi, he explored the idea that writing is emotion imagined while editing is emotion experienced, arguing that conflict remains the heartbeat of cinematic storytelling.\n\t\n\n\t“A good editor plays with your emotion,” he said, referencing American filmmaker D.W. Griffith. “Magic can happen while editing.”\n\n\n\tWhile editing, Hirani said, “Editing can really change the meaning of a story. And how does it happen? When you write something, your unit of writing is a word, and many words make a sentence, sentences make a paragraph, a chapter, and finally a book. Similarly, the unit of editing is a shot. The shots by themselves might not contain the entire meaning, but when they’re put together with many other shots, a new meaning emerges. Now imagine being able to change the shots, flip the shots. A shot also will have sound. Take the sound from here, put it somewhere else. A film will have 10,000 shots. You have the liberty of using transitions, music, sound effects. So you can actually completely transform from what it was intended to be.”\n\n\tHirani and Joshi spoke about their process which begins with the concept that “writing is emotion imagined” while editing is “emotion experienced.” A film, they said, begins when a character “wants” something, conflict is “oxygen” while exposition must be hidden under drama and conflict.\n\t\n\n\t“Conflict in life is not something which is welcome. But in cinema, without conflict, things get very boring very quickly. Conflict is the heart of cinema,” Joshi said, adding that the strongest drama arises when two valid, opposing truths collide.\n\n\tHirani urged writers to ground their stories in lived experiences. “A good writer must pick triggers from life,” he said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTokyo-based filmmaker Anshul Chauhan is expanding his independent production banner Kowatanda Films into India, with horror feature “Nava” marking the company’s first local production. The project reunites Chauhan with actress Shweta Tripathi, who will star and produce through her newly formed company Bandarful Films.\n\n\tSet in the wetlands of Sundarbans, “Nava” follows Tara Sen as she returns home and becomes entangled in a generations-old mystery involving river gods and family secrets. Writer Akash Mohimen penned the screenplay for what’s being described as a culturally rooted genre piece.\n\t\n\n\t“As an Indian who has spent many years living in Japan, people sometimes find it unusual that I make Japanese films,” Chauhan said. “Japan, and especially Tokyo, has given me everything. It shaped me as an artist and as a person. But at the end of the day, I am Indian too, and a part of me has always wanted to tell stories in Hindi.”\n\n\n\tThe director revealed he spent three years attempting to break into the Indian market before deciding to establish his own production infrastructure. “There are only a handful of true producers here, people who actually know how to see a film through, explore co-production funds, work with subsidies, incentives, and find solutions when private or studio financing doesn’t land,” he explained.\n\n\tKowatanda Films India will be led by Chauhan as producer and director, alongside producer Mina Moteki and executive producer Sohrab Bozorgchami. Bozorgchami brings 14 years of line producing experience on projects including “Maidaan,” “Chup” and upcoming films “Sumo Didi,” “Lala & Poppy” and “Happy Patel.”\n\t\n\n\tChauhan and Moteki founded Kowatanda Films as a Tokyo-based independent studio. The company has produced “Bad Poetry Tokyo,” “Kontora,” “December” and latest feature “Tiger,” which premiered at Busan International Film Festival 2025 and had its Indian premiere at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa, where Japan is the focus country. “Tiger” is set for release across Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, with North America and Europe targeted next.\n\n\tTripathi said the collaboration aims to transcend international boundaries. “‘Nava’is a film that draws from the soil of Bengal and the complexities of coping with one’s ancestral past, and yet speaks a universal language of haunting and healing,” she said. “I’m excited to join hands with Kowatanda Films as we bring this atmospheric, unforgettable world to life for global audiences.”\n\n\tMohimen, a Drishyam-Sundance Screenwriters’ Lab 2015 fellow, has co-written projects including “Rukh” and crime series “Bhaukaal.” He is also developing a Japanese-language film with Chauhan scheduled to shoot in Tokyo next year, plus another Japan-set horror project.\n\n\tBandarful Films is simultaneously preparing LGBTQ+ love story “Mujhe Jaan Na Kaho Meri Jaan,” co-starring Tillotama Shome and written and directed by Sonjoy Nag. The company also has a detective crime dramedy and a satire about image maintenance in development.\n\n\tChauhan relocated to Tokyo in 2011 after working as an animator on projects including Indian National Film Award winner “Delhi Safari.” His directorial debut “Bad Poetry Tokyo” won the Grand Prix at Brussels International Film Festival, while “Kontora” received the Grand Prix at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and the Obayashi Award in 2020. “December” premiered at Busan in 2021 and enjoyed theatrical release across five territories.\n\n\tThe director is represented by CAA and Range Media Partners, with plans for production in the U.S. and across Asia.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAcclaimed filmmaker Shekhar Kapur delivered a stark warning to Hollywood studios and tech giants at WAVES Film Bazaar, declaring that artificial intelligence will trigger the collapse of traditional entertainment industry hierarchies and predicting that major corporations built on high entry barriers may not survive the transition.\n\n\tSpeaking at a session titled “Bringing AI and Creativity Together to Craft Stories that Inspire,” moderated by Sujay Sen, executive VP and global head of interactive services at LTI Mindtree, the director of “Elizabeth” and “Bandit Queen” emerged from judging entries for India’s first AI Film Festival with a provocative assessment: “Large corporations are about to fall because the pyramid is going flat. New corporations will be formed.” \n\t\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), where Kapur is the festival director.\n\n\n\tKapur’s comments came after viewing entries from 181 teams who participated in a 48-hour AI filmmaking hackathon, creating two-minute films on the theme of “memories” using only AI tools. The participants were not professional filmmakers but artists, students and writers exploring AI’s creative potential. “The first thing I said is that we should retire. Literally, I’m not kidding,” Kapur stated, noting the quality of work produced in such a short timeframe would have been impossible with traditional filmmaking methods.\n\n\tCentral to Kapur’s thesis is what he calls “the collapse of the pyramid” – the breakdown of traditional hierarchical structures in both corporate and creative industries. He illustrated this with a parable about a CEO preparing to raise $10 billion who discovers that his cleaning lady, armed only with AI prompting skills and intuition, can write a better investment pitch than his MIT and Harvard-educated team.\n\t\n\n\t“The cleaning lady knows more about raising $10 billion than he does because she learned the art of prompting and went at it with full force and emotion,” Kapur explained. “She had intuition, and she used her intuition with all the help from AI.”\n\n\tThe director argued that AI drastically lowers entry barriers to filmmaking. “The best thing about AI is it’s the most democratic technology. There is a $300 million film that can now be made in $300,000. If it’s India, it can be made in $30,000,” he said.\n\n\tKapur predicted that major studios and large corporations will face collapse as AI democratizes content creation. He pointed to practical limitations already constraining traditional cinema: “In India, we have only 8,000 working screens. We keep talking about India as the greatest filmmaking nation in the world, but we have only 8,000 screens,” he noted, adding that similar constraints exist in the U.K. and the U.S.\n\n\tHis solution: AI will create its own distribution platforms, much as TikTok and YouTube have done. “We have to assume, if you want to tell stories and you can’t get to a theater, an AI film could do very quickly. I can make an ‘Avatar’ for YouTube of the same quality with AI.”\n\n\tKapur also issued pointed warnings to executives: “CEOs tell me, ‘Oh my God, what’s going to happen to jobs?’ And I tell them, be careful of your job, because people will not want to work for you. AI will allow people to explore themselves. Everybody will want to be their own CEO.”\n\n\tHe cautioned tech companies with massive AI valuations as well: “Don’t trust tech companies and their trillion dollar valuations. It’s like poker. Nobody’s seen any money, nobody’s seen their cards. We are in the potential of the valuation of these huge AI companies being driven by Wall Street.” The filmmaker believes places like India and China will lead AI adoption because “here we need AI for people to progress.”\n\n\tDespite AI’s capabilities, Kapur emphasized that the technology cannot replace fundamental human experiences. “AI cannot be human. AI is artificial intelligence. We don’t even know where intelligence resides,” he said, noting recent neuroscience research suggesting intelligence may reside in the heart and microbiome as much as the brain.\n\n\tThe director argued that human qualities like hope, fear and faith remain beyond AI’s reach. “The only time that AI can take over humanity is if we have so much inertia that we become predictable,” Kapur explained.\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked about AI’s current limitations in filmmaking, Kapur identified a major challenge. “In AI, we still don’t know how to create close-ups, and there’s a very specific reason: we have something that science has not worked out yet – a relationship between pupils,” he explained, noting that human pupils change thousands of times per second in ways current technology cannot replicate.\n\n\tAddressing concerns about shorter attention spans driven by social media, Kapur suggested the causality might be reversed: “Is it getting shorter and shorter because we are becoming as human beings having shorter attention spans? Or is it getting shorter because films are getting shorter?”\n\n\tDespite this, Kapur insisted storytelling fundamentals remain unchanged. “Storytelling never changes. Storytelling is the way we communicate with each other. Everything is a story,” he said, citing influences from Japanese director Kurosawa Akira, whose visual storytelling transcends language barriers.\n\n\tDuring a lighter segment, Kapur revealed his favorite actor is his uncle, late Bollywood icon Dev Anand, and identified Kurosawa as his greatest directorial influence. \n\n\tThe session concluded with Kapur’s philosophical response to a time machine thought experiment, noting that time itself is relative: “Time is your perception of past, present and future. There is no time unless you perceive it.”\n\n\tThe AI Film Festival’s hackathon entries will be screened on Nov. 26. LTI Mindtree is partnering with Shekhar Kapur Films on the initiative, with plans to introduce AI filmmaking to students at a music school in Mumbai that Kapur helps run.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThree-time Grammy winner Ne-Yo, Indian music legend Sonu Nigam and pioneering Chinese American rapper MC Jin have partnered with former Warner Music Asia co-president Jonathan Serbin to launch Pacific Music Group, a new entertainment company headquartered in Hong Kong focused on developing Pan-Asian talent for global audiences.\n\n\tThe venture marks a strategic bet on Asia’s growing influence in the music industry, with the company aiming to both elevate regional artists to international prominence and provide Western acts with an entry point into Asian markets.\n\t\n\n\tPacific Music Group will launch with multiple genre-spanning imprints covering pop, R&B, hip-hop, electronic and regional Asian styles. The label’s geographic reach extends from Japan to India and from China and Korea south to Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\t“Asia has emerged as one of the most dynamic forces in the global music industry. With half the world’s population and three of the top ten music markets, the region is primed to lead on the world stage. At the same time, rapidly growing markets like India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines offer immense potential. We believe the time is right for a music company born in Asia, but built with a global perspective from day one,” said Serbin, who previously helped drive Warner Music’s expansion across Asia and launched its first dedicated K-pop label. “Ne-Yo, Sonu and MC Jin have all achieved long-standing global success, and they know exactly what it takes to build international music careers. I’m honored to partner with these legends. Pacific Music Group artists will gain invaluable insight from their experience and vision.”\n\t\n\n\tNe-Yo added: “Launching Pacific Music Group isn’t just a business move, it’s a personal mission. As an individual of Chinese descent, I’m proud to use my resources to help discover and elevate the next generation of talented Pan-Asian superstars. I’ve toured across Asia several times and witnessed the evolution of the music scene, so I’m really excited to make history and bring the region’s rich culture to the forefront of the global stage.”\n\n\tMC Jin, who will head up Pacific Music Group’s hip-hop imprint, stated: “The influence of hip-hop on a global scale is undeniable. For me, it provided a way to find my voice as an artist, explore my identity as a Chinese American and share my truth as a storyteller. As a fan of the music and a student of the craft, I’m looking forward to connecting with artists who are also on that journey. Asia is full of talent with unique stories, fresh styles and authentic messages waiting to be shared with the world. With Pacific Music Group, these individuals will now have a chance to share their art rooted in creativity and culture in an impactful way.”\n\n\tSonu Nigam, one of India’s most celebrated performers, added: “India alone has 1.6 billion people, but Indian artists want to connect well beyond our borders. The same is true across Asia. There is a hunger to grow globally and the potential to bring the richness of our cultures to the world. With Pacific Music Group, we’re not just exporting talent, we’re helping artists thrive both at home and abroad.”\n\n\tHe added: “I have performed in more than 50 countries, and everywhere I go I see the same excitement for Asian music and culture. Working with Ne-Yo, MC Jin, and Jonathan gives us a rare mix of global experience and deep regional understanding. Together, we can mentor artists from across Asia and help them share their stories in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to listeners around the world.”\n\n\tThe three artist-founders will provide A&R guidance and mentorship to the label’s roster, drawing on decades of success as globally renowned performers and hitmakers. Serbin brings over 25 years of leadership experience in the music and media industries. During his tenure at Warner Music Asia, he oversaw 11 countries and territories and signed artists including Lay Zhang, Elva Hsiao, Coco Lee, G.E.M., Eric Chou, Vava, Jam Hsiao, Jolin Tsai and Fish Long.\n\t\n\n\t“Our approach is simple,” Serbin said. “We want to discover great artists in Asia and help them reach global audiences, and we want to provide international artists with an authentic and strategic entry point into the region. Pacific Music Group was designed from the beginning to operate at a global scale.”\n\n\tThe company’s name references a shift in the industry’s geographic center of gravity. Three of the world’s largest music markets — Japan, China and Korea — are located in Asia, alongside rapidly growing markets including India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\n\t“Eighty years ago, when Atlantic Records was founded, the Atlantic Ocean symbolized the dominant music axis, linking the U.S. and U.K. Today, that axis has shifted,” the company stated in its announcement. “Asia is now the epicenter of creative energy, musical innovation, and fan engagement.”\n\n\tPacific Music Group’s debut artists will be unveiled in the coming months, with initial music releases scheduled for fall 2025. The company will operate with offices and talent hubs across Asia.\n\n\tNe-Yo has earned three Grammy Awards and penned hits for Rihanna, Beyoncé and Jennifer Hudson. MC Jin became the first Asian American solo hip-hop artist to sign with a major U.S. label after rising to prominence on BET’s “106 & Park Freestyle Fridays.” Nigam has written and performed songs for Indian films for nearly two decades and remains one of the most-streamed artists in India.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAvani Films has rolled out a new documentary slate featuring two projects nearing completion and a science series in development.\n\n\tThe production company’s lineup includes feature documentaries “Comedians in Bars” and “Dispatch,” both in late-stage production, alongside “Rebus,” a three-part science series currently in development.\n\n\t“Comedians in Bars” ventures behind the scenes of stand-up comedy, capturing the art form’s development in bars, backrooms and late-night venues where material is tested and refined. Partially filmed at the Edinburgh Fringe, the world’s largest arts festival, the documentary features interviews with comedians who view themselves as outsiders despite securing programming at the prestigious event.\n\t\n\n\tThe film presents performers from various countries and subcultures discussing ambition, instability, self-doubt and the combination of determination and discipline necessary to build comedy careers. Drawing from director Anu Vaidyanathan’s touring experience, the documentary examines stand-up comedy as labor, survival mechanism and personal reckoning.\n\n\n\t“Dispatch,” which was selected for the NFDC Producers Lab at the WAVES Film Bazaar in partnership with Storiculture and Netflix, presents an intergenerational exploration of women’s experiences. The documentary unfolds across six movements, following a daughter as she grapples with dual inheritances from her birth family and marriage.\n\n\tThe film examines the transmission of care, discipline, labor and faith through women’s daily work spanning different geographies and generations. Rather than focusing on loss, the project emphasizes themes of continuity through intimate observation and remembered voices.\n\t\n\n\t“Rebus,” the three-part science series, explores human, artificial and ecological intelligence. Developed from Vaidyanathan’s technical background — she holds a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering — the series aims to make AI and quantum computing accessible to general audiences.\n\n\tThe project investigates why advanced systems handle complexity effectively while struggling with simple tasks, and examines what the global technology race reveals about power, ethics and imagination. The series combines cinematic presentation with a comedic tone to illuminate transformative technologies.\n\n\tVaidyanathan is a filmmaker, comedian, author and academic. She authored the HarperCollins bestseller “Anywhere But Home.” \n\n\tHer debut stand-up hour “BC:AD” premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe before running Off-Broadway. Her second show “Blimp” has been adapted into a short narrative film starring Carlos Bardem and developed into a feature screenplay titled “Mis(s)Chief.”\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere are no mistakes: Late artist Bob Ross‘ happy trees are about to once again help out public broadcasting. On last week’s 2025 finale of “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver,” the host convinced the Bob Ross estate to auction another of the PBS TV stars’ paintings to support public media. And it has paid off: Ross’ “Cabin at Sunset,” which he painted on a Season 10 episode of PBS’ “The Joy of Painting” in 1986, had fetched around $1,044,000 after 35 bids.\n\t\n\n\tAs bids closed on Monday night at midnight ET, this represented a new auction record for a Bob Ross painting. Earlier this month, Bonhams Los Angeles auctioned off three more of Ross’ “Joy of Painting” works, to support American Public Television — the company that continues to distribute “Joy of Painting.” On Nov. 11, “Winter’s Peace” (1993) sold for $318,000, while “Cliffside” (1990) went for $229,100 and “Home in the Valley” was sold at $114,800. All told, those three paintings nabbed $662,000 — and are now dwarfed by this new figure.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn the show’s Nov. 16 episode of “Last Week Tonight,” Oliver detailed how the decision by the Trump Administration and Congress to eliminate $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting earlier this year has severely impacted radio and TV stations, particularly in rural areas. That’s why the show launched “John Oliver’s Junk,” a website with 65 items (most from the show) that were up for bid to support public broadcasting — including “Cabin at Sunset.” \n\n\tAll told, the auction raised nearly $1.54 million for the Public Media Bridge Fund, which is assisting local public broadcasters in temporarily finding new funds in the wake of the CPB closure.\n\t\n\n\tThe Bob Ross painting was, of course, the majority of that sum. But other major items included a chance for someone’s photo to appear in a graphic over Oliver’s shoulder during an episode (as well as two VIP tickets to a live show taping), which fetched $100,025. A trip to New York to meet Oliver netted $51,600, while a signed case of “SauvignJohn” wine grabbed $13,025.\n\n\tOther items included Russell Crowe’s jock strap (“worn by Russell Crowe in the major motion picture Cinderella Man and later purchased by ‘Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,’ during season 5 of the show, as part of Crowe’s ‘Art of Divorce; auction in which Crowe sold his personal belongings to pay for his divorce”), which earned $21,000; and “Mrs. Cabbage Oliver” (“John Oliver’s on-screen wife, married during an on-screen wedding officiated by Steve Buscemi. Part of ‘Last Week Tonight’s’ season 9 segment on AI-generated art in which John marries a cabbage in the studio”), which scored a bid of $11,111.\n\n\tAlso: A large, gold-plated re-creation of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s balls (“Sculpture of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s scrotum, part of the season 12 segment on presidential libraries”) landed $25,500, while five wax Presidents of the United States ranged from $6000 (Bill Clinton) to $3,333 (William Henry Harrison). Golden Adidas sneakers (“Gold sneakers John Oliver promised to wear in a season 2 episode of ‘Last Week Tonight with John Oliver’ if scandal-ridden FIFA President Sepp Blatter stepped down”) picked up $5,148.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“We’ve actually accumulated a bunch of weird artifacts on this show over the years that we could definitely auction off to raise some much needed money,” Oliver said on last week’s show. “I am proud to announce last week tonight’s first ever auction in aid of public media. This is real!” Proceeds will go to the Public Media Bridge Fund, which is assisting local public broadcasters in temporarily finding new funds in the wake of the CPB closure.\n\n\tIn the case of the Bonhams auctions, those three paintings were part of 30 Bob Ross works that will be sold over the next year, with American Public Television directing all of its proceeds to support public TV stations across the country.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMicrodramas are moving into a new phase of global expansion, industry leaders said at the WAVES Film Bazaar, pointing to evolving genres, rising male viewership, institutional support in Europe and surging demand across India and Latin America.\n\n\tModerated by Variety’s Naman Ramachandran, panelists Tarun Sawhney, president, APAC, Shorts TV, Vijay Koshy, president, TVF and director of Seriesly Berlin, Dennis Ruh broke down the booming global market and discussed India’s acceleration into the space.\n\t\n\n\tRamachandran opened with data showing China’s microdrama market surpassing theatrical revenues, hitting an estimated $7 billion compared to a $6 billion box office, with projections of $26 billion by 2030. He positioned India as a rapidly awakening “sleeping giant”. Asked to define the form, Ruh described microdramas as “a sub-genre of the vertical drama” – two-to-three-minute episodes, often running 60–70 chapters per season, built around cliff-hangers and addictive progression loops. Platforms such as ReelShort and MyDrama, he noted, “provide the first 10 to 20 episodes for free, then users buy tokens, play games or watch ads,” enabling some operators to generate “over $1 million per day.”\n\n\n\tSawhney emphasised the behaviour shift driving this surge. “Our attention spans are dwindling… microdramas are a lifestyle now, ingrained in our entertainment appetite.” He disputed higher budget estimates, saying the majority of micro-dramas “are in the range of $50,000 to $60,000,” with per-minute costs dipping as low as $100 in India and China.\n\t\n\n\tKoshy framed microdramas as “bite-sized storytelling,” but acknowledged TVF has yet to enter the category. “We’ve been cautious,” he said. “Slice-of-life and satire are much tougher to do in the shorter form.”\n\n\tAs genres evolve, romance and CEO tropes still dominate but Sawhney said there is now a demand for thrillers and horrors too, especially with the surge in male audiences from 10% to nearly 30% in some markets. LATAM and Europe are diversifying fastest, with Ruh noted Germany’s first publicly funded microdrama based on a historic tale was created for TikTok, signalling institutional acceptance. “This shows an openness to bring more local stories to those platforms, and I think that’s also the future, how it will evolve in Europe, for example,” he said.\n\n\tRamachandran pointed out that microdramas operate outside established platforms, making customer acquisition and retention expensive. Ruh confirmed that marketing spend “reduces profit,” while Sawhney added a startling ratio: “For every million dollars they spend on content, they spend 10 million on marketing.”\n\n\tThe panel also tackled AI’s accelerating role and responded to the question: Are microdramas here for the long haul? All the speakers agreed that as long as phones with vertical screens exist, microdramas are “here to stay.”\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFae Pictures is ramping up its production activity with multiple projects spanning horror, television and documentary as president Shant Joshi participated in a producers’ development program.\n\n\tJoshi was selected as one of 12 producers for the WAVES Film Bazaar x ProducerLAND Producers’ Lab, a professional development initiative supporting mid-career South Asian producers. He participated in the Project Track with “The Devil’s Tears,” a Tamil-language elevated horror film that marks Maya Bastian’s second narrative feature.\n\t\n\n\tThe company’s Asian-Canadian anthology series “Streams Flow From a River” has been greenlit for a second season, set to begin production in February 2026 for Super Channel in Canada. Backed by the Canada Media Fund and the Bell Fund, the new season shifts focus from the Chinese-Canadian Chow family featured in season one to follow the Pakistani-Canadian Javed family. The six-episode season will be directed entirely by Bastian, with Abdul Malik serving as head writer. Series creator Christopher Yip returns as executive producer, while Keavy Lynch, Renuka Singh, Thomas Pepper and Manny Mahal comprise the writing team.\n\n\n\tThe anthology series exploring immigrant families in rural Canada is a Fae Pictures and Rellow Media production, with Joshi and Lindsay Blair Goeldner executive producing. Temilola Adebayo serves as producer, with Lisa Valencia-Svensson and Leonard Chan as co-executive producers and Melissa Affrunti as associate producer. EST Studios will handle international festivals and market for a standalone feature version of the season titled “Goose Point.”\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, production on “Granny Lee” has been pushed back a year to April-May 2026 following a series of setbacks. The project lost financing from Amazon Prime Video Africa and South Africa’s Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, while also facing delays in the ratification of the Canada-South African co-production treaty. Although the treaty was signed in September 2024, it did not return to the Canadian parliamentary docket until June 2025 due to Parliament’s prorogation following Justin Trudeau’s resignation and the subsequent federal election. The project has since secured new funding from Eurimages, Quebec’s SODEC and South Africa’s National Film and Video Foundation.\n\n\tFae Pictures has also joined as executive producer on “Le Silence de Mostafa,” a Moroccan-Canadian documentary following the return to filmmaking of Mostafa Derkaoui, often regarded as the godfather of Moroccan cinema. The film explores the decolonial filmmaker’s role as patriarch in a filmmaking family, with his granddaughter Kenza Derkaoui directing and producing alongside Stefan Supplice under Niya Production. Mostafa’s son Kamal Derkaoui serves as cinematographer, while Mostafa’s late wife Douja Nour and brother Krimou Derkaoui also appear in the film. Supported by Telefilm Canada and Canada Council for the Arts, the documentary is expected to be structured as a Canada-Morocco treaty co-production and will be versioned in both French and English.\n\n\tWAVES Film Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 2025 International Emmy Awards winners were announced Monday at a gala event in New York. For the 53rd annual edition, winners came from 64 contenders across 16 categories representing a record 26 countries.\n\n\tAmong special honors: Disney Entertainment co-chairman Dana Walden received the International Emmy Founders Award — which was presented to her by megahit producer Ryan Murphy.\n\n\n\t“I know this award is typically given to the people who create the stories. And rightfully so. But I view this honor as recognition of a vital partnership,” Walden said in her acceptance speech. “One that exists between the creator who dreams the dream, and the team that believes in it enough to clear the path. My approach has never been complicated: Find singular voices… and help them do their best work. And most importantly — build a culture of creative risk-taking.”\n\t\n\n\tShe also discussed nurturing Murphy’s “Glee” early in its run: “It wasn’t the worst testing pilot in history – trust me — but it also didn’t get the reaction it deserved. I learned two lessons that changed the way I work with creators. First, through Ryan’s eyes, I got to understand how harsh criticism feels to a creator — particularly if the story is personal.  And, second, the feedback wasn’t really for him – it was for the executives. It was going to be our job to protect ‘Glee’ and teach an audience how to understand something different and original.”\n\n\n\tWalden, who received a standing ovation as she approached the stage, referenced some of the shows she oversaw early in her career at 20th Century Fox TV, including “The X-Files,” “Ally McBeal,” “24” and “The Simpsons” as examples. \n\t\n\n\t“Those shows all have two things in common – they were creatively ambitious and excellent,” she said. “And, though they were made in the US, they were also huge hits around the world. Because great storytelling is truly universal. And that belief – that great stories can come from anywhere and belong to everyone – is at the heart of The Walt Disney Company. It’s also a guiding principle of my mentor and friend, Bob Iger. Bob’s always championed the simple, yet powerful idea that if you get the storytelling right, everything else will follow. No matter how much the world changes, people will always want to feel connected, and they will always need to be entertained.”\n\n\tAs for this year’s awards, the U.K. came into the competition with the most nominations across all categories with 12. Other countries represented included Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong — China, India, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Norway, Qatar, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\t“Live With Kelly and Mark” hosts Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos fronted this year’s International Emmys, which featured sponsors including Variety. Besides Walden, honorees this year also included Grupo Globo chairman/president João Roberto Marinho, who received the directorate award.

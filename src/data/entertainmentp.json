    "body": "\n\tGerman-Lebanese thesp Kida Khodr Ramadan, the “4 Blocks” standout whose profile jumped internationally via Amazon Prime Video, is set to star in “GÖZ,” a radical contemporary reimagining of Goethe’s “Götz von Berlichingen” to be directed by Nuran David Calis, known for his modern-screen adaptation of Büchner’s “Woyzeck.”\n\n\tThe film is in development at Munich and Berlin-based Maze Pictures, whose European co-production project “Phoenix” has been selected at this year’s Berlinale Market Series. \n\t\n\n\tProduced by Geraldine Laprell and Philipp Kreuzer for Maze Pictures, “GÖZ” reframes Goethe’s iron-handed knight as a present-day anti-hero fighting urban displacement. \n\n\n\tSet in a neighborhood pressured by corporate interests and political corruption, the story follows Ramadan’s character as he leads a resistance to protect his home and his honor. \n\n\t“Kida Khodr Ramadan brings an unmatched intensity and authenticity to this role,” Laprell and Kreuzer said in a statement, positioning him as “the perfect force to embody the spirit of Goethe’s most defiant rebel.” \n\n\tThe film marks a high-profile return to classical material for director Nuran David Calis – the son of Armenian-Jewish immigrants from Turkey –  whose previous cinematic adaptation of Georg Büchner’s “Woyzeck” — starring Tom Schilling and Nora von Waldstätten — earned critical acclaim for its bold, modern vision. \n\n\tWith “GÖZ,” Calis aims to bridge the gap between 18th-century “Sturm und Drang” and the socio-political tensions of modern-day Germany.\n\t\n\n\tThe producers also point to Calis’ “Woyzeck” as a reference point for how he translates canonical material into a modern register.\n\n\t“GÖZ” also extends Maze’s broader positioning as a German independent with an outward-facing, international co-production profile. \n\n\tThe company’s producer credits include Rupert Everett’s Oscar Wilde biopic “The Happy Prince” (starring Everett and Colin Firth), the Daniel Radcliffe-led action-comedy “Guns Akimbo” and Abel Ferrara’s “Siberia,” toplined by Willem Dafoe. Maze has also been involved in “Rumours,” an ensemble comedy featuring Cate Blanchett and Alicia Vikander.\n\n\tOn the TV side, Maze has toggled between local commissioning and multi-territory structures, including the German-Dutch-Norwegian fantasy series “Heirs of the Night” and the France 2-linked bestseller adaptation “The Crimson Rivers,” now in its fourth season. \n\n\tThe company’s “Sunshine Eyes” won the Special Jury Prize at Series Mania and later streamed on Netflix, while Bavarian series “Himmel, Herrgott, Sakrament” launched strongly on German TV and is currently streaming on Amazon.\n\n\tThrough subsidiary Supernix, Maze has also participated in high-profile international productions toplined by major English-language stars, including “Nine Perfect Strangers” Season 2 (headlined by Nicole Kidman) and “Cliffhanger” (with Pierce Brosnan and Lily James), reinforcing the company’s role as a cross-border partner on cast-driven packages.\n",

    "body": "\n\tInternational sales and production company EST N8 has acquired worldwide rights to “Janur Ireng: Sewu Dino the Prequel,” a supernatural horror feature from Indonesian filmmaker Kimo Stamboel and MD Pictures. The deal was revealed at Berlin’s European Film Market.\n\n\tThe deal, which excludes Indonesia and Taiwan with selective rights available in Southeast Asia, was negotiated between MD Pictures and EST N8 executives Sophie Shi and Cathy Ni.\n\t\n\n\tStamboel’s prequel expands the horror universe established in the Southeast Asian blockbuster “Sewu Dino,” exploring the origins of the supernatural curse that drives the franchise. The completed film premiered in Indonesia on Dec. 24, 2025, and is now being presented to international buyers at EFM.\n\n\n\tSet years before the original film’s events, the story delves into dark rituals and ancient forces that awaken the terrifying entity, examining the human sacrifices connected to its power.\n\n\tStamboel has built an international reputation through genre films including “Sewu Dino,” “The Queen of Black Magic” and “Headshot.” He also directed MD Pictures’ “Dancing Village: The Curse Begins,” Southeast Asia’s first filmed-for-Imax production, which landed a U.S. distribution deal with Lionsgate.\n\n\t“We are excited to continue our collaboration with top Indonesian genre talent and expand the ‘Sewu Dino’ universe for global audiences,” said Shi, head of EST N8 studios. “Kimo Stamboel is one of the most dynamic horror directors working today, and Janur Ireng delivers the scale and mythology that international fans are looking for.”\n\t\n\n\tEST N8’s current sales slate includes English-language suspense drama “Dear Stranger” featuring the cast of “Drive My Car,” horror titles “The Invisible Half,” “The Hole,” “Pabrik Gula,” “Sorop,” “Hutang Nyawa” and “Perewangan,” Kongkiat Komesiri’s thriller “Delivery Man,” Fantasia best director award-winning Korean action film “Mash Ville,” Korean horror thriller “Chabak” and Cantonese-language thriller “Tape,” based on Richard Linklater’s Sundance film.\n\n\tFounded in 2022 by Jaeson Ma and Eric Tu, EST Studios represents Asian content in the international marketplace. The company’s production credits include Oscar-shortlisted, Emmy-nominated “Hidden Letters” directed by Violet Du Feng, and TIFF selection “K-Pops!” directed by Anderson .Paak.\n\n\tN8, founded in 2023 by Kris Eiamsakulrat and Rachel Y. Wu, operates as an independent film and television studio based in Bangkok with offices in New York and Los Angeles. The company co-produced Thai horror “Home for Rent” with GDH and Pawo Choyning Dorji’s “The Monk and the Gun,” which served as Bhutan’s official submission for the 2024 Academy Awards.\n\n\tMD Pictures, the first publicly listed film company on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, has operated as a content powerhouse in Southeast Asia for over two decades. The company released “KKN: Curse of the Dancing Village” in 2022, which became the highest-grossing horror film of all time in Indonesia with over 10 million viewers. MD acquired and launched MDTV in early 2025.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Tehran” producer Dana Eden has died during the Season 4 shoot of the hit Apple TV+ series in Greece. She was 52. \n\n\tNo cause of death has been confirmed but Shula and Donna Productions, the production company Eden founded alongside fellow “Tehran” producer Shula Spiegel, has sought to dispel rumours that her death was politically motivated. “The production company would like to clarify that the rumors suggesting a criminal or nationally motivated death are untrue and completely baseless,” they said in a statement.\n\t\n\n\tEden was one of Israel’s best-known producers and tributes have been paid from across the media and political landscape. Israeli public broadcaster Kan, who co-produce “Tehran,” said in a statement (via Kan News): “We are saddened by the passing of our friend and partner in a long line of productions, series and programs at the Israel Broadcasting Corporation – Dana Eden. Dana was among the senior figures in the Israeli television industry and was a central figure in the creation and leadership of some of the corporation’s most prominent and influential productions.”\n\n\n\t“The fourth season of the series [“Tehran”] is currently being filmed in Greece – a complex and significant production, which Dana came to closely monitor. Her professional work, uncompromising commitment and love of creation have left a deep mark on the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation. Here we share in the heavy mourning of her family, friends and colleagues, and embrace her dear partner, our friend Shula Spiegel.”\n\n\tIsrael’s minister of culture Miki Zohar wrote on X: “With great sorrow, I received the news of the passing of Dana Eden, one of the most prominent and influential producers in the Israeli television industry. Dana left a profound mark on Israeli creation and brought our story to international stages with pride, talent, and courage. I share in the grief of the family, friends, and colleagues. May her memory be blessed.”\n\t\n\n\t“Tehran” follows the adventures of a Mossad agent, Tamar (played by Niv Sultan), as she seeks to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. The series is set entirely in Iran, with Greece used as a stand-in for the Middle Eastern country, with much of the dialogue in Farsi. The third season, which began airing worldwide in January on Apple TV+, was reportedly delayed because of how similar the plotline is to the real events that have been unfolding in Iran over the past year.\n\n\tGreek police are reportedly investigating Eden’s death to rule out anything suspicious.\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tBranded entertainment executives Anthony Damianakis and Pete Fergusson are launching an ambitious startup called IPX headquartered in Dubai, with offices also in London and Sydney.\n\n\tThe innovative startup aims to connect brands with creators, producers, broadcasters, streamers and other content platforms to jointly develop premium content and ownable IP.\n\n\tIPX – which is being touted as the world’s first global marketplace for branded entertainment – is launching with backing from prominent international branded industry figures such as Toby Hack, a former top exec at advertising and marketing conglomerate Omnicom’s PHD Worldwide, and media entrepreneur Juliette Otterburn-Hall, founder and managing partner of the U.K.’s consulting firm Value Squared.  \n\t\n\n\tDamianakis is a former commercial content director at Australia’s Boomtown Pictures and chief growth officer at innovative advertising company The Saudi Agency Network of which Fergusson is CEO and founder. Fergusson previously founded U.K.-based video agency Nemorin Film & Video whose client base included global brands NBCUniversal, Nat Geo, Hugo Boss, McDonalds, Amazon and American Express.\n\n\n\tWhile operating globally, IPX will have a strategic focus on the Middle East, “capitalising on regional production incentives and the region’s growing momentum as a global content and entertainment hub,” according to a statement. “IPX is establishing its global headquarters in the UAE and has deep inroads into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through the Saudi Agency Network,” it added.\n\n\t“Branded entertainment is a $100 billion industry with no real infrastructure,” said Damianakis in the statement. “Deals happen through personal networks, opportunities are invisible unless you’re in the room, and there’s no efficient way for the right brands to find the right creators,” he went on to note. “We are building the global marketplace this industry has needed for years using behavioural science and data insights instead of gut feel and relationships.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Middle East uniquely combines attractive production incentives, ambitious distribution, a can‑do culture, and growing brand investment,” added Fergusson.\n\n\tIPX is launching on Monday (Feb. 16) with a live pipeline of projects that are being kept under wraps and has secured unspecified early agreements from premium IP owners and major international agencies.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHarry Styles has landed his next new gig: festival curator. \n\n\tThe pop star is set to curate Meltdown at London’s Southbank Centre, which bills itself as the “world’s longest-running artist-curated music festival.” He’ll also perform a headline concert at the event, which coincides with the 75th anniversary of the famed riverside venue (and the central location for both the London Film Festival and this weekend’s BAFTA Film Awards).\n\n\n\tWhile no other acts have been yet announced for the 2026 edition of Meltdown, set to run Jun 11-21, it said that Styles would “draw on his broad influences — from pop, soul, electronic and rock to underground scenes and emerging young British talent.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m deeply honoured to curate the Meltdown festival, especially for the Southbank Centre’s 75th anniversary year. My goal as the curator is to share the music and art that I love, and to celebrate the rich history of the venue,” said Styles. \n\n\t“We both share a passionate belief that music is a vital part of life. It brings us together, and the Southbank Centre has been at the heart of it, providing easy access to great music for the past 75 years. I’m incredibly grateful to Southbank for having me – it’s really exciting for me to have this opportunity in such an iconic venue.”\n\n\tIn 2025, Little Sims curated Meltdown, while previous editions have involved the likes of Robert Smith, Grace Jones and Nile Rodgers. \n\n\tStyles recently announced 30 date at New York’s Madison Square Garden, prompting more than 11 million people to apply for presale access, and a record-breaking 12 nights at Wembley stadium in London.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew series from the “City of God” director Fernando Meirelles and DP Cesar Charlone, plus Angela Chaves, creator of Netflix Spanish-language mega-hit “Desperate Lies,” and “Sissi” co-head writer Robert Krause feature at a high-powered first Series Match, uniting German, Latin American and Spanish producers. \n\n\tOrganized by Iberseries & Platino Industria y Berlinale Series Market, and taking place Feb. 16,  Series Match: Germany and Ibero-America hosts series of undoubted ambition made by often ambitious companies. Having adapted Spain’s “Poquita Fe” for Germany, Berlin-based SKP is expanding, it says,  into premium genre-driven limited series with international ambition and event-scale storytelling. “‘Monika’ is built as a premium international event series,” says  Zeitsprung producer Gala Souvignier.\n\t\n\n\tThese are often genre series, but they are series of substance, thought through at industry and thematic level. \n\n\n\t“‘Assassins in Paradise’ plays with the idea that you can escape geography, but not yourself,” says producer Paula Taborda dos Guaranys.\n\n\t“Through the lens of a psychological thriller, we explore how inherited myths shape identity and how the past persists within contemporary Europe and Latin America. ‘Scorched Earth’ seeks to combine genre tension with emotional and historical depth,” say director-producer Juan Ignacio Sabatini and producer Juan Pablo Sallato at Chile’s Villano. \n\n\tA closer look at most of the titles:\n\n\t“El Abuso,” (Alterna Media, Federation Spain, Ojo Films) \n\t\n\n\t“City” of God” DP Cesar Charlone and co-director Fernando Meirelles re-team for the true story of the dramatic 1971 jailbreak of 101 political prisoners from the Tupamaros, a legendary urban guerrilla group, including Pepe Mújica, who later became President of Uruguay. Written by L.A.-based Ojo Films’ Mariana Santangelo, star of “In This Tricky Life,” toplining Platino Award-winning “Society of the Snow” actor Enzo Vogrincic and “Abuso” is presented at Series Match by Uruguay’s Alterna Media, headed by Maria Laura Berch, co-director of “La Noche Sin Mí” with Natalia Oreiro and Joaquín Romero Vercellino (“Punta Blanca”).\n\n\t“Assassins in Paradise” (Movioca, Ginga Stories)\n\n\tA married couple of German hitmen reach Bahia for one final job. A spiritual awakening and the tropical paradise tempt them to reinvent themselves as restaurant owners. Yet, their instincts, as local cops close down, pull them back toward the life they’re escaping. “A sun‑drenched action thriller, seasoned with humor, spirituality and the unmistakable flavor of Bahia,” says creator Bruno Bloch (“B.O”). Produced by Brazil’s Movioca, behind flagship format export hit “Drag Me as a Queen,” co-produced with NBC Universal for E! and Barcelona’s Ginga Stories, a premium Europe-Latin America co-pro specialist.\n\n\t“Callback,” (Funicular Films, Left Tackle Films) \n\n\tThe second project at Berlinale Series Market from Funicular Films (“This Is Not Sweden”), also pitching “Robbery, Beating and Death” at Co-Pro Series. Here, it teams with recently launched Left Tackle, headed by Esther Cabrero and Albert Quintela, on a project from Joana and Mireia Vilapuig who broke out as creators with the semi-autobiographical “Selftape.” In “Callback,” at a European film festival, just before her debut feature’s premiere, 30-year-old director Fran publicly accuses her producer and lead actor of abuse. “We question the purpose of public shaming and cancellation when the goal is to build a fairer, more equal world,” the Vailapuig sisters note.\n\n\t“Monika – Victory and Death,” (Zeitsprung Pictures, Mariawood Producciones, Fine Time Filmproduktion)\n\n\tThe extraordinary dramatized true story of the life and death of Monika Ertl, daughter of Leni Riefenstahl’s lover, who, converted in guerrillero-avenger shoots dead Che Guevara’s killer in a political and personal vendetta and attempts to kidnap Klaus Barbie. A robust production and talent package taking in Cologne-based Zeitsprung Pictures, Peter Lohner at Beta Film co-established Fine Time, Verónica Triana, co-creator of Netflix’s “Delirium,” María Elena Wood, creator and producer of “News of a Kidnapping,” and “Sissi” co-head writer Robert Krause.   \n\t\n\n\t“The Runaway,” (SKP Ent.)\n\n\tTo be helmed by Josef Rusnak, behind sci-fi thriller “The Thirteenth Floor,” from Roland Emmerich’s Centropolis,  the real life story of Detlef Kowalewski, 1980s German heavy metal guitarist turned prison breakout artist, finally fleeing to Brazil. “I’ve always been drawn to great adventure stories. But when I read Josef’s take on Detlef Kowalewski’s memoir — especially the prison dialogues and the way he builds loyalty from inside — I realized this wasn’t just a prison-break story,” says producer Alexander Keil. “It’s about a man turning himself into a legend and the cost of believing his own myth. That’s when I knew I was in.” \n\n\t“Scorched Earth,” (Villano)\n\n\tFrom Chile’s Villano, which has “The Red Hanger” at Berlin’s prestigious Perspectives strand. “A young photographer travels to southern Chile to investigate the origins of her family’s fortune, built via German colonization. As she confronts the legendary crime of her great-aunt, known as ‘The Nero Woman,’ long-buried violence begins to resurface,” says the synopsis. “‘Scorched Earth’ is a psychological noir drama that explores how private family myths conceal collective historical trauma,” it adds. Created by Paula del Fierro and Enrique Videla, key writers on “La Jauría.” The project has a completed first draft of the pilot and an expanded series bible.\n\n\t“Seven Women,” (Boutique Filmes, Brazil)\n\n\tUniting creator Angela Chaves whose “Desperate Lies” was a Netflix’s Non-English global No. 1 in 2024, and Boutique, behind 2016’s “3%,” Netflix’s first big non-English international breakout. A reimagining of Brazilian Letícia Wierzchowski’s 2002 novel which inspired Globo’s “A Casa das Sete Mulheres,” sold to over 80 countries which still turns on the women relatives of rebel leader Bento Gonçalves, dispatched to the family ranch during Brazil’s 1835-45 Ragamuffin Revolution. But they will be seen from a “contemporary perspective in which the voices of the female protagonists are highlighted, as well as their journeys of freedom,” says Boutique’s Mariana Coelho.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe industry section of Copenhagen documentary festival CPH:DOX has unveiled the Summit and Conference program, which runs March 16-19. Featured speakers include U.S. filmmaker John Wilson, Emmy nominated three times for “How to With John Wilson,” and U.S. filmmaker Sara Dosa, an Oscar nominee with “Fire of Love.” \n\n\tOther speakers include Malaysia-born director-producer Poh Si Teng, an Emmy winner with “Patrice: The Movie” and whose “American Doctor” was competing at Sundance this year, Irish filmmaker Sinéad O’Shea, whose “All About the Money” was competing at Sundance this year, U.S. editor-writer Joe Bini, an Emmy winner with “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,” and U.S. filmmaker Adam Khalil, a member of the Ojibwe tribe, whose “Aanikoobijigan” won an audience award at Sundance this year.\n\t\n\n\tMara Gourd-Mercado, head of industry and training at CPH:DOX, said they saw the Conference and Summit program as “a moment to come together and reflect on the deep changes and challenges we need to tackle head on as an industry.”\n\n\n\tShe said the program “serves as a hub for bold conversations on challenging conglomerates power over content, securing ‘safe havens’ for independent voices, looking at AI as a tool and redefining our relationship to it.”\n\n\tShe added, “Through hands-on discussions and insights from industry leaders, the program promises to spark fresh ideas and equip filmmakers with tactical tools to bypass algorithms and resist censorship amongst other things.”\n\n\tCPH:DOX SUMMIT (March 16)‘Media Sovereignty: Rethink, Envision, Redefine’This “strategic response to Europe’s democratic recession” aims to “redefine media sovereignty in an era of U.S. platform dependence.” By bridging the gap between investigative journalism and film, these discussions offer documentary professionals “concrete lessons on adaptability and solidarity from media ecosystems operating under immense pressure.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Summit is curated by producer Mark Edwards, Danielle Turkov Wilson, founder and CEO of Think-Film Impact Productions, and researcher Sameer Padania, and is hosted by producer Beadie Finzi. It is presented in collaboration with ARTE.\n\n\tThe program, which opens with a keynote by Bruno Patino, president of ARTE France, “confronts a public-interest media infrastructure that is effectively melting.”\n\n\tThe first session, “The Act of Building: New Infrastructure for Information Ecosystems Under Siege,” examines how “concentrated platform power, opaque algorithms, and information warfare are driving the need for new digital, financial, and physical infrastructures that documentary and media makers can defend and rebuild.”\n\n\tNext is “To Be Seen or Not to Be Seen, That Is the Question: The Strategies We Will Need to Connect, Engage and Inspire Citizens in 2030,” a forward-looking strategy session on how independent creatives and distributors can combine forces to “ensure vital stories still reach citizens in 2030, despite constrained access and rising misinformation.”\n\n\tThe Summit concludes with “Tales From the Frontlines,” featuring Joanna Krawczyk (journalist, Correctiv.Europe), Irma Dimitradze (journalist, Georgia), and Bea Wangondu (journalist/director, “Kikuyu Land’). These practitioners share tactical approaches for resisting censorship and utilizing grassroots innovations – from AI-powered fact-checking to cross-border partnerships – to restore trust and protect local democracy.\n\n\tCONFERENCE DAY ONE (March 17)Day one of the Conference opens with “A Morning With: Poh Si Teng,” dissecting the ethics of directing in conflict zones via her debut “American Doctor,” moderated by Thom Powers (“Pure Non-Fiction”).\n\n\tFollowing this, the program explores the making of “Time and Water” in a conversation with Sara Dosa (director), Shane Boris (producer), and Carolyn Bernstein (executive vice president, documentary films at National Geographic), moderated by Anthony Kaufman (journalist).\n\n\tShifting from the visual to the visceral, “The Art of Listening” then explores “how sonic cinema can unlock radical empathy,” featuring filmmakers Hira Nabi (director, “They (No Longer) Remember”), Onyeka Igwe (director, “Penkelemes”), and Anne Gry Friis Kristensen, moderated by Luke W. Moody (head of the BFI Doc Society Fund).\n\t\n\n\tThe afternoon session, “What Is Truth Anyway,” confronts the structural crisis of reality with Joe Bini (writer, editor, filmmaker) and Sofie Hvitved (head of media at the Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies), moderated by Tabitha Jackson (director of Film Forum, New York).\n\n\tThe day continues with “From Prompt to Protocol: The Making of DoxAI,” a workshop facilitated by the Atmospheric Intelligences Initiative and Doc Society, moderated by Diego Galafassi (director, Climate Story Lab Nordic), that invites the doc community to a “speculative design exercise for an AI system grounded in shared values.”\n\n\tThe program then expands into new storytelling forms with “Multi-Sensory Storytelling,” moderated by Mandy Rose (professor, UWE Bristol), exploring immersive formats that engage smell, touch and positional awareness to “move documentary beyond the screen” together with Ali Adjorlu (associate professor, Aalborg University).\n\n\tCONFERENCE DAY TWO (March 18)Day two begins with “A Morning With: Sinéad O’Shea,” before shifting to challenge the status quo of film language.\n\n\tThe session “Constructing Your Own Cinematic Language” features the “Jaripeo” team, directors Efraín Mojica and Rebecca Zweig, on crafting queer, hybrid aesthetics in rural settings, moderated by the film’s co-producer Elena Fortes.\n\n\tIt then continues with “Rekindling the Machine – Documentary in the Age of AI,” a panel that examines how filmmakers can move from “users” to “architects” of human-centric storytelling, facilitated by Doc Society and the Atmospheric Intelligences Initiative together with Marc Silver (director, “Molly vs. the Machine”).\n\n\tWidening the lens from individual craft to collective narrative responsibility, “We’re All Doomed – Can Hope Survive the Permacrisis?” asks if “we can tell dystopian stories that foster solidarity instead of despair.” Bryan Yazell (associate professor, University of Southern Denmark), Pierre-Christophe Gam (artist, architectural designer) and Maisha Wester (professor in American Cultural Studies, Black Diaspora Studies, Film Studies and Gothic literature) lead this debate on how we face the future together, moderated by Jamie Perera (composer, sound artist and producer).\n\t\n\n\tFollowing this, “What’s Next? Future Perspectives on the Shifting Eco-System of the Creative Documentary” addresses the end of the recent golden age of creative documentaries. This conversation will “seek to identify and unpack the different dynamics at play with a view to understanding what is in store for the future of the funding, financing and circulation of independent nonfiction filmmaking” together with Barbara Truyen (executive producer, EPIC Docs), Chris White (executive producer, American POV), Jon-Sesrie Goff (program officer, Ford Foundation), and Andreas Møl Dalsgaard (CEO, Elk Film).\n\n\tThe day wraps up on a dynamic note as Keith Wilson (producer, artist and director) presents “Plane of Losers,” a live documentary performance that “questions the awards-industrial complex and offers a fresh perspective on success, prioritizing community over competition.”\n\n\tCONFERENCE DAY THREE (March 19)Day three of the Conference begins with HBO cult icon John Wilson, known for his stream-of-consciousness style in “How to With John Wilson.” In conversation with Thom Powers, Wilson will discuss his dry wit and eclectic approach to his latest feature, “The History of Concrete.”\n\n\tThe focus then shifts to “Updated Reflections on Contemporary Palestinian Documentary Filmmaking,” where members of the Palestinian delegation Ashtar Muallem, Dalia Al-Kury and Kinda Kurdi discuss how “diverse cinematic approaches to historic Palestine can heal trauma and act as cultural resistance against erasure.”\n\n\tThe afternoon continues with “Liberatory Image-Making: New Perspectives on Sovereignty and Futurity in Indigenous-Led Nonfiction Cinema,” exploring the future of indigenous-led non-fiction.\n\n\tModerated by Emile Hertling Péronard (producer), speakers Tracy Rector (executive producer at Deenaadai), Johannes Ujo Müller (“Our Flag”) and Adam Khalil (filmmaker, artist) discuss “how indigenous communities determine their own cultural manifestations on screen,” while Inunnguaq Petrussen (CEO, Greenlandic Film Institute) gives a presentation about the newly established and highly anticipated Greenlandic Film Institute and the current situation in Greenland, highlighting “the importance of narrative sovereignty.”\n\n\tFinally, “Position, Privilege and the Epistemic Power of the Gaze: Towards Narrative Positionality” examines the ethics of narrative positionality with Nathan Grossman (director, “Amazomania”), Tess Sophie Skadegård Thorsen (consultant and media/tech ethics expert), and Kiyoko McCrae (program director, Chicken&Egg), moderated by Leonard Cortana (inclusion and partnerships manager, EURODOC). The session asks filmmakers to consider how their closeness or distance to a subject – and their relationship with the people filmed – shapes the story they tell and the on-screen representation of those people.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Outlander” star Rosie Day is set to make her directorial feature debut with “One Hundred and Fifty-Two Days,” an adaptation of Giles Paley-Phillips’ bestselling novel.\n\n\tRoman Griffin-Davis (“Jojo Rabbit”) will star in the film, alongside Alistair Petrie (“The Night Manager”), Alice Lowe (“Timestalker”), Annette Badland (“Ted Lasso”) and Paterson Joseph (“Wonka”).\n\n\n\tTold through a non-linear structure, “One Hundred and Fifty-Two Days” follows BOY as he recovers from pneumonia at the same time his mother is undergoing cancer treatment.

Paley-Phillips has co-written the screenplay with Elizabeth Morris (“Above the Below”). Content Now Studios are repping global sales.\n\n\n\t“Adapting ‘One Hundred and Fifty-Two Days’ for the screen has been a deeply personal process,” said Paley-Phillips. “I’m grateful to be collaborating with such an exceptional creative team to bring this story to life.”\n\n\tDay said: “I’m thrilled to be a part of this brilliant team, telling a timely story of grief, hope, and the power of human resilience. ‘One Hundred and Fifty-Two Days’ is a sucker punch to the heart, in all the best ways. I’ve never laughed and cried on the same page of script before, and I can’t wait to see this truly remarkable cast bring this story to life”\n\t\n\n\tHeather Greenwood, who is producing the pic, added: “We’re excited to be launching sales on ‘One Hundred and Fifty-Two Days’ with our trusted partners at Content Now Studios, with an exceptional cast headed by Roman Griffin-Davis. Rosie Day’s debut feature is a beautifully intimate, intergenerational drama, and filming in Lincolnshire is central to the film’s identity, bringing a distinctive sense of place to the story as we take it to the international marketplace.”\n\n\tGreenwood produces for Keal Productions alongside Paley-Phillips for Eight Digits. Executive producers are Guy Avshalom and Camilla Hammer for Content Now Studios with Oliver Mochizuki.\n",

Saxon sued Kanye, claiming he was hired in September 2021 as project manager, caretaker and 24/7 security for Kanye's Malibu property. In the lawsuit, Saxon alleges he worked brutal 16 hour days and was forced to sleep on the floor using a coat as makeshift bedding while overseeing the remodel.\n      \n    \n          Saxon claims things spiraled in November 2021 when Kanye allegedly demanded he remove all the home's windows and electricity. According to the suit, Saxon raised safety concerns, warning the moves posed \"extreme danger,\" especially after Kanye allegedly insisted on bringing large generators inside something Saxon feared could spark a fire hazard.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He also claims Kanye threatened him, saying he'd be considered \"an enemy\" if he didn't comply, and told him, \"If you don't do what I say, you're not going to work for me.\" Saxon says he refused and was fired on the spot.\n      \n    \n          Tony's suing for unpaid wages and labor code violations and potentially dragging Bianca into the courtroom drama.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Kanye has denied all allegations. In a November 2023 filing, his attorney argued that even if Saxon suffered damages -- which Kanye does not admit -- they were caused by other parties, not Kanye, and any liability should be reduced accordingly. Kanye also claimed Saxon performed work without his knowledge and asked the court to toss the lawsuit entirely.\n      \n    \n          Stay tuned ...\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

He called Nicola his world and doubled down on his commitment, reinforcing the united front they’ve shown since tying the knot in 2022.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tThe British Academy’s 2026 lineup of Film Awards nominees has no shortage of snubs and surprises. While the likes of “One Battle After Another,” “Sinners,” “Hamnet” and “Marty Supreme” largely did as was expected and dominated the list, further down there was more than enough to raise eyebrows among awards watchers.\n\n\tWith merely five slots in the best film race, there were plenty of features that didn’t make the cut. In the performance categories, however, the sixth space (one more than the Oscars) saw some names not on many frontrunner predictions sneak in. And, as ever, there was some love for British (and Irish — hi Paul Mescal!) stars not reciprocated over the Atlantic.\n\t\n\n\tBelow, we break down the biggest developments from this morning’s announcement.\n\n\n\tSNUB: “Wicked: For Good” misses out in main categories\n\n\tAfter being shut out entirely of the Oscar nominations last week, “Wicked: For Good” didn’t get much love from BAFTA either. Though the sequel earned nods in the costume and hair and make-up categories, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande failed to receive acting nominations and the film also didn’t show up in the best film, director or screenplay lists. How disappointifying! \n\n\tSURPRISE: Paul Mescal nabs a supporting actor nom\n\n\tPerhaps not all that surprising, but Paul Mescal, having missed out on his second Oscar nomination for “Hamnet,” did get a BAFTA supporting actor nomination. After all, he was playing William Shakespeare. This is now Mescal’s third BAFTA Film Awards nod in four years after “Aftersun” and “All of Us Strangers.” While he’s now taking a break to film the Beatles biopics, surely playing Paul McCartney makes him a shoo-in for leading actor (but not until 2029).\n\t\n\n\tSNUB: Guillermo del Toro doesn’t make director cut\n\n\tThough “Frankenstein” star Jacob Elordi nabbed a supporting actor nomination and the film found plenty of love in the craft categories, director del Toro missed out on a directing nod as he did for the Oscars this year. The movie also wasn’t recognized in the best film or adapted screenplay categories, whereas it’s represented in both in the Oscars race. \n\n\tSURPRISE: Chase Infiniti elbows into leading actress race\n\n\tLeave it to BAFTA voters to give a shout out one of the year’s biggest breakouts. While Chase Infiniti couldn’t land a nomination on home turf from the Oscars, the “One Battle After Another” star is now in the running for the leading actress BAFTA (as well as the Rising Star Award).\n\n\tSNUB: Foreign-language films that aren’t “Sentimental Value” miss out\n\n\tThe British Academy has, by and large, been pretty good at recognizing foreign-language films. “All Quiet on the Western Front” smashed records in 2023. But this year, for any film that isn’t “Sentimental Value,” it’s been, well, all quiet. “It was Just an Accident” and “Sirat,” despite Palme d’Ors and critical acclaim, could only make it on the film not in the English language category, and while “The Secret Agent” was also nominated for original screenplay, Oscar nominee Wagner Moura not even making it past the first round of BAFTA voting is a major snub.\n\n\tSURPRISE: “I Swear” earns five nods\n\n\tAs one of the biggest British indie hits of the year in the U.K., “I Swear” was always destined to have some presence at the BAFTAs. But few would have predicted its five nominations, especially two in the performance categories. Lead star Robert Aramayo, alongside a Rising Star nomination for up-and-coming talent, is now a leading actor nominee (in a group alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet), while Peter Mullan is a supporting actor nominee (with the likes of Sean Penn and Jacob Elordi).\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio has joined an elite group of names who have each earned a record seven BAFTA best actor nominations. In doing so he’s also broken a record himself, becoming the youngest to reach that figure. \n\n\tFollowing the BAFTA Film Awards nominations on Tuesday, DiCaprio was, perhaps unsurprisingly, listed in the leading actor category for “One Battle After Another.” But his seventh nomination — after “The Aviator,” “The Departed,” “The Wolf of Wall Street,” “The Revenant” (for which he won), “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and “Don’t Look Up” — puts him among some esteemed company.\n\t\n\n\tOnly six other actors have achieved this feat, including Daniel Day-Lewis, Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier, Jack Lemmon, Peter Finch and Dustin Hoffman. And at 51, DiCaprio is now the youngest to hit the magical number of seven (Hoffman was 52 when he was nominated for “Rain Man”). \n\n\n\tOn home soil in the U.S., where DiCaprio was Oscar-nominated last week for “One Battle After Another,” he also now has seven best actor nominations, plus a supporting actor nod for “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape.” And there he’s also won one, for “The Revenant.”\n\n\tIt should be noted that, when it comes to BAFTA best actress nominations, the achievements of DiCaprio, Day-Lewis, Caine and all pale in comparison to Meryl Streep, who holds that record with 12 nominations.\n\n\tAs for BAFTA nominations across all the performance categories, Streep and Judi Dench tie with 15 each. Dench, meanwhile, goes home with the top crown for most wins, with six. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s an exciting time for Prime Video in the Nordics. The first half of January brought with it the streamer’s first-ever Danish original with “Snake Killer,” and the end of the month will see the launch of Prime Video’s biggest Swedish drama series of 2026, the eagerly-awaited dystopian offering “VAKA.” Below, you will also find an exclusive first look at “Murder in the Dark,” an adaptation of Dan Turèll’s highly lauded gritty Danish noir novel that is coming out later this year.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety ahead of a slate presentation at the Göteborg Film Festival, Amazon MGM Studios/Prime Video’s head of Northern Europe originals Tara Erer said that, over the last few years, their team has been “working with creatives across the three countries where we’re making originals, and a lot of the things we are working on are now hitting.”\n\n\n\t“The development slate is finally coming to fruition,” she added. “We feel extremely strongly in the Nordics, the writing, directing and producing talent there is incomparable. I am energized by it. It’s great for audiences to finally see the really exciting shows that we’ve been working on.”\n\n\tAmazon MGM Studios/Prime Video’s head of Nordic originals, Emilia Widstrand, echoed that thought, saying the Nordics offer “strong broadcasters with whom [we] can collaborate.” She offered a prime example in the upcoming World War II drama “Rinnan,” from Freamtle’s Miso Film,a project developed in collaboration with Denmark’s public broadcaster TV2. “We’ve seen a fantastic result in the editing room. We will continue to do both, our own projects and co-productions, and will take it project by project.”\n\t\n\n\tErer highlighted how there is an “appetite” for Nordic series outside the Nordics. “With other countries, it’s not so prevalent that you would get a lot of attention for languages outside the local country. There is something with the shows we’re making, where we are seeing a lot of interest.” The exec has, however, reiterated how Prime Video’s strategy is “local for local everywhere.”\n\n\t“The great thing here is that local for local can travel,” she adds. “We want to make Swedish shows primarily for Swedish audiences, same for Danish, Norwegians… Then again, there is so much appetite, so much interest, and so many opportunities here in building projects in a way that maybe feels tricky in other countries. We’re open to licensing, we’re open to originals, we’re open to co-productions… The project should be guiding us.”\n\n\tAsked about a generalized perception that major streamers may have closed doors to smaller local creators, both Widstrand and Erer are quick to rebuff that thought. “It’s important for us to show that we’re a strong player in local drama,” said Widstrand, adding that a large part of the reason they travel to markets like Göteborg is to “meet creators, and to build on those relationships.” “It’s been tough times for the industry, so it’s good to see we’re a player who invests in local dramas and is open to different models of working.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Murder in the Dark,” courtesy of Prime Video\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWidstrand offered “Snake Killer” as an example of a great recent creative collaboration, praising series helmer Anders Ølholm as someone with “a lot of integrity in [his] vision.” \n\n\t“We wouldn’t be able to do something interesting with someone if we didn’t trust their creative vision,” continued the exec when talking about the dynamics of their collaboration. “We are trying to earn trust and work together. I meet producers and creators every day to speak about projects, what they are dreaming of working on, and just trying to find synergies and projects that could work for us, as well as let their vision shine through.”\n\n\tErer emphasized how it is precisely the combination of their small localized teams and “brilliant” storytellers that “drives” their work. “But we do hear this a lot, when creators are like: ‘Oh, you are individuals making shows.’ We hear this in every country. What Emilia and her team have created with our local creators is that trust, where they can call them up and say if there is something they don’t agree with. This is why we all got in [this business].”\n\t\n\n\tBoth execs reiterated that there isn’t an inherent final word in their collaborations, guaranteeing that it is always a matter of dialogue between commissioner and creator. “We want to make sure we’re on the same page, so we can make the best show and reach the biggest audiences,” said Erer. “It’s a collaboration. There is no world in which we would ever alienate someone who’s worked for years on a project. We are all in it because of them.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe king is dead. Long live the “King of Fucking Everything”. \n\n\tFinnish director and screenwriter Tiina Lymi will continue her hit show “Queen of Fucking Everything” in an upcoming feature film dedicated to one of its side characters. \n\n\t“I already have a script,” she told Variety at Goteborg, where “Queen” is nominated for the Nordic Series Script Award. Lymi wrote it with Juha Lehtola of East Film.\n\n\n\t“It’s not at all what people might expect. It’s about taking responsibility for your own actions and about guilt. It’s about a man who vanished. When a woman is insecure, she hurts only herself – a man in the same position hurts everybody around him. He hasn’t grown up and he’s obviously not really a ‘King of Fucking Everything’. Once again, it’s an ironic title,” she said. \n\t\n\n\t“Making this film is interesting and I can only do things that interest me. I have a very personal relationship with the ‘guy who leaves’. I’ve always wondered: What the hell? How can people do that, how can they leave their children? My father disappeared, and I always wondered what happened to him. My mother once said: ‘He’s not bad. He’s just weak’.” That sentence has bothered me for, like, 40 years.”\n\n\tApart from the film, a second season of “Queen” – about a real estate agent Linda who turns to crime after her husband suddenly disappears, leaving her drowning in debt – is also moving forward. The show recently won five Golden Venla awards in its native Finland, including best drama series and best screenplay and director for Lymi. \n\t\n\n\t“I don’t have an explanation for why people seem to love the show, but the main thing is that I never do something that already exists. Also, all the characters are relatable, even though they are crazy and terrible. Nobody is just good or bad. Everyone is both, like we all are.”\n\n\tShe added: “When we look at Instagram and see other people’s gorgeous lives, we feel so small. ‘I love my hobby, I love my family, I have so many friends.’ And you are at home, alone and feeling like shit. But if you look behind these pictures, it’s not the truth. There’s a lot going on behind the scenes.” \n\n\tLymi didn’t want to create a show that pretends to be something it’s not. “It’s not a Finnish series trying to be American, or another Nordic something,” she said. Nordic Noir is still the dominant genre in the region. “It’s a hybrid of drama with some thriller elements and pitch-black humor. I had a clear vision and followed it.”\n\n\tLinda – played by Laura Malmivaara – isn’t the only fascinating female character Lymi has recently delivered, with her box-office smash “Stormskerry Maja,” set in the 19th century, further cementing her transition from acting to directing. \n\n\t“As a writer and director, I don’t just write about women: I write about people. But, as women, we do carry a lot of weight. Even the adjectives used to describe women are totally different. If a man is bossy, he’s ‘determined.’ A woman is a ‘difficult’ bitch,” she stated. \n\n\t“We are being observed, and we are being judged. Especially if you succeed – then you’re a witch. And witches get burned.” \n\n\tInterestingly enough, Lymi will soon move on to another TV series that she wrote, under working title “The Punisher,” and another female character. \n\n\t“She’s in her fifties, a lovely person who gives everything to others and doesn’t take anything for herself. And then… she stops doing it. There will be blood,” teased Lymi. \n\n\t“She has a small, beautiful world. It all happens in the countryside. She’s a makeup artist and a hairdresser who dreams of becoming a nail artist. She wants to do beautiful nails adorned with palm trees and diamonds. But there’s a bad man in the village who destroys everything. And she stops being nice.”\n\t\n\n\tStill, Lymi wouldn’t say that rage is always the answer. \n\n\t“I do not wish to be aggressive, but my characters are, for some reason,” she laughed. “Except for Maja. She refuses to hate anyone and I admire her very much. She’s my kind of heroine.”\n\n\t“As women, especially if you’re a boss, you have two options: You can be a silly girl or a mother. We don’t wear corsets anymore, but we sort of do. We operate within a very narrow space.”\n\n\t“In the Nordic countries, we have laws that say that everybody is equal, women should be paid as much as men, and you can’t beat your wife. But it’s a very small corner of the world and we haven’t had those laws for long. If we don’t talk about it, they can vanish again.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe escalating “One Battle After Another” and “Sinners” duel is heading to the U.K., with the two films — both from Warner Bros. — emerging atop the pack of BAFTA Film Award nominees.  \n\n\tFollowing Tuesday’s announcement, Paul Thomas Anderson’s political satire leads the way with 14 nominations overall, just two shy of the record set by “Gandhi” and leveling with “All Quiet on the Western Front,” “Atonement,” “The King’s Speech” and “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.”  \n\t\n\n\tRyan Coogler’s historical horror, meanwhile, has 13 nominations, the highest for any film by a Black director in BAFTA history. The film gives Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan their first trip to BAFTAs as nominees.\n\n\n\tJust below, “Hamnet” and “Marty Supreme” both came away with 11 nominations, with Timotheé Chalamet returning to BAFTA’s leading actor race for a second year in a row. While “Hamnet” may be flying the flag for the U.K., Chloe Zhao’s film now also has the highest number of BAFTA nominations from a female director (Zhao, it should be noted, is the only woman to land a director nomination this year). \n\n\t“One Battle After Another,” “Sinners,” “Hamnet” and “Marty Supreme” are all in the five-strong best film category, alongside “Sentimental Value” (which also gives Stellan Skarsgard his very first BAFTA nominations at the age of 74).  \n\n\tSo far, so slightly predictable, perhaps. The top four nominated films were the same top four films following the first round of BAFTA voting. But further down, there are a few selections likely to further delight the British industry beyond the success “Hamnet.”\n\t\n\n\tLocal indie titles “I Swear,” “Pillion” and “The Ballad of Wallis Island” made good on their promising showings at the longlist stage, muscling their way out of the outstanding British film category into other key awards — including leading actor in the case of “I Swear” star Robert Aramayo (also pulling double duty as a Rising Star nominee). All three films made it into the screenplay categories.  \n\n\tThere was plenty of love too for other homegrown stars, including Paul Mescal and Emily Watson from “Hamnet,” Wunmi Mosaku from “Sinners” and Carey Mulligan from “Wallis Island.” \n\n\tAs for the snubs, “Frankenstein” landed an excellent eight nominations but didn’t make best film or director, while “Wicked: For Good” scored two for costume and makeup & hair (but still two more than the Oscars).  \n\n\tThe BAFTA Film Awards take place on Feb. 22 at London’s Royal Festival Hall, with Alan Cumming on hosting duties.  \n\n\tSee the full list of nominees below. \n\n\tBEST FILM “Hamnet” — Liza Marshall, Pippa Harris, Nicolas Gonda, Steven Spielberg, Sam Mendes “Marty Supreme” — Timothée Chalamet, Anthony Katagas, Eli Bush, Ronald Bronstein, Josh Safdie “One Battle After Another” — Adam Somner, Sara Murphy, Paul Thomas Anderson “Sentimental Value” — Maria Ekerhovd, Andrea Berentsen Ottmar “Sinners” — Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian, Ryan Coogler \n\n\tDIRECTOR  “Bugonia,” Yorgos Lanthimos “Hamnet,” Chloé Zhao “Marty Supreme,” Josh Safdie “One Battle After Another,” Paul Thomas Anderson “Sentimental Value,” Joachim Trier “Sinners,” Ryan Coogler \n\n\tLEADING ACTRESS Jessie Buckley, “Hamnet” Rose Byrne, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” Kate Hudson, “Song Sung Blue” Chase Infiniti, “One Battle After Another” Renate Reinsve, “Sentimental Value” Emma Stone, “Bugonia” \n\n\tLEADING ACTOR Robert Aramayo, “I Swear” Timothée Chalamet, “Marty Supreme” Leonardo DiCaprio, “One Battle After Another” Ethan Hawke, “Blue Moon” Michael B.

    "body": "\n\tThe nominees for the 2026 BAFTA Film Awards are set to be unveiled on Tuesday.\n\n\tAs Variety exclusively revealed, “Industry” and “Rye Lane” star David Jonsson (last year’s BAFTA Rising Star winner) and “The White Lotus” breakout Aimee Lou Wood are set to host the nominations announcement. The British actors will unveil the full list of nominees for this year’s Film Awards on BAFTA’s YouTube channel and X account starting at 12 p.m. U.K. (4 a.m. PT/ 7 a.m. ET), streaming live from the BAFTA headquarters in London.\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s BAFTA Film Awards longlists were led by Paul Thomas Anderson’s epic “One Battle After Another,” which broke the record for longlist mentions with 16 nods. “Hamnet,” Chloe Zhao’s Shakespearean tragedy starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, and Ryan Coogler’s horror hit “Sinners” followed with 14 mentions apiece. \n\n\n\tNotably, this year’s BAFTA Film Awards nominations are being announced after those for the Oscars, which were revealed last week. In an interview with Variety, BAFTA CEO Jane Millichip said it’s “nice to have Oscar being a bellwether for BAFTA.”\n\n\tHowever, she pointed out that the BAFTA Film Awards ceremony on Feb. 22 is still before the voting window closes for the Oscars, which will take place on March 15.\n\n\t“The switch around with nominations is simply a consequence of dates,” she said. “But I certainly don’t think it makes us less relevant. What happens on Feb. 22 is particularly relevant to everyone at the Academy.”\n\n\tThe BAFTA Film Awards ceremony is on Feb. 22 at London’s Royal Festival Hall, with “Traitors” presenter Alan Cumming serving as host.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the BAFTA Film Awards nominations live below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTving is stepping up its global expansion, launching a new slate of Korean dramas across Japan and the Asia-Pacific region as it deepens its role as an international K-content hub.\n\n\tThe CJ ENM-owned streaming platform has secured a fresh lineup of K-dramas premiering this year, to be released through dedicated Tving-branded sections on Disney+ Japan and HBO Max across 17 countries and territories in Asia-Pacific.\n\n\n\tThe Tving-branded section is a K-content-focused space curated by the streamer for global streaming audiences. The initiative marks the first time the branded hub will feature non-Tving original series produced by external broadcasters, expanding the breadth and diversity of Korean titles available to international viewers.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the representative titles are MBC’s Friday–Saturday drama “The Judge Returns,” produced by OH Story and Slingshot Studio, which premiered Jan. 2, and JTBC’s upcoming series “The Practical Guide to Love,” produced by SLL and scheduled for release Feb. 28. Both titles are available exclusively on Tving for local audiences while being positioned as key offerings in the “Tving Collection” on Disney+ Japan and within the Tving-branded hub on HBO Max in Asia-Pacific markets.\n\n\tEarly audience response has been positive. “The Judge Returns” ranked third on Disney+ Japan in its first week of release, per data shared by CJ ENM. \n\n\t“Beyond original content, Tving is strengthening its role as a global K-content hub that introduces competitive TV series from Korean production companies and broadcasters to global audiences,” a Tving official said. “We will continue to promote the distribution and expansion of K-content based on global partnerships.”\n\t\n\n\tSebastian Kim, head of CJ ENM’s content distribution business unit, said: “We believe in the power of sympathetic storytelling that K-content can present, which will eventually resonate as a universal language.” He added that by forming “healthy distribution channels between production studios and global OTT [streaming] platforms,” the company aims to consistently expand opportunities for Korean content to debut worldwide.\n\n\tTving began targeting overseas markets last year through a branded-section expansion strategy anchored in global partnerships. Since Nov. 4, 2025, Disney+ Japan has been offering Korean content curated by Tving through its “Tving Collection” and “Recommended Korean Dramas” sections. HBO Max also launched its Tving-branded hub on Jan. 2 this year in 17 Asia-Pacific territories, featuring exclusive Tving originals alongside a broader slate from CJ ENM and Tving. \n",

    "description": "\n\tOne of Scandinavia’s most ambitious – and anticipated – TV drama series, historical epic “Royal Blood” from Fremantle’s Nordic powerhouse Miso Film,",
    "body": "\n\tOne of Scandinavia’s most ambitious – and anticipated – TV drama series, historical epic “Royal Blood” from Fremantle’s Nordic powerhouse Miso Film, has secured a production commitment from the Scandi Alliance of TV2 Norway, TV4 Sweden and TV 2 Denmark.\n\n\tScandi Alliance has confirmed the budget for the six-part series as €15 million ($17.8 million), certainly very substantial for Scandinavia. Fremantle will handle international distribution. The series is now expected to start shooting early 2027.  \n\t\n\n\tBoasting extensive experience on helming episodes of high-end dramas such as “The Crown,” as well as ITV Studios’ “I Fought The Law” and TV2’s “Occupied,” Norway’s Erik Richter Strand is attached to direct the premium mini-series.    \n\n\n\tThe production greenlight and Richter Strand’s attachment were revealed on Jan. 27 by TV2 Norway drama head Alice Sommer at the Göteborg Film Festival’s TV Drama Vision conference, kicking of a new phase of international financing.  \n\n\tOriginally announced one year ago at TV Drama Vision as the Scandi Alliance’s first joint drama bet, chosen from 75 Scandinavian submissions, “Royal Blood” was then in early development, set up at Miso Film Norway, part of Miso Film. \n\n\tIn it, as France’s Napoleon challenges Europe’s other great powers, “Royal Blood” depicts the dramatic power struggles between the Scandinavian royal houses over 1807-14. “A small group of ambitious figures in Denmark, Norway  and Sweden are forced to navigate desire, loyalty, identity and ambition in a world where every personal choice carries national consequences,” the synopsis runs. \n\t\n\n\t“Royal Blood” is created by Nanna Westh (“The Legacy,” “Cry Wolf”), Richter Strand, Monica Boracco (“Mars & Venus”) and Katarina Launing (“Battle”). Westh and Richter Strand serve as head writers. \n\n\tThe series is produced for TV2 Norway, TV4 Sweden and TV2 Denmark, by Kristin Ulseth and Vegard Stenberg Eriksen for Miso Film Norway, in close collaboration with Miso Film Denmark and Miso Film Sweden. Peter Bose, Jonas Allen, Christian Rank, Are Heidenstrøm and Richter Strand executive produce. \n\n\t“‘Royal Blood’ is a truly epic undertaking that explores how power, loyalty and personal ambition collide at a pivotal moment in Scandinavian history,” said Sommer. “This is a story that belongs to all of us – Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. ‘Royal Blood’ captures a defining moment when our nations’ fates were intertwined in ways that still shape who we are today.” \n\n\tShe added: “We’re incredibly proud to back this ambitious production as the Scandi Alliance’s first flagship series. With Erik Richter Strand at the helm and Miso Film’s proven track record in premium drama, we’re confident this series will resonate deeply with contemporary audiences while setting a new benchmark for Nordic historical drama.”\n\n\tFounded by Danish producer duo Jonas Allen and Peter Bose, Miso’s proven track record in premium drama is built on series such as Tobias Lindholm’s “The Investigation,” Netflix’s firs Danish original series “The Rain,” Christopher Boe’s inventive “Warrior” and “1864,” a devastating fiction indictment of Denmark’s governing elite.\n\n\t“‘Royal Blood’ is about how power really works and how alliances are built and broken, and how the fate of entire nations can hinge on very human choices. At its heart, it’s driven by fear, pride, vulnerability and courage, where even small decisions can have huge consequences,” said producer Kristin Ulseth at Miso Film. \n\n\tShe added: “Even though it’s set in the past, the story feels incredibly current, making it both a gripping drama and an unsettling mirror of our own times. With Erik Richter Strand attached and not least his experience on ‘The Crown’ we feel confident that ‘Royal Blood’ will have scale and intimacy in a cinematic and deeply relatable way.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will have a security role during the upcoming Milan Cortina Winter Games in Italy, according to several reports.\n\n\tICE and the U.S. embassy in Rome have confirmed to the Associated Press and France’s AFP that ICE agents will be traveling to Italy for the upcoming Feb. 6-22 Winter Games, but only in a capacity of supporting diplomatic security details.\n\n\n\t“At the Olympics, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations,” ICE said in a statement, according to AFP.\n\t\n\n\t“All security operations remain under Italian authority,” the statement added, noting that “obviously, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations in foreign countries.”\n\n\tNews of the presence of ICE agents at the Winter Olympics had been swirling in Italy over the weekend, with Italian authorities saying they had no knowledge of this or downright denying it.\n\n\tThe prospect of ICE agents in Italy following the recent killings of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis has sparked strong polemics. On Tuesday, Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said that ICE agents were “not welcome.”\n\n\t“This is a militia that kills … It’s clear that they are not welcome in Milan, there’s no doubt about it. Can’t we just say no to Trump for once?” the mayor said in an interview with Italy’s RTL 102.5 radio.\n\n\tU.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are scheduled to attend the opening ceremony in Milan on Feb. 6.\n",

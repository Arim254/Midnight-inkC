    "body": "The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures hosted its fifth annual gala at the Academy Museum in Los Angeles last night in support of the museum’s education initiatives, public programming and future exhibitions. This year’s Gala raised over $12 million in donations for the general public and the local community of Los Angeles. \nThe gala was presented in partnership with Rolex, a founding supporter and official watch partner of the Academy Museum. The gala was co-chaired by Jon M. Chu, Common, Viola Davis, Julius Tennon, Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, Jennifer Hudson and Academy Museum Trustee Alejandro Ramírez Magaña.\nThe event honored four important voices in the entertainment industry for their contributions to film, both past and present. The first presenter of the night was Wim Wenders, who presented director Walter Salles with the Luminary Award. The Vantage Award was presented by Jon M. Chu to actor and comedian Bowen Yang, alongside Zoe Saldaña, who presented the Icon Award to actress Penélope Cruz during the night. The final award, the inaugural Legacy Award, was presented by Martin Scorsese to musician Bruce Springsteen. \nGeorge Clooney introduced a musical performance by Bruce Springsteen, where he closed out the event singing “Streets of Philadelphia,” “Atlantic City” and “Land of Hope and Dreams.”\nThe Icon, Legacy, Luminary and Vantage Awards were designed by the Haas Brothers and fabricated by UAP. The awards are solid cast bronze, hand-polished, hand-stamped and triple plated in nickel, copper and 24k gold.  \nThe event design was conceived by Keith Baptista, with talent relations overseen by Special Projects. \nSee the best looks from the 2025 Academy Gala below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharli xcx\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharli xcx wears YSL.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKim Kardashian\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKim Kardashian wears Maison Margiela by Glenn Marten.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJacob Elordi\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJacob Elordi wears Bottega Veneta.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Rodrigo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Rodrigo wears Armani Privé.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSelena Gomez\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSelena Gomez attends the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJenna Ortega\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJenna Ortega wears Grace Ling.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Zegler\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Zegler wears Tamara Ralph.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDamson Idris\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDamson Idris at the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Sennott\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Sennott wears Balenciaga.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAyo Edebiri\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAyo Edebiri wears Chanel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElle Fanning\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElle Fanning wears Balenciaga.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHailey Bieber\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHailey Bieber wears Schiaparelli.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tViola Davis\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tViola Davis wears Gucci.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGreta Lee\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGreta Lee wears Dior.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDemi Moore and Lucy Liu\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDemi Moore and Lucy Liu attend the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMilly Alcock\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMilly Alcock wears Harris Reed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMikey Madison\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMikey Madison wears Dior.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMartin and Francesca Scorsese\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMartin and Francesca Scorsese attend the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSydney Sweeney\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSydney Sweeney wears Giorgio Armani.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSeth Rogen and Lauren Miller Rogen\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSeth Rogen and Lauren Miller Rogen attend the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tNo one would have expected Taylor Swift‘s “The Life of a Showgirl” to lose its grip on the album chart in week 2, and it indeed held on at the top of the Billboard 200, with 338,000 equivalent album units in its second week out. \n\n\tLast week, Swift set a record in the Luminate/Soundscan-era data-keeping books with 4.002 million units. Although this week’s figure marked a predictably significant drop-off from that record-buster, even the second week for “Showgirl” ranked as the fifth best week for any album this year, per Billboard and Luminate. The only albums that had a higher number than 338,000 units in a single frame this year were first-week figures for releases from Wallen (who opened with 493,000), the Weeknd (who started with 490,000), Sabrina Carpenter (which started with 366K) and, of course, Swift’s own debut tally.\n\t\n\n\tBreaking down that 338K figure for Swift’s second week, 101,000 of those units came in the form of pure album sales, Billboard reported. That sales figure represented the biggest drop for “Showgirl” in week 2, down 97%, after a first week that included all the pre-sales for the album, plus a number of release-week-only variants. Nonetheless, 101,000 is a pure-sales figure that few contemporary albums ever reach in a week, and “Showgirl” had little competition in easily standing atop Billboard’s separate Top Album Sales chart for a second week. \n\n\n\tStreaming had a stronger hold, down from the juggernaut first-week figure by only 55%. The album’s tracks picked up a still-staggering 307.59 million on-demand official streams, which calculated out in the chart formula to 236,000 SEA (streaming equivalent album) units. Needless to say, “Showgirl” didn’t have any challengers in returning to No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Streaming Albums chart.\n\t\n\n\tWallen’s “I’m the Problem” spent a dozen nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 this year. That’s a run at the top of the Billboard 200 that Swift will no doubt be hoping to match in the coming months. Looking at the release schedule, it appears as if there won’t be a lot standing in the way of an extended reign, as there are no further obvious pop blockbusters currently scheduled to come out between now and the end of 2025, barring any last-minute surprises from a superstar.\n\n\tWith no music stars interested in putting albums out right now in Swift’s shadow, there were no new entries in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for the week ending Oct. 10.\n\n\tThe only relatively fresh blood on the chart is in Olivia Dean’s “The Art of Loving,” which debuted at No. 8 two weeks ago, then rose one spot to No. 7 last week, and is up yet one more spot to No. 6 in week 3. The latest weekly tally for the album is 36,000 equivalent album units, up 5% from the previous week.\n\n\tEverything else in the top 10 is very familiar fare — perhaps overly familiar, for some tastes. Following Swift near the top of the list are the “KPop Demon Hunters” soundtrack at No. 2 (104,000 units), Wallen’s “I’m the Problem” at No. 3 (79,000 units), Cardi B’s “Am I the Drama?” in fourth place (50,000) and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Man’s Best Friend” in the No. 5 spot (45,000)\n\n\tFollowing Dean at No. 6 are Bad Bunny’s “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” in seventh place (33,000 units), SZA’s “SOS” at No. 8 (32,000), Alex Warren’s “You’ll Be Alright, Kid” — not to be confused with Swift’s “You’re on Your Own, Kid,” of course — at No. 9 (32,000) and, finally, a second Wallen mega-seller, “One Thing at a Time,” in 10th place (31,000).\n\n\tResults for the Hot 100 will come in Monday, with Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia” expected to repeat at the top there as well.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJacob Elordi is teasing the highly anticipated third season of “Euphoria.”\n\n\t“It was incredible, man,” the actor told me Saturday on the Academy Museum Gala red carpet. “It was incredibly liberating. I got to play something so sort of far out from what I’ve done before.”\n\n\tHe said that series creator Sam Levinson “constructed something that’s incredibly clever and cinematic. I think people are really going to like it.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever, Elordi insists he doesn’t actually know exactly what happens in Season 3.\n\n\t“Everybody shoots at different storylines,” Elordi said. “I don’t know what anyone else is doing. I had a really singular storyline. You don’t know what the other story lines are. It’s like FBI files. So it’s great because I’ll get to consume the show the same way that everybody else does as a fan, which I haven’t been able to do before. I’m really excited.”\n\n\tElordi also wanted to clear up a news story that reported he said that Season 3 was entirely shot in VistaVision. “I did not say that, that is not true,” he said, adding, “It’s shot on a lot of different kinds of film and it’s beautiful.”\n\n\tReps at Warner Bros. did not respond to Variety‘s request for comment regarding the use of VistaVision. \n\n\t“Euphoria” follows a group of high school students who orbit around Rue (Zendaya), a drug-addicted teenager who must navigate intense social dynamics, family drama and staying clean after rehabilitation. Season 2 aired in 2022. Across its first two seasons, the show received 25 Emmy nominations and won nine awards.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Elordi, returning cast members include Zendaya, Hunter Schafer, Eric Dane, Sydney Sweeney, Alexa Demie, Maude Apatow, Martha Kelly, Chloe Cherry, Dominic Fike, Colman Domingo and Kika King.\n\n\tTrisha Paytas, Natasha Lyonne, Danielle Deadwyler and Eli Roth have joined for Season 3, as have Bella Podaras, Bill Bodner, Cailyn Rice, Colleen Camp, Gideon Adlon, Hemky Madera, Homer Gere, Jack Topalian, Jessica Blair Herman, Kwame Patterson, Madison Thompson, Matthew Willig, Rebecca Pidgeon and Sam Trammell.\n\n\tElordi is currently in the midst of a promotional and awards campaign blitz for Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein.” Elordi stars in the Netflix film as the monster alongside Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein.\n\n\t“[Netflix CEO] Ted Sarandos said to me before I started the film, ‘You’re so lucky you’re going to get to work with a kind genius and that’s a rare thing,’” Elordi recalled. “A kind genius is a rare thing. He is the kindest of geniuses.”\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tUniversal and Blumhouse’s horror sequel “Black Phone 2” kicked off spooky season with $26.5 million from 3,411 North American theaters. Those ticket",
    "body": "\n\tUniversal and Blumhouse’s horror sequel “Black Phone 2” kicked off spooky season with $26.5 million from 3,411 North American theaters. Those ticket sales were enough to lead an otherwise sleepy weekend at the domestic box office.\n\n\t“Black Phone 2” opened in line with expectations and slightly ahead of its predecessor. The original “Black Phone” launched with $23 million in 2022 as cinemas were only starting to recover from COVID. Just to give a sense of the vastly different box office landscape between the first and second film: With similar ticket sales, “Black Phone” opened in fourth place behind “Elvis,” “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Jurassic World: Dominion” in the height of summer movie season.\n\t\n\n\tIn contrast, the “Black Phone” follow-up had a sluggish October weekend mostly to itself. This weekend’s other newcomer, Lionsgate’s R-rated comedy “Good Fortune,” opened at No. 3 with just $6.2 million from 2,990 venues. Second place went to Disney’s sci-fi sequel “Tron: Ares” with $11.1 million from 4,000 screens, representing a steep 66% decline from its first outing. Right now, the October box office is down 11% from the same point in 2024, according to Comscore. Meanwhile the overall box office is 4% above last year but more than 20% below pre-pandemic times.\n\n\n\t“Black Phone 2” also collected $15.5 million at the international box office for a global tally of $42 million. Though a promising result, Universal and Blumhouse spent more to bring back Ethan Hawke as the serial killer known as the Grabber. The sequel cost $30 million compared to the first film’s $18 million price tag. “Black Phone 2” has decent reviews but wasn’t received as fondly as the original by moviegoers; this film earned a “B” grade on CinemaScore exit polls while the first landed a “B+” grade. \n\t\n\n\t“We’ve seen word-of-mouth grow over the weekend,” says Universal’s president of domestic distribution Jim Orr. “The reasons are simple: Blumhouse and director Scott Derrickson have crafted something that’s terrifying, with a great cast. It’s just what audiences want to see in theaters.”\n\n\tSince ticket sales are split roughly 50-50 between studios and movie theaters, “Black Phone 2” needs to stick around to count as a major comeback for Blumhouse. The low-budget horror empire, responsible for “Paranormal Activity,” “The Purge,” “Get Out” “Halloween” and other franchises with scary-good profit margins, has long been one of Hollywood’s most consistent hitmakers. However the company’s fortunes have shifted over the past year with one dud after another including “Wolf Man” and “M3GAN 2.0.” Blumhouse has another sequel, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” on the calendar in December.\n\n\t“Good Fortune” has the good fortune of respectable reviews (78% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a “B+” grade on CinemaScore). The trouble is that not enough people were incentivized to buy tickets for the $30 million-budgeted film. Aziz Ansari directed in his feature debut and stars in “Good Fortune,” which revolves around a good-intentioned but inept angel (Keanu Reeves) who facilitates a body swap between a struggling gig worker (Ansari) and a wealthy venture capitalist (Seth Rogen).\n\n\t“This is a fair opening for an original character-driven comedy,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. However “even with Keanu Reeves helping ancillary business, the movie is unlikely to recoup its costs.”\n\n\tAnother film that’ll struggle to get out of the red is “Tron: Ares.” So far the futuristic film has earned $54.6 million domestically and $103 million worldwide after two weekends of release. Although the $100 million mark is notable, Disney spent $180 million to produce and many millions to promote the sequel, so “Tron: Ares” requires substantial staying power to justify those costs.\n\n\tChanning Tatum’s dramedy “Roofman” and Leonardo DiCaprio’s action comedy “One Battle After Another” rounded out the top of box office charts.\n\n\t“Roofman” earned $3.7 million from 3,370 theaters in its second weekend, marking a 55% decline from its debut. So far the film has generated $15.5 million and $16.4 million worldwide, a paltry total albiet against a modest $18 million budget.\n\t\n\n\t“One Battle After Another” collected $3.75 million from 2,532 locations in its fourth outing, bringing its domestic total to $61 million. The Warner Bros. film, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, has been a steady performer overseas with $100 million to date, bringing the global total to $162.5 million. That’s an impressive figure for an original, R-rated film that’s nearly three hours long. \n\n\tHowever the studio spent more than $130 million to produce and roughly $70 million to promote “One Battle,” which requires about $300 million to break even. At this rate, the movie is tracking to lose $100 million in its theatrical run, according to studio executives with knowledge of the economics of similar-sized films. (Warner Bros. refutes those estimates.) “One Battle After Another” is, however, expected to be a major Oscar player, which makes it valuable to the company in ways beyond the balance sheet. \n\n\tAnother new release, the Angel Studios drama “Truth and Treason” took sixth place with a tepid $2.7 million from 2,106 theaters. The World War II-set story follows a teenage resistance fighter who opposed the Nazi regime in Germany. Audiences awarded the film an “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls.\n\n\tElsewhere, director Luca Guadagnino’s #MeToo-inspired thriller “After the Hunt” failed to sustain any traction while expanding nationwide. At No. 7, the movie brought in $1.56 million from 1,238 theaters. After one weekend in limited release, “After the Hunt” has amassed just $1.77 million, a dispiriting result for something led by major stars including Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri and Andrew Garfield.\n\n\tIn limited release, Iranian director Jafar Panahi’s Palme d’Or winner “It Was Just an Accident” scored $68,000 from three venues in New York City and Los Angeles, averaging $22,000 per location. The film, released by Neon and expected to be an awards contender, has grossed $115,000 since Wednesday. \n\n\tRichard Linklater’s dramedy “Blue Moon” didn’t fare as well among speciality titles. The movie earned $67,060 from five locations, averaging $13,412 per screen. Hawke also stars in “Blue Moon” (in a very different role from “Black Phone 2”) as songwriter Lorenz Hart as he reflects on the opening night of “Oklahoma,” a new musical by his former collaborator Richard Rodgers.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“I first came to Lucca in 2018, and I thought at the time, it was a sort of a carnival with a lot of people with strange costumes and stuff like that,” film director Manlio Castagna tells Variety. “But when I entered this incredible walled city, I had the feeling it was not just a carnival, but a place where people could be happy with their identities. Lucca Comics & Games is a place where people can be whatever they want to be. They put on masks to show their true selves.”\n\t\n\n\tCastagna is the director of the new documentary “I Love Lucca Comics & Games,” a passionate love letter to the biggest comic convention in Europe. For five days, the medieval Italian town in the heart of Tuscany is transformed into a Cosplay Mecca, with book signings, artist events, screenings, exhibitions and concerts with over 300,000 visitors flooding onto the streets and piazzas.\n\n\n\tUsing the metaphor of the Mandala, Castagna’s film builds a picture gradually piece by piece following the stories of the organizers, the artists and writers, the game designers and film directors, and the fans and how they interact.\n\n\t“This is a movie about communities,” Castagna says. “It’s a place where bridges are more important than walls. It’s important to show how gratitude, for example, is a sort of a glue between normal people, normal in quotation marks, normal people and the community and the artist, the guest.”\n\n\tThere are shots of fans meeting their favorite artists and writers, and what makes it moving is that outside their fandom the stars of the comic book or gaming scene might not be household names and so here they get a taste of the appreciation the fans feel. Having found compelling stories among the fans via social media, Castagna shot throughout the festival with two camera units. An editing bay was made available on site and the festival gave the director access to the VIPs and guests such as the best-selling authors R. L. Stine and Licia Troisi, the rapper Frankie Hi-NRG MC and the comic book artists Pera Toons, Sio, Yoshitaka Amano and Roberto Recchio. “The first day we had a lot of rain and it was difficult but then the sun came out for the following days.”\n\t\n\n\tOne of the most moving stories in the film is the portrait of a father and son bonding over their love of geek culture. “I’ve been going into schools for the last 25 years because I was the vice director of the Giffoni Film Festival for kids. So I connect with the young people, and I’ve seen with my own eyes, how this culture has changed over the years. At the beginning, when I started reading comics, Dungeons & Dragons, the role playing game, was only for a niche of people. In the schools, this kind of art was not seen in a very good way. For example, the two or three kids reading manga would get bullied. Now it’s totally the opposite when I go into the classrooms, all the kids know about this: manga, anime, and D&D. Lucca Comics & Games is a window to see this change, but at the same time it’s the engine of this transformation.”\n\n\tSome of the people included in Castagna’s documentary have their lives transformed by the experience of Lucca. They meet their life partners; they come out; they find friendship and a community. “In fact, the first title that popped up in my mind when I was filming was ‘The Happiness Effect,’ because Lucca has this kind of effect on people. Lucca can affect you as a place full of magic and full of these incredible, special people. For example, people are in the lines for hours and hours, and they are always happy. There are a lot of people, and we never see fighting, or conflict. It’s a wonderful example of how society can be.”\n\n\tComing back to the metaphor of the Mandala highlighted in the film, Castagna explains: “Lucca Comics & Games flourishes from the collective contribution of thousands of people: organizers, exhibitors, artists and the public. It is a collective ritual that, in its composition, reflects the patient construction of the festival itself. But, like the Mandala, the festival is also destined to dissolve. At the end, every element is dismantled, the squares return to emptiness, and the streets resume their rhythm. Nothing remains but the memory and the anticipation of the next edition, when the design can begin to take shape again.”\n\n\tLucca Comics & Games takes place from Oct. 29 to Nov. 2. I Wonder Pictures releases “I Love Lucca Comics & Games” in Italy on Nov. 10.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tIna Garten’s “Be My Guest” returns this Sunday with an all-star lineup and the kind of cozy, conversational charm that made the series a daytime staple. The seventh season premieres Oct. 19 at 11 a.m. ET on Food Network, with new episodes featuring Tina Fey, “Gilded Age” star Christine Baranski, violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman and fashion designer Daniel Roseberry.\n\n\tFor fans looking to stream the new season, the best option is DIRECTV, which offers access to Food Network’s live broadcast and HBO Max, where new episodes become available on demand. DIRECTV’s PREMIER package includes HBO Max at no additional cost, while other DIRECTV streaming and satellite TV plans let subscribers add it for $16.99 a month and they get the first 3 months included at no extra cost. DIRECTV offers three months of HBO Max and along with other premium channels — like Paramount+ with Showtime, Cinemax and STARZ — when signing up for select packages.1\n\t\n\n\tPer Food Network’s description for “Be My Guest” Season 7, “In the season premiere, Ina knows Tina Fey loves custard desserts – so she greets her with Breakfast Panna Cotta.  Tina then shares childhood revelations, standout standup moments and stories about life on the road with her best friend Amy Poehler.  Finally, the duo team up in the kitchen to make a dream dinner of Tina’s Greek Lemon Potatoes served with Ina’s Chicken Thighs with Creamy Mustard Sauce.”\n\n\n\tLater in the season, Baranski will stop by for Maple-Oatmeal Scones, Perlman will try Potato Galette with Smoked Salmon and Roseberry will try Tri-Berry Ricotta Cake.\n\t\n\n\tSince premiering in 2022, “Be My Guest” has helped Garten transcend her Food Network roots to become a full-fledged lifestyle and entertainment figure, blurring the line between culinary television and celebrity interview. The show’s relaxed format — equal parts chat, cooking demo and introspective sit-down interview — has drawn comparisons to longform celebrity conversations like “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction” and “Hot Ones,” positioning Garten as a kind of Hamptons-set cultural interviewer.\n\n\tStream “Be My Guest” Season 7 on DIRECTV here.2\n*w/eligible pkg.

    "body": "\n\tIt’s no big shock to see that commentators on the right, the far right, and the extreme alt-right (I think that covers the waterfront), from Ben Shapiro to film critic Armond White, have pounced on “One Battle After Another,” accusing it of being a “left-wing” movie made for left-wing elites sitting in their left-wing bubble. The forces on the right, led by President Trump, will now say that about almost anything. They treated yesterday’s No Kings protest, with its massive surge of outraged citizens, as if it were some lunatic-fringe collection of hippie terrorists.\n\t\n\n\tIt was a tad more surprising to see the same criticism of “One Battle After Another” made by Bret Easton Ellis, who thinks that reviewers have hailed Paul Thomas Anderson’s film, and overpraised it, “because it really aligns with this kind of leftist sensibility.” Ellis later added on his podcast, “You have the left and the entertainment press propping this movie up to such an absurd degree that it felt unnatural.” I consider myself a fan of Ellis’s (I was a guest on his podcast once), and relish the independence of his voice, so the fact that he isn’t wild about “One Battle After Another” is fine with me. I’m all for debate. But I think that tagging the film with the “leftist” label feeds into the very same cliché mindset that Ellis thinks he’s fighting.\n\n\n\tWhat’s more, if you believe, as I do, that part of the power of “One Battle After Another” is that it is not, in fact, a left-wing movie, it’s important to recognize how that misperception has been fed by a lot of people…on the left. The movie, which is set in an authoritarian America that resembles the one we could be heading toward (it anticipates what the country might start to look like if Trump invokes the Insurrection Act), is centered, for a while, on a ragtag band of revolutionary guerrillas. And since the movie is certainly on their side, I think a lot of the attitude of the entertainment media has been to reflexively treat “One Battle After Another” as if the film itself were raising a revolutionary fist — and as if there were something “left-wing” about attacking authoritarianism. There is not.\n\t\n\n\tThis isn’t merely a matter of semantics. In a strange way, the lionization of “One Battle After Another” as a cinematic manifesto, a movie that sees itself as part of “the resistance” and tips its hat to the glory of being a “radical,” has fed directly into the skewed right-wing view of the film. At times, it’s almost as if the right and the left agree on what “OBAA” is: a romantic salute to revolution. They just don’t agree on where they come down on it.\n\n\tBut see, that word “revolution” is more loaded than people think. And so is “left-wing.” They may just be words, but they have helped to create the lens through which “One Battle After Another” is being viewed. As someone who loved the film, and found it to be a potent statement, but does not consider it a “left-wing” vision, I thought I would try to clarify why “One Battle After Another” should really escape that label, regardless of which side is doing the labeling. Here’s why. \n\n\tThe film borrows the iconography of late ’60s/early ’70s “revolutionaries.” But that world, and the movie’s world, could not be more different. In the film’s opening section, the underground rebels, known as the French 75, are characterized in a way that nods to the counterculture radicals of 55 years ago. One of the film’s most indelible images is that of Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor), in her khakis and boots and open plaid shirt and wool cap, firing a machine gun balanced on her pregnant belly — an image that looks like a Black Panther/Symbionese Liberation Army fever dream. The French 75 launch their insurrectionary acts (bombings, bank robberies, breaking into an immigration-detention facility to free the prisoners) with an overthrow-the-system bravura that nods to that earlier time.\n\n\tBut here’s the difference. The Black Panthers fought for Civil Rights, but by the late ’60s and early ’70s many of the radicals of the counterculture had the stated goal of overthrowing, you know…America. At the time, this was regarded by the overwhelming majority of Americans, including liberals, as an extreme and even crackpot idea. By the time of the rise of the Weather Underground (whose great achievement was accidentally blowing up a Greenwich Village townhouse, killing three of their own members), many of the radicals of the era were starting to look not just extreme but scurrilous.\n\t\n\n\tSo why does “One Battle After Another” pay homage to them? Because they possessed a militant impulse that struck a chord in the popular imagination. Yet the two situations could hardly be more different. At the end of the ’60s, America was not an authoritarian regime. “One Battle After Another,” by contrast, takes place in a police state where the cops and the military have joined forces to patrol an autocratic society, with basic rights stripped away. That is what the French 75 are rebelling against. Does that make them “left-wing”? No, it makes them freedom fighters who are trying to crack a fascist nation back open.\n\n\tHow could anyone think the film starts in 2008? The timeline of “One Battle After Another” might be a little confusing, for several reasons. The film is loosely based on the Thomas Pynchon novel “Vineland,” which is set in the Reagan ’80s; Anderson, looking ahead (the film was shot last year), reconfigured the book into a dystopian projection of what a Trump regime might look like. But a host of progressive critics and writers, obsessed with the idea that the movie is about what’s going on right now, man, have stated that the heart of the action is set quite specifically in the present day. That would mean that the opening 45 minutes, which is set 16 years before that (when the French 75 are going wild), would take place in 2008. But the vision of oppression the movie conjures has nothing to do with the vibe of 2008 (the start of the Obama era). And the power of “OBAA” is that it’s not a literal vision of today. It’s a spiritual projection of where we could land.\n\n\tThe film’s ragtag band of radicals are not glorified. On the contrary, they’re shown to be deeply flawed. This, I think, gets to the heart of why Paul Thomas Anderson has made a movie about radicals that is not, in itself, a piece of firebrand “radicalism.” How imperfect are the French 75? In many ways, the film’s key character is Perfidia Beverly Hills, who’s portrayed as a ruthlessly charismatic rebel leader, until she has her baby (the secret father is Sean Penn’s ramrod-rigid Col. Lockjaw), at which point her lover and partner, Bob Herbert (Leonardo DiCaprio), says: We’re a family now. Our priorities have to pivot away from revolution. Anderson, who has four children with Maya Rudolph, stages this moment with notable conviction. It’s the first thing that makes us take notice of DiCaprio’s character as a morally complex being. But Perfidia is having none of it. She’s placed (by Lockjaw) in the Witness Protection Program, and then hustles over the border to Mexico, leaving the revolution — and, more to the point, her child — behind. The movie does not respect this.\n\t\n\n\tCut to 16 years later. The revolution is in tatters, and Bob is a drug addict sitting around in his bathrobe. He is still, in his way, a devoted father, but apart from that he’s blitzed, navel-gazing, dissipated. This is not a revolutionary we can exactly salute. What’s more, the film’s funniest joke has been widely misinterpreted by media progressives. When Bob calls the French 75 headquarters and keeps failing to remember the proper espionage code phrase (the answer to the question “What time is it?”), many have interpreted this to simply be a sign of how fried his brain is. But that wouldn’t be a funny joke. DiCaprio’s acting in this section — his steam-out-the-ears frustration at the fact that the operator won’t give him a pass on remembering the damn code — is brilliant, and puts the audience right on his side. The bureaucratic fussiness of the operator is clearly meant to be a satire of doctrinaire left-wing rigidity.\n\n\tThe attack on “OBAA” for being “left-wing” could almost be an early salvo in the Oscar race. Speaking of battles, the Academy Awards already look like they’re shaping up to be a four-way war: “One Battle After Another” vs. “Hamnet,” with “Sinners” and “Marty Supreme” coming up on the side. Attacking “OBAA” on ideological grounds sounds like something right out of the anti-“Green Book” playbook. I don’t think that’s where the argument ultimately came from, but it’s one that could easily be exploited by opposing forces.     \n\n\tWhat Is “One Battle After Another” Actually About? It’s the Authoritarianism, Stupid. If you scanned the media coverage of it, you might think “One Battle After Another” was the story of a revolution. It is (sort of). But not really. For 45 minutes or so, it looks like that. But the guerrilla rebellion fails, and while Bob is helped out by Sensei Sergio St. Carlos (Benicio del Toro), the leader of an underground railroad for immigrants, the revolution comes down to a father rescuing his daughter. That’s emotionally powerful, but the portrayal of “resistance” is less potent than the film’s portrayal of authoritarianism itself, and of how directly that connects with what’s happening in America today. The real revolution going on in this country now is the Christian nationalist revolution — an attempt to upend the American Dream and replace it with a theocracy. And the film dares to unveil that; its portrait of the Christmas Adventurers is a chilling vision of hate. That’s all the message the movie needs: that this is happening, that the right-wing revolution is on. And that there are people in America who still want to stop it. To suggest that portraying all that is “left-wing,” even if that’s the side you think you’re on, is to play right into the propaganda. It’s to win the battle of self-righteousness and lose the war.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRobert De Niro is telling Americans to keep protesting against Donald Trump.\n\n\tAfter Saturday’s nationwide No Kings protests, De Niro told MSNBC that the country needs to show “much more” resistance, because that’s “the only thing the politicians are going to recognize.” He added that we need to make lawmakers “more afraid of the wrath of the people” than the “wrath of Trump.”\n\n\t“We can’t let up,” De Niro said. “Cannot let up on him because he is not going to leave the White House. He does not want to leave the White House. He will not leave the White House. Anybody thinks he, oh, he’ll do this, he’ll do that, it’s just deluding themselves.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “The Republicans, most of all, because they know, but they’re going along with it. It’s a classic bully situation. We see it, and there’s no other way to face a bully. You have to face him and fight it out and back them off and back him down. That’s the only way this is going to work.”\n\n\tThe Oct. 18 No Kings protests were joined by nearly 7 million people, according to MSNBC. ICE’s aggressive immigration crackdown remains a key issue in the nationwide demonstrations, as they were during the first No Kings protests in June. National Guard presence in major cities and sweeping cuts to federal programs were also major motivators for participants. \n\n\tDe Niro was one of the many Hollywood mainstays to speak out in support of the No Kings movement. On Oct. 9, he appeared in a video on the TikTok account of political activist group Indivisible to encourage people to attend the No Kings protests.\n\t\n\n\t“The original No Kings protest was 250 years ago,” De Niro said. “Americans decided they didn’t want to live under the rule of King George III. They declared their independence and fought a bloody war for democracy. We’ve had two and a half centuries of democracy since then. Often challenging, sometimes messy, always essential.”\n\n\tHe continued, “Now we have a would-be king who wants to take it away: King Donald the First. Fuck that. We’re rising up again, this time, nonviolently raising our voices to declare: No Kings.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Black Phone 2,” a sequel to Universal and Blumhouse’s 2022 hit slasher film, scared up $42 million at the global box office in its first weekend of release.\n\n\tThose ticket sales included a softer $15.5 million from 71 international territories as well as a leading $26.5 million in the United States and Canada. Top overseas openings were Mexico with $4.3 million, the United Kingdom and Ireland with $1.4 million and Brazil with $1.2 million.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Scott Derrickson, “The Black Phone 2” follows the return of the deranged serial killer known as the Grabber (Ethan Hawke). Initial ticket sales for the second film were slightly ahead of its predecessor, which launched to $13 million overseas and $35.8 million worldwide in 2022. The first “Black Phone,” which cost $18 million, became a sleeper hit with $161 million globally. The sequel, which carries a larger $30 million price tag, shouldn’t have trouble justifying its budget. However, it needs to stick around on the big screen beyond opening weekend to count as a major comeback for Blumhouse. The horror empire has struggled in 2025 with a string of flops, including “Wolf Man” and “M3GAN 2.0.” Another sequel, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” is scheduled for December.\n\n\n\t“Black Phone 2” was this weekend’s only major newcomer at the international box office. Elsewhere, Disney’s sci-fi sequel “Tron: Ares” earned $14.1 million from 52 markets, declining about 50% from its debut. So far, the film has grossed $48.4 million overseas and $103 million globally after two weekends of release. That’s a decent tally, especially for a franchise in its fifth decade — except that Disney spent $180 million to produce and many millions to promote the sequel, so “Tron: Ares” is shaping up to become a major money loser for the studio.\n\t\n\n\tAnother expensive film, Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio’s “One Battle After Another” added $11.8 million overseas, impressively down just 21% from the prior weekend. The Warner Bros. release has generated $100 million internationally and $162.5 million globally. It’s an impressive result for the original, R-rated action comedy (one that’s likely to find itself in the awards race). However, it’s likely to end its theatrical run in the red for Warner Bros., which spent more than $130 million on production and $70 million on promotional efforts.\n",

Mahomes clearly yells out \"This f***ing never f***ing works man\" and stays fully upright -- apparently overcome with frustration to the point he's gesturing toward his sideline in anger.\n      \n    \n          He then crouches again ... and actually runs a play -- a run up the middle by Kareem Hunt for the first down!\n      \n    \n      \n      It’s a Mahomes kind of morning 👋 pic.twitter.com/CNJrwAJULg— Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) October 19, 2025\n              @Chiefs\n          \n  \n    \n          Mahomes is a pro ... so we seriously doubt he was pissed off about the play. More likely he's hoping to win the ESPY For \"Best Leading Actor\" at next year's ceremony.\n      \n    \n          The Chiefs decimated an abysmal Raiders squad 31-0. The win moves the Chiefs up to 4-3 this season; the Raiders will fall to 2-5 with the loss.\n      \n    \n          Looks like Patrick's adding a little insult to injury with this one ... 'cause no matter what plan Mahomes runs, it tends to work anyway.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Patrick Mahomes\n              \n                          \n                Kansas City Chiefs\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                NFL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

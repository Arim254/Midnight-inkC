    "body": "\n\tDakota Fanning will star as an undercover agent of the U.S. Department of the Treasury in a new Apple TV series created by Emmy-winning “Homeland” producer Alex Cary.\n\n\tThe yet-to-be-titled thriller follows Fanning as a mole operating within a multi-billion dollar international conglomerate with powerful political and criminal tentacles. Per the logline, she “becomes conflicted between her mission and a belief that her principal target, the heir apparent to all that corrupt power, is at his core a good man and worthy of her love.”\n\t\n\n\tThe show is part of Cary’s overall deal with Sony Pictures TV, which serves as the studio on the series. He executive produces via his FLW Productions banner. Julie Gardner (“Lady in the Lake,” “Doctor Who”) executive produces for Bad Wolf America, and Fanning executive produces alongside Elle Fanning and Brittany Kahan Ward for Lewellen Pictures (“Margo’s Got Money Troubles,” “The Great”). Kari Skogland (“Smoke,” “The Handmaid’s Tale”) will direct and serve as executive producer.\n\n\n\tDeadline broke the news.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLos Angeles production showed no sign of a rebound in the fourth quarter of 2025, as the industry is still waiting for a hike in state incentives to have an effect.\n\n\tProduction days for film, TV and commercials fell 12.3% compared to the prior quarter, according to data from FilmLA. That continues a downward trend that has persisted since 2022. The total shoot days across those categories has not increased for two quarters in a row since 2021.\n\t\n\n\tFor 2025 overall, production volume was about half what it was in 2019.\n\n\n\tCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a major expansion of the state’s film and TV production incentive in July. The California Film Commission has since allocated $771 million in tax incentives to dozens of film and TV projects, including “Jumanji,” “Heat 2,” and “Baywatch” — but any impact from that expenditure has yet to show up in the production figures. Approved projects have 180 days to begin filming from the issuance of a credit.\n\n\tPhilip Sokoloski, a spokesman for FilmLA, said the latest figures are “disappointing” but not surprising.\n\n\t“FilmLA has consistently projected that the full effect of the expanded Film and Television Tax Credit Program would take time to materialize, and although our overall numbers remain low, there are dozens of incentivized projects that have yet to begin filming,” he said in a statement.\n\n\tAccording to FilmLA, 17.3% of film projects that shot on location last quarter were subsidized by the state. That was down from 19.2% in the same quarter of 2024, but up from 2023 — during the actors’ strike — when 8.7% received state subsidies.\n\t\n\n\tThe rise of state incentives is more striking in TV, where the share of subsidized projects grew from 1.5% in Q4 of 2023 to 6.5% in Q4 of 2024. That figure rose to 11.1% in the same quarter of 2025. Among TV comedies, 31.8% of the shoot days were tied to subsidized projects, while 31% of TV drama production was state-backed. The state has traditionally backed only scripted shows, but recently added “large-scale” reality shows to the mix.\n\n\tBut the increasing state support comes amid a dramatic overall decline. TV production days came in 50% below their five-year average in the fourth quarter, and 22% down from the same quarter in 2024. Film production was 31.7% below the five-year average and 19.7% down from Q4 of 2024.\n\n\tTV comedies were relatively flat compared to the same quarter in the prior year — down only 6% — but were 66% below the five-year average. TV dramas fell 36.4% in Q4 of 2025 compared to Q4 of 2024 — and came in 43.3% below the five-year average.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFox‘s upcoming “Baywatch” reboot is headed to the beach to find its new cast.\n\n\tThe network and Fremantle have set an open casting call in Los Angeles on Feb. 18 to populate the series with both actors and non-actors. Adults of all ethnicities and genders are welcome to audition, and will be considered for series regular roles, recurring characters and walk-ons. According to Fox, available roles include everything “from lifeguards and beachgoers to bartenders, buddies and love interests to rescuers and rescuees of all kinds, as well as additional characters yet to be written.”\n\t\n\n\tThe casting call emphasizes that performers should arrive “Baywatch”-ready, defining that as “wardrobe that evokes a beach setting,” while noting that they should also remain “polished, professional and avoid overly revealing styles and costumes.” The humorous addendum seems like a reference to the high-cut red swimsuits the original “Baywatch” was famous for — but whether Fox is planning for more modest lifeguard costumes this time around or just hoping to prevent wardrobe malfunctions in the audition room remains to be seen. \n\n\n\tThe casting call will be held at the Marina Del Rey Marriott. Registration is open at baywatchcastingcall.com.\n\n\t“Baywatch” will begin production in March on Venice Beach and the Fox lot. The series is set to premiere during the 2027-2027 season. Matt Nix serves as showrunner and executive produces alongside Michael Berk, Greg Bonann, Dante Di Loreto, Doug Schwartz and Mike Horowitz.\n\n\tThe original “Baywatch” was at one point the most-watched series in the worlds, airing in more than 200 countries and reaching more than a billion viewers per week according to some estimates. Starring David Hasselhoff, it ran for 11 seasons from 1989 to 2001, first on NBC and later in syndication with a 2003 reunion film airing on Fox.\n\t\n\n\t“The ‘Baywatch’ Open Casting Call gives actors a rare opportunity to join the team of an iconic global sensation that celebrates the California spirit and helped define L.A.’s incomparable beach culture,” said Fox Television Network president Michael Thorn in a statement. “We’re excited to discover fresh faces with authentic SoCal energy as we bring back Baywatch for a new generation of fans.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Johnny Knoxville announced a new “Jackass” movie coming to theaters in June, fans of the slapstick stunt franchise wondered what type of role the 54-year-old ringleader would have in the production. \n\n\tIn 2022’s “Jackass Forever,” Knoxville performed a stunt where he was pummeled by a bull. He flipped in the air and landed on his head, causing a brain hemorrhage, concussion, broken wrist and broken rib. He has talked about how the injury changed his outlook on the future, indicating he would retire from doing dangerous stunts. Plus, the fourth “Jackass” movie introduced a bevy of younger performers alongside the original crew, hinting at the franchise’s potential future.\n\t\n\n\tIn a brief discussion about “Jackass 5” on the “Books That Changed My Life” podcast, Knoxville was asked, “Are you allowed to do stunts anymore?”\n\n\n\t“I can’t do anything where I can get another concussion,” Knoxville said. “[I’m] way over my limit for concussions, but I don’t care about anything else. I just can’t get hit in the head anymore — but a lot of other guys can.”\n\n\tKnoxville said the “Jackass” movies are “pure hell for the cast, but they’re a lot of fun for me,” adding, “They’re having fun too. I’m very excited about that.”\n\n\t“Jackass 5” will premiere in theaters on June 26 from Paramount Pictures. Little is known about the project except for that it will include new material and never-before-seen archival footage. Variety reported that original cast member Bam Margera has signed a deal to appear in old footage, ending a years-long feud between him and the “Jackass” team following his firing from the fourth movie. Margera is not expected to film new stunts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet revealed during a recent Q&A with Robert Downey Jr. at New York’s DGA Theater that he was threatened by a background actor while filming a scene for Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme.” \n\n\t“I won’t say who, but in that motel sequence, there are a lot of non-actors…that I find it really thrilling to work with, but sometimes it would take multiple takes to really get something out of them,” Chalamet said (per People). “And I’m really getting in the guy’s face and I’m really trying to get him angry with me. I was saying to Josh, ‘He’s not getting angry with me, he’s not getting angry with me.'” \n\t\n\n\tAlthough the Oscar-nominated actor assumed he wasn’t getting a rise out of the unnamed extra, he was mistaken.\n\n\n\t“I did another take, and then the guy said, ‘I was just in jail for 30 years. You really don’t want to fuck with me. You don’t want to see me angry,'” Chalamet said with a nervous laugh. “I said to Josh, ‘Holy shit, who do you have me opposite, man?’”\n\n\tChalamet stars in Safdie’s sports dramedy as Marty Mauser, who chases his dream of becoming a table-tennis champion. “Marty Supreme” is a fictionalized account of the real-life Marty Reisman, who won five world championship medals in table tennis. \n\n\tChalamet is an Oscar frontrunner for his performance in “Marty Supreme,” which has already scored him honors from the Critics’ Choice Awards and Golden Globes. He has also received an Actor Award nomination from SAG. \n\n\tIn his acceptance speech at the Golden Globes, Chalamet said, “My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up. ‘Always be grateful for what you have.’ It’s allowed me to leave the ceremony in the past empty handed with my head held high, grateful just to be here. But I’d be lying if I said those moments didn’t make this moment that much sweeter.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Housemaid” has cleared a notable box office milestone, surpassing $200 million in global ticket sales. \n\n\tThe R-rated film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has generated $100 million domestically and $100 million internationally after four weekends of release. Those ticket sales are especially promising considering that Lionsgate spent just $35 million to produce the film.\n\n\n\t“The Housemaid” opened on Dec. 19 with a modest $19 million in North America. Thanks to great word-of-mouth, the psychological thriller is expected to end its theatrical run with $225 million to $275 million worldwide, a huge result at a trying time for mid-budget films. In a twist, the overseas tally has already surpassed the domestic haul, with top territories including the U.K. (where “The Housemaid” was No. 1 last weekend ahead of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and “Zootopia”) with $23.7 million, France with $17.5 million and Australia with $5.6 million.\n\t\n\n\t“‘The Housemaid’ demonstrates what can be accomplished when the right stars — Sydney Sweeney, Amanda Seyfried, Brandon Sklenar, Michele Morrone, and Elizabeth Perkins — are matched with brilliant filmmakers and captivating material, with it all coming together to create a truly compelling moviegoing experience and an undeniable appetite for more,” Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Adam Fogelson said in a statement. “Paul Feig surpassed expectations by delivering a thriller that’s everything audiences have been asking for. Early on, our team — particularly the women at Lionsgate — recognized Freida McFadden’s trilogy as exceptional cinematic material before it became a literary phenomenon. Congratulations to our outstanding cast and filmmakers and the entire Lionsgate team.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Housemaid” is Lionsgate’s second consecutive wide release to cross the $200 million mark worldwide after November’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” ($241 million). The studio had an otherwise quiet year in 2025 with misses like the “John Wick” spinoff “Ballerina” ($137 million against a $90 million budget) and the Aziz Ansari comedy “Good Fortune” ($26 million against a $30 million budget).\n\n\tDirected by Feig (“Bridesmaids”) and adapted from the best-selling novel by Freida McFadden, “The Housemaid” follows a young woman (Sweeney) with a troubled past who becomes the live-in maid for an ultra-wealthy family (Seyfried and Sklenar play the not-so-picture perfect husband and wife) that isn’t what it seems. Variety’s Owen Gleiberman praised the campy nature of “The Housemaid,” saying the movie “goes right over-the-top, but it does so in a way that’s unusually clever and knowing.”\n\n\t“The Housemaid” is the first novel in McFadden’s best-selling trilogy, so naturally the sequel, “The Housemaid’s Secret,” is already in the works with Sweeney and Feig.\n",

The show was unveiled at the Disney+ showcase in Paris on Thursday evening. \n\n\n\tIn the remake, a catastrophe has led to the extinction of the human race. “After traveling across the country, Adam must face the facts: he is the last man on Earth. Free from everything, he enjoys the advantages of solitude… but remains desperately alone. However, he still holds out hope that another survivor exists. And perhaps even a female survivor,” reads the synopsis. \n\t\n\n\tThe original series, also called “The Last Man on Earth,” aired on Fox from 2015 and 2018, and earned five Primetime Emmy Awards nominations. Forte played the lead role in the show and starred opposite Kristen Schaal and January Jones, alongside Jason Sudeikis and Kristen Wiig.\n\n\tArtus is a well-known French standup comedian who made his feature directorial debut with “A Little Something Extra” which topped the French box office in 2024, grossing over $74 million in France. The modestly budgeted comedy had an ensemble cast of young non-professionals with different types of disabilities.\n\n\tDisney+ didn’t unveil many further details about the new show but it will likely have an international backdrop and cast. The streamer announced a flurry of other series and features at the Paris showcase. \n",

    "body": "\n\tLess than a year after he jigged terrifyingly into Ryan Coogler’s supernatural horror “Sinners” as an Irish-dancing vampire, Jack O’Connell is back with an even more bonkers baddie.\n\n\tSir Jimmy Crystal — who the actor admits is the “maddest character” he’s ever seen — may have been first introduced at the very end of Danny Boyle’s zombie sequel “28 Years Later.” But that was just a taste of the lunacy to come. In Nia DaCosta’s riotous and bloody sequel to the sequel “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” (also written by Alex Garland and out Jan. 16), he truly comes into his own as the devil-worshipping, pseudo evangelical cult “lord” of a gang of sadistic murderers called the Jimmies. Clad in a rich purple tracksuit and with an luxuriant head of hair, Crystal is an exceptional role and one O’Connell says he rejoiced in making his own. \n\t\n\n\tFrom Sony Pictures, “The Bone Temple” is also the latest major project for the Brit, currently in the midst of a prolonged purple patch on the big screen, with more significant titles coming up (including a stomp into the MonsterVerse). While he says he’s not getting “analytical now” about his cinematic reignition, which was arguably sparked by “Back to Black” in 2024, he admits he’s enjoying “savouring” the reception his performances have been getting. \n\n\t\n\t\tSir Jimmy must have been a delicious character to to sink your teeth into\t\n\n\tYeah, it was. It was wild, wild fun. But unbounded. So in a lot of ways, it’s very freeing.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the description of Jimmy when you were first told about him?\t\n\n\tI just remember, above all of his dialog, it said ‘Sir Jimmy Crystal,’ which in itself is easily the maddest character I think I’ve ever seen. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tI’m assuming they came straight to you and there wasn’t an audition process. \t\n\n\tThere was a bit of a procedure, where it involved going around to Danny’s house. Nia was there too. And as a Danny Boyle fan being invited to his house was a monumental day for me. We sat down and chatted, and then I waited to hear back. \n\t\n\t\tI understand you hadn’t actually shot “Sinners” at the time.\t\n\n\tNo, the invite to Danny’s house was prior to going to New Orleans to shoot “Sinners.” But I knew it was going to happen, so when I had the meeting for this I thought, if it did go my way, it was going to amount to an amazing year.\n\t\n\t\tSir Jimmy Crystal is introduced right at the end of “28 Years Later” and it’s a really wild tonal shift from the rest of the film. What reaction did you get from people who saw you in that? \t\n\n\tYeah, largely it was WTF. Which is great. And there’s an ambiguity as well — don’t know if these guys are to be liked or to be trusted. They seem to be a force for good at first and then pretty quickly, as this film opens, you kind of realize that was a misguided view. But it’s great to get to toy with people like that — it’s fun.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJack O’Connell alongside Ralph Fiennes in “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid I read somewhere that the delightful, almost regal-looking, purple tracksuit that you wear in the film was your decision?\t\n\n\tYeah! Purple was the colour of monarchs, wasn’t it? So I just thought it’d give him status. He’s quite pristine. And he has what he refers to as his “fingers” doing all the dirty work. \n\t\n\t\tAs you said, this has been a great year for you with “Sinners” and now this. Have you enjoyed entering your villain era?\t\n\n\tYeah, I guess so. But it’s nothing but sheer luck that “Sinners” came and was followed by “The Bone Temple.” So I just have to count my lucky chickens.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve got a very different villain coming up as ex The Sun editor Larry Lamb in “Ink,” back with Danny\t\n\n\tIt’s a great space to be in. It’s sort of biographical, but in a fascinating era in British culture. And yeah, it’s Danny. It was a play, a phenomenally successful play. And with another top top writer. So again, sheer luck. \n\t\n\t\tAnd you’re entering another major studio franchise, this time the Monsterverse with “Godzilla x Kong: Supernova.” Is this another villain?\t\n\n\tNo, I think this guy’s more of a straight shooter. It’s important to mix it up. But that’s shot, all done and dusted, and was a phenomenal experience. Big toys, big machines, big studios. Big!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIt sounds like it’s a very good time to b Jack O’Connell at the moment and since “Back to Black” you’ve been going from one big film project to the next. Do you feel like you’re having a particularly excellent moment right now — and is there anything you can credit that to?\t\n\n\tPersonally, the view is always on what’s next. So when things get received well, that is brilliant. But hopefully I’m ways into a career that lasts for a little while longer yet. So I wouldn’t be getting too analytical now. But listen, with that said, it feels great the reception to “Sinners” and so far, “The Bone Temple” feels great. And it’s worth savouring those moments. \n\t\n\t\tAt the BAFTA Rising Star nominations last year, which you presented, I think it was David Jonsson who said that you’d been a huge inspiration to him as a young actor. But I’ve heard it from others too, particular actors not born into privilege or with industry connections to give them a leg up. Is that something you’ve heard of, or something you’ve even considered? \t\n\n\tIt’s lovely to hear. It’s probably one of the most rewarding things you could expect to hear. So, yeah, it means a great deal to me. I can point to a handful of actors whose careers have meant the world to me. Particularly in an industry like this one, where it certainly does help to have familial ties, being the sort of outsider that other young actors can point to it and go, ‘Yeah, that’s how it’s done.’ Fantastic. That’s half the reason I get out of bed in the morning.\n\t\n\t\tFinally, did you get the keep the purple tracksuit? \t\n\n\tOh yeah, that’s back with me. 100%. In case we need it again. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Industry” returned to HBO for its fourth season on Sunday night and reached more than 800,000 viewers in its first three days of availability, marking a 20% increase from the drama series’ Season 3 opener in 2024 and its best season premiere ever.\n\n\tThat number was calculated from a combination of Nielsen’s measurement of viewers on HBO’s cable channel and Warner Bros. Discovery’s own data regarding streams on HBO Max, and refers to viewership in the U.S. only.\n\t\n\n\tWBD also reports that both in the U.S. and globally, catch-up viewing of “Industry” in the week leading up to the Season 4 premiere was 60% stronger this year than in the week before Season 3 premiered.\n\n\n\tPer the official logline, “Industry” is set “in the world of international finance, as seen through the eyes of ambitious twenty-somethings struggling to secure their futures. The series follows a group of young graduates competing for a limited set of permanent positions at a top investment bank in London – but the boundaries between colleague, friend, lover and enemy soon blur as they immerse themselves in a company culture defined as much by sex, drugs, and ego as it is by deals and dividends. As members of the group rise and fall, they must decide whether life is about more than the bottom line.”\n\n\tSeason 4 follows Harper (Myha’la) and Yasmin (Marisa Abela) as they “are drawn into a high stakes, globetrotting cat-and-mouse game when a splashy fintech darling bursts onto the London scene. As Yasmin navigates her relationship with tech founder Sir Henry Muck (Kit Harington) and Harper is pulled into the orbit of enigmatic executive Whitney Halberstram (Max Minghella), their twisted friendship begins to warp and ignite under the pressure of money, power, and the desire to be on top.”\n\t\n\n\tMickey Down & Konrad Kay created “Industry” and executive produce alongside Jane Tranter, Kate Crowther and Ryan Rasmussen for Bad Wolf; Kathleen McCaffrey for Little Gems; and Rebecca Ferguson for BBC. \n",

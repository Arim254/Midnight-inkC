    "body": "\n\tThe Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival is doubling down on intellectual property development with the unveiling of 10 original IPs selected for its 2025 Content Market, backed by Indonesia‘s Ministry of Creative Economy.\n\n\tSet to run Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at Yogyakarta’s Jogja Expo Center during JAFF’s 20th anniversary celebration, the Content Market will showcase properties spanning games, comics, novels, animation and digital content — all vetted for screen adaptation potential.\n\t\n\n\t“The strength of Indonesia’s creative economy lies in its storytelling,” said Teuku Riefky Harsya, Minister of Creative Economy. “Through platforms like JAFF Content Market, we can transform local intellectual properties into globally relevant creative products.”\n\n\n\tThe selected lineup includes video game “Amurva” from Ninoi Kiling; comics “Elang Hitam” by Edwin Fernando Tranggono, “Jemawa Yangti” by M. Shahriza Rijadi, “Journal of Terror” by Sweta Kartika, “The Summoning” by Iskandar Salim and “World Without Sleep” by Ferdian Feisal; animation project “Meng” from Monoma Films; novels “Sangkakala di Langit Andalusia” by Hanum Salsabiela Rais and “Tabi” by Marchella FP; and digital content “Gloomy Sunday” by Fanky Landerson.\n\n\tEach IP underwent curatorial review assessing narrative strength, visual potential, commercial viability and cross-sector collaboration readiness. The program is designed to bridge Indonesia’s publishing, gaming and music sectors with its expanding film and streaming industries.\n\n\t“Many of our nation’s best stories already live in books, songs and games, and this platform helps them find new life through film and series adaptation,” said Linda Gozali, market director of JAFF Market. “Our goal is to position Indonesia not only as a production destination but also as a source of original, adaptable ideas.”\n\t\n\n\tThe initiative builds on momentum from JAFF Content Market 2024, when three Indonesian IPs — “Bandits of Batavia,” “Locust” and “Jitu” — were selected for Cannes Film Festival’s Spotlight Asia program, connecting creators with studios and distributors focused on Asian IP adaptation.\n\n\tThe Content Market, sponsored by Amar Bank, facilitates curated pitching sessions and business meetings between IP creators and producers, investors and distributors from across Asia.\n\n\tThe film festival runs through Dec. 6. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe energy around this year’s Sharjah Intl. Film Festival for Children and Youth points to a bigger story unfolding across the Emirate of Sharjah, which is in the United Arab Emirates: the emergence of a creative economy with real infrastructure behind it.\n\n\tAt its center is Sharjah Media City – also known as Shams – a young but fast-growing media and production hub betting that the next generation of Arab storytellers will want to build their careers closer to home.\n\t\n\n\tSharjah’s creative reputation was built on books, art and education, a long-standing commitment to culture that earned it the title of UNESCO World Book Capital in 2019. Now, that cultural ethos is being reframed through the lens of film and digital media. Shams is the engine behind that transformation, linking Sharjah’s artistic heritage with the tools of modern production.\n\n\n\t“Sharjah has always valued knowledge and creativity,” reflects H.E. Mr. Rashid AlObad, director general of Shams. “We’re taking that foundation and translating it into the language of film, media, and digital innovation.”\n\n\tA Different Kind of Media HubIn a landscape dominated by Dubai Media City and Abu Dhabi’s TwoFour54, Shams is taking a different path, one built for agility. Its model favors small and midsize creators, offering quick setup, flexible operations, and space for experimentation.\n\n\t“We’re carving our niche by being agile and culturally-rooted,” AlObad explains. “Our mission emphasizes creativity, innovation, and Arabic content development, aligning with Sharjah’s cultural identity.”\n\t\n\n\tThat approach has paid off. The Shams campus already houses podcast studios, filming spaces, and training centers that have hosted eight TV series and multiple commercial shoots. While other UAE hubs court major international studios, Shams is cultivating independent producers, content creators and small-scale media entrepreneurs, the same generation that festivals like SIFF are helping to inspire.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSheikha Jawaher bint Abdullah Al Qasimi, director of SIFF, and H.E. Mr. Rashid AlObad, director general of Shams.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTraining Meets IndustrySince its launch in 2018, Shams has built a reputation for its hands-on approach to developing creative talent. Its training programs have reached thousands of participants in directing, acting, editing, podcasting, presenting and production management, with over 50 workshops a year led by regional and international experts.\n\n\tThe UAE Entertainment Experience, often referenced as the Arab world’s pioneering attempt at audience-generated filmmaking, drew more than 2,500 participants and resulted in the feature “218: Behind the Wall of Silence,” which was nominated for three awards at the Septimius Awards in the Netherlands, nabbing the top prize in the best Asian actress category. Another program, the Hekaya Project, which AlObad describes as a script room supporting emerging writers, has already produced nine original series, three of which are moving into production for TV and streaming platforms.\n\n\tThat training infrastructure is set to expand with Shams Tadreeb, a dedicated e-learning platform that will bring media and creative courses online. “It’s about expanding access to knowledge and strengthening the UAE’s position as a regional talent hub,” AlObad notes.\n\n\tFrom Festival Dreams to Career PathwaysAt SIFF, Shams’ influence is visible on the ground. The organization has sponsored youth filmmaking workshops and hosted interactive exhibits like the “Films and Games” zone, exploring the intersections between gaming and cinema. AlObad positioned the collaboration as a cornerstone of Shams’ youth strategy: “We share SIFF’s mission to empower young voices. Our goal is to make sure a 15-year-old inspired by the festival today can find a real path into the industry tomorrow.”\n\n\tDesigning the FutureThe next leap for Shams will be physical. The emirate recently awarded a design contract for Shams Studios, a five-soundstage complex that will include post-production suites, creative offices, and hospitality facilities.\n\t\n\n\t“Our priority is to design a landmark facility that can serve both local and international productions,” AlObad shares. “We’re integrating virtual production, AI-driven workflows, and advanced post technologies from the start.”\n\n\tConstruction is expected to begin in late 2025. When complete, the complex will anchor Sharjah’s bid to become a global destination for content creation, a formidable counterpart to its established role in art and literature.\n\n\tEducation as InfrastructureParallel to its studio expansion, Shams is deepening its educational reach. Earlier this year, it announced 100 master’s scholarships for educational leaders and launched a Master’s in Digital Media and Entrepreneurship, a collaboration between the University of Sharjah and the University of Barcelona. Shams staff teach a dedicated course in “Digital Media and Sustainability,” and graduates receive a free business license to start their own ventures, “helping turn academic learning into real-world entrepreneurship,” AlObad asserts.\n\n\t“We’re developing people at every level: from young creators to future industry leaders,” AlObad emphasizes. “Every investment in education should translate into new skills, new businesses, and a stronger creative economy.”\n\n\tSharjah Goes GlobalThis week, Shams took that message abroad at Mipcom in Cannes, where it showcased its studio complex and a slate of local projects. “Our presence was about building relationships and attracting co-production interest,” AlObad says, outlining Shams’ international push. “We want global filmmakers to see Sharjah as a destination for innovative, cost-effective, and culturally-rich production.”\n\n\tSharjah’s Next ChapterFor AlObad, Shams represents the next phase of Sharjah’s cultural trajectory, one where film, digital media and education merge into a unified creative ecosystem. “The Book Fair champions storytelling and knowledge; the Biennial celebrates visual and contemporary art; and Shams extends that creative energy into film, digital media, and content production,” he reflects.\n\n\tIn other words, what SIFF ignites each year –– young filmmakers discovering their voice –– Shams is building the means to sustain. “Our goal,” AlObad adds, “is to create a complete ecosystem, from concept to global distribution, while championing authentic Arab storytelling that reflects the UAE’s values of creativity, inclusion, and progress.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWinter is coming. \n\n\tKristen Bell says the “Frozen 3” cast will “soon” begin production for the third installment of the hit animated movie musical franchise.\n\n\tWhile she hasn’t heard any of the new songs for “Frozen 3,” Bell, who plays Anna, says she has seen the script for the movie.\n\n\t“That’s all I can say. I’m under lock and key,” she said, but also explained the script process. \n\n\n\t“It’s all mostly like concept stuff in the beginning like, ‘Here’s where we think it should go,'” Bell said. “That’s the one great thing about Disney is it goes through a thousand filters, not to be diplomatic, but because everyone’s going to add something different. That’s why the movies plays so well because they hit every single mark because nothing has been missed.”\n\t\n\n\t“Frozen 3” will be released in 2027. Visual development art from the movie unvieled in August 2024 shows Elsa (Idina Menzel) on a white horse and Anna on a brown stag.\n\n\tLee wrote and co-directed with Chris Buck the best animated feature Oscar winner “Frozen,” as well as “Frozen II,” which were set around the fictional kingdom of Arendelle and featured a voice cast led by Bell, Menzel, Jonathan Groff as Kristoff and Josh Gad as the snowman Olaf.\n\n\tThe first “Frozen” premiered in 2013 followed six years later by the sequel.\n\n\tI caught up with Bell on Thursday night at the “Nobody Wants This” Season 2 premiere at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.\n\n\tWhile Bell’s “Nobody Wants This” co-star Adam Brody’s wife Leighton Meester makes a guest appearance in the second season, Bell says her husband Dax Shepard will probably “never” do the same. “He likes podcasting,” she said, referring to “Armchair Expert With Dax Shepard.”\n\t\n\n\tWell, “Nobody Wants This” is about two sisters who co-host a podcast. “But it’s still acting and there’s a whole thing that come along with that. It’s like you have to do hair and makeup, and you memorize the lines and then you’re there all day,” Bell said. “He’s so happy and content with his career. I mean, he would if I asked him obviously but I don’t him to do anything he isn’t craving.”\n\nAdam Brody sums up the new season of “Nobody Wants This” in three words: “sh*t gets real” — and says his dream guest star would be Barbra Streisand, playing herself. pic.twitter.com/bQo71f2hsd— Variety (@Variety) October 17, 2025\n\n\n\t“Nobody Wants This” Season 2 premieres on Netflix on Oct. 23.\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tLawyers for President Donald Trump refiled a defamation lawsuit Thursday against the New York Times, with a complaint that is less than half as long",
    "body": "\n\tLawyers for President Donald Trump refiled a defamation lawsuit Thursday against the New York Times, with a complaint that is less than half as long as the previous one — after a judge spiked the president’s initial lawsuit for being “tedious and burdensome.” As before, Trump’s refiled complaint seeks an astronomical $15 billion in damages.\n\n\tThe New York Times, in a statement Thursday, reiterated its position that Trump’s lawsuit was meritless and said that “nothing has changed” with the new filing.\n\t\n\n\t“As we said when this was first filed and again after the judge’s ruling to strike it: this lawsuit has no merit,” a Times spokesperson said in a statement. “Nothing has changed today. This is merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate PR attention, but the New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.”\n\n\n\tTrump last month sued the Times, several of its reporters and Penguin Random House (publisher of the book “Lucky Loser” by two Times reporters), alleging that their reporting about the president’s finances and business career defamed him. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. A few days later, a federal judge threw out Trump’s suit, calling it “tedious and burdensome” and saying that a complaint is not “a protected platform to rage against an adversary.” In the ruling, Judge Steven D. Merryday gave Trump’s lawyers 28 days to refile the suit, ordering that the amended complaint be no more than 40 pages long and that it “accord with the rules of procedure.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump’s refiled complaint is 40 pages (available at this link), less than half the original 85-page complaint. The new filing is shorter, but the main arguments are the same.\n\n\t“As set forth below, Defendants originated and distributed these publications, and the defamatory statements about President Trump therein, with actual malice,” the revised complaint says. “The statements in question wrongly defame and disparage President Trump’s hard-earned professional reputation, which he painstakingly built for decades as a private citizen before becoming President of the United States, including as a successful businessman and as star of the most successful reality television show of all-time — The Apprentice.”\n\n\tIn his previous ruling finding Trump’s lawsuit “decidedly improper and inadmissible,” Merryday said that several statements in Trump’s initial complaint were unnecessary to make the president’s case. For example, he wrote, “in one of many, often repetitive, and laudatory (toward President Trump) but superfluous allegations, the pleader states, ‘The Apprentice’ represented the cultural magnitude of President Trump’s singular brilliance, which captured the [Z]eitgeist of our time.”\n\n\tTrump’s suit seeks compensatory damages of at least $15 billion as well as punitive damages, as well as a “retraction of the defamatory publications and statements” from the New York Times and Penguin Random House.\n\n\tSeparately, Trump this summer sued the Wall Street Journal, its parent companies Dow Jones and News Corp, Rupert Murdoch and two Journal reporters, alleging defamation over a WSJ story with details about a birthday letter Trump sent in 2003 to Jeffrey Epstein. According to the lawsuit, Trump is demanding “not less than $10 billion” on two counts of defamation, for at least $20 billion total. Last month, lawyers for the Wall Street Journal filed a motion to dismiss the suit, saying that Trump’s suit should be thrown out because the WSJ article in question “is true,” noting that in response to a congressional subpoena, “Epstein’s estate produced the Birthday Book, which contains the letter bearing the bawdy drawing and [Trump’s] signature, exactly as The Wall Street Journal reported.”\n\n\tAmong other litigation, Trump also sued ABC News and CBS News’ “60 Minutes” and reached separate $16 million settlements in each of those cases.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpanish-language act Los Bukis have announced the final pair of dates for their reunion tour, which debuted internationally in 2021. \n\n\tAfter nearly 40 sold-out stadium concerts since 2021, and becoming the first Spanish-language artists with a residency in Las Vegas, the group announces “¡Tuyos por Siempre! El Gran Cierre de un Ciclo” (“Yours Forever! The Grand Closing of a Cycle”). The special events will take place on Feb. 14 in Houston, Texas at Daikin Park, and on Feb. 20, in Inglewood, California at the SoFi Stadium. \n\t\n\n\tLos Bukis scored the biggest Latin tour of 2021, earning $49.6 million, according to Billboard Boxscore. Earlier this year, the group was also recognized with a Hollywood Walk of Fame Star for their 51 years in music. \n\n\n\tLos Bukis promise to take their fans on an emotional journey through decades of hits, performing classics such as “Quiéreme,” “Yo Te Necesito,” “Mi Najayita,” “Falso Amor,” “Ladron de Buena Suerte,” “Morenita,” and the anthemic “Tu Cárcel,” among others. \n\n\tThe concert at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles will be a homecoming for the group after they became the first Latin artists to perform at the stadium. “These two concerts are intended to be a celebration, a gesture of gratitude, and the culmination of a dream that they revived alongside the Bukimanía that has made them unforgettable,” reads a press release. “It’s the perfect moment to close this journey on a high note. Los Bukis, led by Marco Antonio Solís, have invited their fans to join these two historic nights to cherish the memory of this reunion.”\n\t\n\n\tWith the announcement of these two dates, the group confirms that the Houston and Los Angeles concerts will be the only two and final opportunities to experience the original lineup in concert.\n\n\tTickets will be available starting with a Citi presale beginning Oct. 21 at 10 a.m. ET. Additional presales, including artist presale on Oct. 22 at 10 a.m. local time, will run ahead of the general on sale beginning Oct. 24 at 10 a.m. local time at LiveNation.com.\n",

    "body": "\n\tI’m all for a documentary that celebrates its subject, but “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” is a movie that takes what it’s about and holds it up to the light with such unbashed reverence that after half an hour or so, I thought it was all going to be a bit much. Actually, it turns out to be a very good film — canny and honest and unexpectedly moving. But it’s layered with a thick and sugary frosting of adoration.\n\n\tThe movie is a portrait of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, the husband-and-wife comedy team who first came to prominence on “The Ed Sullivan Show” (they made their debut appearance there in 1963) and then became a popular nightclub and TV-variety-show act in the ’60s and ’70s. Stiller and Meara were quite successful, but I wouldn’t call them superstars. I used to see them on TV when I was growing up, and it doesn’t take long for the film to capture the sweet-and-sour novelty of their stand-up sketch-comedy repartee — the way their affectionate but spiky interchanges, rooted in the stark contrast of their personalities (he was a Jewish crank who was like the missing link between Alan Arkin and Al Goldstein; she was a sunny Irish lass with a tart tongue), looked ahead to the age of “Annie Hall.”\n\t\n\n\tWe see a telling clip of Johnny Carson, sometime in the late ’60s, saying, “They’re married in real life! He’s Jewish and she’s Irish — for real,” and his eyes light up with amazement. That’s how unusual it was, at the time, to see a showbiz couple drawn from such  different wells. That said, Stiller and Meara, while they had a fresh and even trend-setting image, always came off, at least to me, as a likable but rather lightweight comedy team.\n\t\n\n\tAs the documentary captures, there was an edge of conviction to their act, because they drew it from their own lives, and their love and (at times) acrimony would spill right onto the stage. Yet Stiller and Meara were launched in the pre-counterculture era of Nichols and May and Mel Brooks’ 2,000 Year Old Man, and by the time they became a TV staple, there was something a tad corny and dated about them. In the documentary, we see their two greatest routines, a satire of computer dating that they first performed in 1966, and their “Hate” sketch, which was way ahead of its time. But once you’ve chuckled at those, there isn’t much left to discover about them as comedians.\n\n\tIt’s hardly a surprise, though, that “Stiller & Meara” treats the two of them like gods on the comedy Olympus. The film was directed by Ben Stiller, who is their son, so yes, he’s a bit close to the subject. What he’s put together has to be reckoned a definitive look at the career of Stiller and Meara. At the same time, the documentary is a tender but clear-eyed family portrait. It was shot starting after Jerry’s death, in 2020 (Anne Meara died in 2015), and much of it consists of the lean, warm, now silver-haired Ben Stiller and his curly-haired acerbic older sister, Amy, hanging out in the vast Upper West Side apartment on the corner of Riverside Drive and W. 84th St. in which the two of them grew up, and where their parents spent most of their lives together.\n\n\tThe apartment is jammed with memorabilia and bric-a-brac, because Jerry Stiller was a pack rat when it came to recording his life — he was into taping conversations, he always had a camera out (that’s how Ben first started to make films as a kid), and “Stiller & Meara” shows us a lot of this stuff: the home movies, the diaries, the personal notes, the recordings of the everyday. (It’s this that the film’s rather bland subtitle, “Nothing Is Lost,” refers to.)\n\n\tThe family comes off, relatively speaking, as quite a happy foursome. It’s clear throughout the documentary that Jerry and Anne genuinely loved each other, and that they provided a nurturing and creative environment for their children. Ben and Amy recall their parents with a richly amused understanding of the couples’ foibles (especially Jerry’s, since he practically wore them on his lapel), and while it’s nice to see a high-powered showbiz family that seems so well-adjusted, a part of us is going: Okay, fine, where’s the drama? Even when we learn that Anne relied on alcohol to cope with the stresses of their performance life (they would go to Patsy’s Italian Restaurant on W. 56th St. and she’d have her vodka), the film makes a point of not overstating the dark side of her addiction. (On a tape of Anne talking to Jerry after a night of this: “I drank too much. I drink. It’s not the end of the world!”) Anne liked her vodka but held herself together and appears, in hindsight, to have been a woman of joy and well-being.\n\t\n\n\tMidway through the movie, having absorbed all this (and sensing that there’s not going to be any dark bombshell), I thought: What is there left to tell? But that’s just when “Stiller & Meara” begins to morph from a likable entertainment-world profile into something more resonant — a nearly novelistic portrait of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara’s life-and-art marriage. In the grand scheme of things, it was a happy one, but it was complicated. They had tons of fights and temperamental clashes. One reason they were two peas in a pod is that their backgrounds were more alike than we imagine: Jerry was born and raised in New York City, whereas Anne was a self-described “Irish princess” from Long Island. She retained a dollop of that Lawn Guyland accent, which is one reason words like “meshuggenah” rolled off her tongue. They may have been from different tribes, but they were both tribal.\n\n\tHere’s something I picked up on: As successful as Stiller and Meara were, had they been more successful — more famous, more coveted, a bigger act rather than a variety-show fixture — they would likely have gotten divorced. Celebrity and money would have been poured onto their simmering tensions like gasoline, and they would have detonated. In their act, Jerry was arguably the less gifted of the two, but he was the perfectionist (mostly because he was so insecure about his talent), and that took its toll. It drove Anne nuts, because she was actually less invested in their success.\n\n\tAnd maybe that was her way of keeping them sane. Since Stiller and Meara were stars who weren’t overly famous, they were able to keep their professional lives in a kind of compartment. And this allowed them to put family first. That they did so was rather heroic, as well as charming and touching. They would parade their kids onto talk shows (there’s a hilarious clip of Benjy and Amy on “The Mike Douglas Show” playing “Chopsticks” on violins), but it’s also fascinating to behold how when the two did on-camera interviews, they would discuss their lives, and it would suddenly get very serious, and their disagreements would rise to the surface, only to be channeled into a laugh (though not always), which became a form of therapy. Later on, we learn that they underwent plenty of couples’ therapy.\n\t\n\n\tTo complete the family meditation, Ben Stiller puts his own children, Ella (23) and Quinlin (20), on camera, as well as his wife, Christine Taylor, from whom he was separated for several years (the two reconciled during the pandemic). He talks about how much his own flaws echo those of his father, but the truth is that Ben Stiller comes off here as such a benign and accommodating person that the family-demons-through-the-generations theme doesn’t register with very much impact. It just gets filed under “Nobody’s perfect.”\n\n\tIn the ’70s, Stiller and Meara began to pursue separate careers as straight actors (that’s how Anne had begun), and they had some real success, with Jerry appearing in movies like “The Taking of Pelham One Two Three” and “Airport 1975” (which inspired young Benjy, with a home-movie camera, to make “Airport ’76”), and Anne in “Lovers and Other Strangers.” In 1975, each of them was tapped to star in a TV series (Jerry in the sitcom “Joe and Sons,” Anne in the law drama “Kate McShane”), and it was probably part of the karma of their long-term harmony that both shows failed. They were married for 62 years.\n\n\tJerry Stiller finally found a kind of mega-fame when he was cast as George Costanza’s disgruntled father on “Seinfeld” — the most perfect casting in the world, since even back in the 1970s he sounds like George Costanza’s father. In the documentary, Ben and Amy say that Jerry seemed to bring all his buried sides, the anger and the craziness, to that role. Yet Ben describes his father as a “spiritual” man, in a way that remained hidden from the camera. Anne Meara, on the other hand, was all soul — the kind of person who was visibly generous, though when we hear her on the tapes Jerry made of their conversations, you saw that she gave as good as she got. Neither one was a doormat; neither one was a saint. Yet they remained devoted to each other, and “Stiller & Meara” shows you, quite movingly, that what the two had in common was how ardently they both believed in something bigger than themselves.\n\n\t“Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” streams on Apple TV+ starting Oct. 24. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhether “Ragtime” is presented in productions mammoth (as in its 1998 premiere) or modest (the 2009 revival), the musical, adapted from E.L. Doctorow’s kaleidoscopic 1975 novel, reverberates with the directness, passion and allegorical heft of an American folk epic.\n\n\tLear deBessonet opens her tenure as artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater with an expanded and exceptional version of the concert-plus production she staged at New York City Center during the weeks surrounding the presidential election last fall. It’s a savvy choice given the positive reception it received, the show’s panoramic scope and the ever-vital themes of the work.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a thrilling experience, though on the Vivian Beaumont Theater’s vast stage this pageant of a musical feels a bit skimpy. Not that the musical needs opulent sets, but it does call for stunning stagecraft to match the awe of its aspirations. It’s achieved here only intermittently.\n\n\n\tBook writer Terrence McNally artfully adapted Doctorow’s densely packed, historical novel which, from the start, seemed destined to be a musical. (Its title alone would get the theatrical rights rolling.) But because of the multitude of characters and stories of the book, that was no easy task. (The 1981 film version was less than a commercial triumph.)\n\n\tTapping into Doctorow’s cooly elegant narration and rambunctious conceit, McNally streamlined the event-filled book into a clear, cohesive and dynamic creation for the stage.\n\n\tMusic unites the interconnecting stories in this saga and expands its passions, with a sumptuous score by composer Stephen Flaherty and lyricist Lynn Ahrens that taps into a wide range of American styles, idioms and amalgams, even as the second act turns more dissonant. Special mention, too, goes to William David B John’s lush orchestrations and the show’s gorgeous choral work.\n\t\n\n\tDirector deBessonet’s fluid staging follows three disparate groups  — a white, upper-middle-class family, an African-American couple and a newly emigrated Jewish widower and his young daughter.  They all face seismic shifts in their lives at the turn of the last century.  Dramatic shifts in America, too, as “Ragtime” takes on weighty issues of racism, immigration, class, industrialization, the rise of unions, and the changing worlds for women and popular culture.\n\n\tThat’s a heavy load to balance — on top of a slew of symbols and metaphors. But the leading actors manage to fill in the broad outlines of their archetypical characters (most with generic monikers) with finesse as they adapt, embrace, rebel or are defeated by the chaos of fast-moving times.\n\n\tFrom his suburban perch, the imperious Father (Colin Donnell) fails to hear or understand the music of change, especially the new syncopated sounds of ragtime which trips up the inevitability of the beat, creating a new tempo for the times.\n\n\tHowever, Mother (Cassie Levy, splendid) appreciates this new music which accompanies her transformative story arc. She changes from dutiful 19th century wife and mother (singing the quaint “Goodbye, My Love”) to a 20th century woman who finally finds the power of her own agency (a resounding “Back to Before”).\n\n\tHer Younger Brother (Ben Levi Ross, funny, sad and riveting) also yearns for something more than privileged comfort and finds his purpose and inspiration in activist Emma Goldman (Shaina Taub, bringing warmth to the rabble-rousing). Mother’s Little Boy (Nick Barrington, humorously self-possessed) is a curious observer of the changes taking place around him. He’s clairvoyant, too — he foresees the trigger event for a world war— giving the work a touch of prophecy that is better integrated in the novel.\n\n\tThe second story follows the journey of Tateh (Brandon Uranowitz), the Latvian immigrant and his Little Girl (Tabitha Lawing), from New York’s tenements to factory exploitation in a mill town to his re-invention as a populist filmmaker in a nascent industry. Uranowitz’ is both tender and tough in both his struggles and in his triumph, capped with a chronicle of his character’s rise in a dazzling “Buffalo Nickel Photoplay Inc.”\n\t\n\n\tThe main propellant of these interwoven stories is the narrative of Coalhouse Walker Jr. (Joshua Henry, simply superb), a successful and charismatic musician, and Sarah (Nichelle Lewis), whom he loved, lost and is reunited with, only to have tragedy fall upon them both. Lewis delicately dials the character’s challenging emotional swings from madness, through recovery, hope and despair. But it’s Henry’s commanding presence, richly felt emotions and powerful vocals that anchors the show while making the production soar.\n\n\tThough the score is anthem-heavy and earnestness is always hovering, there are moments in the show that are transcendent. The opening number remains a stunner as choreographer Ellenore Scott finding fresh ways of delineating all the major and minor characters and introducing the tensions that will further tighten throughout the show.\n\n\tIncluded in these special moments are Coalhouse wooing Sarah out of her room with his enchanting “New Music”; their love duet, “Wheels of a Dream”; the contrasting quests of Father and Tateh in “Journey On;” Younger Brother’s passion in “The Night That Goldman Spoke at Union Square” and, with Goldman singing what the young man can’t articulate, “He Wanted to Say”; and Allison Blackwell as Sarah’s Friend, tearing through the Act One closer “Til We Reach That Day” with artful measure.\n\n\tThe show’s creators also know that lightness is needed, too, and give the audience the occasional breather — while remarkably keeping the themes in play — by tapping into the appeal of secondary characters such as escape artist Houdini (Rodd Cyrus), Evelyn Nesbitt  (Anna Grace Barlow, a delight as perhaps America’s first meaningless celeb); and a rude bunch of baseball-loving bros.\n\n\tIn productions large or small — or, here, imperfectly in-between, though still glorious — everything is the service of the show that creates with words, music and movement a grand American tapestry — tears and all.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf ever a play seemed tailor-made — tailor-braided? — for the Mark Taper Forum stage, at least in the 2020s, it’s “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding.” The most intimate of the three Music Center theaters in downtown L.A. is clearly upholding its mandate to do programming that represents a broader range of cultures, but at 739 seats, the Taper is hardly so small that it can afford to skip out on the mandate to entertain the traditional theater audience. How sweet it is, then, to witness how delightfully “Jaja” fills that sweet spot where cultural specificity and undeniable mainstream appeal collide. It feels good to hear the laughter of Black women during some of the earliest scenes, at references that only someone who’s been to a braiding salon is likely to get. It feels even better when the entire audience has joined in, as they quickly and loudly do, since no foreknowledge of cornrows or passion twists is really required. It’s the kind of show that nearly anyone who walks in is going to find captivating, with or without an appointment.\n\t\n\n\tPlaywright Jocelyn Bioh’s dramatic comedy opens with two of its characters, Marie (Jordan Rice), the 18-year-old daughter of the shop’s proprietor, and Miriam (Bisserat Tseggai), an only slightly older employee from Sierra Leone, bringing the gate up at their Harlem salon. Even before the shop’s other daily habitues join them to fill out the ensemble, you may immediately be thinking: Why is there not a Tony Award for best hair? Oh wait — there is, or at least was, for once, as the Broadway version of this play won a “special” Tony in 2024 for hair and wig design. Fortunately, “Jaja” has even more going for it than follicular eye candy, as seen in the several other categories in which the New York production got Tony nominations, including best play and best direction (and a win for costume design). What it had going for it in the Broadway production is fully in evidence in this stop at the Taper, which comes at the end of a national tour, also directed flawlessly by Whitney White. The whole cast is as on fire as if they were just opening that gate for the first time; they’re doing their own wonderful weave every night.\n\t\n\n\tThese two introductory characters are joined by three more braid-makers who are always a tight unit after all, despite all they have in common as immigrants. The most contentious is Bea (Claudia Logan), a Ghanaian émigré who has a big chip on her shoulder over how the yet-to-be-seen Jaja ( started this shop without her coming in as a co-owner, with their differing financial situations. Bea also has a big beef with her fellow employee Ndidi (Abigail C. Onwunali), a Nigerian immigrant whose pleasant attitude and possibly superior braiding skills have caused some customers to shift loyalties and head for her chair. Then, somewhere in the middle of the mild-mannered-to-aggressive scale, there’s the sexy Aminata (Tiffany Renee Johnson), the only one fiery enough to be friends with Bea and meet her at her level — although Bea’s stream of grievances will become obnoxious enough to eventually test even Aminata’s loyalty. As for the seemingly shy Miriam, it takes a while for her flame to become evident, but the tale she tells a customer about the circumstances of her leaving Sierra Leone suggest that she might be the toughest of all these cookies.\n\n\tAnd Marie, who is sort of the young maitre ‘d of the shop? She will never be anything other than the voice of calm and reason, as the most innately Americanized of this bunch, and someone who had to learn not to stand out, attending a private school far away from all this immigrants’ loose talk. As for Marie’s mother, the Senegalese shop owner, we have to wait almost as long for Jaja (Victoire Charles) to show up in the play named for her as we have to wait for Godot in his. But turn up she does, in the final third, in a wedding dress — did we mention she’s getting married today? — that feels like an eighth wonder of the world when you first catch sight of it. (No one need guess why the show won that costuming Tony.) When Jaja finally appears for one long scene late in this one-acter, Jaja does almost as much talking as any of them, coming off as rude but also giddily excited for her impending matrimony, which she may not be heading into for strictly romantic reasons.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Jaja’s African Hair Braiding’ at the Mark Taper Forum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJavier Vasquez\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere’s a good reason the “Barbershop” movie turned into a whole film and television franchise in the 2000s and 2010s: A hair care setting is ideal for a workplace comedy — or comedy-drama — because of the possibilities for friends or strangers to drop in and act as audience surrogates or conversational foils. It’s surprising that a salon of this sort haven’t been much used as a milieu before now, because one thing that’s different from a dudes’ place, especially, is that when someone settles into those chairs for as intricate a process as this, they’re gonna be there pretty much all day. So Bioh doesn’t have to come up with contrived excuses to keep the supporting characters hanging around for a long spell in this day-in-the-life play.\n\t\n\n\tWell, the female supporting characters tend to be in it for the duration, anyway. Not so much the men — or the man. The male characters who pop into the shop have such short turns at bat in the action that you wonder if the production can really afford to keep on so many guys with so little to do… until it dawns on you that, ohhhh… maybe it’s the same guy. The Playbill and of course the curtain call confirm your suspicion: It’s Michael Oloyede playing all these specimens of manhood, in chameleonic fashion. (He is the one holdover here from the original Broadway production.)\n\n\tThe comedy in the show is fairly relentless, up to a point. To say that it feels like the stuff of a sitcom for a good while is not an insult; it feels like a situation comedy you’d want to watch play out every week. This is a world in which we can laugh not just with the characters’ interpersonal foils but at some of their clients’ delusions, like the woman who is sure that her golden rows are turning her into a dead ringer for Beyonce, even if it takes a hilariously herculean effort to flip that half-ton of hair from one shoulder to the other.\n\n\tBut, of course, it’s not a total surprise that Bioh has something more serious on her mind than just letting basic female bonds and rivalries play out. You can more or less guess that Bea, however rough and unfairly domineering she is, will get some redemption, or at least not go down as the villain of the piece. The real adversary, off-stage, of course, is a society that is not as welcoming of immigrants as these women assume or hope, even with the womblike enclave of Harlem as a seeming buffer. So, yes, it’s going to go darker toward the end, though not so much so that it feels like all the laughs you’ve already expended are being pulled back from you.\n\n\tInterestingly, “Jaja” is the second major production in L.A. this fall that is set as a period piece in the late 2010s. Naturally, that’s not an arbitrary choice, and in the case of the other such show, “Eureka Day” at the Playhouse, it’s because the vaccination themes would only make sense pre-COVID, not -post. In the instance of “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding,” it’s because the women’s lack of complete panic, as immigrants, would not make sense during the second Trump term. It’s set during the first, before this administration made the administration of terror a proud hallmark. It’s sad to think that any playwright who wants to do a contemporary play in which urban characters are not deeply weary or living in abject fear will forever be setting their narratives in a time a little bit before the present one, but there we have it, for now.\n\t\n\n\tThe bittersweetness that ultimately characterizes “Jaja” doesn’t mean that is isn’t still fizzy. There’s not just effervescence but serious joy in this show — an exuberance you’re maybe not meant to think can or will last forever, but this blisteringly hot day in Harlem sure makes for a cool breeze of a night at the theater, while it lasts. And that’s a lovely relief from feeling cold as ICE. I’d like to say that its appeal is so universal, it’s a show even a newly hired immigration agent could love, but all theater has some limits to its appeal. “Jaja” really doesn’t feel like it has many.\n\n\t“Jaja’s African Hair Braiding” runs through Nov. 9 at the Mark Taper Forum.

While she said there were a few ways to go with that ... one of the major issues at play is $$$.\n      \n    \n          \"Obviously, pay is a big one,\" she said. \"But I think the biggest thing, like, is the revenue share.\"\n      \n    \n          \"So once we get that to a certain point, I think they'll be in a better spot.\"\n      \n    \n          Only time will tell if the two sides can avoid a lockout. As you know ... the players and the current commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, aren't on the best of terms these days. Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier even recently said the W has \"the worst leadership in the world.\"\n      \n    \n          New CBA or not, Young and the Aces are still celebrating the heck out of their latest WNBA title ... and are slated to have their parade through Sin City later Friday evening.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                WNBA\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tMae Martin has set a first-look deal with Netflix, Variety has learned exclusively.\n\n\tUnder the deal, Martin will continue to develop and create TV series for the streaming giant, while the deal also includes a new stand up special. \n\n\t“Over the last seven years I’ve been lucky to build relationships at Netflix that have felt supportive and creatively empowering, allowing my stories (and weird jokes about snow globes, etc.) to reach a global audience,” Martin said. “I’m so grateful to continue that relationship, and this vote of confidence will allow me to elevate other voices as well! I can’t wait to show everyone what I’ve been cooking up.”\n\t\n\n\tMartin first worked with Netflix on the semi-autobiographical series “Feel Good.” Martin starred as a fictionalized version of themself in the show, which aired for two seasons and received strong critical acclaim. The cast also included Charlotte Ritchie, Lisa Kudrow, Phil Burgers, and Adrian Lukis. Martin then released the stand up special “SAP” on Netflix in 2023. \n\n\n\tMost recently, Martin created, wrote, and starred in the Netflix limited series “Wayward,” which debuted in 2025. The show — which also boasted Oscar nominee Toni Collette among its cast — examined dark secrets buried in a small town in Vermont that contains a school for troubled teens. The show premiered at TIFF and spent five weeks on the Netflix Global Top 10 chart.\n\n\t“Mae is a singular voice who brings a rare combination of originality and curiosity to everything they do,” said Danielle Woodrow, director of content for Netflix Canada. “We were thrilled with the success of Wayward and can’t wait to see what they dream up next.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tJoshua Jackson has been cast in “How to Survive Without Me,” an HBO Max drama pilot from Greg Berlanti and Bash Doran. \n\n\tThe official logline for the project reads, “In the wake of matriarch Beverly’s passing, the De Angelis family have begun to drift, unsure how to manage their complicated, evolving lives without her guidance, but in true Beverly fashion, she found a way to keep running the show from the beyond. Should they wish to experience Beverly’s final work, the family must find the time — and make the effort — to remain connected, and be there for each other through all of life’s challenges yet to come.”\n\t\n\n\tJackson will play Cooper, “a chef about to open a members dining club in Los Angeles” who “is literally carrying forward his mother’s recipes and approach to food. He presents as confident and a player, but he’s suffering in silence — keeping a secret that could destroy both his lifelong friendships and the culinary career he’s built in is mother’s honor.”\n\n\n\tHe joins previously announced star Ray Romano, who plays Leo, “newly a widower and suddenly performing the lead role of parent that he never auditioned for. As his five, complicated adult children begin to navigate life without their mother at the center, Leo is forced to find his own voice as a parent, moving out of wife’s shadow to become the family’s new, differently effective center.”\n\n\tJackson, best known for roles in “Dawson’s Creek,” “Fringe,” “Dr. Death” and more, is repped by CAA, Anonymous Content, Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox and Imprint. \n\t\n\n\tThe story for “How to Survive Without Me” is by Berlanti, Doran and Robbie Rogers, with Berlanti and Doran writing the project. Berlanti, Rogers, Sarah Schechter and Leigh London Redman executive produce for Berlanti Productions through the company’s overall deal at Warner Bros. Television, which serves as the studio on the project. Doran also executive produces.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Esposito took to Instagram on Friday to share that she must move out of the house she mortgaged to finance her directorial debut, “Fresh Kills.”\n\n\t“Yeah, I’m looking like ass right now because I’ve been crying because I’m moving out of my home that I mortgaged to make my film,” the actor said in a self-taped video.\n\n\tEsposito went on to say, “And then to have people who are in the spotlight now not be able to just throw one back and say, ‘Hey, watch this film.’ I said to myself, ‘You know what? Nobody owes anybody anything.’ And then I thought, ‘Do we? Do we as human beings? Maybe that’s why we’re in this problem right now where we are. I think actually we do owe each other something. We owe each other decency as human beings.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the press tour for “Fresh Kills” in 2024, Esposito told KTLA that her passion for the project led her to mortgage her home.“This town tells you what you can be and what you can’t be for so many years. I was just so over that and thought, ‘Why am I asking the world to believe in me, I have to believe in me,’ So I’m going to put my money down,” she said in an interview. “At the end of my life, am I going to be happy that my house was paid off? Or am I going to be so happy that I gave myself the opportunity that I’ve been waiting for for far too long? So I thought, I’m going.”\n\n\n\tPremiering at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2023, “Fresh Kills” is an indie drama set in the late 1980s and early 1990s about two sisters (Odessa A’zion and Emily Bader) whose mother (Esposito) tries to hold the family together when the girls’ mafia boss father (Domenick Lombardozzi) goes to prison. Esposito told Variety in 2023 that the script had been “percolating and marinating” since she was 16, and called the movie “[her] heart,” adding that she used to say, “I don’t think I’d be able to die unless I do this” — referring to making “Fresh Kills.”Fans of the movie and fellow industry professionals showed their support for Esposito in the comment section of her Instagram post. Don Cheadle said, “Here for you, kiddo! Ya’ll check Jennifer’s movie out. She put and puts it all on the line. A real artist in the pursuit of truth!”Debra Messing chimed in, adding, “Jen, I am heartbroken for you. Your film was exquisite and I’m better for seeing it. The fact that you have to leave your home in order to give your Art to the world is maddening. Sending love and strength and appreciation.”Jerry O’Connell added, “So sorry, Jen. I WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT. Promise!”\n\n\tIn a new post on Wednesday, Esposito expressed her gratitude for the support and well-wishes she received since making the news public and clarified that her house was sold to pay off the mortgage, not seized by the bank. She also revealed she is currently crowd-funding for her upcoming film, “Mary Rides the F Train.” \n\t\n\n\t“Betting on yourself is never wrong,” said Esposito in the new video. “I just wish art could be taken for art’s sake and viewed on its merit. That’s why it’s so important to get behind independent films.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMost of the Oscar prognostication action happens around the best picture, acting and directing races, leaving the poor writing nominees metaphorically stuck alone in a room, staring at a blank screen. Not wanting to compound their feelings of loneliness, neglect and — let’s face it, they’re writers — bitterness, Variety is flashing the spotlight in their direction with this list of five things to look for in the original and adapted screenplay categories.\n\t\n\n\t1. Paul Thomas Anderson for the win\n\n\n\tThis might fall into a “Jeopardy!” category titled “Stating the Obvious.” Anybody with a passing knowledge of how the Oscars work understands that the winner is often really getting the award because “it’s their time.” \n\n\tAnderson has five previous screenplay nominations — three for original (“Boogie Nights,” “Magnolia,” “Licorice Pizza”) and two for adapted (“There Will Be Blood,” “Inherent Vice”) —and 14 nods overall, with no wins to date. He’s up for three Oscars this year. Do the math. If he doesn’t win for best picture or directing, he’s likely winning for adapted screenplay.\n\n\t2. Unstoppable “Sinners”\n\n\tWith a record 16 nominations, “Sinners” clearly has momentum behind it, so don’t be surprised to see its writer/director Ryan Coogler walking up the aisle at the Dolby Theatre when they read the name of the winner for original screenplay.\n\n\t3. Dark horses\n\n\tSupporting actor and actress are typically seen as the dark horse categories, often giving the win to a charming young newcomer (e.g., Anna Paquin for “The Piano”) or an aged vet making a comeback (Gloria Stuart for “Titanic,” Christopher Plummer for “Beginners,” etc.). But the screenplay categories have also seen their share of equine noir cross the finish line in first place, including Billy Bob Thornton (“Sling Blade”), who beat out “The English Patient” and “Trainspotting” for adapted screenplay in 1997, and Mark Boal (“The Hurt Locker”), who bested Quentin Tarantino (“Inglourious Basterds”) and Pixar’s “Up” in the original screenplay category in  2010.\n\t\n\n\tThis year, the darkest horse in the writing categories is writer/director Jafar Panahi’s Persian-language “It Was Just an Accident,” which is nominated for original screenplay, as well as international film. But, if history is any indicator, its chances are slim. \n\n\t4. Lost in translation\n\n\tOnly six foreign-language films have won in the writing categories, all original screenplays, and only two since 1967: “Talk to Her” by Pedro Almodover in 2003 and “Parasite” by Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won in 2020. So you can probably safely count out “It Was Just an Accident” and, to a lesser degree, its fellow original screenplay nominee, “Sentimental Value,” which is primarily in Norwegian and Swedish. The latter’s chances are amplified because portions of the movie are in English and it’s a more high-profile contender, with a total of nine nominations, including nods in supporting categories for a pair of actors well-known to Academy voters, Stellan Skarsgård and Elle Fanning.\n\n\t5. Hyphenates triumphant\n\n\tWhen a presidential nominee picks their running mate, they look for a candidate who can strengthen their support in various demographics and territories. With the Oscars, there are no running mates, but it helps if you appeal to more than one voting bloc. That’s why, in the screenplay categories, the advantage goes to the writer who is also a director.\n\n\tExamples range from three-time winners Billy Wilder (“The Lost Weekend,” “Sunset Boulevard,” “The Apartment”) and Woody Allen (“Annie Hall,” “Hannah and Her Sisters,” “Midnight in Paris”) to Sean Baker, who last year took home the Oscar for original screenplay (as well as best picture) for “Anora,” which he also directed.\n\n\tThis year, only two of the 10 nominated films were not written or co-written by the director — “Blue Moon” (Robert Kaplow) and “Bugonia” (Will Tracy) — neither of which has much momentum, almost assuring that a director will get a statuette in both categories.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe International Film Festival Rotterdam crowned its industry award winners on Wednesday following an intense six days of activities in the Dutch city. The awards encompassed all arms of the festival’s industry sections, encompassing CineMart, Darkroom, Lightroom and Safe Harbour, benefiting projects in all stages of development. Winners include “Daughters of the Sea,” by “Leonor Will Never Die” director Martika Ramirez Escobar, and “Neon Phantom,” by “Samba Infinito” director Leonardo Martinelli. \n\t\n\n\tIn a statement, the head of IFFR Pro Marten Rabarts emphasized the importance of new initiatives such as Safe Harbor, Cinemart x HBF and Lightroom at this year’s edition, stating that “the breadth and evolution of this year’s program was a true reflection of our commitment to meeting filmmakers’ shifting needs.”\n\n\n\t“Tonight it was a privilege to come together and celebrate all the market projects, including the winners, each of which has gained remarkable momentum over the past few days – and to round out another powerful edition of IFFR Pro that has sparked connections, unlocked new partnerships and propelled projects closer to a life on the screen and beyond,” he added.\n\n\tThe creation of new key initiatives was one of the several key topics discussed by industry players on the ground. Below, Variety rounds up some of the main talking points at this year’s IFFR Pro, plus a full list of award-winners: \n\n\tThe Trump effect: U.S. indies heading back to Rotterdam\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety ahead of the festival, Rabarts emphasized how one of his key priorities this year and in the years to come was to restore the relationship between IFFR Pro and the U.S. indie scene. This is not only a decision informed by market needs, but also by observing how certain American filmmakers have faced a different but still present form of displacement under the Trump administration. Rabarts brought up how “Watermelon Woman” director Cheryl Dunye had to come to Rotterdam last year because “she couldn’t find support for her next project in the U.S.”\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety, “The Gymnast” director Charlotte Glynn spoke as to how the current sociopolitical unrest in the U.S. has made it even more important for American films to have space at festivals like Rotterdam. She praised her international team, including talent from Mexico, Brazil and China. “This group from around the world all helped shape the movie. I’m so grateful for how each of their perspectives has deepened the story I wanted to tell. The reality is that in the United States right now, many of my incredible collaborators won’t feel safe or could have come to a premiere because of the viciousness and violence of the current administration, which makes our premiere at Rotterdam even more special.”\n\n\tJames N. Kienitz Wilkins, whose “The Misconceived” played in Harbour, offered a more industry-focused point of view: “I was recently told by a well-known U.S. programmer that he was obliged to go to Sundance, but always looked to Rotterdam for what’s really going on.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Gymnast,” courtesy of IFFR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Visit Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDisplacement crisis: flexibility is key \n\n\tThis year’s festival kicked off with the world premiere of the first batch of films produced by the Cate Blanchett-spearheaded Displacement Film Fund, including new works by “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” director Mohammad Rasoulof and “Klondike” director Maryna Er Gorbach. Within one year, the festival announced the initiative, organized a selection committee, selected grantees, allocated funds and premiered six new films, crowning their efforts by recently announcing a second round of grants.\n\n\tThroughout the Pro activities, there was a generalized feeling of: how did they pull that off? A festival fundraiser, who asked not to be identified, told Variety that they were in “awe” of how HBF managed to benefit from private funding from a major partner like UNIQLO for the initiative and still manage to organize and hand out the grants in time for the films to be produced under a very tight schedule. “I am very curious as to how this might become a practical example for other similar funds,” they added.\n\n\tHBF head Tamara Tatishvili told Variety that agility was “key” to delivering the initiative. “One of the strengths of a fund like ours and our ecosystem is that we can be more flexible than many other financiers. In roles where the legal framework is more important, we would not be able to do some of those films. We had to be very agile.”\n\t\n\n\tCan Rotterdam find Southeast Asia’s Park Chan-wook?\n\n\tRotterdam has a long legacy of supporting and platforming filmmakers from Southeast Asia, with a particular recent focus on Indonesia and Malaysia. A more recent development, however, is how the festival has turned into a fruitful connecting point to facilitate co-productions between countries from the region. EST N8 sales representative Sophie Shi told Variety that Rotterdam is still key when it comes to fomenting such deals, as well as “educating” Southeast Asian producers on the importance of international visibility. \n\n\tA lot of producers in the region haven’t seen the value of why we would need international reach,” she adds. “However, if you look at the development of Korean cinema, it took years of active work. We still don’t have a Park Chan-wook in Southeast Asia, but we need to invest in that idea. Korea has proven that content from Asia can impact the whole world, so that should give us hope and encourage producers from our countries to educate producers internationally. Rotterdam is a great place for this to happen.” \n\n\tThey’re Still Here: Brazil comes strong  \n\n\tFrom a packed house on the festival’s first weekend for a career conversation with Kleber Mendonça Filho to sold-out screenings of Tiago Melo’s “Yellow Cake,” the Brazilian presence was palpable at this year’s festival. At the market, that was intensified tenfold thanks to HBF+Brazil, delivered in partnership with RioFilme, Spcine and Projeto Paradiso, and dedicated to supporting the early development of projects by second and third-time filmmakers from Brazil. \n\n\tProjeto Paradiso’s executive director, Josephine Bourgois, said their team leaves Rotterdam feeling it has been a “very special year” for Brazil at the festival. The exec highlighted not only the hefty Brazilian presence in all festival and pro programs but also the 40-person delegation on the ground, including over a dozen members of Projeto Paradiso’s very own talent network. “It emphasizes a feeling of continuity, but also of a renewed partnership that is becoming increasingly ambitious with projects such as HBF+Brazil.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Yellow Cake,” courtesy of IFFR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Gilvan Barreto\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIFFR Pro 2026 winners in full:\n\t\n\n\t4DR Studios Awards\n\n\t4DR Studios Award for Best Immersive Project in development:\n\n\t“Chemin des Bâtards,” dir. by Leon Rogissart, produced by BNA-BBOT, UpscaleXR and Muziektheater Transparant (Belgium, Netherlands)\n\n\t4DR Studios Award for Best Immersive work-in-progress project in Lightroom: \n\n\t“Cléo,” dir.

CAN has signed deals with more than 20 U.S.cinema circuits, representing more than 400 locations and 2,500 screens.\n\n\n\t“Through our new network of theater sites, studios can quickly activate film campaigns using programmatic advertising and drive direct-to-theater ticket sales,” said Boxoffice EVP Global Exhibitor Relations Malcolm MacMillan. “This unique approach delivers the reach, speed, and hyper-targeting of web-based programmatic buying, while ensuring the movie consumer’s direct conversion on cinema websites, without intervention from third-party ticket brokers. With thousands of screens already signed up for our network, CAN will help studios with a turnkey pathway to deploy high-impact, conversion-focused cinema campaigns nationwide.”\n\n\tCAN was created by Boxoffice in partnership with the interactive advertising platform, MediaKoi, which allows companies to run content across relevant platforms.

    "body": "\n\n\tWhitney Leavitt’s world is widening.\n\n\tThe 32-year-old is best known for Hulu’s “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,” the addictive reality TV series she broke out from as the villain in Season 1, though she’s garnered more sympathy over time. But if everything goes Leavitt’s way, the unscripted genre won’t be her main claim to fame a few years from now. Though Season 4 of “Mormon Wives” drops on March 12, her focus is elsewhere: Monday marked her Broadway debut as Roxie Hart in the ongoing Broadway revival of “Chicago.”\n\n\tThis was always the plan. “I have a distinct memory of being in college with my husband while we were dating, and he asked, ‘What do you want to do?’” Leavitt says, sitting across from me at a Times Square Italian restaurant after a “Chicago” rehearsal. “I was like, ‘I want to be in the movies.’ It was always something I’d thought in my mind, but I had never said it out loud, and I didn’t know how to get there. Like, ‘Where do people go?’” \n\n\tIt’s strange, at first, to imagine a version of Leavitt who was so reticent to admit her dreams. These days, she’s known for her shameless ambition, and back then, she was a fine arts major with a dance concentration. A career as a performer would have been a logical goal.\n\n\tThen again, despite her coursework and her upbringing as a competitive dancer, Leavitt didn’t come from a culture that expected her to pursue a career at all. She and her husband — Conner Leavitt, also a fixture on “Mormon Wives — attended Brigham Young University, the Mormon Church’s flagship school. “Looking back, I do wish that I would have ventured out to other universities, because it was very conservative,” she says. In 2019, the year after she graduated, a study found that female BYU grads made an average income of $800 per year by age 34. (No, there aren’t any zeroes missing from that stat.) In other words, the world was telling Leavitt to become a full-time homemaker.\n\n\tAnd that’s what she was for a number of years. She and Conner had their first baby in 2019.\n\n\t“I was starting to lose my sense of self,” she says. “Your time is designated so much to this one human being that even when you have time for yourself, all I could think was, ‘What did she eat today? I’m gonna have to get up at this time. I didn’t get this at the grocery store.’ That was my life — and that’s not the life I wanted to live.” So she changed it.\n\n\t“You can like the life you’re livin’ / You can live the life you like,” Leavitt was singing on stage just minutes ago, rehearsing “Nowadays,” the bittersweet Roxie-Velma duet that leads into the “Chicago” finale. As we walk from the Ambassador Theatre to the restaurant, she gasps, wide-eyed and delighted, “We’re actually getting to eat during this interview? I want carbs!” When we sit down, she apologizes over and over for needing a minute to look at her phone — “Don’t hate me,” she pleads, and she seems to mean it earnestly — which she hasn’t checked since her interview on “Live With Kelly and Mark” before rehearsal this morning. We begin tearing into the free bread basket, and she grins, warning me that she likes to bite straight into the butter rather than spreading it onto the bread. We talk about her career at length over meatballs, and then she heads home to Conner and their three children, who are waiting for her in an apartment on the Upper West Side.  \n\n\n\tThese are the kinds of days she dreamed of back in the throes of early motherhood. During that come-to-Jesus moment when she realized she didn’t like the path she was on, “I was like, ‘Let’s stop groveling,’” she says. “‘Let’s get off our ass and see what we’ve got. I have an iPhone, and I’ve got a free app where I can shake my booty and create funny videos.’” She became a TikToker.\n\n\tThough Conner always supported her, others in Leavitt’s life were wary of her fledgling social media hustle. “Telling my family and friends, it was just such a joke to them. ‘Why do you want to do that?’ ‘Wow. Good luck,’” she recalls. “And I knew it was crazy. Like, I’m a mom! But they thought it was this childish thing, while I felt like I needed a platform to put myself out there.” And even when the content was silly — dancing, lipsyncing, joking about parenting — it carried meaning for her. During some of those difficult postpartum days, scrolling on TikTok “was an outlet for me,” she says. “I was like, ‘I just want to think of nothing! I just want to look at my phone.’”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhitney and Conner Leavitt, holding one of their children in an episode of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” Season 2.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney/Fred Hayes\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBeing in movies was still the plan, and Leavitt felt sure that she could get herself there. But in the meantime, she focused on finding any way she could to make money entertaining people. For years, she posted three to five videos per day to figure out what would stick. In the process, she found other Mormon moms on TikTok who were not only building sustainable incomes but outearning their husbands, becoming the rare female breadwinners in their community. As they befriended each other and began posting content together, their audiences grew. The group became known as #MomTok, and their videos evolved into a sensation.\n\t\n\n\tYet Leavitt felt conflicted about the rise of #MomTok. “The brand deals were nice. They were fun,” she says. (And they brought in a lot of money.) “But my goal wasn’t to be an influencer, right? And that’s what I was becoming.” Still, she figured that staying the course would pay off. “I would get together with these other women who didn’t necessarily have the same goal in mind, because I think that most of them enjoy being an influencer, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” she says. “I enjoyed it because, for one, I loved the camaraderie, but also putting myself out there in avenues where you’re gonna see more of me. Then the reality show presented itself.”\n\n\tShe thought “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” would be her big break, and it has been. The show premiered on Hulu in September 2024 and immediately surpassed “The Kardashians” to become the streamer’s most-watched reality premiere of the year. But that success has come at a cost. “We were just excited to get a bigger platform, and that’s also how it’s presented to us. ‘Look at this diamond. So shiny and cute!’ I’m like, ‘It is! Give it to me!’” Leavitt says. All of a sudden, the interpersonal dramas that she normally would have resolved in a group chat or over the dirty sodas the show made famous were streaming on Hulu for the world to see — and to tear her apart.\n\n\tThe early episodes of “Mormon Wives” establish Leavitt as the foil to Taylor Frankie Paul, who founded #MomTok. Paul made headlines in 2022 for revealing that she and her husband were divorcing after she cheated on him with one of their friends — and that the friend was one of many with whom they’d been “soft swinging.” The news snowballed, with Paul’s online audience assuming that other members of #MomTok had also been sexually involved with Paul and her husband. (Every “Mormon Wives” cast member denies this, with the exception of Miranda and Chase McWhorter, who joined in Season 2.) But it also got Hulu’s attention, landing the women of #MomTok their own TV show. If Paul was the show’s scandal-wracked but goodhearted star, Leavitt was its holier-than-thou villain who hated to share the limelight. The other women often met her passive aggression with direct confrontation, leaving her in tears. That pattern didn’t go over well with “Mormon Wives” fans, who have often criticized her for having a “victim mentality.”\n\t\n\n\tLeavitt knows she’s made her share of mistakes on “Mormon Wives.” Her sins against her castmates in Season 1 included skipping Paul’s baby shower, giving Demi Engemann an embarrassing gag gift related to her sexual history, leaving the #MomTok group chat, unfollowing everyone on social media, skipping Mayci Neeley’s business launch event and showing up uninvited to Mikayla Matthews’ birthday party to apologize to Neeley. The kinds of offenses that can feel nuclear and even relationship-ending within the context of a friend group — but that don’t typically earn you death threats. Unless you’re on camera.\n\n\t“I didn’t watch reality TV. I still don’t. So I went into it very naive,” Leavitt says. “And people forget that before you film, people are talking to you like, ‘You’re about to have this conversation with so-and-so, and she’s pissed.’ It gives me so much anxiety. I’m like, ‘What do you mean she’s pissed? What? Now I’m scared!’ Like with Mikayla’s birthday party, I was bawling my eyes out before walking in those doors. But nobody would have known that.”\n\n\tAs online hate poured in after the release of Season 1, Leavitt was inconsolable. But now she laughs at herself for the same thing her critics jabbed her for. “Sometimes, when something bad happens to you, you only think of yourself,” she says. “‘Woe is me. Me, me, me, me, me. This is why I’m the victim.’”\n\n\tNow an Emmy-nominated hit with a massive following, “Mormon Wives” films at a breakneck pace; the March release of Season 4 comes only 18 months after the series launched. So Leavitt was angsty and exhausted by the time contract renegotiations rolled around after Season 2, and when she didn’t get what she wanted, she quit. As revealed in one of the show’s signature fourth-wall breaks in the Season 3 premiere last fall, she had asked Hulu for a role on a scripted series and was turned down. She decided that if being a reality TV star wasn’t going to offer a more concrete path toward her artistic goals, the emotional cost had become too high. Leavitt bought a house in Southern Utah, five hours away from production in Provo, and moved her family there. Then producers called to say that “Dancing With the Stars” wanted some “Mormon Wives” to audition, but she’d have to rejoin the show if she wanted a shot.\n\n\t“I had a really long conversation with Conner. Like, ‘I don’t know how to feel like myself and do this experience,’” she says. When Leavitt watched her own actions on the show, she saw a woman in crisis, responding to artificial pressures instead of acting on her true instincts. But “Dancing With the Stars” was exactly the kind of opportunity she’d hoped to nab when she first got on TikTok. After a long week of mulling it over, Leavitt decided to confront the anxieties that made her feel like a victim in Seasons 1 and 2. “I was like, ‘You know what? Fuck that.’” \n\t\n\n\tLeavitt returned to “Mormon Wives” with a new attitude. She’d been absent for the first four episodes, and when grilled by her castmates about why she’d come back in Episode 5, aptly titled “The Book of Resurrection,” she was transparent about prioritizing the “Dancing With the Stars” audition over her #MomTok friendships. \n\n\t“I always knew what I wanted. I’ve never been ashamed of it,” Leavitt says. “I’ve learned as I’ve grown up that that’s sometimes a turn-off for people, but that’s just a part of who I am. And the women knew that. They knew I’d always had this goal in mind. It was a matter of: Give me that one shot. I want to show everyone how much I love doing this and put art out there, so hopefully it leads to more.”\n\n\tObviously, her admission caused more drama among #MomTok. But that no longer wounded her the way it used to.\n\n\tLeavitt instituted a pre-game ritual for every “Mormon Wives” filming session. It’s not exactly prayer — Leavitt still considers herself a Mormon despite that she’s “definitely not as active as I used to be” — but it works for her. “I take a big fucking deep breath,” she says, laughing, “and I have a song I listen to.” (She alternates between “Could Have Been Me” by The Struts and “Golden” from “KPop Demon Hunters.”) “I envision myself at peace. ‘Let me reground myself because I know shit’s about to hit the fan, and I want to be as authentic as I possibly can.’” She stopped trying to avoid the drama — which would be an unreasonable goal on reality TV — and instead focuses on showing up to the drama as her truest self. It makes for good television without wrecking her mental health.\n\t\n\n\tLeavitt doesn’t spend much time anymore thinking about the way her scenes are edited. \n\n\t“Reality TV is hard, because you have to be willing to understand that there’s a story we’re telling, and you can’t keep everything. We signed up for that,’” she says. “Did I know that in the beginning? No. But I know it now. It’s a story they created —” she corrects herself — “Sorry, not created. It’s a story they put together. So sure, there were parts left out where I was like, ‘Maybe I would have gotten more grace if that was kept in.’ But it’s entertainment.”\n\n\tEven when she knows she’s at fault, Leavitt is less concerned about viewers’ opinions. “I think the important thing is recognizing it, trying your best not to do it again, but then also being like, ‘Well, I’m a human being, and you don’t have to like me.’” She pauses, then blurts, “Because I also probably wouldn’t like you!”\n\n\tThere are still hiccups. “I’d be lying if I didn’t say on-camera emotions are naturally heightened. I’ve had conversations where I’m like, ‘That was way over the top,’” she says. “Something happened in Season 4 and I messaged one of the women — which everyone’s gonna see, because I lost my shit — like, ‘Bro, I’m so sorry. That was completely out of line.’ When there’s a camera in front of me, I feel an unspoken pressure to perform. I’ve talked about it with some of the women, and a lot of them agree. We’re like, ‘What is that? I would have never freaked out that much, but I did, and it’s not like anybody told me to. I just did.’”\n\t\n\n\tLittle by little, she’s working on healing her #MomTok relationships. When asked how she’s doing with the other women today, she quips, “I would say, ‘great’! And then ‘good’ for some of them. And then ‘OK.’ But no bad.” The geographical distance between her and the rest of the cast has helped. Portions of Season 4 were shot while Leavitt was in L.A. competing on “Dancing With the Stars” — because, of course, she did end up getting cast, as did her castmate Jen Affleck.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhitney Leavitt and Jen Affleck after learning they were cast on “Dancing With the Stars.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney/Fred Hayes\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLeavitt’s opportunism was paying off. Early into her run on “Dancing With the Stars,” she found out she’d been cast in her first feature film: a Christmas rom-com called “All for Love.” Then, just a day after she’d privately told her dance partner Mark Ballas that Roxie Hart would be a dream role, the producers of “Chicago” reached out to ask if she’d like to audition. “I was like, first of all, fuck yes. Secondly, I need to learn how to sing right now.”\n\n\tLeavitt started taking vocal lessons and learning monologues. Though she was never asked to do a dance audition, she and Ballas planted a covert one on national television when they competed with “Cell Block Tango,” one of the most iconic numbers in “Chicago.” They made it to the semifinals of “Dancing With the Stars” before they were eliminated, with many online speculating that the timing of “Mormon Wives” Season 3 and the reveal of her unabashed pursuit of the audition pushed viewers to vote against her. Still, the cards were stacked in her favor: She was widely being discussed as the most skilled dancer on her season, and her in-person “Chicago” audition was approaching.\n\n\tThen came the whirlwind of Leavitt’s life. She flew from L.A. to New York for her audition two days after her “Dancing With the Stars” elimination on Nov. 18. The official offer to play Roxie came the next day. The day after that, she found out that ABC had arranged for her and Ballas to professionally tape the freestyle they’d hoped to perform as “Dancing With the Stars” finalists — set to a mashup of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” and the “Mormon Wives” theme song — paired with a lengthy interview on Alex Cooper’s popular podcast “Call Her Daddy.” Leavitt then spent two weeks shooting “All for Love,” headed back to Utah to get her family packed for the winter and moved to New York to start “Chicago” rehearsals a few days before Christmas. In the six weeks since, while learning all her lines, songs and choreography, she has been intermittently followed by camerapeople documenting her “Chicago” experience for Season 5 of “Mormon Wives.”\n\n\tIt’s a lot. And it doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon. When I ask Leavitt whether she’s in talks for any unannounced projects, she bats her eyelashes and takes a nibble of the Nutella focaccia pizza she’s ordered for us to share. “Maybe,” she says. “Maybe another movie. Not a rom-com. A thriller.”\n\t\n\n\tHer dreams are getting more specific now. “We need another ‘Step Up,’” she tells me. “It needs to be a limited series. But can we mix it with a bit of ‘American Horror Story’? A little more edgy, and not so campy.” A Ryan Murphy project is at the top of her wishlist, she says more than once, and she saw him when she attended the premiere of “The Beauty,” but her gut told her it wasn’t the right time to introduce herself. “But I said hi to Ashton [Kutcher],” she says, “who thought I was a different Mormon wife. That’s OK. We all kind of look alike.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMark Ballas and Whitney Leavitt during the “Dancing With the Stars” Season 34 semifinals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney/Eric McCandless\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe experience of shooting “Mormon Wives” Season 5 in New York away from her castmates has been “very lonely,” Leavitt says, “but they’re all gonna come to opening night. I’m excited to see everyone. But then I gotta get up the next day and do the show again. Am I even gonna be able to get together with them before my next show?”\n\n\tIf it’s this tricky for Leavitt to schedule a hang — and crucially, a filming session — with #MomTok even when they’ve traveled across the country to see her, her future on “Mormon Wives” looks murky. “They’re following me while I’m in New York, but I don’t know how that would look for future seasons. It wouldn’t make sense. People want to see the group together,” she says. “Part of me is like, ‘I can’t do both,’ because both are so time-demanding. Even filming Season 5 has been really hard.” \n\n\t“And I need to crush this role,” she continues. “I want producers to come. I want writers and directors to come. And I want them to be inspired, to be like, ‘Let’s create things together.’”\n\n\tSo I ask: Besides her friendships with her castmates, which she could theoretically maintain even if she left “Mormon Wives” — “And I would,” she cuts in — what does she gain from staying now that she’s booking the roles she always dreamed of?\n\n\tFor the first and only time during our nearly two-hour interview, Leavitt falls silent. \n\t\n\n\tAfter a full 10 seconds, during which I assume we’re both picturing headlines about her exiting “Mormon Wives” to join the Murphy-verse, she answers truthfully: “I don’t know. Because this is what I wanted, and I wasn’t shy about sharing that. So at what point do you move on to the next journey?” She and Conner “keep going back and forth,” she says. “That’s where it all started, so it’s kind of sad. But maybe that’s the best thing.”\n\n\tThis time away from Utah has also given Leavitt some much-needed space from her “devout, exact obedience” to the Mormon faith she grew up with. “I still have those same core values and standards,” she says, but “my 30s have been the first time I’ve questioned things.” Her oldest child is six — two years away from the age of baptism in the Mormon Church. Leavitt still wants to go through with that tradition, but she also wants to raise her kids to think for themselves. “They may grow up and be like, ‘Well, what do you mean?’ I don’t drink alcohol, right? But they might be like, ‘Well, I want to drink.’ And I’d be like, ‘OK.’ That’s the journey I’m on right now.” \n\n\tThe journey has also led Leavitt to consider how — and whether — politics should factor into her life as a public figure. “Of course I have opinions. Of course I hate what’s going on right now. It’s really sad and it’s disturbing, and it makes me angry,” she says, referring to ICE’s ongoing raids in Minneapolis and nationwide. “I do want to use my platform for good. I just don’t know what that looks like. I don’t know if posting on my Instagram story [helps]. I feel like I actually need to do more.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhitney Leavitt as Roxie Hart\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmilio Madrid\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBack at the theater, where I watched Leavitt chatting and getting feedback from her “Chicago” castmates and choreographers, she seemed just like the no-holds-barred version of herself she debuted in “Mormon Wives” Season 3 — but warmer, happier. It’s easier to be your best self in a production that depends on your success than it is in one that zooms in on your darkest moments. And that sounds obvious, but it’s something Leavitt has had to learn in real time.\n\t\n\n\tEven now that the pain of becoming a reality villain has subsided, it hasn’t stopped feeling bizarre. “I don’t feel like I did anything that bad. You would think I had brutally killed someone from the commentary you hear online,” she says, laughing. That’s part of what makes Roxie, who does brutally kill someone at the beginning of “Chicago,” such a delicious alter ego for Leavitt.\n\n\tLeavitt may not be a murderer, but she sees herself in Roxie’s ambition. “Sometimes when I’m playing her, I’m like, ‘This hits a little too close to home.’ She’s like, ‘Please, no pictures!’ But …” In character, Leavitt shimmies one shoulder and gives a sly grin, like she’s posing for a photo anyway. “We might share that in common.”\n\n\tWhat has Roxie — whose crime turns her into a celebrity until a new murderess steals the spotlight — taught Leavitt about fame? “It’s not something that you can rely on,” she says. \n\n\tIt’s true, Roxie’s star status is fleeting. But as her story ends, her career on the stage presses forward. (And “Chicago” itself is the longest-running American show in Broadway history.)\n\n\tSo Leavitt has also gleaned a few lessons about endurance. “Roxie’s always known what she wants, and she was never afraid to say what it is,” she continues. “She’s curious. ‘Oh, you did it that way? I’m gonna try too.’ I can relate, because I’m still learning in this industry. I’m like, ‘OK, that’s who I need to suck up to? Great. I can do that.’”\n\n\tYou can see the gears turning in Leavitt’s mind as she says of Roxie: “She’s a villain, but she gets to be a hero. She took circumstances that were out of her control and was like, ‘How do I keep this going?’” Listening to her speak — a Broadway lead who two years ago was just a TikToker in Utah — it isn’t hard to believe that Leavitt will keep going too.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Lake Theater & Café in the Portland suburb of Lake Oswego, Ore. will no longer screen “Melania,” the Amazon Studios documentary about first lady Melania Trump, after Amazon pulled the film from its screens.\n\n\tThe move was in response to the theater’s marquee messages promoting the film, including “Does Melania wear Prada? Find out Friday!” and — quoting Sun Tzu — “To defeat your enemy. You must know them. Melania.”\n\n\n\tDirected by Brett Ratner, “Melania” chronicles the 20 days leading up to President Donald Trump’s second inauguration. Amazon purchased the rights to produce and distribute the film for $40 million in 2025.\n\t\n\n\tManager Jordan Perry said the theater received a call from Amazon asking them to pull the film. “The studio was not happy and/or did not appreciate my take on marketing their film to our own public,” Perry told The Oregonian. A source familiar with the film confirms that the title was indeed pulled.\n\n\tThe marquee was subsequently changed to read: “Amazon called. Our marquee made them mad. All “Melania” showings cancelled. Show your support at Whole Foods instead. Join Amazon Prime for Free Two-Day Shipping.” \n\n\n\tPerry said the theater had also received emails and messages from local patrons questioning why the film was being shown at all. In a blog post, he explained that booking “Melania” was intended as a humorous choice during a slow movie week, not a political statement. “Wouldn’t it be exponentially weirder, to the point of being funny, to show “Melania” here, at your obviously anti-establishment, occasionally troublemaking, neighborhood cinema?” Perry wrote.\n\t\n\n\tAmazon Studios declined to comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSouth by Southwest has added a second wave of programming to its 2026 film and TV lineup.\n\n\tAmong the titles added is Season 3 of “The Comeback,” the long awaited — and allegedly final, if HBO is to be believed — new installation of Michael Patrick King and Lisa Kudrow’s comedy series that premiered in 2005 and came back for a second season in 2014. Kudrow stars as a washed-up former sitcom actress who returns to the limelight later in her life.\n\t\n\n\t“Pretty Lethal,” a thriller film starring Uma Thurman and the buzzy young actresses Iris Apatow, Lana Condor, Millicent Simmonds, Avantika, Maddie Ziegler as ballerinas, has been added to the headliners section. \n\n\tThe festival has filled out its 24 Beats Per Second section of music-focused films with documentaries about the Red Hot Chili Peppers — focused on the impact of original guitarist Hillel Slovak — as well as Lainey Wilson, Jack Johnson, Noah Kahan and Charley Crockett.\n\n\tAdam Scott wil be a presence at SXSW this year, starring in two new films: “The Saviors,” in which he and Danielle Deadwyler play an estranged couple renting out an AirBnB, and “Hokum,” an Irish horror film from writer-director Damian McCarthy.\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to share more of our 2026 lineup,” said Claudette Godfrey, SXSW’s president of film and TV. “We’ve assembled an extraordinary range of voices and visions: bold new filmmakers, high-profile studio premieres, gripping series, powerful documentaries and stunning international cinema. Every year, I’m blown away by the caliber of talent that chooses SXSW to share their work and 2026 is no exception. These projects push boundaries, take risks and demand to be seen live and in person. The magic of SXSW is our community and we’re counting down the days until we come together and celebrate with the most engaged, enthusiastic crowds around.

We're told the light spooked the uninvited guest, who fled on foot before anyone could get a good look at his face. The man noted there was no break-in attempt and nothing was stolen from his yard.\n      \n\n          As everyone knows, Nancy's family reported her missing Sunday after they received word she didn't show up at her regular church service.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    NewsNation\n          \n    \n          Police say she was kidnapped from her home between Saturday night and Sunday morning.

Problem for him is -- the court just ruled to toss out nearly all of Vonleh's claims ... finding the dispute had already been handled in arbitration and he couldn’t relitigate it.

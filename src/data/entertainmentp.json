    "description": "\n\tCBS News got more than it bargained for when it arranged for an interview earlier this week between President Donald Trump and anchor Tony Dokoupil ",
    "body": "\n\tCBS News got more than it bargained for when it arranged for an interview earlier this week between President Donald Trump and anchor Tony Dokoupil on his still-nascent tenure on “CBS Evening News.”\n\n\tAccording to a report published Saturday by The New York Times, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told producers and the anchor that Trump did not want the exchange edited. “He said, ‘Make sure you don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,’ Leavitt told Dokoupil and his executive producer, Kim Harvey. “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.'”\n\t\n\n\tSuch behavior is not unexpected when it comes to the Trump administration. Trump won a $16 million settlement from CBS News’ parent company, Paramount, after he he sued over the way a “60 Minutes” interview with former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris was edited in 2024. Legal experts felt Trump’s suit lacked merit, but Paramount was in a squeeze — it needed U.S. regulatory approval to sell itself to its new owner, now called Paramount Skydance. Trump has also won legal fees from Walt Disney Co., and worked to entangle other media outlets in legal skirmishes, including The Wall Street Journal and the BBC. Paramount’s decision led in part to the exit of two senior CBS News executives with oversight of “60 Minutes” and other operations.\n\n\n\tIn a statement Saturday, CBS News said Leavitt’s demands were not a factor in its decision to present Doukopil’s 13-minute long interview with Trump, at a Ford plant in Michigan, in full: “The moment we booked this interview we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety.”\n\t\n\n\tEven so, CBS News has caved to a similar demand in the past, a move that can be seen to sacrifice its journalistic independence. In September, CBS News agreed to stop editing taped interviews with newsmakers who appear on its Sunday public-affairs program “Face the Nation” following complaints from the Trump administration over an appearance on the show by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. She made made a number of false or unproven statements during her intervifew about Kilmar Abergo Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was deported despite his having protected legal status in the United States. CBS News offered just a portion of the overall interview with Noem and made the full exchange available online.\n\n\tThe Trump threat comes even as CBS News has worked to give administration officials more time on its programs. Under recently installed editor in chief Bari Weiss, both “CBS Evening News” and “60 Minutes” have found more room for talks with officials including U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, for example, who spoke with Doukopil for three segments of a weekend broadcast following a U.S. military incursion on Venezuela. “60 Minutes” offered a report in October that had U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son in law, Jared Kushner, offer insight into an effort to end recent conflicts in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\tThe threat from the White House was issued as Paramount Skydance is jockeying to acquire the media assets of Warner Bros. Discovery, even though that company has already brokered a deal to sell its streaming and studio operations to Netflix. Such a pact will also require regulatory approval.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJamie-Lynn Sigler got emotional during a recent interview with ABC (via Entertainment Weekly) in which she discussed her recent guest spot on “Grey’s Anatomy” as a doctor with multiple sclerosis. She said the role was extremely personal, given that she was diagnosed with the condition 25 years ago and felt she needed to “keep it a secret” out of fear of losing work.\n\n\tShe told ABC, “To think back 25 years ago — when I was diagnosed and having to keep it a secret, thinking that if anybody knew that I had MS, that meant that I would never work again — and to now be in a position where my having MS inspired a role in a storyline on a show like ‘Grey’s Anatomy,’ I never would have believed you.”\n\t\n\n\tSigler, who was working on the legendary HBO drama “The Sopranos” at the time, was 20 years old when she was diagnosed with MS. She didn’t go public with the news until 2017, when she sat down with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\n\tOn Jan. 15, Sigler appeared on “Grey’s Anatomy” as Dr. Laura Kaplan, a urologist with MS. In her episode, she gives Dr. Richard Webber, played by James Pickens Jr., advice on how to best treat his prostate cancer.\n\n\tSigler said her goal with the part was to “show someone in their power” and give an authentic depiction of someone living and thriving with MS.\n\n\t“My very first take, where I do say the words that ‘I have MS,’ was very emotional for me,” she said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMark Jones, a veteran animation writer and the director of B-horror comedy classics like “Leprechaun” and “Rumpelstiltskin,” died on Jan. 16 in Los Angeles after a brief stay at West Hills Hospital. He was 72.\n\n\tGeorge Saadi, a friend and collaborator of Jones’, confirmed his death to Variety. His 73rd birthday was Saturday, Jan. 17, and he missed the date by only a few hours.\n\n\n\tJones was best known for writing and directing the 1992 cult classic “Leprechaun,” starring Jennifer Aniston and Warwick Davis. The film spawned seven sequels. “Leprechaun Returns,” the most recent installment, was released in 2018. His other notable credits include 1995’s “Rumpelstiltskin,” a feature-length retelling of the classic fairytale, and 1997’s “NightMan,” a made-for-TV movie about a musician who is struck by lightning and gains the power to hear the frequency of evil.\n\t\n\n\tJones got his start working on Saturday morning cartoons. He sold his first script to Filmation Studios before landing at DePatie Freleng, where he wrote “Mister Magoo” and “Pink Panther.” He then moved to legendary animation house Hanna-Barbera, where he wrote and story edited for shows like “Super Friends” and several “Scooby Doo” projects.\n\n\n\tSome of his other notable animation writing credits include “Fangface,” “Yogi’s Space Race,” “Plastic Man,” “Heathcliff” and “Mister T.”\n\n\tJones also worked on several live-action series through the ‘80s and early ‘90s. These included “The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo,” “Riptide,” “The A-Team,” “The Fall Guy” and “Superboy.” His most recent feature directing credits include 2013’s “Scorned,” 2008’s “Triloquist” and 2004’s “Quiet Kill.”\n\t\n\n\tA private memorial service for Jones is planned for the near future.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s no spoiler that Cillian Murphy makes his return to the hit zombie franchise that made his name more than two decades on in “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple.” Danny Boyle, who gave the actor his big screen break in “28 Days Later,” revealed the info after the actor notably failed to show up in last year’s sequel “28 Years Later” (it turned out that, no, he wasn’t the emaciated zombie seen rising from a field).\n\n\tBut those who don’t want to know how and when he appears in Nia DaCosta‘s blood-soaked sequel to the sequel — in cinemas with Sony Pictures — may want to stop reading now. \n\t\n\n\tMurphy does indeed return in “The Bone Temple,” reprising his role as Jim, the bicycle courier who famously woke up from a coma to find a London deserted and devastated by the Rage virus back in 2001. But it’s not until right at the very end of the new film — and in a distinctly quiet scene that calms the tone down dramatically from the wildly unhinged mayhem seen over the previous 90 minutes. For director Nia DaCosta, working from Alex Garland’s script, that was entirely the point of what she hoped to achieve. \n\n\n\t“Because it’s not a big ‘return of the superhero’ franchise moment,” she explains to Variety. “It’s the return of the bike messenger.”\n\n\tAfter reaching the climax of a prolonged and escalating period of madness with Ralph Fiennes’ Dr Kelson, Jack O’Connell’s Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal and Chi Lewis-Parry’s Alpha zombie Samson, the film makes a sudden shift to a whole new setting, showing Murphy’s Jim living in relative isolated safety, quite possibly in the same remote cottage he was left at the end of “28 Days Later.” A quarter century on and he now has a daughter (who he’s seen helping prepare for a history exam). \n\t\n\n\t“The fact that Alex wrote him teaching his daughter history and that’s how he wanted to introduce him back into the story, I was like, ok, so that’s how we shoot it,” DaCosta says. “So it’s grounded. It’s not this big, bombastic moment. And I think it’s powerful enough just to see him.” \n\n\tIt was certainly powerful enough to have audiences erupt into cheers in early screenings. \n\n\tAs it happens, audiences may have recognized Murphy’s voice much earlier. As DaCosta was figuring out the title sequence of “The Bone Temple” and how to introduce the name of the new film on screen, she decided that what she needed to do was deploy a scene from the past. “So we did it with sound, and the sound you hear is Cillian’s from the first film saying ‘Hello’,” she says. “So he actually appears in the film very early on.”\n\n\tFans of the franchise may also note a hat tip to it’s origins in the big reveal with Murphy later on, with DaCosta using the original eerie track “In a Heartbeat,” composed by John Murphy for “28 Days Later.”\n\n\t“That was the biggest franchise-y thing we did,” she says. \n\n\tMuch like the final scene in “28 Years Later” that introduced O’Conell’s Crystal, the last act in “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” with Murphy heavily suggests that there’s more to come. Thankfully, Sony has already greenlit a follow-up, with Garland back on writing duties.\n\n\tDaCosta claims it was “so much fun” making the film (and also admits it was “100%” a reaction to having made a major MCU tentpole in “The Marvels” and then an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s “Hedda”). But sadly it’s largely irrelevant whether or not she’d want to come back to direct the next one. \n\n\tAs she notes: “Danny called dibs.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatt Damon and Ben Affleck recently appeared on the “Joe Rogan Experience” to promote their new Netflix film “The Rip,” and the long-time friends and collaborators shared their thoughts on how the streamer is changing the way movies are made. \n\n\tDamon pointed out that because viewers give a “very different level of attention” to a movie at home versus in a theater, Netflix wants to push the action set pieces toward the front of the runtime. He also said there are behind-the-scenes discussions about reiterating “the plot three or four times in the dialogue” to account for people being on their phones.\n\t\n\n\t“The standard way to make an action movie that we learned was, you usually have three set pieces. One in the first act, one in the second, one in the third,” Damon explained. “You spend most of your money on that one in the third act. That’s your finale. And now they’re like, ‘Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay. And it wouldn’t be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they’re watching.’”\n\n\n\tAffleck then cut in, adding that the streamer formula for successful content isn’t the only way. He used Netflix’s recent limited series hit “Adolescence” as a shining example.\n\n\t“But then you look at ‘Adolescence,’ and it didn’t do any of that shit,” Affleck said. “And it’s fucking great. And it’s dark too. It’s tragic and intense. [It’s about] this guy who finds out his kid is accused of murder. There are long shots of the back of their heads. They get in the car, nobody says anything.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile Damon thought shows like “Adolescence” are “the exception,” Affleck said he felt the show “demonstrates you don’t have to do” the Netflix tricks to please audiences.\n\n\tWatch the entire “Joe Rogan Experience” episode with Damon and Affleck here.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” continues to rack up the accolades.\n\n\tThe film’s song “Golden” was honored by the American Cinematheque Tribute to the Arts for best original song. Songwriters EJAE and Mark Sonnenblick accepted the award. EJAE got emotional as she told the audience what songwriting meant to her. She called the song “a beautiful accident.”\n\n\t“I thought I was gonna be a KPop Idol, but that didn’t happen. But in my mid-20s, when I had to give up my dream to be a singer, I met a couple of KPop producers.” She explained how they asked her if she wanted to write a track, and she did – about going through a breakup with her ex. “What’s so weird was, after I was done, it weirdly helped me deal with the breakup better than talking to my girlfriends. Every melody, every word, had intent and expressed my emotion to its purest form.” \n\t\n\n\tEJAE, who, along with Sonnenblick, won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice awards for best original song. EJAE talked about writing “Golden” and how she had her character, Rumi, in mind. “The character was a fictional character, but the emotion was raw and very real. I think we all know how it feels to really crave for hope when it feels very hopeless, and it truly did help bring light in a very dark time in my life, actually to the point where I cried while singing the demo.”\n\n\tSince the movie’s release and success, she has been flooded with messages from fans sharing what the songs mean to them. “The most received message I got was verbatim the sentence, ‘Your song ‘Golden’ saved me,’ and that is exactly the reason why you’re write.”\n\t\n\n\n\tProduction designer Jack Fisk, who has never won an Oscar, was honored with the Career Achievement Award. His wife, Sissy Spacek, presented him with the award.\n\n\tFisk, whose credits include “Badlands,” “Mulholland Drive,” “The Revenant” and “Marty Supreme,” recalled being best friends with David Lynch. He said, “In 1970, just out of art school, my best friend David Lynch and I drove to Los Angeles from Philadelphia in a rented U-Haul truck. He was going to the new American Film Institute, and I was looking for a job. I found one – on a non-union film for $100 a week. – It was holding traffic while the film company was shooting in a house about a quarter mile away. I was curious to be closer to the set, so I could see what’s going on. Then I found out that there was an art department on most films, and that became my goal – to get into the Art Department.” He also worked with Lynch on “The Straight Story.”\n\n\tFisk thanked Spacek and also shared how the two first met. “I met Terrence Malick, who was directing his first feature film, and he introduced me to a girl from Texas, Sissy Spacek, who would star in it. In 1972, Terry, Sissy, Martin Sheen, and a crew of 35 began filming ‘Badlands,’ and my life was changed forever.”\n\n\tHe said he had no career regrets after five decades in the industry. “As my friend David often said: “The Art Life – it’s a great Life!”\n\n\t“Sinners” casting director Francine Maisler took time to thank the organization for “recognizing the pivotal role that casting plays.” The Academy Awards will recognize casting for the first time at next month’s ceremony.\n\n\t”One Battle after Another” editor Andy Jurgensen called director Paul Thomas Anderson “an extraordinary mentor and collaborator.” Jurgensen added, “He’s taught me to go against convention, to be inventive, to let an audience know it’s okay to laugh, to embrace mistakes and imperfections, and maybe most of all, when to know not to cut.”\n\n\tThe following are the Tribute to the Crafts honorees:\n\n\tCasting: “Sinners” (Francine Maisler) – Warner Bros.

    "body": "\n\tJoachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” won best film at the 38th European Film Awards, which took place Saturday in Berlin. The film also won best director, screenwriter, actor, actress and original score. \n\n\tThe lead actress, Renate Reinsve, said the film’s awards campaign had become a “sentimental journey,” although lead actor Stellan Skarsgård downplayed his chances of winning the Oscar, despite his recent Golden Globes win. He said his chances were “slim.” \n\t\n\n\tThe best film nominees included narrative features “It Was Just an Accident,” “Sirāt,” “Sound of Falling” and “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” as well as documentaries “Afternoons of Solitude,” “Fiume O Morte!,” “Riefenstahl,” “Songs of Slow Burning Earth” and “With Hasan in Gaza,” and animated films “Arco,” “Dog of God,” “Little Amelie,” “Olivia and the Invisible Earthquake” and “Tales From the Magic Garden.”\n\n\n\tTrier won the award for best director for “Sentimental Value.” The other nominees were Yorgos Lanthimos for “Bugonia,” Oliver Laxe for “Sirāt,” Jafar Panahi for “It Was Just an Accident,” and Mascha Schilinski for “Sound of Falling.”\n\n\tTrier paid tribute to the power of cinema to unite people. “I think we’re at a core moment when we all have to take into account that the other is not our enemy, and that art can help us, at best, create empathy in the darkness,” he said. “Together with strangers, we can laugh and cry in the cinema. So this is also a plea to keep cinema alive, because it is a place where many of us grew up and learned about being human.”\n\t\n\n\tThe screenwriter award went to Eskil Vogt and Trier for “Sentimental Value.” The other contenders were Santiago Fillol and Oliver Laxe for “Sirāt,” Panahi for “It Was Just an Accident,” Schilinski and Louise Peter for “Sound of Falling,” and Paolo Sorrentino for “La Grazia.”\n\n\tThe statuette for best European actress was picked up by Reinsve for “Sentimental Value.” “Somebody give me a slap,” the Norwegian actress said, echoing a line from the film. She added, “This is a movie about a father and daughter relationship, and two sisters, and I want to say to my two sisters, Helen and Cecilia, that I am the older sister but you were the ones taking care of me when we were growing up, and thank you so much, I wouldn’t have been anywhere without you.” \n\n\tIn a post-awards press conference, Trier complimented Reinsve for her ability to “unhinge herself in front of the camera.” He added, “Even though she plans and does a deep character study and does this incredible preparation, you kind of get into sort of uncontrolness in front of the camera when something occurs in you which is quite magical and my job is to try to not get in the way and try to support and stimulate all those possibilities.”\n\n\tThe other best actress nominees were Leonie Benesch for “Late Shift,” Valeria Bruni Tedeschi for “Duse,” Léa Drucker for “Case 137,” and Vicky Krieps for “Love Me Tender.”\n\n\tThe best actor award went to Skarsgård for “Sentimental Value,” who was competing against Sergi López for “Sirāt,” Mads Mikkelsen for “The Last Viking,” Toni Servillo for “La Grazia,” and Idan Weiss for “Franz.”\n\n\tAsked to comment on Donald Trump’s desire to take over Greenland, Skarsgård said, “It’s pretty absurd, isn’t it? It’s a little man who has megalomania and tries to take over the world.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRenate Reinsve\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Getty\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe ceremony was opened by Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who spoke about the terrible bloodshed and oppression in his homeland, and the importance of speaking out.\n\n\t“When the truth is crushed in one place, freedom suffocates everywhere,” he said. “Then no one is safe anywhere in the world. Not in Iran. Not in Europe. Not in America. Not anywhere on this planet. And that is precisely why today our task as filmmakers and artists is harder than ever. If we are disappointed with politicians, we must at least refuse to remain silent. Because silence in a time of crime is not neutrality. Silence is a participation in darkness.”\n\t\n\n\tWith that said, he declared the 38th edition of the awards open.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Getty\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDuring the ceremony, the European Lifetime Achievement Award was received by Norwegian acting legend Liv Ullmann, who used her speech to make a controversial point about the Nobel Prize. On Thursday, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded the prize last year, gifted her peace prize medal to Donald Trump.\n\n\t“I’m Norwegian,” Ullmann said. “We gave a Nobel Prize to somebody who deserved it, and suddenly that Nobel Prize is going to someone else … It is so strange. And that is why I’m happy, specifically now, because I know that in Norway we have laws that say: If you misuse a Nobel Prize, we take it away from you. So, somebody in the United States may be very disappointed. He will lose it. He just got it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLiv Ullmann accepted the European Lifetime Achievement Award from Juliette Binoche\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Getty\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIgor Bezinović’s “Fiume O Morte!” won the best documentary prize. The other contenders were Albert Serra’s “Afternoons of Solitude,” Andres Veiel’s “Riefenstahl,” Olha Zhurba’s “Songs of Slow Burning Earth,” and Kamal Aljafari’s “With Hasan in Gaza.”\n\n\tThe animated feature film award was won by “Arco,” whose producers include Natalie Portman. The other nominees were Ugo Bienvenu’s “Arco,” Raitis Ābele and Lauris Ābele’s “Dog of God,” Maïlys Vallade and Liane-Cho Han’s “Little Amelie,” Irene Iborra Rizo’s “Olivia and the Invisible Earthquake,” and David Súkup, Patrik Pašš, Leon Vidmar and Jean-Claude Rozec’s “Tales From the Magic Garden.” \n\n\tThe Discovery Award, given to a director for their first full-length feature film, went to Laura Carreira for “On Falling.” The other nominees were Urška Djukić for “Little Trouble Girls,” Akinola Davies Jr. for “My Father’s Shadow,” Laura Carreira for “On Falling,” Murat Fıratoğlu for “One of Those Days When Hemme Dies,” Mathias Broe for “Sauna,” and Mara Tamkovich for “Under the Grey Sky.”\n\n\tGreta Scarano’s “Siblings” won the European Young Audience Award. The other nominees were Ugo Bienvenu’s “Arco,” and Nóra Lakos’ “I Accidentally Wrote a Book.”\n\n\t“Sirāt” dominated the craft categories, with the film’s Mauro Herce winning the cinematographer award, the production designer award going to the film’s Laia Ateca, the sound designer award picked up by “Sirāt’s” Yasmina Praderas, Amanda Villavieja and Laia Casanovas, Cristóbal Fernández winning best editor, and the casting director award going to Nadia Acimi, Luís Bértolo and María Rodrigo.\n\t\n\n\tIn other craft categories, Torsten Witte won the make-up and hair award for “Bugonia,” Sabrina Krämer won the costume design award for “Sound of Falling,” and Hania Rani won the award for a composer of an original score for “Sentimental Value.”\n\n\tAt the nominations stage, “Sentimental Value” had led the race with five nominations, while “Sirāt” followed with four, and “Sound of Falling” and “It Was Just an Accident” tied with three each. \n\n\tDuring the ceremony, Alice Rohrwacher picked up the European Achievement in World Cinema Award, and the Eurimages International Co-Production Award went to Maren Ade, Jonas Dornbach and Janine Jackowski of Berlin’s Komplizen Film, whose credits include “Sentimental Value.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRian Johnson took to X on Friday night to shut down a claim from former Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy that he was “spooked by the online negativity” and never returned to the “Star Wars” franchise after helming “The Last Jedi.”\n\n\tIn response to a post from IGN aggregating the news, he wrote, “Lol zero spooked, sorry.”\n\n\tAfter 2017’s “The Last Jedi,” Johnson was set to develop another “Star Wars” trilogy. However, the project never got off the ground, and he instead shifted his focus to starting the “Knives Out” franchise.\n\t\n\n\tIn her exit interview with Deadline, Kennedy shared her side of the story on why Johnson never returned. While she did acknowledge that “Knives Out” ate up “a huge amount of his time,” she also claimed he got “a little scared” by the fan backlash to “The Last Jedi” and decided to step away from the project.\n\n\t“I do believe he got spooked by the online negativity,” Kennedy said. “I think Rian made one of the best ‘Star Wars’ movies. He’s a brilliant filmmaker and he got spooked. This is the rough part. When people come into this space, I have every filmmaker and actors say to me, ‘What’s going to happen?’ They’re a little scared.”\n\n\tSitting down with Rolling Stone last summer, Johnson said the trilogy never made it deep into development and was “all very conceptual.” He explained that before any real progress could be made, “’Knives Out’ happened” and the “Star Wars” project fizzled out.\n\n\t“Nothing really happened with it,” Johnson said. “We had a great time working together, and they said, ‘Let’s keep doing it.’ I said, ‘Great!’ I would kick ideas around with Kathy. The short version is ‘Knives Out’ happened. I went off and made ‘Knives Out,’ and was off to the races, busy making murder mysteries. It’s the sort of thing if, down the line, there’s an opportunity to do it, or do something else in ‘Star Wars,’ I would be thrilled. But right now I’m just doing my own stuff, and pretty happy.”\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          The former NBA star was arrested and booked for driving under the influence after he was pulled over early Saturday morning. The incident is still under investigation.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He was also slapped with two traffic violations -- driving more than 41+ miles per hour over the limit and improper lane change/failure to maintain lane.\n      \n\n          At the time of publishing, it appears Odom is still in custody.\n      \n    \n          Odom has a documented history of drug and alcohol addiction. He was previously arrested for DUI in 2013.\n      \n    \n          In 2015, Odom nearly died of an overdose ... and his wife, Khloé Kardashian, rushed to his side to nurse him back to health. Their relationship ended not long after Odom relapsed in 2016.\n      \n    \n          Odom -- who played for four teams across a 14-year NBA career -- committed himself to sobriety in recent years ... and even offered help to others struggling with addiction, like Bam Margera, via several rehabilitation centers he owns.\n      \n    \n          We broke down all of Odom's struggles in our documentary \"TMZ Presents: Lamar Odom: Sex, Drugs, & Kardashians\" ... now available to stream on YouTube.\n      \n    \n          Story developing ...\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                The Kardashians\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

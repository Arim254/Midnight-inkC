    "body": "\n\tAnonymous Content has named Darren Walker as its next president and CEO.\n\n\tWalker, who previously served as the president of the Ford Foundation, will oversee all aspects of the production and management company. He’ll work from the Anonymous offices in both Los Angeles and New York.\n\n\t“When I was approached about joining Anonymous Content, it became clear that this is a company defined by creative excellence, independent ownership, and the freedom to take long-term bets on artists and stories,” said Walker in a statement. “That independence, especially in a moment of profound change, uniquely positions Anonymous Content to shape culture for decades to come. I’m ready to get to work and carry that legacy forward.”\n\t\n\n\tOn behalf of the Anonymous Content board, Michael Klein said, “Anonymous Content has always been powered by exceptional people and a belief in creative independence. We have deep confidence in the strength of this team and the company’s direction.”\n\n\n\tBoard member Anna Golin added: “We are thrilled to partner with Darren Walker as CEO and believe his leadership will position Anonymous Content to support its artists, expand its global ambitions, and build on my father’s creative legacy that has defined the company for more than twenty-five years.”\n\n\tAs Walker joins Anonymous, the company will receive a material investment from the social impact org Emerson Collective to support the company’s growth.\n\n\tAt Ford Foundation, Walker managed a $17 billion endowment and oversaw 500 employees across global operations. There, he executed a groundbreaking $1 billion social bond to help stabilize nonprofit institutions during the pandemic. He also played a role in resolving Detroit’s bankruptcy, and he established a documentary film fund called JustFilms, which partnered with the Sundance Institute Directors Lab and Tribeca Film Institute to support emerging filmmakers.\n\t\n\n\tWalker is also the president of the Board of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., where he oversees a $250 million annual budget. Before joining Ford, he served as vice president at the Rockefeller Foundation, and he is an accomplished attorney and capital markets professional. He currently serves on the boards of Ralph Lauren Corporation, the Obama Foundation, Bloomberg LP, Clooney Foundation for Justice and other leading brands and organizations.\n\n\tFounded in 1999 by Steve Golin, Anonymous Content is a production hub and management company representing more than 200 directors, writers, actors and comedians. It’s behind Oscar winners like “The Revenant” and “Spotlight” and is backing the upcoming TV series “American Classic,” “East of Eden” and “12 12 12.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCharli xcx is taking Sundance by storm ahead of the world premiere of “The Moment,” a concert mockumentary in which a fictionalized version of the pop star mounts an ambitious tour for her “Brat” album. The singer joined the Variety Studio presented by Audible hours before the film’s premiere and got honest about the film’s origins, which included turning down her label’s original pitch.\n\n\t“I was approached to make a more traditional tour film around the ‘Brat’ shows I was doing,” Charli explained. “It kind of felt like a way to elongate the life span of the album for my record label. I was just not really into that. I was only interested in flipping the form of something quite traditional.”\n\t\n\n\t“I was thinking of how I could put a spin on a long-form film about what I had experienced throughout the album cycle. This is where I landed, this satirical take not only on the music industry but myself. It felt like a way into talking about pop culture, fame and the loss of art the second you put something out. This felt like a rich ground to breed ideas.”\n\n\tJoining Charli in the film are Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Jamie Demetriou, Hailey Benton Gates, Rachel Sennott, Isaac Powell and Alexander Skarsgård. Some actors play fictionalized version of themselves (Sennott), while others play fictionalized versions of real people on Charli’s team (Berlant is her make-up artist, for instance). The film is directed by Aidan Zamiri, one of Charli’s close collaborators during the “Brat” era as the helmer of her “360” music video and more.\n\n\t“How cool and rewarding that ‘Brat’ was the most successful thing she’s ever done — something that she felt was such a true expression of her,” Zamiri told Variety in a pre-festival interview. “And then it’s interesting to see something like that become so global and so mass consumed that it became a commercial output for various brands.”\n\t\n\n\tElsewhere during her Sundance interview, Charli was asked by Variety’s Matt Donnelly about this week’s Oscar nominations. Charli is an outspoken cinephile, and her Letterboxd ratings often go viral across social media platforms like X and more.\n\n\t“I haven’t looked at the nominations. I don’t know! I don’t know anything,” Charli admitted, although she was surprised to find out that Ariana Grande was snubbed in the best supporting actress category for “Wicked: For Good.” Grande and Charli worked together on the “Sympathy Is a Knife” remix off Charli’s “Brat and It’s Completely Different but Also Still Brat.”\n\n\t“Oh, Ari! She is amazing,” Charli said. “She goes full force. I literally do not know who is nominated or not, but that’s a surprise to me that she wasn’t.”\n\n\t“The Moment” opens in theaters January 30, following its Sundance premiere.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRiz Ahmed goes full James Bond, sort of, in Prime Video’s upcoming comedy series “Bait,” which world premiered on the opening night of the 2026 Sundance Film Festival ahead of its streaming premiere in March. The Oscar nominee writes and stars in the series as a struggling London actor who is thrust into an existential spiral after his audition to become the next James Bond goes viral. Ahmed billed the series as more about life’s audition process than Bond himself.\n\t\n\n\t“I had been keeping notes of all the contradictions that make up my life,” Ahmed said during a Sundance interview with co-star Guz Kahn at the Variety Studio presented by Audible. “The difference between public and private self. What inspired it is sometimes life feels like one big audition. We’re all trying to prove ourselves online, chasing the validation of strangers and looking for approval. I wanted to make a show that explores that.”\n\n\tBut Bond is still top of mind for Ahmed. The 007 franchise is currently undergoing a reboot that’s backed by Amazon, the same studio behind “Bait.” The actor quipped: “Everyone has an audition for Bond. Daniel Craig’s was ‘Layer Cake’… This is my audition for Bond. I dare anyone to watch this show and think we shouldn’t play Bond.”\n\n\tAmazon’s first James Bond movie is being directed by “Blade Runner 2049” and “Dune” helmer Denis Villeneuve. It will be the first 007 tentpole following the end of the Daniel Craig era. The new Bond actor has not been announced, although the latest viral internet rumor has pegged “Euphoria” star and “Frankenstein” Oscar nominee Jacob Elordi for the role. \n\t\n\n\t“I don’t mind who plays James Bond as long as it is me,” Ahmed said about 007 casting rumors before playfully storming off the set when co-star Guz Kahn informed him: “I think Jacob Elordi will be James Bond over Riz Ahmed.”\n\n\t“To be honest, this show is not about Bond,” Ahmed added on a more serious note. “James Bond in our show is a symbol of what my character wants to be, the ultra alpha-male. He just wants to be someone else, which so many of us want to be. That’s the relatable part.”\n\n\t“Bait” streams March 25 on Prime Video.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Wicker Husband,” a short story by Ursula Wills-Jones, tells of an isolated, mocked woman who commissions a basket maker to weave her a husband. This wicker man becomes a devoted partner, sparking jealousy and malice in her narrow-minded neighbors, exploring themes of love, cruelty, and societal conformity.\n\n\tImagine a world where you could bail on Hinge and Raya, and instead go straight to a basket weaver when you’re looking for a mate. \n\t\n\n\tThis is close to the premise of “Wicker,” one of the starriest titles rolling out at this weekend’s Sundance Film Festival. Olivia Colman, Alexander Skarsgard, Elizabeth Debicki and Peter Dinklage lead an ensemble from married filmmakers Alex Huston Fischer and Eleanor Wilson.\n\n\n\tBased on the short story “The Wicker Husband” by Ursula Wills-Jones, Colman plays a lonely woman in a fantasy world reminiscent of feudal times. Desperate, she enlists a basket weaver (Dinklage) to make her a husband from straw. Thanks to some magic, and a killer practical costume from Weta Workshop, her wish comes true. Skarsgard plays her gorgeous woven companino, who fulfills and supports her beyond expectation. Things take a turn when jealous villagers begin to resent the resourceful Colman.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOlivia Colman reviews footage on the set of “Wicker.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It’s a very dressed-up movie about relationships and marriage. That’s really fun to kind of dig into all the desire and the envy, repression and misogyny,” Wilson told Variety. \n\n\tSkarsgard’s costume, which took about 50 people to make, will be a key reveal at the film’s Friday premiere in Park City, Utah. \n\t\n\n\t“We worked with WETA, the best people in the world. We engaged them really early, which was huge, because we knew that we needed to be able to show people what this was going to look like,” said Huston Fischer. “It’s important to get the audience on board with the idea. We need to know this creation looks like the actor, and that he would be stunning.” \n\n\tOscar winner Lol Crawley (“The Brutalist”) serves as cinematographer, and the film is on the ground at Sundance seeking distribution. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Debicki with her directors on the set of “Wicker.” \n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf there was a reason for veteran actor Edward James Olmos to resurrect his magnetic role in “Zoot Suit,” it’s to honor the man behind that landmark work centering the Mexican American experience. Olmos gets back into his swag-spilling persona as an otherworldly, Caló-speaking figure from the 1940s, now only in voice, to narrate “American Pachuco: The Legend of Luis Valdez.” This playful and comprehensive biographical documentary from director David Alvarado spends time with a deserving trailblazer whose name and accomplishments perhaps aren’t engraved in the American consciousness, but should be.It’s not an overestimation to say that Latino storytelling in the U.S. owes plenty to what Valdez did with his Teatro Campesino, a community theater company initially tied to the United Farm Workers movement and Cesar Chavez, and later on as a director on theater’s biggest stages, as well as in Hollywood with the landmark film “La Bamba.” Alvarado does the leg work for the viewer in defining the Chicano identity crucial to approaching Valdez’s body of work, as an interstitial worldview that took shape in the U.S. among people of Mexican descent. Finding themselves otherized and vulnerable in the only land they’d ever known, they defined themselves instead. They are not recent immigrants but American individuals, born and raised, who still treasure a connection to their ethnic background.A point that Valdez reiterates throughout his interview segments, as do some other voices in a parade of legends, is that Chicanos are part of America’s story, not separate from it. Born in Delano, California to a family of farm workers, Valdez grew up looking up to his older brother Frank, who had decided to pursue the American dream by way of education. But Valdez found his calling early on in the arts, realizing that live performance could impact audiences profoundly. Combined with his activism in defense of workers’ rights, these experiences shaped Valdez into a politically conscious artist.Others interviewees include Oscar-winning filmmaker Taylor Hackford, actor Lou Diamond Phillips and tireless labor leader Dolores Huerta, an icon in her own right — all sharing their thoughts on Valdez’s offbeat artistic propositions that confronted injustice and the white perception of Chicanos. His televised play, “Los Vendidos (The Sellouts),” which cleverly closes out the documentary, depicts a store where a person can buy different versions of Mexican automatons. There’s an Indigenous couple, a stereotypical sombrero man, but also a dressed-up, neatly groomed young man wearing glasses. The character depicts the idealized version of a Mexican American, one who aspires to be seen in the same light as a white man.\n\t\n\tAmid the chronological retelling of anecdotes and landmark events in Valdez’s storied career, Alvarado also illuminates the elderly master’s personal wounds. Valdez’s relationship to language occupies substantial real estate. That people assumed he couldn’t speak English based on his physical appearance motivated him to study literature. Yet, instead of subverting his true self, he deployed the spoken word to assert his lack of interest in fitting in. Olmos’ pachuco in “Zoot Suit” speaks in Chicano slang known as Caló, a mix of English and Spanish that employs its own collection of terms, like the word “rasquachi.” It describes something that may not be aesthetically pristine, but derives value through resourcefulness and resilience. Meanwhile, brotherhood emerges as the emotional driving force behind Valdez’s vision, and not only because his younger sibling Danny Valdez was a creative accomplice on multiple ventures, most notably “La Bamba.” Chief among his painful memories is a longstanding schism with Frank Valdez, who later sought to dismiss and forget his upbringing among Mexican frameworks in order to fully assimilate into the mainstream.Alvarado’s doc is standard in construction but lively in tone, reflecting his subject’s engagement with the sociopolitical challenges faced by Chicanos in the 20th century. Valdez didn’t create from a place of self-pity or victimhood, but with a bit of chip on his shoulder — eager to prove wrong those who underestimated him based on his background. One wonders then if Alvarado could have created satirical vignettes in the spirit of Valdez’s Chicano theater pieces to complement his storytelling or expand it, as director Travis Gutiérrez Senger did in his Chicano art group study “ASCO: Without Permission.”Valdez grasped that assimilation for Chicanos, as understood by the white majority, didn’t mean integrating with American society on their own terms, but to accept the erasure of their family’s origin. The U.S. demanded (and seems to be doing so again) that Mexican Americans choose a side: either be discriminated against for speaking Spanish or retaining any culturally specific traditions, or follow the status quo, with the promise that they’ll be accepted. As Alvarado explores repeatedly, Valdez rejected that pathway, instead honing his indigenous roots, and dedicating his life to exalting those who, like him, exist in the in-between.As much as the doc is explicitly celebratory, its existence is inherently a political statement, just like Valdez’s oeuvre. To spotlight a Mexican American pioneer who still stands proud in all the nuances of his identity feels necessarily defiant — especially in 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBC’s surprising return to a traditional pilot season might give some TV insiders a sense of nostalgia. But despite the desire to turn back the clock to a more fruitful time in network TV history, this is not an exact replica of pilot seasons past.\n\n\tThe Peacock network has so far ordered six pilots in 2026 – five dramas and one comedy – with sources indicating more orders are on the way. Even with the six already on the slate, that is the most pilots NBC has commissioned since the days before COVID and double what they ordered in 2025.\n\t\n\n\tBut actors, don’t book that pilot season apartment at the Burbank Oakwood just yet. First, there is no indication that NBC or any of the other broadcast networks are going to totally abandon the year-round development model they have adopted in favor of a normal pilot season. Until the streaming revolution, the Big Four broadcasters would order, staff, cast and shoot in excess of 50 pilots over the course of several months leading into upfronts in May. That’s not coming back entirely, but NBC is keen on working within the usual pilot window going forward.\n\n\n\tAccording to an NBC executive who spoke with Variety, the network wants to return more to the pilot season model. This is simply the first year in some time that outside factors – like COVID and the double strike of 2023 – have not impacted their ability to pick up pilots in the traditional timeframe.\n\n\t“The process worked so well for a long time for a reason, and we are really still very enthusiastic about it,” the NBC exec said.\n\n\tNearly all of the pilots NBC has ordered this winter have a police procedural bent. That even includes NBC’s lone comedy pilot, an untitled PI single-cam from “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” alums Dan Goor and Luke Del Tredici.\n\t\n\n\tNBC’s drama pilots include a reboot of “The Rockford Files;” “What the Dead Know,” about a death investigator that hails from Dick Wolf’s Wolf Entertainment; and “Puzzled,” about a star athlete who suffers a brain injury that makes him a wiz at solving crimes.\n\n\tEven the one (slight) outlier — “Protection,” from writers Josh Safran & Jenna Bush Hager – follows a law enforcement family targeted by a mysterious assassin.\n\n\tCase-of-the-week hours have been in high demand lately, as appetites for high-budget, heavily serialized fare has soured in the past couple of years. NBC’s current lineup is dominated by procedurals, including two “Law & Order” shows and the “One Chicago” dramas.\n\n\tOn the enduring power of procedurals, the NBC exec said, “You can dip in and watch something that has a really satisfying beginning, middle and end… and it’s very appealing. Or you could also watch five seasons in a row and never leave your couch and it’s very appealing.”\n\n\tNBC is also not alone in picking up pilots under traditional pre-upfronts calendar. ABC has a spinoff of “The Rookie” in the works, starring Jay Ellis, as well as a comedy from Rachel Bloom. CBS has the comedies “Eternally Yours” from the “Ghosts” team and “Regency” from Tara Hernandez. (Fox is still avoiding pilot season as we knew it).\n\n\tLike so many other aspects of the TV biz that were unfairly maligned in the streaming era, series pilots can be an invaluable tool for assessing the potential for a TV series. As everyone started chasing the Netflix model of “order first, figure out details later,” pilots largely fell by the wayside.\n\n\tBut now, even streamers are relying more on pilots. Hulu (and mostly John Landgraf’s FX team) have commissioned several pilots recently, while HBO Max is deep into the pilot game with the cop drama “American Blue” and the family drama “How To Survive Without Me” from Greg Berlanti, Bash Doran, and Robbie Rogers.\n\n\tThen there’s Netflix, the streamer that helped blow up the network playbook as we knew it. Netflix has mostly avoided pilots in its development process. But it recently picked up the “A Different World” sequel series after ordering a pilot for it in early 2025. In TV, perhaps it’s not such a different world after all.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLater today (well, tomorrow in Taiwan), “Free Solo” climber Alex Honnold will start his ascent on the 1,677-foot Taipei 101 skyscraper — without ropes — by carefully making his way up the tower’s slab base. But that’s the easy part. From there, he’ll get on the building’s middle section, designed like eight-story “bamboo boxes,” which will require steep climbing over these overhanging sections.\n\n\tOn the corner of those boxes are dragon figures, which Honnold will mount to get to the next level. It’s the most visually dramatic way to ascend, but he’ll be completely exposed, with the drop right below him. Then there’s the top part of Taipei 101, which has overhanging sections where Honnold’s legs will be dangling, and he has to use his upper body strength to scale up.\n\t\n\n\t“There’s this massive steel ring section, which we call the crown of Taipei 101, where he’s saying he might bat hang,” says James Smith, the head of adventure at Plimsoll Prods. Ltd. “You kind of put your knee into a hole, and then you can lean backwards and just rest and stretch your arms and things get the blood going.”\n\n\tNervous yet? If not, just wait until Honnold gets to the small, four-foot platform at the top of Taipei 101. “For a climber, you want to summit properly,” Smith says. “You want to be the highest human for miles around.”\n\n\tYikes. So much could go wrong — or hopefully, right — and obviously Netflix and Plimsoll execs are counting on the latter as “Skyscraper Live” kicks off at 8 p.m. ET on Friday night (that’s 9 a.m. Saturday in Taipei). “There is a massive focus on how do you guarantee that this is entertaining, but obviously the other element is safety,” says Plimsoll Prods. CEO Grant Mansfield. “I have chaired as many safety meetings as I have creative meetings.”\n\t\n\n\tThe January date for the climb was chosen because it’s dry season in Taiwan right now — although rain is still possible, and the forecast right now calls for a 30% chance of moisture the morning Honnold starts his climb.\n\n\t“Our main contingency planning is we can delay the broadcast by maybe an hour, maybe slightly longer,” Smith says. “If there’s been a light shower and the building’s drying off, the temperature here is pretty good,  there’s often a light breeze, so the building will dry relatively quickly. If it is deemed too wet, if there’s too much moisture on the building, we will probably delay to the next day, which would be a Saturday night transmission in the U.S. We could even delay another day if we needed to. Obviously Alex has to be 100% comfortable and happy in himself and in the conditions. And then our safety team likewise have to.”\n\n\tNetflix unscripted series VP Jeff Gaspin compares the live telecast window to “launching a space shuttle. We’ll be on site for a few days after if, for some reason he doesn’t go on that day,” he says. “But after that, it’s probably a bigger reschedule. There’s only certain times of year you can actually climb the tower because it’s rainy season between April and September.”\n\n\tViewers of 2019’s Oscar-winning Nat Geo doc “Free Solo” saw Honnold call off his landmark climb up El Capitan at first when he didn’t feel ready; similarly, Smith, Mansfield and Gaspin’s teams have reiterated to the athlete that there’s no shame in postponing if he’s not up to it.\n\n\t“There’s a two-tick system,” Mansfield says. “First and foremost, he has to feel good about it. And we’ve said to him repeatedly, if you’re not feeling it, despite the fact it’s a live broadcast, and there’s a bunch of TV people hanging around, you are under no pressure to do this climb. And the second tick is, if we get in a situation where he’s saying, ‘Yeah, I’m going for it,’ but there are things that bothering us, we have the right to say ‘no.’ He won’t be on that building unless we’re all comfortable. But there’s been a huge amount of planning for this. He said he’s the fittest he’s ever been. He’s really been training for this. We’re feeling good about it at this stage.”\n\n\tJoe DeMaio is the director behind “Skyscraper Live,” while Al Berman is showrunner and executive producer. Mansfield also credits risk management firm Secret Compass for being a big part of Plimsoll’s gameplan in mitigating any potential problems. “They are acknowledged experts in this field,” he says.\n\t\n\n\t“Every scenario has been mapped out, as you might expect,” Mansfield adds. “The main focus has been on keeping Alex safe. This is a building he knows very well. It’s a building which is very well suited for climbing. If at any point he decides that he’s too tired when he’s on the building, we can get him off there as well. But Alex really knows what he’s doing. He’s an extraordinary kind of athlete.”\n\n\tShould the unthinkable happen, yes, Netflix has planned for the worst-case scenario. “It’s obviously a conversation that everybody has,” Gaspin says. “You can imagine  what we’ll do. It’s nothing momentous. We’ll cut away. We have a 10-second delay. Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen. But we will cut away, and it’s as simple as that.”\n\n\tOf course, no one is expecting that. Given the complexities of some of his past free solo climbs, observers say they believe Taipei 101 will be a piece of cake for Honnold.\n\n\t“I think the main thing is, we trust Alex,” Mansfield says. “As he says in a number of his packages, he doesn’t have some kind of a death wish. He is an incredibly talented climber and an elite sports person. It would be an insult to say he takes mad risks. I don’t think he’s ever denied that he feels fear, but he’s found a way of processing it and managing it. The comfort I will take in that control room is that I know we’ve got the show very well-planned. And if he gets on that building to climb it, Alex will be completely confident he can do the climb. And if he’s completely confident, we’re completely confident.”\n\n\n\tThe live event is the culmination of something Honnold has been aiming to do for years; as a matter of fact, he announced a similar live televised climb on the Taipei 101 in 2013, until Nat Geo, uneasy about the safety of it, pulled the plug.\n\n\tBut in recent years, Plimsoll — a part of ITV Studios — has developed a tight relationship with Honnold, having worked with him on series such as “The Devil’s Climb” and “Arctic Ascent With Alex Honnold,” both for Disney+ and National Geographic. Plimsoll has also been big in the live space, with shows such as “Earth Live” and “Yellowstone Live,” both for Nat Geo. So when Honnold told Smith that he was still itching to follow through on his Taipei 101 dream, the Plimsoll folks got to work.\n\n\t“It was just the right idea at the right time,” Mansfield says. “The trick is if you’re not televising live sports events, you have to create something of significant scale. So a man climbing a very tall building without a rope is a pretty compelling proposition, right? When it’s probably the greatest climber who’s ever lived and a guy that we formed a really close relationship with the last four years, all the stars were aligned.”\n\t\n\n\tKnowing how fixated Honnold was on Taipei 101, Smith knew it had to be that skyscraper. Plus, the more he researched the tower, the more he knew it was perfect for an event like this. “It’s almost like it was built to be free solo climbed,’ he says. “It’s got fantastic architecture. It’s got lots of intricacy. Some skyscrapers are quite uniform and rather boring. But this has got twists and turns and little challenges almost at every level. As Alex says himself, it’s a world class climbing objective, and just deserves to be climbed.”\n\n\tSecuring Taipei 101 for the special wasn’t easy, however.  “Taipei 101 was always the number one choice, but started to look for other buildings around the world just in case this one didn’t come through. It took a while before I could get in the room and really try and convince them that this was a great idea,” Smith says.\n\n\tMeanwhile, at Netflix, even before Honnold and Plimsoll pitched the idea of “Skyscraper Live,” the streamer was looking for a live stunt event akin to classic TV moments like 1974’s attempt by Evel Knievel to ride his motorcycle across the Snake River Canyon.\n\n\t“All those things sound horrific and scary, but they’re experts, and that’s their livelihood,” Gaspin says. “We heard a bunch of different pitches, and then Alex’s came in. I was a fan of the ‘Free Solo’ movie, and the idea that he’s going to climb this building was both terrifying to me, but was thrilling. When we were choosing between some of the ideas that had come through, this one really stood out.”\n\n\tOf course, it had to be live — a field Netflix has tried to corner over the past few years with the WWE, Christmas Day NFL, boxing events, the Tom Brady roast and now, even, the reboot of “Star Search.” “If you don’t do it live, then it’s really just a clip on the news,” Gaspin says. “That’s not something that you need Netflix for. Part of why you want to go live is there’s some danger involved. It just makes it a more compelling viewing experience.”\n\n\tLive TV is such a priority for Netflix that the streamer hired ESPN’s Elle Duncan as its first sports anchor. Her first gig will be hosting “Skyscraper Live,” “trying to entertain people at the same time that we’re watching someone do something that could kill him,” she recently told Variety.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s also a logistical feat for the producers, who say Taipei 101 lends itself well to the production since the structure’s features — like those dragons — make for good camera angles. For the special’s four main camera operators, it’s also going to be a marathon: As they film Honnold, once he climbs past them, the camera crew will sprint to the elevator and get above him again to resume shooting. “They’re going to leapfrog each other,” Smith says. “That looks great on paper, our next challenge is to see whether it works in practice.” The producers are also relying on remote cameras, drones and a helicopter with a stabilized camera for the higher section.\n\n\t“I do love the process of live television,” Smith says. “I love the meticulous planning that all comes down to that one moment. It’s more akin to kind of putting on a play or a live concert. I love the fact that you have to spend months and months,  really getting into the detail, thinking through all these different scenarios. But then when you’re on air, it’s all about being in the moment and being reactive and making decisions very quickly.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, for Netflix viewers who can’t catch “Skyscraper Live,” the streamer has asked Plimsoll to quickly put together a shorter, cut-down version of the broadcast featuring highlights. And actually, that shorter post-game version of “Skyscraper Live” might come handy for Gaspin himself, as he admits that he’s a bit spooked by the stunt.\n\n\t“I have a little bit of vertigo, so just hearing the idea terrified me,” he says. “I will be truly honest: I’m not sure how much of it I can watch. Not that many things make me anxious, but that that truly does make me anxious!”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe wide, still, often unblinking stare of feature film newcomer Jessica Gabriel’s Ujah burns a hole right through “Lady,” galvanizing the camera and issuing the audience with a challenge to look away first. Few will dare. It’s a deliberately confrontational style of performance and portraiture, fixing all attention on a character that people would, and do, find easier to ignore in real life: a young, working-class Black woman living by and for herself on the mean streets of Lagos. As the only female taxi driver working her corner of Nigeria’s heaving metropolis, Lady is accustomed to underestimation by a callous patriarchy, and staunchly resists the gender normatives implied by her name. \n\t\n\n\tOlive Nwosu‘s lively, humid debut feature zeroes in on a determined individualist in a city of over 17 million. In many respects, the story told here is a familiar one. Still haunted by a traumatic childhood, Lady works long days and nights, dreaming of escape — specifically, to the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown, a name she takes very literally. As she stashes her savings in a hidey-hole in her insecure shanty dwelling, we practically count the minutes until the dream is stolen from her. \n\n\n\tIn some ways, Nwosu’s script subverts expectations. In others, it traces a classic, bittersweet arc of growth and self-realization even when plans are thrown off course. If her filmmaking style is relatively straightforward, it’s a rich, raw sense of place that gives this Sundance entry — premiering in world dramatic competition — vitality and danger.\n\n\tThe sprawl and all-hours noise of Lagos come through immediately in expansive, sun-sharpened establishing shots — sweeping over the city’s waterways, squatter settlements and concrete-linguine highways, forever congested with impatient vehicles. It’s in one of these jams that we first encounter Lady, behind the wheel of her trusty mini-SUV, its windshield emblazoned with the all-caps slogan “SING YOUR OWN SONG.” Once traffic starts moving, she holds it up a little longer to buy peanuts from one of the many jaywalking vendors weaving their way around the cars; in this ecosystem of strivers living by their wits, every transaction matters.\n\t\n\n\tShe is less sympathetic, however, to the community of gangsters and sex workers that keep the city humming after hours. When her estranged childhood friend Pinky (an excellent Amanda Oruh), now a sex worker herself, reappears in her life with a job offer, Lady is coldly unreceptive. But the job, ferrying Pinky and her fellow ladies of the night for their pimp Sugar (Tinuade Jemiseye), is ostensibly easy and well-paid: Finally, a ticket to Freetown feels within reach. In reuniting with Pinky, meanwhile, Lady is forced to confront chapters of her past she had previously closed without closure, and to accept a life less solitary than the one she has guardedly built for herself.\n\n\tThe film is most expressive and affecting when observing the slow-building rapport between Pinky and her nightly female fares — garrulous, primped-and-powdered women with whom our introverted, sexually ambiguous protagonist has little obvious kinship, though she comes to see herself as their protector in a realm ruled by exploitative men. Ensemble scenes of the women at rest, gossiping and needling each other, crackle with warmth and lived-in specificity both in writing and performance. Ujah’s tightly controlled portrayal loosens by fine, still-wary degrees, as if uncertainly trying on sisterhood for size. Nwosu’s script likewise avoids pat female-bonding sentiments, attentive to the experiences and worldviews that can still separate women in a man’s world.\n\n\tNwosu proves herself a keen-eyed observer in such scenes, as she does in sequences that ride the city’s teemingly chaotic, unpredictable street life, with Alana Mejia Gonzalez’s camera charging intrepidly through strobe-lit clubs and dust-kicking political protests alike. When it’s driven more by plot than atmosphere or community, however, “Lady” feels less confident. A late, high-stakes narrative swerve is hastily engineered and rather too easily abandoned, while flashbacks to Lady’s damaging childhood have a slightly tidy, script-workshopped air to them — as does the clunky insertion of present-day political context via regular radio reports by a radical DJ.\n\n\tBut these are minor first-film missteps in a character study that mostly thrives on rough edges and clashing textures — the hallmarks of a distinctive urban environment that has molded an equally spiky, unusual personality. As much as Lady yearns to distance herself from Lagos, she remains a daughter of its energy and friction, cutting her own path through its tumult.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEline van der Velden is the CEO and founder of AI company Particle6, which is behind AI “actor” Tilly Norwood. The creation became the center of a Hollywood hailstorm in late 2025 after Van der Velden suggested on a panel in Zurich that she was set to sign with an agency. The comments prompted an immediate backlash from across the industry and beyond as actors, unions and more waded into the AI debate to condemn Tilly Norwood and question what her existence meant for the profession. With concerns over AI in film and TV growing exponentially, Tilly Norwood quickly became the very recognizable, computer-generated face of the issue. Those behind Tilly have leaned into that role — on Jan. 22 when the Oscar nominations were announced, the official Tilly Norwood Instagram posted an image of Tilly at a podium holding an award (not an Oscar), with the caption, “Congratulations to all the Oscar nominees, even the ones who hate me! You’re all my heroes and I’m sorry for scaring you so much this year. Making movies is the most important job in the world!”\n\t\n\n\tIn this op-ed, which comes as more than 700 industry figures have gotten behind a new anti-AI campaign calling out tech companies, Van der Velden asserts that “AI is here to stay.” But instead of pushing back, she urges actors to embrace the technology and actually develop their own “AI actor.” She also argues that, given the demands put on performers’ bodies and mental health, alongside the “constant scrutiny” of appearances and aging, AI is actually “more ethical.”\n\n\n\tWhy All Actors Should Future-Proof Themselves and Develop an AI Actor\n\t\n\n\tWhen people talk about Tilly Norwood, they often forget one crucial detail: There’s a real person and a creative human vision behind her.\n\n\tActors have always brought characters to life, and that’s exactly what I did with Tilly. She didn’t simply appear because AI wanted her to — I wanted her to!\n\n\tShe came to be because of our team’s creativity, our choices and the months of hard work. I wanted to see what was possible with the technology, and what we were able to create awe-struck me. I felt obliged to bring it to the attention of the creative community. And attention she got.\n\n\tBut through all the noise, if we ignore her human origin, we miss the point of how AI fits into our future creative work, and that’s where most of the fear comes from.\n\n\tI want to start here because the debate around AI performers too often removes the artist from the art. AI isn’t a magical entity on its own; it’s a tool that responds to creativity. A calculator for the creative mind. I’ve been working in this field for 20 years, and with AI for over three, and I can say this: It’s all about craft, authorship and ownership. This is not about replacing real performances, it’s about giving actors new opportunities in this new medium of AI film and TV that’s fast arriving.\n\n\tAn AI actor is a storytelling vehicle that can be used to portray many different characters. An AI actor could be a digital twin of the performer, or a bolder, more expressive version of themselves. It might even be something entirely different — wilder, more imaginative, something that would never exist physically. Or a younger and more beautiful AI actor than oneself, as in the case of Tilly Norwood. Some actors might choose to use performance capture, bringing the AI actor to life with their own face and movement. Others might prefer guiding their actor like in animation, shaping it through intention, timing and emotional framing. I use a combination of both.\n\n\tThat’s the beauty of AI: It’s not one-size-fits-all, it’s a tool to extend the craft we’ve practiced for centuries.\n\n\tThis Is Still Acting. Just With New Tools\n\n\tWhen I created Tilly Norwood, I didn’t stop being an actor. I became an actor in a new way. Everything about Tilly, her humor, rhythm, style, comes from my own instincts and years of formal training. Tilly doesn’t exist without human guidance. She doesn’t move, speak or react without careful human direction. Crafting her personality is a creative process, just like animation, puppetry or performance capture. Think of Andy Serkis as Gollum — he was acting, even though Gollum was digital. The same goes for Zoe Saldaña in “Avatar.” She wasn’t less of an actor because her character was blue and rendered in pixels. In fact, she’s pioneered what she calls the “most empowering form of acting.”\n\t\n\n\tThe key opportunity now is that AI offers actors the opportunity to own their creations. Tilly, for me, is my Mickey Mouse, a storytelling vehicle that I created, that goes on to tell stories in ways we never imagined. For real actors, AI opens new doors, offering them a chance to bring their own digital characters to life through their AI actor, a true extension of their craft.\n\n\tOwnership is the opportunity\n\n\tThere’s a lot of noise around whether we should call AI characters “actors.” The ethical issue isn’t the terminology, it’s ownership and consent. AI actors should be something performers build and control, just like writers own their scripts, or musicians own their masters. This isn’t about replacing human performers, it’s about giving actors the agency to take control of their future.\n\n\tWhen actors create their AI actors, guided by their creative vision, they own their work. They become more than just performers; they’re intellectual property (IP) owners. In this new world, actors are empowered to take charge of their creative output in ways they’ve never been able to before. And yes, before anyone panics, agents can still take their cut, and unions can still protect their rights.\n\n\tThat’s why I created an AI talent studio where actors and creators can build, license and protect their own AI actors.\n\n\tA More Ethical Way to Perform\n\n\tHere’s a truth that’s often uncomfortable to say: traditional acting demands that performers put their bodies and sometimes their mental health on the line. Dangerous stunts, intimate scenes, extreme physical transformations and endless hours of hair, makeup and retouching are all part of the deal, not to mention the constant scrutiny if a performer’s face dares to age in the “wrong” way. And yet still, some find it more acceptable for a person to change their appearance through surgery rather than digitally.\n\n\tAn AI actor presents a more ethical alternative. With AI, performers can explore roles without the need for dangerous stunts, extreme beauty standards or invasive procedures. The focus can shift to what really matters: timing, emotional intelligence, intention, and expression. It’s a deeply humane approach and focuses on the real craft of storytelling.\n\n\tAn AI actor allows performers to continue working without sacrificing their personal lives or physical limitations. Imagine being an actor with a family or other responsibilities and still being able to work from home. Hybrid AI productions can also take place in rehearsal rooms and on minimalist sets. AI actors let performers do what they love, on their own terms.\n\t\n\n\tThe Puppeteer Has Always Been a Performer\n\n\tWe’ve seen this before: A puppet is not alive, yet no one doubts the artistry of the puppeteer. The same is true for animated characters, masks, costumes and motion-captured creatures.\n\n\tAn AI actor is simply a more responsive puppet — one that can learn, adapt to its creator and perform across mediums. The soul of the performance still belongs to the human behind it. Just like photography, film or digital editing, AI production requires human taste, judgment and experience.\n\n\tOur AI Policy and Copyright Considerations\n\n\tAt Particle6, we take copyright and ethical AI development very seriously. After three years of AI experience, we’ve developed a strict AI policy to ensure our work is done responsibly. Our team is not permitted to reference any copyrighted material or upload any non-licensed content to open systems. When we make digital twins, it is always with consent and fair compensation. Our goal is clear: We want to innovate with AI while respecting intellectual property.\n\n\tThe creation of Tilly Norwood was driven by this policy. I specifically wanted to avoid infringing on anyone’s likeness or copyright. Our aim was to build something entirely original, fresh and new — a character born from imagination, not a replication of someone’s likeness. I wanted her to resonate with people around the world, and many people know someone who looks similar to her. Tilly was created by Particle6 using only publicly available tools and without referencing or training on the work of any specific performer. We didn’t train any systems to create Tilly.\n\n\tThe irony is that by wanting to create an entirely original character, I seem to have attracted more outrage than much of the deepfake work online that reproduces real people.\n\n\tReskilling and Retooling for the Future\n\n\tAs AI technology evolves, we believe that it’s essential to ensure that the workforce is equipped to thrive in this new landscape. It’s easy to resist change, just as the Luddites did during the Industrial Revolution, fearing that new technology would take away jobs. But history shows that fighting the wave of progress often leads to more harm than good. Instead of protesting the new industrial revolution that’s just around the corner, we’re focusing on reskilling and retooling our industry. We’re proud to help professionals, from costume designers and DOPs to editors and set designers, transition into the AI-driven world of film and television. And these professionals are testing their new skills out on Tilly. Behind the scenes, talented individuals are creating new costumes, set design, hair, make-up, and directing funny lines for her. This is about empowering creative talent to thrive in a changing industry, not replacing jobs. Everyone has a place in this new world, and we’re excited to help people tap into the vast potential that AI offers.\n\t\n\n\tDon’t Lock Actors Out of the Future\n\n\tAI is here to stay. The question is not whether AI actors will replace actors, it’s whether actors will own their place in this new era — or be left behind. AI actors, created and owned by performers, are not the enemy of acting. They are its next evolution.\n",

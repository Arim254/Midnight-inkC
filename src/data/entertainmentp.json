    "body": "\n\tGuy Moon, a veteran Nickelodeon composer who worked on network classics like “The Fairly OddParents” and “Danny Phantom,” died on Thursday in a traffic collision. He was 63.\n\n\tMoon’s family announced his death in a Facebook post on Friday.\n\n\t“We are overcome with grief to announce the passing of our beloved patriarch, Guy Moon. He was killed on Thursday morning in a traffic collision,” read the post. “We feel singularly blessed to have been able to call him dad and husband. As we stand together at the base of what seems to be an insurmountable grief, we are emboldened to grieve him with honor and courage with the tools that he equipped us with in his beautiful life. He has left an unmistakable legacy, and will be profoundly missed by us, his family, and countless others whose lives he impacted.”\n\t\n\n\tOutside of “The Fairly OddParents” and “Danny Phantom,” Moon also worked on ”Chalk Zone,” “Tak & the Power of Juju,” “Back at the Barnyard,” “Big Time Rush” and “T.U.F.F Puppy” for Nickelodeon. His work on “The Fairly OddParents” earned him Emmy nominations in 2002, 2003 and 2004 for outstanding music and lyrics.\n\n\n\tButch Hartman, the mastermind behind “The Fairly OddParents” and “Danny Phantom,” mourned Moon on his Instagram Story.\n\n\t“I have no words yet because there are none adequate enough,” he wrote. “I will be making a statement soon. Guy was my friend. My brother. My family. My heart is broken.\n\n\tMoon’s other notable credits include shows like “The Addams Family” cartoon, “Johnny Test” and “Cow and Chicken,” as well as films like “The Brady Bunch Movie” and its 1996 sequel.\n\t\n\n\tA celebration of Moon’s life is planned to take place in Los Angeles on Feb. 7. Another celebration will take place in his home state of Wisconsin at a future date.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPamela Anderson spoke to Variety at the WWD Style Awards at the Regent Santa Monica on Friday, previewing her role in Michael Cera’s “Love is Not the Answer.” While a release date and details have not yet been revealed, the May announcement promised a “precise yet unpredictable, absurdist comedy that moves between hilarity and heartbreak as it explores modern loneliness and the search for connection.”\n\n\t“It was a wild experience, and I just finished it right before the holidays,” Anderson said. “I just went back to blonde [hair] yesterday, so I felt like I finally let the character go. So it was, well … you have to see. I got to play a really interesting woman, and that was exciting.”\n\t\n\n\tAnderson has been on a hot streak since her critically-lauded “The Last Showgirl,” which garnered her a Golden Globe nomination in 2025. In August, she appeared alongside Liam Neeson in “The Naked Gun,” which was honored as Best Comedy at the Critics Choice Awards. With another big laughfest on the way, Anderson shared her personal favorite comedy film, as well as her style inspirations.\n\n\t“I love ‘The Jerk.’ That’s my favorite old comedy,” she said. “But I love old movies … I feel like even this hair and [my outfit], I was kind of inspired by Jeanne Moreau. I like cinematic kind of looks and old movies, and I’m always inspired by them.”\n\n\tSo far, 2026 is shaping up to be another big season for Anderson. She shot five movies last year. Among those projects is the Kornél Mundruczó drama “Place to Be,” which also stars Ellen Burstyn and Taika Waititi, and “Rosebush Pruning” from director Karim Aïnouz, featuring Elle Fanning, Riley Keough and Callum Turner.\n\t\n\n\tAnderson attended the Style Awards ceremony as the Beauty Icon winner. Other honorees at the event included Hailey Bieber (Style Trailblazer), Kourtney Kardashian Barker (Wellness Entrepreneur of the Year) and Omega (Red Carpet Watch of the Year).\n\n\tGeorge Clooney appeared at the event to accept a posthumous Red Carpet Visionary honor for Giorgio Armani, who died at 91 in September.\n\n\t“First of all, you’ve got to see Giorgio. By the way, [he] is the most handsome designer I’ve ever seen in my life. He always made us look like idiots when we’d sit next to him. It’s very odd to be here tonight accepting something for Giorgio, because he should have been here,” Clooney began, adding that Richard Gere should be credited with putting Armani on the map. \n\n\t“But since he couldn’t show up, and you know, fuck him,” he cracked, adding with a smile, “That’s the only thing that will come out of this [speech].”\n\n\tDemi Moore was recognized as the Fashion Icon of the Year, for which she gave credit to her stylist, Brad Goreski.\n\n\t“I trust you. I know you always have my best interest at heart,” Moore said. “You push me when I need to be pushed, and you also listen to me. You listen to what I need and what will make me feel safe. “\n\n\tShe also signaled what was most important to her in the new year. “My 2026 [goal] is to continue with the acceptance of ourselves as we are. We don’t need to be different. The most beautiful part of who we are is just being our unique selves, our imperfect selves,” Moore said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTo the extent that “The Night Manager” has survived in the cultural memory since the limited series — adapted from the John Le Carré novel on the same time — aired a full decade ago, it was as a showcase for pretty people in pretty places. (It made sense that director Susanne Bier would go on to helm “The Perfect Couple,” a murder mystery starring Nicole Kidman and set at a destination wedding in Nantucket.) For a while, the show seemed like it could kick off a Le Carré revival; Korean auteur Park Chan-Wook delivered an underrated take on “The Little Drummer Girl” with rising star Florence Pugh the following year. But the trend never took off, and “The Night Manager” lived on largely as images of Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Elizabeth Debicki swanning around Switzerland and Mallorca. Much like an actual vacation, its transportive power was directly linked to its finite end.\n\t\n\n\tTen years later, however, “The Night Manager” is back, as is Hiddleston’s soldier-turned-hospitality-professional-turned-spy Jonathan Pine. Screenwriter David Farr has extended Le Carré’s story past its original conclusion, resulting in an odd hybrid: characters like Pine and his handler Angela Burr (Olivia Colman) remain the same, while the director (Georgia Banks-Davies), the BBC’s American production partner (Amazon Prime Video, taking over from AMC) and the setting are all new. In shifting the action to Colombia, “The Night Manager” can at least continue to deliver on stunning vistas and escapist intrigue. But after watching all six episodes of Season 2, I still wasn’t convinced this property — no hotel pun intended — needed revisiting, let alone expansion. At least a very dark cliffhanger ending sets up an already announced Season 3, even if it somewhat contradicts the easy-viewing appeal. \n\t\n\n\tSet nine years after the events of Season 1, Jonathan no longer works in hotels — the profession that first brought him into contact with arms dealer Richard Roper (Laurie), whose body he and Angela identify in an opening flashback, and served as a compelling, specific hook. (Thanks to Jonathan, Roper owed hundreds of millions of dollars to some powerful creditors, who kept him captive for years before dumping his corpse in Syria.) Instead, Jonathan helps run a remote surveillance squad within the Foreign Office known as the Night Owls, spying on targets (often in hotel rooms!) remotely and at all hours of the day. But despite the new job and a new, assumed name, Jonathan is still haunted by his experience with Roper, an amoral hedonist whose luxurious lifestyle was bankrolled by bloodshed. When an old associate of Roper’s resurfaces, Jonathan throws himself back into the fray in pursuit of a man billing himself as Roper’s spiritual successor: Colombian arms magnate Teddy Dos Santos (Diego Calva). \n\n\tColombia is a country beautiful enough to deliver the stunning scenery one expects of “The Night Manager,” from lush jungles to historic cities, and stable enough to host a major TV production. But the memory of decades-long civil unrest, largely ended by a peace agreement signed in 2016, is still fresh enough to provide a real-life context for Teddy’s machinations. Calva is a captivating screen presence whose raffish charisma is a solid substitute for Laurie’s plummy, posh playboy — though the one-time “Narcos: Mexico” star deserves more roles beyond the Central American underworld, like his naive dreamer in Damien Chazelle’s 2022 film “Babylon.” “The Night Manager” is nonetheless Jonathan’s show, and while Season 2 has its moments, it’s ultimately unable to cultivate him into a George Smiley-like figure. Smiley, a more famous Le Carré creation, could tie together multiple otherwise unrelated stories over multiple books (and subsequent adaptations). Jonathan doesn’t hold up to the same sustained scrutiny. The same chameleonic blandness that makes him so suited to espionage makes for an inherently unmemorable hero.\n\n\tThe shamelessly Bond-inspired opening credits to “The Night Manager” — soaring strings over graphics of guns firing and rosaries shattering — no longer align with Jonathan’s tortured, traumatized mental state. An entanglement with Miami-based shipping broker Roxana Bolaños (Camila Morrone) recalls that iconic character’s revolving door of paramours, and Jonathan’s new boss Mayra (Indira Varma) could give Judi Dench’s M a run for her money in hard-nosed severity. But Hiddleston’s aged-up, haunted Jonathan is more dour than debonair, even if he retains the actor’s easy elegance. I can’t say I spent much time in the intervening years since Season 1 wondering what became of the reluctant spook, nor did I find him an especially enjoyable hang after our reunion. New colleagues Waleed (Anil Desai), Basil (Paul Chahidi) and Sally (Hayley Squires) never rise above the level of accessories to Jonathan’s obsessive pursuit of closure, let alone to that of a potential co-protagonist.\n\t\n\n\t“The Night Manager” eventually establishes a more direct link between the two seasons, a blatant bit of revisionism that still facilitates a more dynamic back half of this new chapter. By then, however, it’s a little late. The viewer has long since started to wonder why Farr didn’t set his sights on another Le Carré yarn, or simply started fresh in Colombia without the need for British interlopers. Season 1 of “The Night Manager” was a success, but not such a world-conquering hit that a follow-up is almost economically mandatory, as with “Big Little Lies.” Season 2 is not without enjoyable intrigue, yet never proves worth the risk of opening a closed (literal) book.\n\n\tThe first three episodes of “The Night Manager” Season 2 will be available to stream on Amazon Prime Video on Jan. 11, with remaining episodes streaming weekly on Sundays.\n",

On one hand, there’s a lot of filler, and I would have rather watched an oil rig float by slowly than suffer through Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) acting like a brat during her first hours at college. But then, in the last 10 minutes, two explosive things happen: One that has been telegraphed all season, and one that took me by surprise. Read on to slog through the dumb stuff until that jaw-dropping ending. Onward!\n\t\n\n\nT.L. (Sam Elliott) delivering another shot to “The View”: “I don’t think they’re trying to be funny, but they are.”\nTommy (Billy Bob Thornton) just throws lit cigarettes into his pool? Gross!\nWow, I’m shocked that Rebecca (Kayla Wallace) is going back to Charlie (Guy Burnet) to smooth things over. Progress!\nOoh, Charlie is delivering that crackling energy back. I like the chemistry here!\n“Bad jewelry and worse haircut”? Charlie has the best mullet in the oil game!\nWhy is there so much haircut talk in this episode? Keep that long hair, guys!\nI know Gallino (Andy Garcia) has to shoot people on occasion, but his home life is so chill. Other couples in this show could learn from his love story with Bella (Stefania Spampinato)!\nWould love to see Ainsley try to get along with Paigyn (Bobbi Salvör Menuez).\n“Like the godless religion.” Oof, Ainsley…\nOh no, they’re so woke! Brace yourself, the audience of “Landman”!\nA pronoun convo! Boy, oh, boy….\nShout out to Ainsley for even misinterpreting the question, “Do you eat meat?”\nGreta (Miriam Silverman) is back! And Ainsley is immediately mispronouncing her name…\nTCU is going to regret letting Ainsley and Angela (Ali Larter) set foot on campus.\nI’m glad the solution is to not force Ainsley grow up at all! Sure, just get her a swanky penthouse so she doesn’t have to get to know anyone or challenge herself to expand her horizon.\nGreta, you should have had security drag Angela out. You’re in power here!\nOK, Angela, you won.

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron is almost singlehandedly keeping cinemas afloat in the new year as “Avatar: Fire and Ash” leads the box office for the fourth consecutive weekend. His third Na’vi adventure generated $21.3 million from 3,700 theaters between Friday and Sunday, bringing its total to $342.6 million domestically and $1.23 billion globally.\n\n\tThose ticket sales were twice as much as the next biggest films, including newcomer “Primate” and holiday holdover “The Housemaid.” Those two films are neck-in-neck for second place, with each estimated to generate $11 million over the weekend. (Final tallies will be reported on Monday.)\n\t\n\n\t“Primate” appears to have the slight edge over the competition with $11.3 million from 2,964 venues in its opening weekend. “Primate” also earned $2.1 million internationally for a global start of $13.4 million. Moviegoers appear mixed on the $21 million-budgeted film, which received a “B-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls. “Primate” follows a friend group whose tropical vacation goes awry when a nearby chimpanzee becomes violent. Paramount is distributing the film, the first under the studio’s production deal with 18Hz, run by former DC Films chief Walter Hamada.\n\n\n\tLionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid,” which looks to take the No. 3 spot with $11.2 million, has continued to draw impressive crowds. After four weekends of release, the R-rated film has earned $94.15 million in North America and $192 million worldwide. It’s an especially great result considering “The Housemaid” cost just $35 million to make.\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” dropped to fourth place with $10.1 million in its seventh weekend of release. The animated sequel has been a box office powerhouse with $378.8 million domestically and $1.65 billion to date, ranking as Walt Disney Animation’s highest-grossing movie of all time.\n\t\n\n\tAnother new release, Lionsgate’s disaster sequel “Greenland 2: Migration” with Gerard Butler, rounded out the top five with $8.5 million from 2,710 locations. The original film, 2020’s “Greenland,” debuted on demand in the U.S. because of COVID, but became a modest hit overseas with $52 million. The sequel was produced by STX for $90 million; Lionsgate acquired the domestic rights for $10 million. “Greenland 2,” which earned a tepid “B-” grade on CinemaScore, follows a family who search to find a new home after a comet strike that decimated most of the planet.\n\n\t“This is a flat start,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. However, he adds that “Gerard Butler is a well-liked action star around the world. International numbers and ancillary rental and streaming business should be good.”\n\n\tSixth place went to A24’s “Marty Supreme” with $7.3 million from 2,512 theaters, declining around 38% from the prior weekend. Those ticket sales take the Timothee Chalamet-led ping pong dramedy past $70 million in North America and $84 million globally, ranking as one of A24’s biggest movies of all time. “Marty Supreme” cost $70 million to produce, the most expensive film to date for A24, so it’ll need to stick around through the winter to rationalize its budget. (Theaters get to keep roughly half of revenues.) However, awards attention — Chalamet just won the Critics Choice for best actor, is nominated tonight for a Golden Globe and will likely find himself in the Oscar race — helps justify the studio’s spend in ways beyond the balance sheet.\n\n\tElsewhere, Searchlight’s “Is This Thing On?” brought in $2.3 million while expanding to 1,475 theaters. The film, directed by Bradley Cooper and starring Will Arnett as a divorcee who turns to stand-up comedy, has grossed $3.4 million to date.\n\n\tAnother awards hopeful, Neon’s dark comedy “No Other Choice,” has generated $1.3 million from just 147 theaters over the weekend. The film, from acclaimed South Korean director Park Chan-wook, has amassed an impressive $3.4 million while in limited release.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Angel Studios debuted “I Was a Stranger,” which earned $1.2 million from 1,400 theaters to land at No. 15 on domestic charts. The PG-13 film, which carries a $6 million budget, takes place after tragedy strikes a Syrian family in Aleppo.\n\t\n\n\tSo far, the box office is pacing slightly ahead of 2025. Although January is known to be slower for theaters, this month could be busier than expected with blockbuster hopefuls including Sony’s apocalyptic thriller “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” the anime “All You Need Is Kill,”  Amazon MGM’s sci-fi adventure “Mercy” with Chris Pratt, Sam Raimi’s survival horror film “Send Help” and the Jason Statham-led “Shelter.”\n\n\t“We’re hoping for a stronger start to the year than in 2025 and 2024,” says Gross. “For the [January] box office to approach pre-pandemic levels, ‘All You Need Is Kill, ‘Mercy,’ ‘Send Help’ and ‘Shelter’ are going to have to perform big.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe long strange trip that is the Grateful Dead and its primary offshoot, Dead & Company, has truly faded into grey with the passing of Bob Weir. \n\n\tAlthough Jerry Garcia cast the longest shadow across the legend of the Dead with his dark, complexly melodic songs and his hazy, frayed vocals, Weir’s shadow was more translucent, melodically lighter and rhythmically astute. And his handsome baritone vocals cut a deeper groove across the expanse that was the Dead’s storytelling prowess at its most regal — especially when “Bobby” lifted that voice into a surprising, broken angel’s falsetto. As far as his rhythm guitar work went, Weir’s McCoy Tyner-influenced tonality allowed him to color jazzily outside the lines while maintaining an unusual inner pulse. If Jerry was the folky psychedelic sage, Weir was the soulful country squire, qualities that carried through the younger Dead-man’s solo albums and band projects beyond the Dead such as Kingfish, Bobby and the Midnites and RatDog.\n\t\n\n\tRather than pick through the dense, lush fields of Grateful Dead and solo band bootleg live concert tapes that could fill a football stadium, Variety’s top musical moments of Weir’s focus on a dreamy collection of tracks from the studio recordings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGrateful Dead, “Viola Lee Blues” (1967)Starting with the Dead’s self-titled debut album, Weir and Garcia’s wiry blues guitar runs and boyish vocals meshed together like a Mobius strip across 10-plus minutes of blissful, twanging psychedelia, accompanied by the rumble of Pigpen’s grand organ at full blast. Their intermingling of voices and strings was a joy to behold, whether it was in the harmonies of “Ripple” with Phil Lesh joining in or the latter-day likes of “Throwing Stones.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tGrateful Dead, “Born Cross Eyed” (1968)On “Anthem of the Sun,” the Dead’s second studio album, Weir had already begun to stretch himself as a singer and as a songwriter. Authoring this noisy, jazzy track all by his lonesome, Weir vocally zig-zagged his way across a cluttered arrangement flush with oddball time changes.\n\n\n\n\n\tGrateful Dead, “Truckin’” (1970)Sure, this is the Dead’s most overplayed anthem, its most fun crowd singalong, and its most mainstream moment alongside “Touch of Grey.” But, think back to the first time you heard this lazy, grooving tune co-penned by Garcia, Lesh, Weir and lyricist Robert Hunter: it’s Weir’s chill but smoldering vocals that make “Truckin’” roll along nicely, and gain in intensity only when he shakily intones the phrase “livin’ on reds, vitamin C and cocaine.”\n\n\n\n\n\tBob Weir, “Cassidy” (1972)So, “Ace” may have been Bob Weir’s debut solo album, but it’s the rest of the Dead that back him throughout, and ultimately made the album’s best songs — such as “Black-Throated Wind,” “Mexicali Blues” and “Cassidy” (all three written with John Perry Barlow, Weir’s frequent co-writer) — into Dead concert favorites. Named in part for Neal Cassady, the Beat Generation icon whose spirit all but defines the Dead, Weir’s winding, jangly, near-pop tune is a marvel of two-part harmony, whether sung with Donna Jean Godchaux on “Ace” or with Brent Mydland on several live Dead albums.\n\n\n\n\n\tGrateful Dead, “Weather Report Suite” (1973)The three pieces of Weir’s suite – Prelude, Part 1 and Part 2 (“Let it Grow”) – are, far from feeling broken apart, joined in harmony and gentility across the fluid waves of the Dead’s 1973 “Wake of the Flood” album. Contemplating passing seasons and dead flowers, Weir’s deep, lava lamp-like flow of a vocal is as sadly ruminative as Barlow’s lyrics. And yet, Weir’s musical co-write with folky Eric Andersen, with the backing of (then) new modal jazz-influenced Dead keyboardist Keith Godchaux, is bright and open.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tKingfish, “Big Iron” (1976)Showing off his love of showy country, Weir puts all of his heart and playful gusto into Marty Robbins’ classic “Big Iron.”.Though Robby Hoddinott was responsible for the track’s prickly guitar lead, the backing of bassist-pal Dave Torbert from New Riders of the Purple Sage elevates Weir and the song’s rhythmic bottom to something uplifting and downright prancy.\n\n\n\n\n\tGrateful Dead, “Estimated Prophet” (1977)The mesmerizing “Terrapin Station” album was only made more complex by Weir’s hill-jumping, quaveringly soft baritone. A clear standout is the fuzzy, subtle, suite-like shifts in melody and tone of “Estimated Prophet,” with a set of lyrics dedicated to an unwise, but still charismatic, spiritual guru of unnamed origin. One of Weir’s most enigmatic tracks, and easily one of his finest.\n\n\n\n\n\tGrateful Dead, “I Need a Miracle” (1978)From the Dead’s swaggering “Shakedown Street” album comes Weir at his boogie-down slickest and most refined as a confident singer. With almost shocking clarity, Weir as a vocalist struts in time with guest harmonica player Matthew Kelly and turns the “Street” into a block party.\n\n\n\n\n\tGrateful Dead, “Feel Like a Stranger” (1980)While Jerry laid down his globby, blobby guitar squiggles that had become his latter-day Dead signature, Weir – the singer – warbled freely, woozily and bluesily through a stuttering jazzy groove, until he and Jerry tied together their fates in some genuinely familial vocal harmonizing and a brisk, frenetic guitar solo at song’s end.\n\n\n\n\n\tBob Weir, “Gonesville” (2016)After years of live records with a cast of jazz elites (Rob Wasserman, Don Was) and the beginnings of Dead & Company’s healthy run, Weir popped up with a surprisingly gritty solo album, “Blue Mountain.” Its best, most rousing song, “Gonesville,” featured Beat Gen-worthy lyrics about getting lost and loving it, and a bluesy, stomping, swampy sound co-written by Josh Kauffman, Josh Ritter and Weir himself. Weir’s “hey hey hey” chorus alone is worth the price of admission.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” remained the No. 1 movie globally as fellow holiday holdover “The Housemaid” nears a notable box office milestone.\n\n\tJames Cameron’s third mega-budget sci-fi epic has added $65.6 million internationally and $86 million globally in its fourth weekend of release, bringing its overseas tally to $888 million and global total to $1.23 billion. Although a box office juggernaut, “Fire and Ash” is trailing the first two films, 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “The Way of Water,” at this point in its run. Of course, this film’s predecessors are two of the biggest movies of all time, with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.\n\t\n\n\tWhether “Fire and Ash” reaches the $2 billion benchmark, this Pandora-set adventure proves yet again that Cameron isn’t to be doubted in terms of box office appeal. Disney’s 20th Century’s “Avatar 3” recently surpassed another Disney tentpole, “Lilo & Stitch” ($1.03 billion), to stand as the second-highest-grossing Hollywood release of 2025. Another Disney tentpole, “Zootopia 2,” remains the biggest film that debuted last year with $1.65 billion and counting.\n\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” has remained a box office force since Thanksgiving, with $30.8 million overseas and $40.9 million worldwide in its seventh weekend in theaters. So far, the animated sequel has grossed a staggering $1.27 billion internationally and $1.65 billion globally, strengthening its position as Walt Disney Animation’s biggest film in history.\n\n\tIn other box office milestones, Lionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid” is about to surpass $200 million globally. The film has generated $25.5 million from 66 overseas territories, including a No. 1 bow in the United Kingdom with $23.7 million. So far, the R-rated film, adapted from Freida McFadden’s popular book and starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has become a breakout hit with $98.3 million internationally and $192.5 million worldwide after four weekends of release. Those ticket sales are especially promising considering “The Housemaid,” directed by Paul Feig, cost just $35 million to produce.\n\t\n\n\tAnother Christmastime release, Sony’s adventure comedy “Anaconda,” crossed the $100 million mark over the weekend. The movie, starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd as friends who attempt to remake the 1997 cult favorite “Anaconda,” brought in $7.7 million from 63 overseas markets and $12.7 million globally in its third weekend. The film has amassed $55.8 million internationally and $110.1 million worldwide to date against a $45 million budget.\n\n\tElsewhere at the international box office, Chloe Zhao’s drama “Hamnet” launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland with $4.2 million. The film, which is being released by Focus Features in the U.S. and Universal internationally, will continue to expand across the globe in January. So far, “Hamnet,” starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal in a tragedy that follows the death of William Shakespeare’s son, has grossed $17.1 million worldwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Running Man” races from the theaters and into the home video market, as the action comedy, starring Glen Powell, arrives on Paramount+ on Jan. 13.\n\n\tDirected by Edgar Wright, “The Running Man” was adapted from a Stephen King novel of the same name, originally published in 1982 under the author’s frequented pseudonym, Richard Bachman. The story focuses on Ben Richards (Powell), a blacklisted blue-collar laborer living in a dystopian future. To lift his family out of poverty, he enters to compete in “The Running Man,” a televised game show where he must survive 30 days while being hunted by the network’s mercenaries as well as regular civilians. If he makes it through the 30 days, he wins $1 billion.\n\t\n\n\tAlongside Powell, Josh Brolin, Colman Domingo, William H. Macy, Lee Pace, Michael Cera, Emilia Jones, Daniel Ezra, Jayme Lawson and Sean Hayes round out the film’s star-studded cast. \n\n\n\tParamount released the movie on Nov. 14. in 3,534 theaters. Produced by Wright alongside Simon Kinberg and Nira Park, the movie grossed $16.5 million at the box office during its opening weekend, finishing second behind “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” which released that same weekend. In total, “The Running Man” grossed more than $69 million at the worldwide box office against a $110 million budget and received mixed reviews.\n\n\tWright’s movie is the second feature adaptation of King’s novel, following the 1987 TriStar Pictures film of the same name, which was directed by Paul Michael Glaser and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as Richards. \n",

It’s expected to take home the award for best musical or comedy film, and Anderson is poised to win best director. Star Leonardo DiCaprio is up against Timothee Chalamet (“Marty Supreme”), George Clooney (“Jay Kelly”), Ethan Hawke (“Blue Moon”), Lee Byung-Hun (“No Other Choice”) and Jesse Plemons (“Bugonia”) in the best actor in a musical or comedy race. Chalamet has been a strong contender, after winning the Critics Choice Award, and enters Sunday night as the frontrunner for his ping-pong dramedy “Marty Supreme.” \n\n\tIn the lead actor in a drama category, Wagner Moura (“The Secret Agent”) may have a slight edge over Michael B. Jordan (“Sinners”), Joel Edgerton (“Train Dreams”), Dwayne Johnson (“The Smashing Machine”), Oscar Isaac (“Frankenstein”) and Jeremy Allen White (“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”). In the lead actress category, Jessie Buckley’s tragic performance in “Hamnet” could lead her to the win over Jennifer Lawrence (“Die My Love”), Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”), Julia Roberts (“After the Hunt”), Tessa Thompson (“Hedda”) and Eva Victor (“Sorry, Baby”).\n\n\tIn the lead actress in a musical or comedy category, Rose Byrne’s frantic portrayal of a mother in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” has her as the frontrunner over Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked: For Good”), Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”), Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”), Emma Stone (“Burgonia”) and Amanda Seyfried (“The Testament of Ann Lee”).\n\n\tIn the TV races, HBO’s luxury hotel-set drama “White Lotus” leads all nominees with six nominations, including acting nods for Carrie Coon, Parker Posey, Aimee Lou Wood, Walton Goggins and Jason Isaacs. Netflix’s limited series “Adolescence,” which chronicled a murder case in one long, continuous shot, follows close behind with five nominations.\n\n\tSee the nominees below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFRANKENSTEIN (Netflix)\n\n\tHAMNET (Focus Features)\n\n\tIT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT (NEON)\n\n\tTHE SECRET AGENT (NEON)\n\n\tSENTIMENTAL VALUE (NEON)\n\n\tSINNERS (Warner Bros.

DHS says the video provides critical context for what agents were dealing with just before the shooting.\n      \n\n          According to DHS, Good's vehicle placement impeded federal agents, turning a routine operation into a rapidly escalating encounter.\n      \n    \n        \n                    \n                      1/7/26\n                  \n      \n    \n          The video release comes as scrutiny around the shooting continues to intensify. DHS maintains the clip that helps explain the circumstances leading up to the fatal moment.\n      \n    \n          The FBI has begun investigating the circumstances of the shooting ... but state investigators have been denied access to evidence, according to the AP.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Renee Nicole Good\n              \n                          \n                ICE\n              \n                          \n                Shootings\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

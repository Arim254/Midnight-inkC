    "body": "\n\tParamount Skydance boss David Ellison will be in attendance at Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The news comes hours after his studio upped its bid for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery to $31 per share.\n\n\tSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina posted on X Tuesday afternoon that Ellison will be his guest at Trump’s address.\n\n\tReps for Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. \n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery said in a press release on Tuesday that the WBD board “had not made a determination” whether or not Paramount’s offer is “superior” to the deal currently in place with Netflix. If Paramount’s new bid is preferable, Netflix will “have four business days after such determination to negotiate with WBD and to propose any revisions to the Netflix transaction.”\n\n\tNetflix’s deal is around $83 billion for just Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max. Paramount wants all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its linear assets, for $112 billion. Since Netflix’s agreement is still in effect, the WBD board will continue to recommend the deal with the streaming giant, which will go to a shareholder vote on March 20.\n\n\tAlong with the increased purchasing power of $31 per share, Paramount’s latest offer also includes a ticking fee of 25 cents per quarter starting after Sept. 30, as well as a $7 billion breakup fee if the deal doesn’t clear regulatory scrutiny. Paramount also offered to pay the $2.8 billion fee for Warner Bros. if it terminates its merger with Netflix.\n\n\tNews of the new deal came at the end of a seven day negotaing window, during which Netflix allowed WBD to “seek clarity” on Paramount’s “best and final offer.”\n\t\n\n\tSome have interpreted Paramount as having the upper hand in the regulatory battle for Warner Bros. since Larry Ellison, David’s mega-billionaire father, is a longtime Trump supporter. However, in a Truth Social post in Dec. 2025, the president deflected this theory, saying of the Ellisons, “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\n\t“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that ’60 Minutes’ has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before,” Trump wrote. \n\n\tWhile Trump told NBC in early February that he thought he “shouldn’t be involved” with regulating the Warner Bros. deal, he appeared to backtrack on this stance on Feb. 21, when he demanded Netflix “immediately” fire board member Susan Rice or “pay the consequences.” \n\n\t“Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences,” Trump wrote. “She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tPresident Donald Trump is set to deliver his 2026 State of the Union address Tuesday night at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. The primetime speech will be delivered before a joint session of Congress, and will broadcast across every major news network such as ABC, PBS, CBS and Fox.\n\n\tThe best way for cable-cutters to tune into the President’s speech is on Disney+ and Hulu, which will be streaming ABC’s broadcast live online, with additional additional pre- and post-show coverage across ABC News programming. PBS NewsHour will also carry the speech live, with coverage beginning ahead of the address and continuing through the Democratic response and analysis.\n\n\n\tThe speech will also broadcast across other major news network such as CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC) and C-SPAN, in addition to several Spanish-language networks such as Telemundo. Those without cable can easily access these broadcasts through a variety of live TV streamers such as DirecTV, Sling TV, Hulu + Live TV and Fubo TV.  \n\n\tDirecTV has a five-day free trial that gets you access to 90+ live television channels, including dozens of cable news networks. Use the free trial to livestream President Trump’s State of the Union speech online free.\n\n\tTrump is expected to use tonight’s speech to lay out a broad midterm-year message centered on the economy and his second-term agenda, with particular focus on tariffs and trade after the recent Supreme Court ruling limiting parts of his tariff program. Coverage previews also point to immigration and DHS funding as major themes, while foreign policy — especially tensions involving Iran and the possibility of further U.S. military action — is likely to factor into the address as well. \n\n\n\tIt’s Trump’s first formal State of the Union of his second term (after last year’s joint-session speech) and arrives at a particularly charged point in Washington, just months ahead of the 2026 midterms, with Republicans and Democrats already treating the speech as a message test for the fall campaign. It also comes on the heels of a Supreme Court setback to parts of Trump’s tariff policy, which is likely to heighten attention on how he frames the economy, trade and executive power in front of Congress — and in front of a national TV audience.\n\n\tStream Trump’s State of the Union address live online free with a free trial to DirecTV here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSamuel L. Jackson‘s long-gestating “Tulsa King” spinoff is finally moving forward — but with a new title and setting. Paramount+ announced Tuesday that “Frisco King” — formerly titled “NOLA King” — will start production next month in Ft. Worth, Texas.\n\n\t“Tulsa King” creator Taylor Sheridan is now set to write all eight episodes of “Frisco King” Season 1, which comes from Paramount Television Studios and 101 Studios. News that Sheridan would write all of “Frisco King” comes seven months after Variety first broke the news that original “NOLA King” showrunner Dave Erickson had exited the spinoff.\n\t\n\n\t“We are honored to have Taylor Sheridan write the first season of ‘Frisco King’ and bring to life Samuel L. Jackson’s iconic character,” said Paramount Television Studios prexy Matt Thunell. “Having him pen all episodes of the season with his singular voice will be a treat for fans of ‘Tulsa King’ and audiences around the world.”\n\n\n\tBack when it was called “NOLA King,” the spinoff was to have been set in New Orleans. But with the title change also comes a setting change: “Frisco King” will mostly be set in Frisco, Texas. (According to insiders, the show will still briefly visit New Orleans, but the bulk of the story now takes place in Frisco.)\n\n\tJackson was introduced to “Tulsa King” viewers in Season 3 as Russell Lee Washington Jr., “who, after befriending Dwight Manfredi (Sylvester Stallone) during a ten-year stint in federal prison, is sent to Tulsa by New York’s Renzetti crime family to take Dwight out once and for all.” Instead, per the original logline,  he’s “inspired by what Dwight created in Tulsa and impressed with the possibilities of second chances.”\n\t\n\n\tSaid Paramount+ head of originals Jane Wiseman: “Taylor Sheridan continues to build worlds that attract some of the most iconic talent working today, and ‘Frisco King’ is no exception. Having Samuel L. Jackson step into this universe is a testament to the scale and ambition of the storytelling Taylor is crafting. We’re thrilled to expand this storyline with such a powerhouse creative team and cast on Paramount+.”\n\n\tProduction was previously announced to begin in early 2026; now, the word is cameras will start rolling late March in Fort Worth.\n\n\tSheridan, Stallone and Jackson are all EPs on “Frisco King.” David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Christina Alexandra Voros, Michael Friedman, LaTanya Richardson Jackson and Keith Cox also executive produce.\n\n\tParamount+ noted that “Tulsa King” hit Nielsen’s top 10 streaming originals chart for eleven consecutive weeks in Fall 2025. \n\n\tJackson’s recent TV output includes the Apple TV limited series “The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,”  the Marvel-Disney+ show “Secret Invasion,” and Peacock’s “Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist.” He also previously voiced the title character in the animated series “Afro Samurai.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom the trifecta of prizes “Happy Birthday” earned during its Tribeca world premiere in 2025 to the multiple audience awards and other kudos it collected on the international festival circuit, plus, its selection as Egypt’s Oscar submission, the poignant drama is surely one of the best and most awarded foreign features still seeking U.S. distribution. Helmed and co-written by Sarah Goher, the first-ever Egyptian chosen as one of Variety’s 10 Directors to Watch, it illuminates disparities of wealth and class in contemporary Cairo through the affecting story of a resourceful 8-year-old maid whose devoted friendship with the daughter of the household she works for is frowned upon by her employers.\n\t\n\n\tGoher, a screenwriter and producer making her feature debut, proves herself to be a director-writer of uncommon sensitivity. She draws a performance of astonishing depth from Doha Ramadan as Toha, the illiterate but street-smart young domestic who doesn’t yet understand her position in Egypt’s complex social hierarchy.\n\n\n\tSmart, capable and quick-witted, Toha’s current joy comes from her relationship with Nelly (Khadija Ahmed), the spoiled granddaughter of her employer (Hanan Youssef), a tetchy, elderly diabetic. Toha helps to hide Nelly’s bed-wetting from her soon-to-be divorced mother Laila (Nelly Karim) and covers for her when she’s late or binging on ice cream. Meanwhile, Nelly enjoys having a friend of a similar age right in her own home and ignores her grandmother’s snide comments about Toha being a potential source of lice.\n\n\tNow that Nelly’s father has left, financial worries cause the women to prepare to leave their modern home in an affluent gated community. Nelly’s ninth birthday celebration looks to be a casualty of the situation until Toha comes up with a clever plan to get Nelly the party of her dreams. But as the day progresses, Toha, who has no idea of when she was born and has never heard of birthday wishes, finds herself learning some hard lessons that leave the audience quietly devastated.\n\t\n\n\tGoher’s carefully calibrated visuals in partnership with Seif El Din Khaled’s intimate cinematography perfectly establish the painful paradox of money and class. In the film’s opening moments, the two young girls in their pajamas and wildly curly hair play happily in a pink tent on the early morning of Nelly’s birthday. Sure, one has slightly darker skin and the other more delicate features, but they seem like equals. Then, after the adults come into the frame and Toha dresses in shapeless clothes and a headscarf, their social position and economic circumstances become much clearer. Nelly goes to school while Toha fetches and carries for the “Madames.”\n\n\tDespite her menial work, Toha feels lucky. She hates the subsistence fishing that she would have to do if she lived with her family. Although she might not have her own bedroom at Nelly’s house, merely a couch in a living room, at least she has drawers in which to store her things, many of them Nelly’s castoffs. In contrast, at her mother’s ramshackle house the kids sleep where they can and must share all their clothes. No wonder, in her innocence, Toha tells Laila that she hopes she can stay with Laila and Nelly forever.\n\n\t(Over)-confident in her ability to make things happen, Toha isn’t conscious of the class-prejudice her mismatched designer cast-offs and headscarf incite at the fancy boutique where she accompanies Laila. But the social boundaries she encounters there are also present in her employer’s household as well as at its very gates.\n\n\tUnbeknownst to Toha, her employer arranges for Toha’s sister (Jomana Ibrahim) to pick her up so that she can’t participate in Nelly’s party, even though Toha believes that Nelly wants her there. As the sisters leave the complex, the gate guard insists on rummaging through the bags of food and clothing Laila has given them, even calling the house to make sure they had the right to take them. Fatme feels humiliated, but Toha is too busy plotting how to return from her rundown village near the Nile.\n\n\tEver enterprising, Toha does eventually make her way back to the party, but there, the ultimate dawning of her place outside of Nelly’s circle is heartbreaking. The sheer joy Goher has captured Ramadan experiencing earlier is replaced by confusion, pain and tears. Goher and her charismatic young star understand how to use cinema as a powerful empathy generator. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Brazilian film “Gugu’s World” starts quite literally true to its title by showing the audience its lead character’s room, full of everything he loves. Director Allan Deberton crams much story and characterization in those opening frames. From Gugu’s soccer trophies to his colorful wardrobe to the glitter on his face, this 11-year-old is revealed fully and economically. A complete portrait in mere minutes. He’s shown dancing around and even wearing a cape. An endearing character to fall in love with instantly, thus setting up this charming film.\n\t\n\n\t“Gugu’s World,” which won the jury prize for the Generation section at the Berlinale, is a generous character study of a queer pre-teen. Gugu (Yuri Gomes)  lives with his grandmother Dilma (Teca Pereira), in a small house near the Araújo Lima reservoir. Their bond is strong as he lost his mother, Dilma’s daughter, when he was very young. She accepts him unconditionally and their time together is filled with playful joy. At school, he’s doing well and has two supportive girlfriends. He is also a star soccer player. Of course he has a nemesis: a boy named Francisco who’s not as good at soccer, and who keeps calling Gugu “a sissy” while goading him into confrontations. His father Batista (Lázaro Ramos) eyes him with disappointment and euphemistically calls him “a clown.”\n\n\n\tAndré Araújo’s screenplay manages to flesh out all these interrelationships with sensitivity and nuance. The film finds space to tell the story of Gugu and Dilma’s special bond in scenes that feel natural. A highlight is their love of Cyndi Lauper’s “Time After Time,” which was a favorite of Gugu’s mother. When Dilma starts becoming frail, Gugu goes to great lengths to take care of her while keeping others from invading their space. Though different, the same tenderness shows in the father and son relationship. There’s hurt and shame standing between them, but also love that might lead to genuine appreciation of each other at any point. \n\t\n\n\tHowever, above all Araújo splendidly comes up with an unforgettable cinema hero. In crafting Gugu he writes a wholly original character who also immediately feels familiar. The audience gets to know Gugu so well and fall in love with his courage, singularity and determination to protect his grandmother and their oasis of a life together. In Gomes, the filmmakers hit the jackpot. The young actor brings grit, grief and much exuberance to his performance. He is in almost every frame and holds the film together with a grounded and spontaneous performance that has none of the precociousness that mars many a young actor’s performance. Pereira matches him in warmth and their duet is a pleasure to watch. \n\n\tVisually the film is as colorful as Gugu’s personality. Deberton, working with production designer Dayse Barreto and costume designer Gabriella Marra, fills the frame with vibrant colors — deep pink and blue, purple and yellow, to show the beauty and vivaciousness of Gugu’s world. He might be worried about his grandmother, frustrated with his dad, sometimes uncomfortable among his peers, but it’s clear he likes himself and knows he will persevere. \n\n\tTherein lies the strength of this film. Not everything goes well, there’s tragedy and sadness but also a sense of infinite hope that permeates the proceedings. The first sentence the character utters at the beginning of the film is that “he’s going to save the world.” By the end of the film that seems entirely plausible, even believable. If Gugu doesn’t save the world, he will at least protect himself and his grandmother and make their life together as wonderful as can be. The film seems destined to play at many festivals, especially queer ones. However “Gugu’s World” is such a crowd pleaser that it deserves to be seen widely by audiences. They’ll be in for a real treat.\n",

Per the studio, the game “intends to deliver the ultimate Wolverine fantasy, with fast, fluid, and ferocious combat; exhilarating, action-packed set pieces, and a gripping story that taps into the core tenets of one of the most compelling comic book characters of all-time.”“Wolverine” was developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Insomniac Games in partnership with Marvel Games and released its first trailer during PlayStation’s “State of Play” presentation in September 2025.“We aim to deliver the ultimate Wolverine fantasy built on Insomniac staples like fast, fluid, and ferocious combat; exhilarating, action-packed set pieces; robust accessibility features; and a gripping story that taps into the core tenets of one of the most compelling comic book characters of all-time,” Insomniac Games senior community manager Aaron Jason Espinoza said in a PlayStation blog post first announcing the game. “We’re breaking new ground with Wolverine, yes, but our penchant for telling stories about heroes overcoming colossal odds is as strong as ever.

    "body": "\n\tManagement of the Writers Guild of America West met with the staff union on Sunday night as the two sides aimed to resolve the week-old staff strike.\n\n\tBut while there has been some movement on some issues, the staff union said that not enough progress has been made.\n\n\t“Management is still not ready to meet the moment,” said Dylan Holmes, co-chair of the Writers Guild Staff Union bargaining committee, during picketing on Tuesday. “They do not want us to be on this picket line and are trying to figure out how to get us off of it. But they are still unwilling to bargain in good faith with us in order to get there.”\n\t\n\n\tThe WGSU went on strike on Feb. 17, alleging that union leadership had failed to seriously address the staff’s concerns. The staff union — which includes about 100 guild employees — argues that wages are too low and that workers are subject to unfair promotion and discipline practices. Many WGAW employees make $50,000 to $80,000 a year, according to public data. \n\n\n\tWGA management has denied the allegations of bad-faith bargaining and said it will continue to work with the staff to reach a resolution. The two sides met on Sunday night at the International Longshore and Warehouse Union hall in San Pedro, as WGAW management sought a “neutral” site.\n\n\tAnother meeting was expected as soon as Tuesday night.\n\n\tIf the strike persists much longer, it could impact the WGA Awards, which are scheduled for March 8 at the J.W. Marriott hotel in downtown Los Angeles. Staff members typically work at the event alongside an event production crew. If they are on strike, it might raise concerns among members about crossing a picket line.\n\t\n\n\tA few dozen WGA members joined the staffers in picketing outside the union headquarters at Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street on Tuesday morning.\n\n\t“It’s very hypocritical and quite frankly embarrassing that a union that is always at the forefront of trying to get a good deal for its members won’t do the same for its own staff,” said writer Joe Russo, who was an assistant lot coordinator during the 2023 WGA strike. “I don’t think it’s a good look.”\n\n\tThe WGSU formed last April and is working to get its first contract. Last August, the union filed an unfair labor practices complaint accusing the WGA of firing a union staffer for union activity. At the picket on Tuesday, WGA workers and members carried signs holding Ellen Stutzman, the guild’s executive director, accountable for alleged ULPs.\n\n\t“Come on y’all, this is embarrassing,” read one sign. Another: “Thought we were on the same team.”\n\n\tThe WGA is due to sit down with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers on March 16 to begin bargaining new contract on behalf of writers. The WGA has said that bargaining will go on even if the staff is on strike.\n\n\t“I don’t love that we’d be basically negotiating on two fronts,” Russo said. “So it would be great to resolve this, get all our ducks in order, stop airing our dirty laundry and focus on a deal for members, because at the end of the day that will help staff too.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLesley Manville and Ciarán Hinds are such terrific actors that a lot of us would follow them anywhere. But in the wee drama “Midwinter Break,” these two pour their skills into playing a couple of fuddy-duddies — a homepsun Northern Irish married couple, Stella and Gerry, who have reached their early seventies and are so set in their dainty, placid ways that they’ve become like two old pieces of cozy matching furniture. They sit, they read, they have a drink, they have a meal, they exchange comforting pleasantries…and then another day is behind them. And another, much the same, lies ahead.\n\t\n\n\tThe whole design of the movie is to take these two out of their comfort zone, to dip beneath the stodgy surface contentment of their well-worn habits and touch the explosive emotions that the couple — or, at least, one of them — has been covering up.\n\n\n\tAt Christmastime, they’re at home, Gerry seated in the living room nursing an evening cocktail, when Stella asks if she can still tempt him; we wonder if she means something erotic, and when he turns her down, we really wonder. (Is the threadbare dimension of their marriage that the fire has gone out in the bedroom?) But no, she’s just talking about going to church. Stella and Gerry exist in a state that looks halfway between retirement heaven and a coma. The two have a son, who is grown, who they don’t see very much. They are also exiles: residents of Glasgow, Scotland, even though the film presents them as Irish to the core. There’s a reason they left their homeland behind.    \n\n\tIn the middle of the night, Stella gets up and goes over to the computer, acting on a sudden inspiration. A bit later, after exchanging Christmas presents, she hands Gerry an envelope with a surprise gift inside: two plane tickets to Amsterdam, where she has arranged for them to have a four-day getaway. She wants to shake up their routine. But as soon as they arrive in that elegant Dutch city of bridges and hidden corners, it’s clear that it’s going to take more than a change of locale to do it.\n\t\n\n\tThe movie opens with a jarring flashback. We see the young Stella (Julie Lamberton), very pregnant, being rushed to a hospital after some kind of accident (she has blood on her arm). A cataclysm took place, but we’re not sure what, and our first thought is: Did she lose the baby? Is their son not their actual son?\n\n\tAs Stella and Gerry settle into their Amsterdam vacation, having breakfast at the hotel, visiting a fabled art museum, always lubricating the day with a pint, a glass of wine, a tumbler of Scotch (Gerry brings a bottle along with him in case he needs a quick refill), we register the depth of their connection. (In the bedroom, it turns out, the fire is still alive.) These two fit into each other’s lives as snugly as nesting dolls, to the point that they may have no surprises left, nothing new to discover.\n\n\tExcept that they do. Stella wants to visit a women’s housing facility that’s also a stately convent: a Catholic retreat nestled right in the middle of Amsterdam. A devout Catholic herself, she’s intensely interested in the women who live there. She tells Gerry, who has always been a secular man, that she wants to find a way to be more devout in her own life. And the reason for that is that she wants…more. More than what the two of them already have. This leaves Gerry flabbergasted. What’s the “more” that she could be talking about? He has no concept of it. He thinks their lives are perfect.\n\n\tIt all connects, of course, to that opening flashback. But what happened there is not, perhaps, what we suspect. Was it a miracle? Stella thinks it was. But the real point may not be about what did or didn’t happen. It’s about how two people in a marriage this close could be so cut from the same cloth and, at the same time, so different. Not because there’s some deep dark secret, but because people are…different. Gerry, we can see, drinks too much (he’s the definition of a happy “functional” alcoholic), and Stella has a problem with that, but the real problem isn’t the drinking. It’s the void Gerry is covering up. And Stella now wants to fill her own void with faith.\n\n\tThe director, Polly Findlay, presents all of this in a fluid and fastidious prestige-teleplay-of-the-week way. Adapting a 2017 novel by Bernard MacLaverty (the script is by MacLaverty and Nick Payne), she creates a generous space for her actors, who turn what might have been a rather staid movie — and still, at times, is — into a meticulous duet.\n\t\n\n\tManville has often played characters of magnetic will (just think of her domineering snob of a sister in “Phantom Thread,” her lusciously obnoxious tippling receptionist in “Another Year”), but in “Midwinter Break” she throws us for a while because her Stella, at first, seems the picture of dowdy devotion. But it turns out that she’s devoted to something deeper, a mystery she can no longer repress. Manville, in a nifty feat of acting, lets that unruly spirit poke through, even as she persists in trying to keep a polite lid on it. She shows us the spirituality of an ordinary woman. And Hinds, dolefully bearded, makes Gerry as comfy and trusting as an old sheepdog: a genuinely benevolent man, yet one who is starting to drown in his quiet complacency. “Midwinter Break” does nothing earth-shattering (it remains wee), but the movie touchingly colors in how it might be possible for two people to know each other too well and also not well enough.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohn Davidson, the Scottish Tourette’s syndrome activist and real-life inspiration for “I Swear,” was thrust into the spotlight at the 79th BAFTA Awards when his involuntary vocal tics disrupted the ceremony, including an outburst of racial slurs that occurred as “Sinners” stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented an award. In an exclusive email interview with Variety, Davidson offers his perspective on what happened, including what precautions and guardrails he had expected the BBC and BAFTA to take before he attended the ceremony.\n\t\n\n\tSince the fallout, Davidson’s team shares that he’s reached out to the studio handling “Sinners” in order to directly apologize to Jordan, Lindo and production designer Hannah Beachler.\n\n\n\tHere he is, giving his account, in his own words.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo at the Bafta awards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for BAFTA\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMany people’s only frame of reference for Tourette’s syndrome comes from stereotypes, particularly the idea that it’s “just swearing” or saying slurs for shock value. How do you describe the condition to someone starting from that place?\n\n\tVery often, the media focuses on my particular type of Tourette’s, which is called coprolalia — the involuntary use of obscene or offensive language. This symptom affects 10% to 30% of people with the condition and is not a criterion for diagnosis. However, it is one of the hardest tics to manage and can be very distressing for those living with it. Many individuals report discrimination and isolation as a result.\n\n\tI have been physically beaten to within an inch of my life with an iron bar after ticking a comment to a young woman whose boyfriend and accomplice ambushed me one evening.\n\t\n\n\tThe real challenge isn’t the tics themselves, but the misconceptions surrounding them. Understanding the full range of Tourette’s helps reduce stigma and supports everyone living with the condition.\n\n\tWhen socially unacceptable words come out, the guilt and shame on the part of the person with the condition is often unbearable and causes enormous distress. I can’t begin to explain how upset and distraught I have been as the impact from Sunday sinks in.\n\n\tIn the moment before a vocal tic, do you know what’s coming, or does it only become clear after the fact?\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the condition, people either have an ability to suppress what they are saying for short periods of time, or they don’t. Suppressing can be compared to taking a full bottle of Coca-Cola and shaking it each time you feel the need to tic. Before long, the pressure is so intense it has to be released, and it bursts out — and on occasion, that can lead to a tic attack.\n\n\tFor me personally, my brain works so fast and the tics have always been so aggressive that I have no idea when they are coming or what they will be. I have almost no ability to suppress, and when the situation is stressful, I have absolutely no choice but to tic — it simply bursts out of me like a gunshot.\n\n\tWhen a tic involves a slur or taboo phrase, what’s the single most important thing you want people to understand about the distinction between intent and involuntary neurological response?\n\n\tI want people to know and understand that my tics have absolutely nothing to do with what I think, feel or believe. It’s an involuntary neurological misfire. My tics are not an intention, not a choice and not a reflection of my values.\n\n\tThose who have seen “I Swear” will understand this. My tics have said and done things over the years that have caused huge pain and upset — punching Dottie [my second mother] in the face is a prime example. Dottie is someone I love dearly. I would never, ever want to hurt her. I have even punched her in the face when she was driving at speed, almost causing a head-on collision.\n\n\tTourette’s can make my body or voice do things I don’t mean, and sometimes those tics land on the worst possible words. I want to be really clear that the intent behind them is zero. What you’re hearing is a symptom — not my character, not my thought, not my belief.\n\t\n\n\tTourette’s can feel spiteful and searches out the most upsetting tic for me personally and for those around me. What you hear me shouting is literally the last thing in the world I believe; it is the opposite of what I believe. The most offensive word that I ticked at the ceremony, for example, is a word I would never use and would completely condemn if I did not have Tourette’s.\n\n\tI am often triggered by what I see and/or what I hear, and this part of the condition is called echolalia. For example, when the chair of BAFTA started speaking on Sunday, I shouted, “Boring.” On Sunday, Alan Cumming joked about his own sexuality and, when referencing Paddington Bear, said, “Maybe you would like to come home with me, Paddington. It wouldn’t be the first time I have taken a hairy Peruvian bear home with me.” This resulted in homophobic tics from me and led to a shout of “pedophile” that was likely triggered because Paddington Bear is a children’s character.\n\n\tI would appreciate reports of the event explaining that I ticked perhaps 10 different offensive words on the night of the awards. The N-word was one of these, and I completely understand its significance in history and in the modern world, but most articles are giving the impression I shouted one single slur on Sunday.\n\n\tWhat went into the decision to attend in person, and what conversations, if any, did you have with BAFTA or the BBC in advance about how to support you and other guests?\n\n\tThis was an awards ceremony that featured six nominations connected to a film that told the story of my life living with Tourette’s. This has been a three-year project for me, working with the writer, director, production and cast. I am also an active executive producer on the film. I had as much right to attend as anyone.\n\n\tI also knew that as voting members, most people in the audience would have seen “I Swear” and would be well prepared, well educated and well informed about my condition.\n\n\tAfter living with Tourette’s for almost 40 years, I was aware of how physically and mentally difficult it would be for me to attend. I also had a serious heart operation only five weeks ago. I put every ounce of energy and concentration into being able to attend.\n\n\tI was thrilled to see that on the night, everyone — including some of the most well-respected and famous people from the film world — cheered at my name and applauded. I stood and waved to show my appreciation and acknowledged that this was a significant moment in my life, finally being accepted. It started as one of the most memorable experiences of my life.\n\t\n\n\tStudioCanal were working closely with BAFTA, and BAFTA had made us all aware that any swearing would be edited out of the broadcast. I have made four documentaries with the BBC in the past, and feel that they should have been aware of what to expect from Tourette’s and worked harder to prevent anything that I said — which, after all, was some 40 rows back from the stage — from being included in the broadcast.\n\n\tAs I reflect on the auditorium, I remember there was a microphone just in front of me, and with hindsight I have to question whether this was wise, so close to where I was seated, knowing I would tic.\n\n\tWhat was going through your mind in the moment you realized the room could clearly hear your tics?\n\n\tInitially, my tics were noises and movements, but the more nervous I got, the more my tics ramped up. When my coprolalia tics came out, my stomach just dropped. As always, I felt a wave of shame and embarrassment hit me all at once. You want the floor to swallow you up. I wanted to disappear. I wanted to hide — just get away from all the eyes.\n\n\tI was hoping people would understand. My mind was saying: These people have seen the film. They will know I can’t help this. They will know it’s not me. This is exactly why we are here. I was saying in my head, “Please don’t judge me. Please understand this isn’t who I am.”\n\n\tI was trying to calm myself down, to breathe, but ultimately, I made the decision to leave to not cause any more upset. BAFTA found a private room with a monitor where I watched the rest of the awards.\n\n\tThe awards were, in all honesty, just a heightened version of my everyday life and are the reason why, for many periods in my life, I have been fearful of leaving the house — because I am so anxious and nervous about what I might tic and what people’s reaction might be.\n\n\tYou’ve spent years educating and campaigning around Tourette syndrome. Where have you seen real progress — and where does misunderstanding persist most stubbornly?\n\n\tSometimes you feel like you are making real progress in educating people on the condition, but there is so much more needed. Comments following the BAFTAs where people have said things like, “I need to stay inside,” “I wouldn’t say these things unless I thought them,” and “I am racist deep down” are deeply upsetting for me, and show there is still so much to do.\n\t\n\n\tThe negative responses only go to show the importance of people seeing the film and understanding more about an incredibly complex neurological condition. I had an expectation that the BBC would physically control the sound at the awards on Sunday. I was so far from the stage. From the lack of response from the early presenters to my tics, and with no one turning around to look at me, I assumed, like everyone else, that I could not be heard on the stage.\n\n\tThe only time I became aware that my tic had reached the stage was when Delroy and Michael B. Jordan appeared to look up from their role as presenters, and soon after that I decided to leave the auditorium.\n\n\tFinally, is there any language you’d ask us to avoid — words like “outburst” or “uncontrollable” — in favor of something more accurate?\n\n\tIt’s important not to use the word “disability.” This is considered a “condition” by the Tourette’s community. I would prefer phrasing such as: “I have lived with the condition …”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohn Turturro’s crime thriller “The Only Living Pickpocket in New York” has sold to Sony Pictures Classics a month after its Sundance Film Festival premiere. \n\n\tA release date hasn’t been set but SPC is eyeing a theatrical debut in the fall.\n\n\tWritten and directed by Noah Segan, “Pickpocket” follows Harry (Turturro), a veteran of the craft who struggles to keep up with the changing times — phones are trackable, wallets rarely have cash and guns are hiding in plain sight. When a theft goes awry, Harry embarks on a high-stakes race against time through the Big Apple. Giancarlo Esposito, Tatiana Maslany, Steve Buscemi, Karina Arroyave, Victoria Moroles, Will Price and Jamie Lee Curtis round out the cast.\n\t\n\n\t“Noah Segan’s ‘The Only Living Pickpocket’ is one of the great New York movies ever featuring John Turturro in the finest performance of his career, and it’s a glorious entertainment,” Sony Pictures Classics said in a statement. “It will be a big hit this fall with audiences everywhere.”\n\n\n\tIn Variety’s review, critic Tomris Laffly shared a similar sentiment and praised “The Only Living Pickpocket in New York” as an “unapologetically local love letter to the Big Apple and its less-illustrious denizens that New York deserves.” She added that “Pickpocket’ feels like a new, minor-key New York classic.”\n\n\tThis is Sony Pictures Classics’ third acquisition out of this year’s Sundance following the crowd-pleasing love story “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty” and drama “Bedford Park.”\n\n\tSegan is best known for working with Rian Johnson on such films as “Looper,” “Brick” and the “Knives Out” trilogy. His last directorial effort was 2022’s “Blood Relatives,” a horror comedy about Jewish vampires. “Pickpocket” was produced by Johnson’s T-Street Productions, which backed a prior Sundance darling in Chloe Domont’s psychological thriller “Fair Play,” which sold to Netflix for a staggering $20 million in 2023.\n\t\n\n\tSegan called Sony Pictures Classics co-presidents Michael Barker and Tom Bernard “legends in their own right” and thanked them for “iconically supporting the sort of sincerity and care we’ve put into the film.”\n\n\t“As a multi-generational New Yorker, capturing the soul and energy of our city was a requirement for ‘The Only Living Pickpocket in New York.’ No one embodies that vibe more than John Turturro,” Segan said in a statement. “Working alongside his legendary friends and colleagues like Steve Buscemi and Giancarlo Esposito, actors who have defined New York Cinema throughout their careers, gave us the authenticity that New York demands. Alongside our crew, we managed to make discoveries in our own backyard, through fellowship and shared history. It is a great honor to partner with Sony Pictures Classics in bringing the movie to audiences.”\n",

'cause they can officially rent out the actual Canadian cottage from the show!\n      \n    \n          Yes, seriously. The iconic lakeside Barlochan Cottage tucked away in Muskoka, north of Toronto, is hitting Airbnb -- and bookings open March 3 at 12 PM ET.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The price? $248.10 in Canadian dollars per night (about $181 USD) -- a cheeky nod to \"24\" and \"81,\" the jersey numbers of Hudson Williams’ Shane Hollander and Connor Storrie’s Ilya Rozanov, the duo at the heart of the show’s fiery, queer hockey saga.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As any fan knows, the 3-bedroom forest-core fantasy in the pics wasn’t just set dressing -- it was the setting. From Connor’s now-legendary \"I’m coming to the cottage\" line to Shane and Ilya’s off-ice moments, all the way to that finale ... it’s basically a fandom pilgrimage site with throw pillows.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Fair warning -- this place will book up faster than a game-winning breakaway. So if you’re still nursing that \"Heated Rivalry\"-shaped hole in your heart, you’d better lace up and move fast before the next season skates back into our lives!🏒\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Hudson Williams\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Travel\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Hockey\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Governor Newsom basically says he had a mediocre SAT score and he can't read well due to his severe dyslexia ... so he's no better than anyone in the audience.\n      \n\n          Many -- including newly minted MAGA movement star Nicki Minaj -- called Newsom's comments racist ... claiming he meant Black people are stupid and can't read because the audience must be mostly Black in the ATL.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          But, just take a look at the crowd, captured in new photos -- it's a predominantly white audience watching the event -- pop goes the racism argument.\n      \n    \n          Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens defended Governor Newsom ... telling outsiders to keep their mouths shut instead of telling his citizens what should offend them.\n      \n    \n                    \n                          \n                                  \n      \n        \n    \n          Newsom has also defended himself by arguing Republicans didn't care when the prez posted an A.I. vid of the Obamas as monkeys ... so nitpicking his comments is totally unfair.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          HL says this is just another example of the \"circular firing squads\" former President Obama warned about ... because Dems jumped on Newsom instead of standing by their own.\n      \n    \n          Harvey says he's not endorsing people ... and encourages them to pop off at Newsom about his record if they want -- but don't go for the clickbait BS.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Gavin Newsom\n              \n                          \n                Harvey Levin\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Live\n              \n                          \n                Politics\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Benny has an overall score of 3/5.\n      \n    \n          Benny Blanco's not exactly putting his best foot forward for his wife Selena Gomez ... and we mean that literally.\n      \n    \n          The record producer was on his \"Friends Keep Secrets\" podcast Tuesday ... and while the vibes were chill, his feet were doing the absolute most. At one point, he kicked back, threw those bare dogs up on the couch and ... let’s just say the soles told a very dusty story.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Completely oblivious, Benny was rubbing his feet together for peak coziness … meanwhile, fans were spiraling, clutching their pearls and reaching for disinfectant through the screen.\n      \n    \n          Now, maybe this is just how things roll in the Blanco-Gomez household -- or maybe we caught him on the worst possible day -- but it’s hard to believe Selena’s just sweeping this one under the rug.\n      \n    \n          Perhaps she’s never had the full, unfiltered bottom-view experience. Either way, we’ve done the dirty work and brought the situation to light.\n      \n    \n          So now we have to ask -- is this still her sole-mate ... or does she need to walk away?

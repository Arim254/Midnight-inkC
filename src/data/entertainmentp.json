    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery reported record-breaking streaming performance for the Milano-Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games, with the company posting triple-digit growth across its HBO Max and Discovery+ platforms compared to the Beijing 2022 Games.\n\n\tThe return of the Olympic Winter Games to Europe, combined with what the company described as a highly innovative streaming experience, drove significant growth in viewership and engagement across WBD’s services.\n\t\n\n\tTotal hours viewed on its streaming services grew 103% versus Beijing 2022, with three times as many subscribers (234% growth) tuning in via HBO Max and Discovery+. The milestone came quickly – total subscribers streaming Milano-Cortina content surpassed the entirety of Beijing 2022’s streaming audience within just the first three days of full competition (Feb. 6-8).\n\n\n\tSocial video views on Eurosport’s European accounts and TNT Sports’ U.K. and Ireland accounts exceeded 4 billion, representing a 580% jump versus Beijing 2022.\n\n\t“The success we witnessed in the opening days has translated into an outstanding Olympic Winter Games for Warner Bros. Discovery with substantial streaming viewership and engagement growth in addition to highly robust linear audiences,” said Andrew Georgiou, president and managing director of WBD Sports Europe.\n\n\tA feature of this cycle was Olympics Multiview, a new offering that allowed streaming subscribers to watch up to four events simultaneously on a single screen with their choice of audio commentary. Roughly a third of users – 32% – made use of the feature. Viewers could also set personalized watch lists, receive gold medal alerts, track live action via timeline markers, and select from up to 21 commentary languages.\n\t\n\n\tThe platforms carried all 246 live sessions across the 19-day competition window, which peaked at 11 concurrent events and featured 116 medal contests with 2,900 athletes competing. Triple-digit streaming growth was recorded individually in France, Germany and Italy on HBO Max, as well as in the U.K. on Discovery+.\n\n\t“Watching the Olympic Games on HBO Max and Discovery+ clearly resonated with audiences in the U.K. and Europe with three times as many people choosing to stream the Games with us compared to Beijing 2022,” Georgiou said. “Viewers being able to curate their own Olympics, selecting from all 116 live events and using innovative features such as our one-screen Multiview, drove significant increases in time spent by fans watching on our streaming services.”\n\n\tLinear performance also held strong, with WBD’s Eurosport (Europe) and TNT Sports (U.K. and Ireland) channels posting a 3% increase in total viewers versus Beijing 2022 – a reversal of the broader decline in linear TV consumption seen over the same period. Total linear hours viewed climbed 51% versus the prior Winter Games. Country-level linear gains on Eurosport included France (+47% hours viewed), Germany (+50%) and Poland (+32%), while TNT Sports in the U.K. and Ireland climbed 60% in hours viewed.\n\n\tGeorgiou added: “This Olympics has set an incredibly strong foundation as we look to Los Angeles 2028 and the Olympic Winter Games returning to Europe again for French Alps 2030.”\n",

Roddick, who has worked for Fox Sports and Tennis Channel in the past, will join the Disney sports giant’s roster of tennis commentators just prior to Wimbledon.\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to welcome Andy to the team. ESPN has long led the way in delivering in-depth tennis analysis, and with several recent talent additions, we’ve further strengthened our coverage,” said Linda Schulz, ESPN’s vice president of production, in a prepared statement. “Andy brings a distinctive, energetic, and highly relevant voice that will elevate both our studio and match coverage.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen it comes to tennis, ESPN has been working on its serve. The sports outlet in January named popular basketball host Malika Andrews to lead tennis coverage at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.\n\n\n\t ESPN said it struck a “multi-year deal” with Roddick, who retired from the sport in 2012 after reaching the Wimbledon finals three times and the U.S. Open finals once. Between 2002 and 2010, Roddick landed nine consecutive year-end top 10 finishes in the ATP rankings. He helped lead the United States to the 2007 Davis Cup title. Roddick was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 2017.  \n\n\tRoddick has made appearances in the past on shows including “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” “The Weakest Link” and “Celebrity Family Feud.” “Simply, I’m always just a massive fan of tennis,” Roddick said in a statement. “I’m very excited to join the ESPN tennis team and look forward to covering the two biggest tournaments in the world.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tDelroy Lindo spoke to Vanity Fair at one of the 2026 BAFTA after parties and said that he and “Sinners” co-star Michael B. Jordan “did what we had to do” when the N-word was shouted out as they were presenting the award for best visual effects to “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Lindo added that he wished “someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards.”\n\n\tVariety has reached out to BAFTA for comment.\n\n\n\tThe slur was shouted by John Davidson, who is diagnosed with Tourette syndrome. Davidson attended the BAFTAs as the subject of the nominated biopic “I Swear.” The film’s leading star, Robert Aramayo, won the best actor prize during for playing Davidson, whose condition causes him to produce involuntary vocal tics.\n\t\n\n\tAs reported by Variety: “A number of outbursts from Davidson could be heard throughout the BAFTA ceremony, including ‘shut the fuck up’ being shouted during an introductory speech from BAFTA chair Sara Putt and ‘fuck you’ when the directors of ‘Boong,’ which won the BAFTA for best children’s and family film, accepted their award.”\n\n\tSources told Variety after the ceremony that floor managers warned guests and attendees sitting around Davidson of his condition, without specifying what kinds of outbursts they might hear. According to multiple sources, none of the nominees or attendees were contacted by BAFTA or BBC ahead of the show with any such warnings.\n\n\tBAFTAs host Alan Cumming thanked the audience during the ceremony for their understanding after Davidson had several outbursts, including shouting the N-word.\n\n\t“You may have noticed some strong language in the background. This can be part of how Tourette’s syndrome shows up for some people as the film explores that experience,” Cumming said. “Thanks for your understanding and helping create a respectful space for everyone.”\n\t\n\n\tThe host added later on during the ceremony: “Tourette’s Syndrome is a disability and the tics you’ve heard tonight are involuntary, which means the person who has Tourette’s Syndrome has no control over their language. We apologize if you are offended tonight.”\n\n\tThe BAFTAs came under even more scrutiny after the tape-delayed broadcast aired later that night on the BBC with Davidson’s use of the N-word still audible. The BBC then apologized for not editing out the racial slur and removed it from from the version of the BAFTAs streaming on iPlayer.\n\n\tAfter pulling the BAFTA Film Awards from iPlayer early Monday afternoon, a BBC spokesperson said: “Some viewers may have heard strong and offensive language during the BAFTA Film Awards. This arose from involuntary verbal tics associated with Tourette syndrome, and as explained during the ceremony it was not intentional. We apologize that this was not edited out prior to broadcast and it will now be removed from the version on BBC iPlayer.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tUbisoft has set three executives as the new leaders of its iconic “Assassin’s Creed” video game franchise, including alums who oversaw work on beloved title “Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag.”\n\n\tVantage Studios, the Ubisoft subsidiary that operates the “Assassin’s Creed,” “Rainbow Six Siege” and “Far Cry” franchises, has named Martin Schelling head of the “Assassin’s Creed” brand. With this new title, Schelling will be responsible for overall strategy and long-term vision of the brand. Most recently, Schelling served as Ubisoft’s chief production officer and oversaw development workflows across the company’s portfolio. Schelling previously had leadership roles on “Assassin’s Creed” titles including “Revelations,” “Black Flag,” “Origins” and “Valhalla.”\n\t\n\n\tCreative director on both “Assassin’s Creed Origins” and “Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag,” Jean Guesdon has been appointed head of content for the franchise. Guesdon will oversee the Ubisoft brand’s creative direction, support individual games and guide the future of “Assassin’s Creed” “while staying true to its core DNA.” A veteran designer at Ubisoft, Guesdon’s credits trace back to the original 2007 “Assassin’s Creed” game. \n\n\n\tFrançois de Billy has been set as the brand’s head of production excellence, a title that Ubisoft’s Vantage Studios says is is meant to “strengthen production practices and execution across the brand.” François was production director on both “Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla” and “Assassin’s Creed: Origins.”\n\n\tThe new trio will transition from their current roles over to the “Assassin’s Creed” leadership team in the coming weeks to work alongside Andrée-Anne Boisvert, producer for “Assassin’s Creed’s” cross-brand initiatives and head of technological excellence, and Lionel Hiller, vice president of brand and go-to-market strategy.\n\t\n\n\tThese appointments come on the heels of great change across Ubisoft, which is in the process of dividing up all of its teams into five “creative houses,” one of them being Vantage Studios. This new model is being pioneered by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot as part of the company’s latest restructuring of operations amid weak post-pandemic performance.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGuillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and “KPop Demon Hunters” have been added to the Criterion Collection. The two Netflix releases are among the most acclaimed and most streamed films of 2025 and are in the thick of the Oscar race.\n\n\t“Frankenstein” was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including best picture and supporting actor for Jacob Elordi, who plays the creature. Del Toro has labored for decades to bring his sumptuous reimagining of Mary Shelley’s classic tale to the screen, mounting and then being forced to abandon the production at several points in his career. He finally gets his wish with a film that is visually bold, offering soaring sets and lush cinematography. Like so many del Toro films, the monster in this story is less savage and more sympathetic than the human characters. Oscar Isaac, Christoph Waltz and Mia Goth co-star in “Frankenstein.”\n\t\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” was a viral smash when it was released on Netflix last summer, eventually becoming the most popular film ever on the streaming service. It is directed by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans and won the Golden Globe and Critics’ Choice Awards for best animated motion picture and  song for “Golden.” The hit number was also the first K-Pop song ever to win a Grammy, and “KPop Demon Hunters” is nominated for best animated feature and original song at the upcoming Academy Awards.\n\n\n\tThe Criterion Collection publishes classic and contemporary films from around the world in editions that offer the highest technical quality, as well as supplemental materials including interviews and behind-the-scenes looks. Previous Netflix films that are part of the collection include Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma,” Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman”, Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog,” Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” and “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio.” Criterion also recently announced that it was adding other awards season favorites from 2025, including Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident” and Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent,” to its roster. \n",

    "body": "\n\tGenerative-AI company Suno has named former Merlin CEO Jeremy Sirota as its chief commercial officer, it announced Monday morning. In the role, Sirota will lead Suno’s commercial strategy, music industry relationships, platform partnerships, and enterprise solutions and will report directly to CEO Mikey Shulman.\n\n\tDuring his six years as CEO of Merlin, the digital music licensing partner for independent music labels and distributors, Sirota scaled annual revenue from $900 million to $1.8 billion while rebuilding its technology infrastructure and expanding its data and licensing capabilities. He led licensing agreements with major technology platforms including Apple, Deezer, Meta, Spotify, Twitch and YouTube among others. He also negotiated Merlin’s early AI partnerships.\n\t\n\n\tPrior to Merlin, Sirota held business development, strategy and operational roles at Meta on the music team, was a senior record executive at Warner Music Group, and served as a technology lawyer at Morrison Foerster, where he did licensing work for entertainment companies and advised on intellectual property matters.\n\n\n\t“Jeremy is a rare leader who has spent his career working to improve every side of the music business – for fans, artists, music rightsholders, and platforms,” said Shulman, co-founder and CEO of Suno. “What truly sets him apart is his ability to build what doesn’t yet exist, finding opportunity where others see obstacles and bringing all sides with him. That mindset will help craft a better future of music for all, and I couldn’t be more excited to have him join Suno.”\n\t\n\n\tSuno recently announced a partnership with Warner Music Group and last fall, it launched what it claims is the the first generative audio workstation, Suno Studio, which blends pro-grade multi-track editing with AI stem generation.\n\n\t+ Sony Music Publishing has promoted Greg Prata to chief financial officer, effective March 31. He will continue to be based out of the company’s New York office and will report to SMP chairman & CEO Jon Platt.\n\n\tIn his new role, Prata will oversee all aspects of Sony Music Publishing’s financial operations globally, including reporting, accounting, budget, administration and IT. He succeeds Tom Kelly, who recently announced his upcoming retirement from his position as CFO, after a 35-year career.\n\n\tPlatt said, “Greg has been a trusted leader on our team, and I’m pleased to see him step into the CFO role as we advance our next stage of growth. At the same time, we thank Tom for his remarkable tenure. His leadership has helped drive our success and set a high bar for excellence that Greg will continue to build upon.”\n\n\tPrata joined Sony in 2012 as senior VP of financial planning & analysis, following his time at EMI. In 2019, he was promoted to executive VP of finance & corporate strategy. Prior to his roles at Sony Music Publishing and EMI, Prata spent over a decade in private equity and investment banking.\n\n\t+ Patron Saints of Music, the custom music house behind Bravo’s “Below Deck” and others, has named Allie Moskovits head of sync & business development. In this newly created role, Moskovits will lead sync strategy for Patron Saints’ expanding catalog to drive business across TV, film, advertising, gaming, and emerging media. She will also focus on developing new artists and songs to diversify the catalog and expand the company’s footprint beyond unscripted television.\n\n\t+ Culture Wave, a Los Angeles–based, “rock-forward” artist management company operating in partnership with Red Light Management, has expanded in several areas.\n\n\tArtist managers Ryan Cunningham and Mike Bingham of Polarizer Management have joined Culture Wave, bringing their rosters into the company’s management division. Cunningham represents the Armed, Prostitute, Trauma Ray, Patrick Shiroishi, Truck Violence, Jodi, while Bingham joins with Trauma Ray, Spiritual Cramp and Agriculture. Cunningham will remain in his role at Biz 3 Publicity where he’s been a publicist for 12 years.\n\t\n\n\tThe company also announces the promotion of Rachel Hacken to artist manager, transitioning from day-to-day support for Jason Mageau’s roster. Hacken now manages Kittie, Gore., Thousand Below, and Holy Wars; as well as:\n\n\tAlana Lopez joins as touring & logistics manager, supporting Jason Mageau’s roster and Culture Wave artists; Madison Stern joins as day-to-day manager for Andrew Jarrin; Ana Garcia joins as digital marketing coordinator; Erin Carignan joins as day-to-day manager for Ryan Cunningham; Joey Mullen joins as co-manager for the band Agriculture with Bingham.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has kicked off production on “Messily Ever After” (working title), a new Korean romantic comedy film reuniting “Pachinko” stars Kim Minha and Noh Sang-hyun. \n\n\tThe film follows Su-hyun and Hyun-tae, a couple whose decade-long relationship swings between deep affection and mutual exasperation. “Leaning into the emotional whiplash of a long-term relationship, ‘Messily Ever After’ explores what it really means to stay together after the honeymoon phase has long ended — capturing the messy mix of loyalty, irritation, desire, and doubt that comes with truly knowing someone. The film is expected to blend sharp, witty storytelling with a grounded look at modern relationships,” according to Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tKim, known for her roles in “Pachinko,” “Typhoon Family” and “Way Back Love,” plays Su-hyun, a perfectionist curator who holds everything together professionally but finds herself unraveling when jealousy and love enter the picture. Noh Sang-hyun, also of “Pachinko” and “Love in the Big City,” plays Hyun-tae, a passionate installation artist who is unafraid to stand his ground. The casting reunites the two actors following their on-screen romance in “Pachinko,” this time as college sweethearts now a decade into their relationship.\n\n\n\tThe film marks the feature directorial debut of Seo Jung-min. Production is handled by Bombaram Film — the studio behind the young adult romance “Love Untangled,” directed by Namkoong Sun, and the acclaimed drama “Kim Ji-young, Born 1982,” directed by Kim Do-yeong.\n\n\t“Messily Ever After” continues Netflix’s push to champion emerging filmmakers in Korean cinema, following titles including “Love Untangled,” “20th Century Girl” and “Lost in Starlight.”\n\t\n\n\tThe title joins Netflix’s extensive Korean slate that was unveiled in January. \n",

    "body": "\n\tA spinoff of CBS and Dick Wolf‘s long-running drama series “FBI,” “CIA” follows an elite FBI/CIA fusion cell that investigates international plots, terrorist cells and geopolitical secrets. A generic police procedural, “CIA” isn’t mind-blowing. However, based on the show’s opener (critics received just one episode for review, which is an anomaly), the series will undoubtedly shift and expand, bringing in viewers who have rocked with “FBI” for the past eight seasons, and newcomers looking for an entry point into the franchise.\n\t\n\n\tThe series opener begins in present-day New York City, and follows CIA case officer Colin Glass (Tom Ellis), who receives a call that leads him to a crime scene. A towering and roguish agent who sees rules as mere suggestions, Colin isn’t pleased to see that the FBI has already been tipped off and is swarming around. He’s increasingly annoyed when his presence is questioned by Bill Goodman (Nick Gehlfuss), an FBI Special Agent, whose goody-two-shoes personality and straight-laced looks immediately scream Fed. Unfortunately, for the duo, Colin needs an FBI liaison to operate on U.S. soil. The CIA’s New York deputy chief, Nikki Reynard (Necar Zadegan), FBI Special Agent in Charge Isobel Castille (Alana de la Garza) and Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine (Jeremy Sisto) pair the men together to solve the case, but things don’t exactly go swimmingly.\n\n\n\tIt’s quite a challenge to evaluate a series in totality based on just one episode, but getting “CIA” to air has not been easy. According to a Variety report from the fall, there was drama behind the scenes: Production for “CIA” was initially pushed back, and then briefly paused, after actress Michael Michele left the show (she was supposed to portray the character that Zadegan now plays). After Michele parted ways with “CIA,” longtime “Law & Order: SVU” showrunner Warren Leight stepped down as showrunner — Leight had taken over the role from David Hudgins. “FBI” showrunner Mike Weiss finally stepped in once Leight exited. These changes moved the show to a midseason premiere rather than its original fall 2025 debut. With only the pilot available to screen, it will be interesting to see whether any pauses or shifts have affected the storytelling as the season progresses.  So far, “CIA” works well as an average New York City-set law-enforcement procedural. Perhaps that will be enough.\n\t\n\n\t“CIA” premieres Feb. 23 on CBS, with new episodes dropping weekly on Mondays.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire & Ash,” “Wicked: For Good” and “Zootopia 2” may have dominated the holiday box office, but they weren’t enough to lift AMC Theatres‘ quarterly earnings. The world’s largest exhibitor reported that revenues for the three-month period ending in December topped out at $1.28 billion, down 1.4% from the $1.3 billion it recorded a year earlier. More troubling, attendance dropped nearly 10% as the collection of year-end blockbusters failed to pack ’em in at the same rate. AMC hosted 56.3 million patrons compared to the 62.4 million it welcomed in the year-ago period. \n\t\n\n\tLosses did shrink for AMC. The company’s net loss was $127.4 million, compared to the $135.6 million in losses from a year earlier. It logged a diluted loss per-share of 25 cents, having reported a loss of 35 cents in the prior-year quarter. \n\n\n\tAMC’s food and beverage revenue hit $436.5 million, down slightly from the $446.2 million in concessions it sold in the same period in 2024. Admissions revenue came in at $701.6 million, a drop from the $721.4 million in ticket sales that AMC rang up in the year-ago quarter. \n\n\tDuring the quarter, AMC, which remains heavily leveraged, converted the majority of its equity investment in Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation, a gold and silver exploration company, into approximately $24.1 million in cash. It said the amount was “approximately equal” to the capital it initially invested in the transferred securities. \n\n\tAMC hosts its earnings call for investors and analysts on Tuesday. Adam Aron, its CEO, released a statement to accompany the earnings report in which he predicted that 2026’s lineup of potential blockbusters, which includes Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” and “Avengers: Doomsday,” will outgross the roster of 2025 hits. \n\t\n\n\t“AMC is exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on a recovering box office,” Aron said. “And as I have said many times before, the not-so-secret formula to a full box‑office recovery is straight forward, we need more great movies from our studio partners.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wednesday” Season 3 is officially in production, with the show bringing in four new additions to its cast. \n\n\tChris Sarandon (“Dog Day Afternoon,” “The Princess Bride”), Noah Taylor (“Peaky Blinders,” “Game Of Thrones”), Oscar Morgan (“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,” “Gotham Knights”), and Kennedy Moyer (“Task,” “Roofman”) are all set to appear in the hit show’s third season. The new castings come just after it was reported that Winona Ryder would be guest starring in Season 3, while it was previously reported that Eva Green would play Morticia Addams’ sister. \n\t\n\n\tTaylor previously worked with “Wednesday” director and executive producer Tim Burton on the film “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” while Sarandon voiced Jack Skellington in Burton’s “A Nightmare Before Christmas.” \n\n\n\t“It’s our dark delight to fling open Nevermore Academy’s gates once more as we begin production on Season Three,” series creators and showrunners Al Gough & Miles Millar said. “We thank our invincible cast and crew for their continued commitment to doom and gloom. To the fans, we appreciate your patience and ravenous online commentary – your twisted theories have inspired nightmares. This season we welcome new students, new teachers, and excavate some long-rotting Addams Family secrets. Don’t say you weren’t warned.”\n\n\tAs with past seasons, the third is being shot in Dublin, Ireland. Jenna Ortega will return in the role of Wednesday Addams, who viewers last saw riding off with her Uncle Fester (Fred Armisen) to attempt to rescue her friend and roommate Enid (Emma Myers) from being trapped as an alpha werewolf. \n\t\n\n\t“I’m so excited to be back for Season 3 and it’s great to be reunited with all of the original cast,” Burton said. “The addition of some dear friends and past collaborators of mine – Winona, Eva, Chris, Noah…makes this season extra special. I feel very lucky.”\n\n\tAside from Ortega, Myers, and Armisen, the cast of “Wednesday” includes: Hunter Doohan, Joy Sunday, Moosa Mostafa, Georgie Farmer, Isaac Ordonez, Billie Piper, Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo, Victor Dorobantu, Evie Templeton, with Luis Guzmán, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Joanna Lumley. \n\n\tThe show is based on characters created by Charles Addams. Gough, Millar, and Burton are all executive producers. MGM Television is the studio. \n\n\t“Wednesday” Season 2 was released in two parts in August and September 2025. Like the first season, the second went on to become a massive hit for Netflix, where it currently ranks as the streamer’s fifth most-watched English language season of TV ever. Season 1 is the most-watched season ever. \n\n\n\n",

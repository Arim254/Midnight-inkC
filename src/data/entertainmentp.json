    "body": "\n\tAfter launching a home-invasion franchise with the simple premise of three masked figures terrorizing a couple on the rocks, “The Strangers” creator Bryan Bertino has maintained his sensibility as a writer-director, spinning other original horror chamber pieces unmoored by sympathy. Now, the horror helmer’s latest effort shows characteristic daring in its detachment. \n\n\tGenerically titled “Vicious,” the film offers a spare setup — a depressed young woman is wracked by hallucinations — with little definition of what is afflicting her or why. The writer-director doesn’t solicit sympathy for Polly (played by Dakota Fanning) or impose meaning on her suffering. It’s a very naked approach to horror, entirely propped up on formal execution. In other words, he risks leaving the audience with nothing. And that comes to pass in “Vicious,” which trickles down to Paramount’s streaming service after being slashed from the studio’s theatrical slate.\n\t\n\n\tBertino finds an ample engine in Fanning, at least. The opening introduces her character aglow in red light, complemented by a narrated monologue, vaguely written but delivered as pure, possibly suicidal despair. It’s clear that something is eating away at her, and that impression sticks in proceeding scenes, with the holiday season shut-in Polly half-heartedly preparing for a job interview and calming down her concerned mother over the phone.\n\n\n\tThese early, somber moments cast a mood, but the film is eager to hold Polly’s feet to some fire. “Vicious” has the devoted attention for its lead that Roman Polanski’s domestic horror classics “Repulsion” and “Rosemary’s Baby” did, but Bertino has a more gung-ho gameplan. Instead of gradually boiling into insanity, the film hits fever pitch hallucinations right away and quickly exhausts itself attempting to keep pace. \n\t\n\n\tThe rubber meets the road when Polly receives a mysterious box from a bewitching, raspy old woman (Kathryn Hunter, the current go-to for that type of thing — and deservedly so). It comes with a ticking hourglass and a series of vague challenges: Give the box “something you hate, something you need, something you love.” It’s an instruction brimming with technicalities, forcing Polly to excavate her most personal traumas. It also leads to some sliced body parts and grimy-looking strangers, who tap Polly on the shoulder for a scare before disappearing.\n\n\tThat’s all disappointing, familiar horror imagery, but “Vicious” gets by on atmosphere for a good while before that. A crackling fireplace casts a dull pall over Polly’s living room, but it’s the only warmth in her stupendously cavernous home. The house appears to exist at the end of the universe, so much so that it comes as a surprise when Polly briefly dashes to a neighbor’s place seeking a lifeline. But when that stranger ends up possessed within minutes, stabbing herself in the face and sending Polly back out into the cold, it seems like no other development would’ve made more sense. There are no helping hands when the entire movie may or may not be unfolding inside someone’s head.\n\n\tThat credo reasserts itself as Polly begins to be haunted by visions of her loved ones. Bertino strictly withholds from elaborating on her personal history — a self-imposed limit that ultimately keeps the film from getting under the skin, but does serve to further emphasize Polly’s isolation. One memorable moment comes early, when another call between Polly and her mother tilts into dread as the voice on the phone morphs into a more callous, sinister being. It’s a trick that “Vicious” is smart to return to, with its scant side characters offering Polly brief warmth before revealing themselves as vessels for the demon haunting her. Fanning’s tensed, squirrelly performance comes to life in these spots, with Polly’s waning trust and fear of betrayal cluing into a wounded self-loathing that becomes the film’s best lasting impression.\n\n\tBut “Vicious” is mostly a numbing slog. Fanning flatlines when left to be a solo show as Bertino whacks her around like a pinball, hitting big, loud scares that seem to keep resetting. As Polly excavates the darkest parts of herself, the film can’t string together a build to match the depths of her soul-searching. The movie devolves into something inexact and thoughtless, without anything distinct to recenter it. It’s hardly a sin for cruelty to be the point, especially in horror. But you have to at least land your punches.\n\t\n\n\t“Vicious” is now streaming on Paramount+.\n"

    "body": "\n\tCANNES, France — “The future began 100 years ago,” proclaimed a three-minute clip shown at a Globo Showcase Cocktail on Sunday evening at Mipcom, chronicling the Brazilian communications giant’s evolution from newspaper, launched in 1925, to radio and Rede Globo TV network.\n\n\tThe welter of Globo international partnerships and deals confirmed on stage on Sunday at Cannes Carlton Hotel by Angela Colla, Globo Head of International Business and Co-productions, did much to suggest that for Globo the future is beginning again. \n\t\n\n\tA country the size of a continent, Brazil’s battle this century has been to reach out to the rest of the world and Globo’s challenge to consolidate the broadening of its portfolio from telenovelas –  while ensuring that they continue to travel – to other forms of entertainment and business models, joining the global mainstream. \n\n\n\tOne way to achieve that is format deals. “This year was key in marking our consolidation in the format sales business,” Colla said in Cannes. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Others\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Paulo Belote\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn one unannounced pact, Globoplay has pacted with Anonymous Content for a U.S. version of “The Others,” Colla announced. Created by Lucas Paraizo (“Under Pressure”) and charting the current build of intolerance, he has told Variety, “The Others” is set in a gated community in Rio’s suburbs where a scuffle between two teens escalates into a bloody confrontation between their parents. The format has already sold to Germany (ndF) and Greece (produced by Primavisione, broadcast by Alpha).\n\n\tIn further deals unveiled by Colla, partnering with Turkey’s Ay Yapim, Globo has seen revenge saga “Leyla,” the Turkish adaptation of telenovela phenomenon “Brazil Avenue,” go global, selling to date to more than 20 countries. \n\t\n\n\tGlobo has sold the format for “All the Flowers,” about a visually impaired perfumer’s battle for freedom and love, to Greece’s  Primavisione and Alpha. It has also clinched a format deal with Portugal’s SIC broadcast network on “Pages of Life,” a 2006 modern classic telenovela from Manoel Carlos. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the Flowers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Globo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGlobo’s Ron Leshem, Fox, BBC Studios Co-Productions\n\n\tAnother way to join the global conversation: international co-production with key “A” List creatives and companies. Announced just before the Showcase, via his prodco label Crossing Oceans, Ron Leshem, creator of the original “Euphoria,” will be joining forces with Koby Gal Raday and Ilda Santiago’s Janeiro Studios and Globoplay, the leading Brazilian streaming platform, to produce “Paranoia.” \n\n\tTo be co-developed by Leshem and Claudia Jouvin, who broke out this summer as head writer of Globoplay smash hit “Perfect Days,” “Paranoia” was described to Variety by its producers as “‘Black Swan’ and ‘Whiplash’ mixed with the feel-good vibes and payoffs of the ‘Queen’s Gambit’ and the generation-defining impact of ‘Euphoria.’”\n\n\tUnveiled on Saturday, Globo and Fox Entertainment Studios – the world’s leading producer of Christmas movies – announced they were partnering to develop and produce an original English-language Christmas movie set and filmed in Brazil. Aiming to ensure cultural authenticity, Globo will provide creative guidance to accurately reflect Brazilian culture and traditions, including the country’s unique celebration of Christmas, which takes place during Brazil’s summer.\n\n\tLate last week, BBC Studios and Brazilian Globo signed a landmark first co-production deal for a doc series that will “transport audiences to the heart” of Brazil’s sprawling Amazon rainforest.” The series, whose details are still being kept under wraps, will be produced by BBC Studios Specialist Factual Productions and Globo, with a story that innately comes from Brazil,” Janet Brown, president of Global Content Sales at BBC Studios, told Variety.\n\n\tAlex Medeiros, Globoplay Director of Drama, Documentaries and Films drilled down at the Showcase on other co-production arrangements: with Telemundo Studios, a first title to be announced shortly; with Beta Film, announced last year at Mipcom; with Fremantle on the series “Crime Inc,” and with Gaumont USA on “Deluxe,” about the rise and fall of Brazil’s high-fashion icon Eliana Tranchesi, which goes into production this week.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnything Goes\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew Globo Shows Catch Fire\n\n\tIn straight sales, Globo has licensed to top Argentine network Telefe both “All the Flowers” and “Xuxa, the Documentary,” on Brazil’s biggest pop star.\n\n\tIts trailer shown at the Showcase, Globoplay’s latest release, series “Perfect Days” – a stylish but rapidly unsettling abduction thriller chosen by Variety among its Must-See TV titles for Mipcom – has become the most-watched original series on Globoplay of any nationality since its premiere in the Summer, Colla announced, calling the Anonymous Content Brazil production “a thrilling series which still has an impact on me” and which “shows a different side of our audiovisual work.”\n\n\tA second Mipcom title, “Anything Goes,” a plush, fast-paced remake of one of Brazil’s biggest telenovela 1980s hits, hit a 56% audience share at the moment of the murder of the arch villainess, while the production is Globo’s top-grossing primetime telenovela in Brazil, with 16 brands, including BYD, Corona, Uber, Amazon, Paramount, and L’Oréal, participating in 76 branded content actions. \n\n\t“We are storytellers, and our greatest triumph is our commitment to quality and to representing the best of our people — happiness, hard work, creativity, strength, and optimism, among other core values,” Colla said at the Mipcom Showcase. \n\n\t“We always tell stories in a responsible way, stories that move and connect with all kinds of audiences,” she added. “And diversity is not only within the content or genres, such as telenovelas, series, or documentaries, but also in the business models, including finished content, scripted formats, unscripted formats, and co-productions.”\n\n\tMore to come.\n",

    "body": "\n\t15 years after working on Christopher Nolan’s “Inception,” actor Elliot Page spoke about reuniting with the Oscar-winning director for his historical epic “The Odyssey,” set to release in theaters in July 2026.\n\n\t“I was so excited to be thought of for [‘The Odyssey’] and to be asked to come back to work with him,” said Page during the “X-Men: Days of Future Past” panel at this year’s New York City Comic Con. “I loved working with him on ‘Inception’ and loved being a part of that movie. I was just completely jazzed and excited, and [I] basically went and met with Chris and talked about the part, then sat in a room and read the script. It was such a joy to come back.”\n\t\n\n\t“To come back now, as you can imagine, being more comfortable in yourself makes these sorts of projects more enjoyable,” Page added. “To get to have a Chris Nolan experience again now meant so much to me selfishly.”\n\n\n\tThe “X-Men: Days of Future Past” panel was moderated by “Happy Sad Confused” podcast host Josh Horowitz. It also featured James McAvoy, who previously played the role of Charles Xavier from 2011 to 2019. When asked about the potential reboot of the franchise with fancasted actors such as Colman Domingo and Bella Ramsey, McAvoy spoke about his excitement for a return to the world of Charles Xavier with a new ensemble cast.\n\n\t“Look, I’m [just] excited to see what happens next,” said McAvoy. “I was a fan before I was an employee. and I’ll be a fan again. Colman Domingo sounds amazing.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe first two movies directed by Bradley Cooper revealed a couple of key things about him. The most essential is that he’s a born filmmaker — not just a good one but a great one. The other thing they revealed is that Bradley Cooper, for all his searching intelligence and humanity, is a consummate creature of showbiz. His entrancing 2018 remake of “A Star Is Born” was steeped in the entertainment industry (arena rock, dance-pop videos, the Grammys), and part of the film’s power lay in the granular authenticity with which it portrayed those worlds. As for “Maestro,” Cooper’s haunting Leonard Bernstein biopic, it told the story of a classical musician who was baptized in the limelight; that he had to keep his private life offstage only threw the luminous sheen of his celebrity into higher relief.\n\t\n\n\tAfter those two visions of the high-maintenance inner lives of artist/entertainers, “Is This Thing On?,” Cooper’s third outing as a director (it premieres tonight at the New York Film Festival), comes off as a deliberately shaggy and casual change of pace. It’s a tale of marital separation and impending divorce, shot in an easy-flow voyeuristic hand-held style, and it’s about two people who are supposed to be ordinary enough to represent the lot of us.\n\n\n\tAlex and Tess Novak (Will Arnett and Laura Dern) have been married for 20 years. They live in a handsome old house in the New York suburbs, where they have two sons who are both 10 (they’re “Irish twins,” as Alex explains). Alex works “in finance,” which is as detailed a description of his job as we ever hear; we never once see him at work (which is strange for a character who’s in finance, given that work is pretty much all they do, but never mind). Tess is a stay-at-home mom, though with a high-powered past that looms large.\n\t\n\n\tThe film opens with the two of them trying to find the right moment to tell their boys that they’re separating. There is no right moment, and the early scenes are about fumbling steps and the tentativeness of awkward new roles. Alex moves into an apartment in the West Village — a sterile place that he barely gets around to furnishing, though as divorce crash pads go it doesn’t exactly look cheap. To mark his new life, Alex buys a blue-and-white VW van, shuttling back and forth between the city and the burbs; he also has his kids over to stay with him. The co-parenting seems to go reasonably smoothly, with a minimum of rancor.\n\n\tBut there’s a showbiz wild card at play. On his first night alone in the city, Alex is wandering around the Village and tries to get a drink at the Olive Tree Café, the fabled spot on MacDougal Street that’s attached to the Comedy Cellar (which is the floor below). There’s a $15 cover charge, which Alex doesn’t have the cash for, so to get in for free he agrees to do an open-mic comedy set. We in the audience roll with this in a way that goes down easy, though maybe a little too easy. Will Arnett, after all, is a comedian, and when Alex first gets up there, staring into the black void of an audience, we don’t really have the feeling that this is a “finance guy” who has suddenly stepped into the existential spotlight of stand-up. Looking confident and relaxed, he starts talking about his divorce predicament, and despite a silent stretch or two he gets off a few good lines about it. He glides into the stand-up zone without much fuss.\n\n\tThen again, the movie provides a context for that. At the club, Alex is surrounded by other stand-up comics, as he of course would be, but it’s not just “Oh, here’s what happens at a comedy club.” The other acts we see are all personal and confessional comics (played by real comedians like Jordan Jensen, Chloe Radcliffe, Reggie Conquest, and Dave Attell), who draw jokes out of spilling their lives out onstage. That this  has become the new normal in comedy is the legacy of many great stand-up artists, from Richard Pryor to Sarah Silverman, but it also says something about our therapeutic culture of too much information. Just as the rise of “American Idol” marked the transition into a world where everyone, it seemed (or, at least, a hell of a lot more people than there used to be), knew how to sing, “Is This Thing On?” unfolds in a society where the democratization of stand-up has spread the comedy impulse far and wide.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s now what people do. They get up in front of a crowd to make light of themselves, attack their exes and enemies, and turn their most intimate stories into laughter. And maybe that’s why “Is This Thing On?” doesn’t feel all that “inside” in its presentation of the stand-up-comedy world. It’s not nearly as incisive a view of what goes down in comedy clubs as the one conjured by Mike Birbiglia’s brilliant “Don’t Think Twice” (2016). Then again, Alex isn’t trying to “make it” as a stand-up. He’s using open-mic night for therapy, and he’s not bad at it — he’s just okay enough to generate some chuckles of recognition and avoid embarrassing himself.\n\n\tWe can certainly buy all this. Cooper, who wrote the script with Arnett and Mark Chappell, based the movie on the life of a British pharmaceutical rep named John Bishop whose marital-separation fling with stand-up was a story Will Arnett had heard about. But even though it doesn’t necessarily strain credibility, the stand-up-comedy plot of “Is This Thing On?” does turn a marriage story into a real-life showbiz fairy tale. Alex, his marriage having disintegrated, feels like he’s lost everything, and stand-up offers him a lifeline — a way to save himself, and maybe to save other things too.\n\n\tIt’s an observant, bittersweet, and highly watchable movie, yet there’s an inner softness to it, a slightly pandering quality. Will Arnett, who has the look and demeanor of a less energized Michael Keaton, is a likable enough actor in a rather mopey way, but he has done a lot of sitcom work, and it shows. In “Is This Thing On?,” Arnett seems, in essence, to be playing Alex as a sitcom dad — sharp-tongued yet benign, lost in his daze of self-interest, with an essential quality of harmlessness that’s the opposite of movie-star danger.\n\n\tLaura Dern, so brilliant as a divorce lawyer in “Marriage Story,” here invests Tess with a sharpness that never veers too far from sadness. We pick up on the idea that the separation has been driven by her, but Tess’s sense of regret hangs over the movie, especially when her backstory gets filled in: She was a member of the U.S. Olympic volleyball team (a star athlete — there’s that hint of showbiz rearing its head again), and she is now bent on getting back to her athletic roots by becoming a coach. She gets together with Laird (Peyton Manning), who can connect her to that world, and in one of those we-know-it’s-only-a-movie-but-come-on! coincidences, their drink, which morphs into a date, results in their heading over to a nearby comedy club…where Alex just happens to be performing! She hears his unfiltered portrait of their marital spats, and their sex life, compacted into one five-minute monologue. But that’s okay! It’s essentially the film’s version of couples therapy.\n\t\n\n\tCooper has unerring showbiz instincts. He surrounds Alex and Tess with friends and relatives — like Alex’s goofy second-rate stage-actor brother, Balls (played by Cooper with a cheesy grin under a variety of facial hair), and his wife, Christine (Andra Day), who expresses a great deal of righteous hostility toward men so that Tess doesn’t have to, along with some friends, played by the likes of Sean Hayes and Scott Icenogle, nattering in the background. As Alex’s parents, Christine Ebersole and Ciarán Hinds are the film’s crowd-pleasing billboard for what even a happy marriage is: affection and empathy, sure, but also two people who have agreed to tolerate more about each other than they don’t.\n\n\tThere are far worse things that a gifted filmmaker could offer an audience these days than a feel-good divorce comedy. Yet “Is This Thing On?” is a minor movie that cushions the agony of a marital split in ways that can feel like it’s cutting corners. Alex and Tess are well-off enough to have a very posh separation, their disconnect hinges more on misunderstanding than anger, and while Alex is supposed to be moonlighting as a comic, the truth is he hardly seems to do anything but stand-up comedy. In a funny way, the film treats even marriage as a form of showbiz. It says that once the demons have been acknowledged, the show must go on.\n"

    "body": "\n\tAmazon Prime Video has released the first teaser for the upcoming “Invincible” Season 4, set to premiere in March 2026, out of New York Comic Con. One of the comic book series’ most dangerous villains has also been cast: Lee Pace will voice the evil Viltrumite Thragg.\n\n\t“Invincible” Season 3 aired its eight episodes in February 2025 and picked up an early Season 5 renewal in July at San Diego Comic Con. It was also revealed that Matthew Rhys is voicing an unknown character in Season 4. \n\t\n\n\tAfter a nearly three-year break between the show’s first two outings (plus an unpopular mid-season break in the sophomore season), Season 3 was a return to form for the show and thrilled fans with its ultra-violent superhero action and compelling comic book storylines.\n\n\n\tSeason 3 ended on several cliffhangers for Steven Yeun’s Mark Grayson, aka Invincible. He survived the Invincible War, where universe-hopping villain Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) recruited an army of Invincibles from alternate dimensions to wage war on Earth. The prime Invincible saved the day, but Rex Splode (Jason Mantzoukas) died and several heroes were gravely injured. Angstrom Levy is also revealed to have survived by teleporting to another universe.\n\n\tJust as the world is rebuilding, a deranged Viltrumite named Conquest (voiced by Yeun’s former “Walking Dead” co-star Jeffrey Dean Morgan) arrives on Earth to survey Invincible’s not-yet-started takeover of Earth. The two have a ferocious battle, with Mark’s girlfriend Atom Eve (Gillian Jacobs) getting caught in the crossfire. Just when it seems like Conquest struck a fatal blow to both Eve and Invincible, Eve’s powers rebuild her body and she incapacitates the evil Viltrumite. With Conquest defeated, Invincible reveals that he’s going to take a more pro-killing stance on taking down his villains. There’s also an alien Sequid army slowly forming, Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) is secretly keeping Conquest incarcerated, the battle-hungry Battle Beast is alive and the demonic detective Damien Darkblood is summoning a hellish monster to fight Invincible.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the Season 4 teaser below.\n\n\n\n"

Hull will have complete access to Abbey Road as his creative playground and studio home in the UK, as well as its collection of vintage gear, microphones and instruments, and future tech including Audiomovers. He will also consult on the studios’ music tech and innovation work.\n\t\n\n\tPart of his new position will also include active participation in Abbey Road’s free education programs for the next generation of artists and producers. This includes Abbey Road “Amplify,” which is expanding to Manchester for the first time this year for a series of panels and studio workshops.\n\n\n\tIn addition to Kid Harpoon, the likes of Everything Everything, Fraser T Smith, Rosie Danvers and Rich Turvey are all confirmed to take part in Amplify, with more artists and industry experts to be confirmed in the coming weeks.\n\n\tHull said: “I’m beyond excited to become Producer in Residence at Abbey Road. In this position, I’m hoping to use my experience to help guide some of the incredible up-and-coming talent we have in the UK while they navigate their way through what can be a difficult industry. Mark and the team have a real desire to give back and develop new talent, which is something I’m really passionate about.

He’s already part of our modern history, having first worked here in 2011 with Florence + The Machine, and we have long admired his impact on the global stage – with highly creative production skills and an ability to craft melodies that intoxicate and move the world. Tom’s experience, know-how and generosity are already fueling and informing our work as we enhance the gear and instruments in our smaller rooms. And we’ll combine forces to create new opportunities for the next generation of artists, producers and creatives, so I’m super excited by the possibilities with Tom as we write the next chapter in the Abbey Road story.”\n\n\t+ Complex and Verzuz have announced a partnership to relaunch the music series. Combining Verzuz’s epic music matchups with Complex’s immersive storytelling and live events, this next chapter of the viral music battle series will leverage Complex’s expansive audience and authoritative voice in youth culture to propel the show further, elevate artists and cement it as a cultural force.\n\n\tAs part of the partnership, Complex will receive exclusive distribution rights of Verzuz, integrating the hit series throughout the media juggernaut’s ecosystem of content, commerce and live events.\n\n\t“Rather than talking so much, we just want to get to the action,” said Swizz Beatz and Timbaland.\n\n\tThe partnership officially kicks off at ComplexCon Las Vegas on Oct. 25 with a highly anticipated live match-up of Cash Money and No Limit going head to head.

The series, titled “50 Years From Home,” will combine new music and catalog tracks that complement each EP’s theme. The first EP, “50 Years From Home: I Gave You Everything I Had,” is set for release on October 17 and will include the recent single, “Go Rest High on That Mountain.”\n\n\tAccording to the announcement, Gill has amassed 1.7 billion global streams and 19.4 million in domestic album sales.

The announcement comes in the wake of Spotify reaching direct publishing agreements with all three major labels – Universal and Warner earlier this year and Sony in September – as well as a recent deal with Kobalt that covers the U.S. market.\n\n\t+ The National Independent Talent Organization (NITO) and Sweet Relief Musicians have unveiled a wide-ranging auction of instruments and memorabilia from such artists as Ringo Starr, Bonnie Raitt, the Eagles, Metallica’s James Hetfield, Jason Isbell, Def Leppard and more. Proceeds from the auction, which runs Oct. 8-22, will benefit NITO and Sweet Relief.\n\t\n\n\t“We want to thank all these amazing artists who have donated their time and instruments to this auction, the funds will be going to two great organizations pushing for a healthier music industry for everyone,” NITO executive director Nathaniel Marro said in a statement.\n\n\tNITO is an advocacy organization that focuses on issues such as the reforming of ticket regulations, performance rights organizations, artist visa programs and radio royalties.\n\n\tSweet Relief Musicians is a 501(c)(3)-designated charity that provides grants to musicians and industry professionals for basic expenses like insurance premiums, prescriptions and other medical treatments as well as housing and food costs.\n\n\t+ Warner Chappell Music, the publishing arm of Warner Music Group, on Wednesday announced a new global deal for publishing with Rico o Muerto, an independent label in Mexico co-founded last year by the artist Oscar Maydon and songwriter/manager Alexis “Chachito” Fierro. The label was helped to launch under the guidance of music-industry polymath Yusim Aladro.\n\n\t“I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know Chachito and Oscar Maydon, and it’s clear that beyond being gifted songwriters – and in Oscar’s case, a super talented artist – they have a remarkable instinct for discovering and developing promising talent,” said Gustavo Menéndez, Warner Chappell’s president of U.S. Latin and Latin America, in a statement.\n\n\tRico o Muerto recently became, in partnership with Downtown Artist and Label Services, the home of rising songwriter Víctor Mendívil, who has previously worked with Yng Lvcas, Ganggy and El Padrinito Toys.\n\n\t+ After being acquired earlier this year by Gebbia Media, Big Machine Label Group’s rock-focused imprint, Big Machine Rock, declared Wednesday that it has entered a “new era.”\n\n\tThe label has announced a revivified leadership team as part of its refresh, the topline of which is now: general manager Heather Luke, SVP of promotion Allison Smith, VP of digital strategy Brooke Nixon and project manager Tara Curran.\n\n\tIt also announced a live event series, titled “Off The Record with Big Machine Rock,” to launch Oct. 15 in Chicago and featuring Ryan Perdz. The first release under its new regime will be a new live album from Sammy Hagar, titled “Sammy Hagar & the Best of All Worlds Band – The Residency.”\n\t\n\n\t“We are thrilled to be a part of the next chapter of Big Machine Rock,” Greg Murphy, executive vice president at Gebbia Media, said in a statement.\n\n\tMonday, October 6\n\n\tHybe America has announced the launch of Hybe Label Services (HSL), the company’s first global organization specifically designed to bolster the growth of its artists in international markets.

    "body": "\n\t“Shogun” star Anna Sawai and “The White Lotus” breakout Aimee Lou Wood are circling the roles of Yoko Ono and Pattie Boyd in the upcoming four-part “Beatles” biopic by director Sam Mendes, Variety has confirmed.\n\n\tOno, an artist and singer-songwriter, is the widow of John Lennon and one of his biggest creative influences. Sawai would star alongside Harrison Dickinson as Lennon, who was married to Ono from 1969 until his death in 1980. Lennon was shot and killed by a deranged fan outside of their Upper West Side apartment building, the Dakota.\n\t\n\n\tBoyd, a model, met George Harrison (who will be played by Joseph Quinn) when she was 19 on the set of the Beatles 1964 feature “A Hard Day’s Night,” and became a sensation in her own right in 1960s swinging London. They married in 1966; after the Beatles broke up in 1970, their marriage began to deteriorate, and they ultimately divorced in 1977. She was subsequently married to Eric Clapton from 1979 to 1989. On Oct. 10, she posted to social media that the prospect of Wood playing her was “big news” and she was “looking forward (hoping) to meet” the actor “at some point in the future.”\n\n\n\tThe deals for Sawai and Wood are not signed, however, and it’s not certain they will be cast. A representative of Sony Pictures had no comment.\n\n\tAs for the rest of the Fab Four, Paul Mescal is playing Paul McCartney and Barry Keoghan will star as Ringo Starr. Saoirse Ronan has been cast as McCartney’s first wife, Linda, who also performed in his post-Beatles band, Wings; Mia McKenna-Bruce is set to play Starr’s first wife, Maureen Starkey.\n\t\n\n\tMendes is making four separate movies, one from each Beatles member’s point of view. They will intersect to capture the band’s improbable journey from Liverpool to the center of global culture, leading to their 1970 breakup. The tagline, in other words, is “Each man has his own story, but together they are legendary.” All four installments will debut on the big screen in April 2028 in what Sony Pictures is dubbing the “first binge-able theatrical experience.” The exact release timeline is unclear.\n\n\tMcCartney, Starr, and the families of the late Lennon and Harrison have granted full life story and music rights for the scripted films, making these the first features sanctioned by the band.\n\n\t“I’m honored to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies,” Mendes said when the project was announced earlier in 2025.\n\n\tSawai, 33, rose to fame in Japan as a singer in the girl group Faky before breaking through internationally on the Apple TV+ series “Pachinko.” She scored an Emmy for the series “Shogun,” making her the first Japanese actress to win for lead actress. Sawai will also appear onscreen in director David Leitch’s heist film “How to Rob a Bank” and the Jeremy Allen White and Austin Butler-led crime drama “Enemies.” \n\n\tWood, 31, first starred in the Netflix teen dramedy “Sex Education” over four seasons from 2019 to 2023.  She’s also appeared opposite Bill Nighy in the 2022 film “Living,” and she earned her first Emmy nomination in 2025 for her role in the third season of HBO’s “The White Lotus.”\n\n\tAlex Ritman contributed to this report.\n"

    "body": "\n\tWhen director Simon Stone first read the script for Netflix‘s latest psychological thriller “The Woman in Cabin 10,” it was as if he was transported back in time.\n\n\t“I was really intrigued by how much it felt like it came from an era of movies that we don’t really do anymore,” Stone tells Variety of the film, which is based on Ruth Ware’s 2016 novel of the same name. “The script itself is very Hitchcockian — it’s of a period of thrillers that were made the last time the world went crazy politically, post-Watergate.”\n\t\n\n\tOut on Netflix now, “The Woman in Cabin 10” follows Lo Blacklock, an investigative journalist aboard a mysterious billionaire’s luxury cruise ship who is convinced she saw a passenger being thrown overboard. As Lo gets closer and closer to the truth, paranoia seeps in while everyone else on the ship tells her she is losing her mind. The tense film is anchored by none other than Keira Knightley, who delivers a layered performance as a woman refusing to back down in the face of injustice.\n\n\n\tAuthor Ware was shocked when she found out Knightley was attached to the project, but says the Oscar nominee really got to “the heart of Lo’s character.”\n\n\t“On the one hand she’s got a fragility, a sort of vulnerability, and on the other she’s got a real inner strength — a core of steel and an unshakeable sense of what is right. I think Keira nails that,” Ware says.\n\n\tTo prepare, Stone asked Knightley to watch a series of iconic thrillers: Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Conversation,” starring Gene Hackman; “The Parallax View” with Warren Beatty; and the Robert Redford films “All the President’s Men” and “Three Days of the Condor.” Knightley, who has been on a run with the genre lately thanks to her hit Netflix series “Black Doves,” was eager to take on another edge-of-your-seat project.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m a big fan of the thriller genre, I love it, and all of those films that he mentioned have been films that I’ve just loved,” Knightley says. “So the opportunity to play that lead character — that is normally a man — was just one that I thought, ‘Oh God, this is exciting.’ You wouldn’t necessarily look at me and think Gene Hackman type, you know?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKeira Knightley and David Ajala in “The Woman in Cabin 10.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParisa Taghizadeh/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tKnightley says she took inspiration from the “calm” performances of Hackman, Redford and Beatty, while at the same time making it her own by dialing up the paranoia. “You were like, ‘Warren Beatty does nothing in ‘Parallax View,'” Stone recalls with a chuckle. “And I said, ‘Well maybe give me a little bit more than that.’ And Keira finds this extraordinary nuance.” \n\n\t“It’s a relaxed, cool path that they choose, which is super interesting when you’re dealing with tension. That’s basically what a thriller is — it’s how you serve that kind of tension,” Knightley adds. “There’s a leaning against a wall or constantly chewing or constantly thinking and watching everybody else, but actually the action is happening with everybody around them.”\n\n\tGuy Pearce convincingly portrays the billionaire in question, Richard Bullmer, while Knightley’s Lo is aided in her search for the truth by her photographer ex-boyfriend Ben, played by David Ajala. \n\n\t“The one thing I really enjoyed about this story is how claustrophobic it felt and intense, in the right way,” Ajala says. “There was a good thrilling energy to it, if captured correctly on camera. And I don’t mind being involved in a whodunit murder mystery because then we all become armchair detectives trying to figure out who it is.”\n\n\tThe character of Bullmer marks yet another shady figure in the repertoire of Pearce, who scored an Oscar nomination last year for his haunting performance as another filthy rich and ill-intentioned man in Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGuy Pearce in “The Woman in Cabin 10.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParisa Taghizadeh/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPearce says that he finds himself drawn to “characters that have internal darkness and things that they’re dealing with themself because it’s just interesting stuff to play.” \n\n\t“More so than playing a romantic lead,” he adds. “I’m not very good at that stuff anyway… but yeah, I gotta be careful not to be typecast.”\n\t\n\n\tPearce will next star in Ridley Scott’s post-apocalyptic sci-fi film “The Dog Stars,” while Knightley is set to deliver a second season of “Black Doves” for Netflix. Also in the works at the streamer is a new series adaptation of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice,” a text that Knightley is more than familiar with, having starred in the beloved 2005 film alongside Matthew Macfadyen.\n\n\tAsked if she has any advice for the new cast — led by Emma Corrin as Elizabeth Bennet and Jack Lowden as Mr. Darcy — Knightley says with a smile: “I can’t wait to see it. I mean look, you don’t need words of advice. With that cast, it’s a no-brainer. That cast, that book, what could go wrong? It’s going to be amazing.”\n"

    "body": "\n\tKen Aymong, one of a handful of key lieutenants to executive producer Lorne Michaels at NBC‘s “Saturday Night Live,” made surprise cameos on the program’s latest two episodes — in the credits.\n\n\tAymong, who retired from “SNL” in 2021 after joining the venerable program in the mid-1980’s, has returned to the show as a supervising producer for the show’s current 51st season, according to a person familiar with the matter. His name scrolled by during the show’s credits early Sunday morning as it closed out its second episode, and last week as well. Details on what spurred him to return to the fold could not immediately be learned, but Aymong had been brought back to help out with some of the landmark events in “SNL“‘s 50th season, which included a massive concert at Radio City Music Hall.\n\t\n\n\tAymong has long been known not for booking guest hosts or writing celebrated sketches, but for something perhaps more important: maintaining the business of the TV institution. ““I always look at the financial perspective of the show,” Aymong said in “Live From New York,” an oral history of the program by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller. “I want it to go on forever.”\n\n\n\tNBC declined to make producers available for comment. LateNighter previously reported on Aymong’s return to “SNL.”\n\n\tAymong’s return comes as “SNL” has been giving new duties to some of Michaels’ top deputies. Erin Doyle, a longtime producer, was elevated at the start of the season to the top echelon of senior staff. Erik Kenward, another member of that circle, has taken on head-writer duties this season with a band of other “SNL” veterans. Michaels, who turned 80 in November of last year, has given no signal that he wants to step back from the show he has managed and influenced for nearly half a century, but has given some indications that others will take up day-to-day duties he might once have done himself.\n\t\n\n\tMichaels has developed a coterie of key aides over the years. In addition to Aymong, Doyle and Kenward, they also include Steve Higgins, another top producer who also works on NBC’s “Tonight Show” and Mike Shoemaker, a former “SNL” producer who currently runs “Late Night with Seth Meyers” behind the scenes. Others in the past have included Lindsay Shookus and Marci Klein, both of whom are no longer with the show. Aymong’s duties aren’t the glitziest, but are quite crucial as “SNL” manages its production budget for special effects, set design, and many other elements that help the show stand up under intense linear, streaming and social-media scrutiny week after week.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe first two movies directed by Bradley Cooper revealed a couple of key things about him. The most essential is that he’s a born filmmaker — not just a good one but a great one. The other thing they revealed is that Bradley Cooper, for all his searching intelligence and humanity, is a consummate creature of showbiz. His entrancing 2018 remake of “A Star Is Born” was steeped in the entertainment industry (arena rock, dance-pop videos, the Grammys), and part of the film’s power lay in the granular authenticity with which it portrayed those worlds. As for “Maestro,” Cooper’s haunting Leonard Bernstein biopic, it told the story of a classical musician who was baptized in the limelight; that he had to keep his private life offstage only threw the luminous sheen of his celebrity into higher relief.\n\t\n\n\tAfter those two visions of the high-maintenance inner lives of artist/entertainers, “Is This Thing On?,” Cooper’s third outing as a director (it premieres tonight at the New York Film Festival), comes off as a deliberately shaggy and casual change of pace. It’s a tale of marital separation and impending divorce, shot in an easy-flow voyeuristic hand-held style, and it’s about two people who are supposed to be ordinary enough to represent the lot of us.\n\n\n\tAlex and Tess Novak (Will Arnett and Laura Dern) have been married for 20 years. They live in a handsome old house in the New York suburbs, where they have two sons who are both 10 (they’re “Irish twins,” as Alex explains). Alex works “in finance,” which is as detailed a description of his job as we ever hear; we never once see him at work (which is strange for a character who’s in finance, given that work is pretty much all they do, but never mind). Tess is a stay-at-home mom, though with a high-powered past that looms large.\n\t\n\n\tThe film opens with the two of them trying to find the right moment to tell their boys that they’re separating. There is no right moment, and the early scenes are about fumbling steps and the tentativeness of awkward new roles. Alex moves into an apartment in the West Village — a sterile place that he barely gets around to furnishing, though as divorce crash pads go it doesn’t exactly look cheap. To mark his new life, Alex buys a blue-and-white VW van, shuttling back and forth between the city and the burbs; he also has his kids over to stay with him. The co-parenting seems to go reasonably smoothly, with a minimum of rancor.\n\n\tBut there’s a showbiz wild card at play. On his first night alone in the city, Alex is wandering around the Village and tries to get a drink at the Olive Tree Café, the fabled spot on MacDougal Street that’s attached to the Comedy Cellar (which is the floor below). There’s a $15 cover charge, which Alex doesn’t have the cash for, so to get in for free he agrees to do an open-mic comedy set. We in the audience roll with this in a way that goes down easy, though maybe a little too easy. Will Arnett, after all, is a comedian, and when Alex first gets up there, staring into the black void of an audience, we don’t really have the feeling that this is a “finance guy” who has suddenly stepped into the existential spotlight of stand-up. Looking confident and relaxed, he starts talking about his divorce predicament, and despite a silent stretch or two he gets off a few good lines about it. He glides into the stand-up zone without much fuss.\n\n\tThen again, the movie provides a context for that. At the club, Alex is surrounded by other stand-up comics, as he of course would be, but it’s not just “Oh, here’s what happens at a comedy club.” The other acts we see are all personal and confessional comics (played by real comedians like Jordan Jensen, Chloe Radcliffe, Reggie Conquest, and Dave Attell), who draw jokes out of spilling their lives out onstage. That this  has become the new normal in comedy is the legacy of many great stand-up artists, from Richard Pryor to Sarah Silverman, but it also says something about our therapeutic culture of too much information. Just as the rise of “American Idol” marked the transition into a world where everyone, it seemed (or, at least, a hell of a lot more people than there used to be), knew how to sing, “Is This Thing On?” unfolds in a society where the democratization of stand-up has spread the comedy impulse far and wide.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s now what people do. They get up in front of a crowd to make light of themselves, attack their exes and enemies, and turn their most intimate stories into laughter. And maybe that’s why “Is This Thing On?” doesn’t feel all that “inside” in its presentation of the stand-up-comedy world. It’s not nearly as incisive a view of what goes down in comedy clubs as the one conjured by Mike Birbiglia’s brilliant “Don’t Think Twice” (2016). Then again, Alex isn’t trying to “make it” as a stand-up. He’s using open-mic night for therapy, and he’s not bad at it — he’s just okay enough to generate some chuckles of recognition and avoid embarrassing himself.\n\n\tWe can certainly buy all this. Cooper, who wrote the script with Arnett and Mark Chappell, based the movie on the life of a British pharmaceutical rep named John Bishop whose marital-separation fling with stand-up was a story Will Arnett had heard about. But even though it doesn’t necessarily strain credibility, the stand-up-comedy plot of “Is This Thing On?” does turn a marriage story into a real-life showbiz fairy tale. Alex, his marriage having disintegrated, feels like he’s lost everything, and stand-up offers him a lifeline — a way to save himself, and maybe to save other things too.\n\n\tIt’s an observant, bittersweet, and highly watchable movie, yet there’s an inner softness to it, a slightly pandering quality. Will Arnett, who has the look and demeanor of a less energized Michael Keaton, is a likable enough actor in a rather mopey way, but he has done a lot of sitcom work, and it shows. In “Is This Thing On?,” Arnett seems, in essence, to be playing Alex as a sitcom dad — sharp-tongued yet benign, lost in his daze of self-interest, with an essential quality of harmlessness that’s the opposite of movie-star danger.\n\n\tLaura Dern, so brilliant as a divorce lawyer in “Marriage Story,” here invests Tess with a sharpness that never veers too far from sadness. We pick up on the idea that the separation has been driven by her, but Tess’s sense of regret hangs over the movie, especially when her backstory gets filled in: She was a member of the U.S. Olympic volleyball team (a star athlete — there’s that hint of showbiz rearing its head again), and she is now bent on getting back to her athletic roots by becoming a coach. She gets together with Laird (Peyton Manning), who can connect her to that world, and in one of those we-know-it’s-only-a-movie-but-come-on! coincidences, their drink, which morphs into a date, results in their heading over to a nearby comedy club…where Alex just happens to be performing! She hears his unfiltered portrait of their marital spats, and their sex life, compacted into one five-minute monologue. But that’s okay! It’s essentially the film’s version of couples therapy.\n\t\n\n\tCooper has unerring showbiz instincts. He surrounds Alex and Tess with friends and relatives — like Alex’s goofy second-rate stage-actor brother, Balls (played by Cooper with a cheesy grin under a variety of facial hair), and his wife, Christine (Andra Day), who expresses a great deal of righteous hostility toward men so that Tess doesn’t have to, along with some friends, played by the likes of Sean Hayes and Scott Icenogle, nattering in the background. As Alex’s parents, Christine Ebersole and Ciarán Hinds are the film’s crowd-pleasing billboard for what even a happy marriage is: affection and empathy, sure, but also two people who have agreed to tolerate more about each other than they don’t.\n\n\tThere are far worse things that a gifted filmmaker could offer an audience these days than a feel-good divorce comedy. Yet “Is This Thing On?” is a minor movie that cushions the agony of a marital split in ways that can feel like it’s cutting corners. Alex and Tess are well-off enough to have a very posh separation, their disconnect hinges more on misunderstanding than anger, and while Alex is supposed to be moonlighting as a comic, the truth is he hardly seems to do anything but stand-up comedy. In a funny way, the film treats even marriage as a form of showbiz. It says that once the demons have been acknowledged, the show must go on.\n"

County Sheriff's Department claiming that after a night of drinking with Barrett, she woke up in bed to find him touching her and alleged he then had sex with her against her will.\n      \n\n          At the time, our law enforcement sources told us the woman told deputies she and Barrett had been friends for several months and that the evening began with drinks in Los Angeles before they went back to his place, where she alleged the incident occurred.\n      \n    \n          After filing her report, the woman underwent a sexual assault exam, and the LASD Special Victims Bureau took over the investigation.\n      \n    \n          Now, prosecutors say the evidence did not support criminal charges, and the case has been closed.\n      \n    \n          A rep for Barrett had no comment.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          "

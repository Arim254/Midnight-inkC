    "body": "\n\tSix years ago, a low-quality web animation on Muslim Kids TV sparked an idea that would become “Time Hoppers: The Silk Road,” the first theatrically released animated feature made by and for the Muslim community.\n\n\tThe film opens Feb. 7 in over 660 U.S. theaters, marking a milestone for family entertainment and grassroots productions, demonstrating that independent animation can still draw audiences at a time when theatrical releases for the genre face significant challenges.\n\t\n\n\tThe animated feature follows four gifted children from the year 2050 who discover the ability to time travel and must protect history’s greatest scientists from an evil alchemist threatening the future of modern science along the ancient Silk Road.\n\n\n\tGabriel Milo, COO of Milo Productions, said the time-travel concept, in which children meet historical figures, first gained traction as a mobile game funded through Canadian production grants. Within three months, it surpassed 100,000 downloads, signaling strong demand for Muslim-centered content.\n\n\t“For the first time, Muslim children will be able to see themselves reflected on the big screen,” Milo said. “That was something we saw was missing, and we saw a real market opportunity.”\n\n\tEven as the industry trends away from theatrical releases, the filmmakers believed their audience craved a communal viewing experience. Early social media engagement reinforced that instinct, with requests pouring in from communities around the world.\n\n\tRather than rely on celebrity endorsements, the marketing strategy emphasized what Milo called “community credibility over celebrity.” Community leaders, educators and religious scholars were cast in voice roles, including the character Dean Hafsa. That trust-based approach extended to a nationwide network of volunteer “local champions,” who used promotional toolkits to drive ticket sales in their regions.\n\t\n\n\tShannah Miller, vice president of marketing at distributor Fathom Entertainment, recognized the model’s potential early on. Fathom, which handles roughly 100 specialty releases each year, saw “Time Hoppers” as an opportunity to expand beyond its core faith-based audience, which accounted for nearly half of the company’s revenue last year.\n\n\t“This was a first,” Miller said. “The content was created by the Muslim community for the Muslim community, and it felt authentic, while still being accessible to a broader audience.”\n\n\tThe partnership between Milo Productions and Fathom proved critical to the film’s rollout. Milo provided data on community demographics and priority markets, while Fathom leveraged its exhibitor relationships to expand bookings and add showtimes as demand grew — sometimes within hours.\n\n\t“We’d email Fathom, and within an hour the tickets were live,” Milo said.\n\n\tOriginally scheduled at 516 locations for Feb. 7-8, exhibitor demand quickly pushed the release past 660 theaters, with pre-sales outpacing expectations. More than 35,000 tickets have been sold — nearly $500,000 in revenue — with the majority of purchases still expected in the final days before release.\n\n\t“We’re up more than 35% in pre-sales since Monday,” Miller said. “And historically, 70% of tickets sell in the last 72 to 48 hours.”\n\n\tFor a one-day event built around new IP and an underserved audience, the film’s performance is notable. Its “edutainment” approach is designed to spark curiosity rather than deliver formal lessons, supported by companion workbooks and coloring books developed with historians.\n\n\t“Our goal is intrigue,” Milo said. “We want kids to ask questions and want to learn more.” Beyond box office numbers, the release reflects the potential for original stories from underrepresented communities to connect with audiences, even as Hollywood relies heavily on established IP.\n\n\t“Underserved audiences will show up,” Milo said. “They’ll show up for authentic voices that represent them.” While rooted in Muslim history and culture, the film’s broader themes of education, curiosity and pride in heritage have encouraged the community to welcome wider audiences. Fathom supported that outreach with targeted trailer placement and partnerships with exhibitors, including educational tie-ins for school groups.\n\t\n\n\tThe model is already translating overseas. In Canada, bookings grew from 15 to nearly 40 Landmark Cinemas locations, covering more than 90% of the exhibitor’s footprint. As “Time Hoppers: The Silk Road” heads into theaters, it arrives amid a rising appetite for animation and stories outside traditional studio formulas. For Milo and Miller, the takeaway is clear: there’s an audience eager for representation, and when approached authentically, they’ll turn out in force.\n\n\t“This is genuine support,” Miller said. “People are excited to see themselves on screen, and that’s powerful.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTim Ellis is the CMO for the force behind America’s annual marketing Olympics: the Super Bowl.\n\n\tThe NFL’s executive VP and chief marketing officer is heading toward the summit of the league’s season as the Seattle Seahawks take on the New England Patriots at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The NFL heads in to Super Bowl LX with the NFL on a regular-season roll: viewership for regular-season games climbed an average of 10% in the 2025 season.\n\t\n\n\tEllis joined the National Football League from video game giant Activision in 2018. 2026 marks a high watermark for what he calls the “helmets off” strategy of highlighting football’s superstar players as well as showcasing its ever-changing roster of new recruits and rising stars. The rebound of the past 10 years follows a rough period for the league with players embroiled in criminal headlines and the league’s tone-deaf response to Colin Kaepernick’s civil rights protests.\n\n\n\t“We’ve never had a bigger fan base,” Ellis told Variety.\n\n\tHere, Ellis explains how and why pro football made a conscious effort to widen its all-American tent to include women, people of color, casual fans and international viewers — and make the sport more valuable to marketers. He addresses why the league was eager to recruit Bad Bunny for the Halftime Show, and why the NFL has stood by Puerto Rican superstar despite pushback from some quarters.\n\n\tWhat in your view accounts for the big viewership gains this past season?\n\n\tIt is a combination of an excellent product, meaning the quality of the game has never been better or more exciting, as well as us over the last several years working hard to expand our audience And to connect our brand with modern youth culture. So I think, as it relates to the game itself the closeness of the competition, the fantastic finishes, the riveting comebacks, all of these have just thrilled audiences the entire season. Some facts which are just kind of mind blowing. Seventy-three games were decided by three points or fewer season. Sixty-two games there was a winning score in the final two minutes. And then if you look at the competitive balance, it really led to unpredictability. And in the sports world, that’s actually a good thing. It fuels excitement.\n\t\n\n\tThere were three teams that won their division titles after finishing last the year before in their division. So if you’re a fan, that just gives you that knowledge and that excitement and that anticipation that anything can happen.\n\n\tWhat made the NFL want to invest in broadening its fanbase from the hardcore football lover? Why were you recruited in 2018 from Activision?\n\n\tWe’ve never had a bigger fan base. We now have over 200 million fans in this country — three-fourths of the country are fans of the NFL. My mission here was to restore how the league shows up in the world. You know, obviously, particularly in the U.S., but increasingly so in the rest of the world. My mantra was how do we open our arms wider to bring more people into the NFL, and how do we make the NFL more human, more inclusive and more deeply connected to the fans? So I created a strategy called the “helmets off” strategy, which was really to get the helmets off the players, to humanize the players and to lean into their passions, and really show a more open, more accessible, more compassionate face to the league. That’s helped us not only appeal to a lot of more casual audiences, girls and women, people of color, LGBTQ. That really helped us connect with those audiences and bring them in.\n\n\tWas this initiative a hard sell to league officials and team owners? \n\n\tI just sort of laid out a plan. This is how we need to move forward. We need to reduce the tension that fans can feel right amongst the sort of the league and the players. And we need to just focus on the on our roots, where the values are the NFL, and begin to modernize right? So on the one hand, we’re going to put the players in the forefront and have them be the face of the League, which again humanizes the league, but it also gave us a chance to feature in a very emotional way the things that these players really cared about, right? And it allowed them to be very vulnerable and open and connect with people in a very different way.\n\n\tTo connect with with Gen Z, we focused on the things that the players loved around entertainment, like music, fashion and gaming. You may have noticed that we now, for example, we’re the only sports league that has a fashion editor, Kyle Smith, and he’s part of our marketing team. We brought that in. We have a lot of things that we’re doing to build that up. We have deep connections with all of our gaming partners, and then also a lot of the biggest creators in the world around gaming. We partner with them and bring them in. It took us years to really develop those partnerships and to earn the trust of these folks who really help us exponentially connect with fans in the US and around the world. Two of the biggest ones, IShowSpeed who has over 100 million followers, and then MrBeast — he’s massive now. We partnered with him early on. He had his first Super Bowl commercial with the NFL as an example. This year, our first game was streamed out of Brazil, and [MrBeast] was in charge of the NFL for a day in Brazil that first game this year. So we did lots of things with him and with some others, and we were earned their trust. We earned their partnership, and that’s really helped us see the world in a very different way. It’s helped us connect and build relationships and connect with our youth and important casual audiences.\n\t\n\n\tA number of people have pointed out the flag football effect too, as the gentler form of football opens up youth competition to a wider range of players. Is that true in your experience?\n\n\tWe care about participation, and we want to make sure that we position flag as a legitimate sport. Then there’s no question about whether football was safe enough for young people to play because we’re offering not only tackle, but flag football as well. We really worked hard with the 32 teams to get flag football sanctioned as a girl’s varsity sport in high schools across the country, and we made significant progress in just a few short years. And now, with the NCAA now embracing flag football, we’re going to work and together to build a pro league with partners, and then ultimately the Olympics in ’28. These are really monumental shifts in the way that we think about football and football youth development, and it’s really helping us make the game more fun and interesting to a whole new fan base.\n\n\tNow that it’s been a few years, what is the net gain for the NFL from the Taylor Swift effect? Your female viewership was already rising, but Swift’s influence must’ve been like rocket fuel?\n\n\tShe was particularly powerful and impactful with our very important segment of the 12-to-24 year old girls and women. That represents about 8% of our fan base, and a very important part of our fan base, because of course, they represent the future. And she grew that segment about 30% first year. So 8% of our fan base, she grew that 30%. I think she provided so many young women the opportunity to come in and feel comfortable wanting to be there and enjoying the game in a really authentic way.\n\n\tHow else are you trying to reach Gen Z and beyond?\n\n\tIt’s a natural extension of what we had already been doing for years with our influencers and creators. And those influencers and creators include some sports stars like Simone Biles, right? We’ve even brought them into our marketing group, and they were photographers on the sidelines. I know if you saw that, but Simone, Simone and Suni Lee were actually photographers for a game for our marketing group. So they get all this inside access work on the sidelines.\n\n\tAnd then you’ve got Olivia Culpo who’s a very influential person. She’s the wife of [San Francisco 49ers player] Christian McCaffrey. And then Hailee Steinfeld [wife of Buffalo Bills’ quarterback Josh Allen], and [former NFL star] Jason Kelce’s wife, Kylie, so we really lifted up and partnered with not just the players themselves and some of these influencers and creators, but also some of the influencers and creators who were either wives or girlfriends of the players who really had a passion for the game and wanted to express themselves.\n\t\n\n\tBad Bunny just won the big prize of the night at Grammy Awards. What do you hope for out of the Halftime Show this year?\n\n\tBringing in Bad Bunny this year is already having a huge impact on a very important audience, both in the U.S. and internationally. And then the impact that we had with Kendrick Lamar last year in terms of video views and interest and engagement, far beyond the game itself, throughout the world. I’ve been in London doing deep research on insights on how to continue to position the NFL internationally, and they all talked about Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny, and the impact that some of these decisions have made. You have to be willing to not please everyone. There’s always going to be a segment of your fan base that is not 100% happy with some of your choices, but you have to be willing to take the risk, if you will, and to also believe in what it takes to grow your fan base and to grow the image of the NFL with very important young audiences. And what we’re finding is that some of our more mature audiences, that they actually love it, right? They start to sort of like get excited about as well, because it just makes the whole league and the image of the league feel more youthful and more energetic and more fun.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnthropic has released a set of four ads as part of its 2026 Super Bowl marketing push that take a swing at artificial-intelligence rival OpenAI‘s push into advertising. The spots each carry the tagline, “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,” referring to Anthropic’s AI chatbot.\n\n\tSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, immediately lashed out about how his competitor positioned OpenAI’s move into advertising, accusing Anthropic of producing “deceptive” ads that are “clearly dishonest.”\n\t\n\n\tOpenAI said last month that it will begin testing ads on the ChatGPT’s free and low-price subscription tier for users in the U.S. The company promised that user data and conversations will “never” be “sold to advertisers.”\n\n\n\tOne of the Anthropic ads — a version of which will air on NBC’s Super Bowl LX telecast — spoofs an OpenAI commercial that depicts a young man doing pull-ups in a park and uses ChatGPT to create a workout plan. In the Anthropic spot, the guy asks the AI agent, “Hey, can I get six-pack quickly?” The AI chatbot, clearly meant to be an ad-enabled ChatGPT, replies that “confidence isn’t just built in the gym” and promotes a (fictional) insole product that “adds one vertical inch to your height” to help “short kings stand tall.” The end of the spot features Dr. Dre’s “What’s the Difference” with the lyric, “What’s the difference between me and you?”\n\n\tAbout the rival’s ads, Altman said he thought “they are funny, and I laughed.” But, he said, “I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,” Altman wrote in a post on X.\n\t\n\n\t“I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it,” Altman said. According to OpenAI, the ChatGPT ads will be “clearly labeled” and separated from the “organic answer” provided by the AI system, asserting that ads it serves will not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you.”\n\n\tContacted by Variety, Anthropic declined to comment on Altman’s remarks.\n\n\tAnthropic will air one of the 60-second spots (“How can I communicate better with my mom?”) as a pregame ad on NBC and a 30-second in-game ad cutdown of the “Can I get a six-pack quickly?” ad during the game.\n\n\tIn a blog post, Anthropic further spelled out its philosophy toward ads. “Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free,” the company says. “But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.”\n\n\tThe Anthropic blog continued, “We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see ‘sponsored’ links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.”\n\n\tAltman, for his part, said the point of making AI ad-supported is to widen access to the tech.\n\n\t“Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions,” he wrote, adding that “More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the U.S., so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do.” He also noted that ChatGPT Plus and Pro tiers exclude ads.\n\n\tAltman also alleged that “Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI — they block companies they don’t like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can’t use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.”\n\t\n\n\tOpenAI’s own 2026 Super Bowl ad, Altman wrote, is “about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.” He claimed there have been more than 500,000 downloads of OpenAI’s Codex coding agent app since it launched on Feb. 2.\n\n\t“This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them,” Altman concluded his post.\n\n\tWatch the four Anthropic ads:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNeon, the studio behind behind “Parasite” and “Anora,” has prevailed in a heated bidding war for U.S. rights to “Once Upon a Time in Harlem.” \n\n\tThe documentary was conceived and filmed in 1972 by the late William Greaves and restored and directed by his son David Greaves. It premiered to raves at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. At various points, Netflix, Sony Pictures Classics and Mubi were in the mix for rights to the film. Neon is planning a theatrical release for the film later this year. The sale marks the second acquisition for the indie studio, following its deal for the queer horror film, “Leviticus.”\n\t\n\n\t“Once Upon a Time in Harlem” documents a party Greaves threw with the (then) living titans of the Harlem Renaissance. For four hours, this group of artists and writers reminisced, debated and drank while discussing the cultural revolution they helped set in motion and the changes they experienced in the part of the city they called home. \n\n\n\tOver 50 years later, David Greaves, one of the original cameramen, used his father’s notes and workprints to create a new film. “Once Upon a Time in Harlem” is produced by David’s granddaughter, Liani Greaves. David and Liani serve as William Greaves Productions’s president and vice president of production, respectively. Louise Archambault Greaves, William’s wife and creative partner of 55 years, co-founded the company in 1963. Following his death in 2014, she worked to restore his films. Producer Anne de Mare worked with Louise to preserve and digitize over 60,000 feet of previously unseen 16mm footage shot by Greaves in 1972. The preservation was overseen by multi-disciplinary artist and preservationist Bill Brand. Louise died in 2023.\n\t\n\n\tIn a rave review, Variety’s Lisa Kennedy wrote, “‘Once Upon a Time in Harlem’ turns viewers into time travelers but also invited guests, rightly grateful to be in the room. For some of us, this film might evoke the wonder of a great-grandchild listening in on grown-up reminiscences. Nodding at the substance. Smiling at the style.”\n\n\tThe deal was negotiated by Sarah Colvin, vice president of acquisitions for Neon and Jason Ishikawa and Isadora Johnson of Cinetic Media on behalf of the filmmakers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tApple Original Films has landed global rights to “The Last First: Winter K2,” a sports documentary that recently premiered at Sundance Film Festival. \n\n\tDirected by Amir Bar Lev, “The Last First” captures a 2021 extreme mountain climbing expedition to scale K2, the second-highest peak in the world. It’s told through the lens of mountaineers — Icelander John Snorri Sigurjónsson and Pakistani father-son team Ali and Sajid Sadpara — who are competing to be first to summit K2 in the winter, when the mountain’s conditions are the cruelest. In a press release, Apple said “The Last First: Winter K2” takes viewers “the icy heights and unpredictable weather of K2 and reveals a surprising and layered story — one of strategy and determination, class and caste, money and power — all under life and death circumstances.”\n\t\n\n\t“At its core, this is a profoundly human story about the cost of ambition and the people left searching for answers,” said producers Ben Silverman and Howard T. Owens of Propagate Content. “Amir approaches the film with empathy and precision, and we’re honored to see it reach a worldwide audience through Apple TV after such a powerful Sundance debut.”\n\n\n\tIn Variety’s review, chief film critic Owen Gleiberman described “The Last First” as “engrossing, […] but not exhilarating,” adding that “it’s not another climb-every-mountain doc of daredevil glory. It’s a movie that shows us the dark side of literally getting high.”\n\n\tSundance sales have been glacial; Olivia Wilde’s dinner-party comedy “The Invite” sold to A24, crowd-pleaser “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” was acquired by Sony Pictures Classics and horror thriller “Leviticus” was nabbed by Neon. But other festival favorites like “Josephine,” “Wicker,” “Union County” and “Chasing Summer” remain without buyers. \n\t\n\n\tApple’s major Sundance acquisitions over the years include the Oscar-nominated documentary “Come See Me in the Good Light,” musical dramedy “Flora and Son” and Academy Award-winner “CODA.”\n",

As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMNET, Jessie Buckley, 2025. ph: Agata Grzybowska / © Focus Features / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Actress Commentary (Updated Feb. 5, 2026): We have a best actress lineup of career-defining turns, each beloved for their own distinct reasons and vulnerable in ways the Academy voters love to reward and be passionate about.\n\n\tJessie Buckley, “Hamnet”\n\n\tFor Her: A raw, unsparing embodiment of grief as a lived-in condition rather than a narrative device. Buckley navigates the film in elemental sorrow without sentimentality, delivering what many consider the performance of the year, and undoubtedly her career so far. Her second nom after “The Lost Daughter” confirms her stature among the most formidable actors of her generation with adoring respect.\n\n\tAgainst Her: The movie’s emotional severity may be eclipsed by those who are scared to engage with it. Despite eight nominations, the film’s failure to secure Paul Mescal a nomination hints at uneven Academy support.\n\n\tRose Byrne, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”\n\n\tFor Her: A ferocious, discomfort-forward performance that never softens its edges. Byrne commits fully to a woman unraveling in real time, turning psychological collapse into something uncomfortably familiar. After two decades of exceptional work (i.e., “Bridesmaids,” “Spy”), this marks her long-overdue first invite to the ceremony.\n\n\tAgainst Her: The film’s abrasive tone may alienate voters, and with just this single nomination for the Mary Bronstein dark comedy, it lacks broader institutional support.\n\n\tKate Hudson, “Song Sung Blue”\n\n\tFor Her: A warm and calibrated comeback that blends her talents with vulnerability and musical ease. Twenty-four years after her “Almost Famous” nomination, Hudson returns with added gravity and reminds voters that she still has it (and never lost it).\n\n\tAgainst Her: The arc may feel familiar compared with more formally adventurous work. With just one nomination, the film failed to generate additional momentum.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENTIMENTAL VALUE, (aka AFFEKSJONSVERDI), from left: Renate Reinsve, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, 2025. © Neon / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRenate Reinsve, “Sentimental Value”\n\n\tFor Her: Quietly authoritative, Reinsve anchors Joachim Trier’s Norwegian drama with intelligence and restraint. After missing recognition for “The Worst Person in the World,” her nomination positions the star as one of international cinema’s most compelling contemporary performers.\n\n\tAgainst Her: Subtlety can be mistaken for simplicity, particularly in a field favoring loud voices and transformations. Despite nine nominations, the SAG snub lingers as a warning sign.\n\n\tEmma Stone, “Bugonia”\n\n\tFor Her: A fearless performance that leans fully into absurdity while maintaining control that keeps the viewers on the edge. The two-time Oscar winner (“La La Land,” “Poor Things”) continues her run of bold, director-driven choices that make her a default nomination for anything she touches — a strong future candidate to join Meryl Streep and Frances McDormand in the three-timers club.\n\n\tAgainst Her: Voters may hesitate to reward her so soon after a recent win. In addition, the film’s tonal extremes could divide viewers. It’s a Yorgos Lanthimos film after all.\n\n\tFinal Oscar voting will take place from Feb. 26 to Mar. 5. The 98th Oscars will be held March 15 and will air on ABC, hosted by Conan O’Brien. The first out-of-the-gate winner guesses are below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tFollowing his big wins at the Grammy Awards this past weekend, Bad Bunny now has his sights set on this Sunday’s Super Bowl Halftime Show, teasing that his performance is going to be a “huge party” and that viewers “don’t have to learn Spanish” to enjoy it.\n\n\tThe Puerto Rican musician appeared alongside Apple Music’s Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden for an official interview before the big day, discussing what fans should anticipate.\n\n\n\t“I really as I said, I want people to have fun. It’s going to be a huge party, it’s going to be what people can always expect from me, I don’t know if that is something,” he said. “That’s what I want to bring to the stage. Of course, a lot of my culture, but I don’t want to give any spoilers. It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be easy. People only have to worry about… I know that I told them that they had four months to learn Spanish. They don’t even have to learn Spanish. It’s better if they learn to dance. There’s no better dance than the one that comes from the heart, the heartbeat dance, that’s the only thing they need to worry about and enjoy. And of course choose your team at the game.”\n\t\n\n\tBad Bunny said that he’s prepping for his performance by “eating Smashburgers” and “[thinking] about the Super Bowl Halftime Show at 4 a.m.” He shared that he found time to rehearse amid his tour and didn’t over-stress, opting instead to “take it easy.”\n\n\t“Wake up, work out, [drink] my coffee, not think too much about it,” he said. “Last night, I couldn’t sleep because I was thinking about it. But yeah, I want to think that it’s just 30 minutes doing something that I love, that I like, and it’s just like that. I’m trying to enjoy it and I know that I’m going to have fun. All the crew, all the people. They’re going to have fun that day. That’s what I’m trying to focus. Just enjoy the moment, enjoy what is happening, what I’m doing. Trying not to put pressure or something on it.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tWhile other Super Bowl sponsors like Instacart, Pringles and Bud Light will trot out famous faces like Ben Stiller, Sabrina Carpetner and Post Malon",
    "body": "\n\tWhile other Super Bowl sponsors like Instacart, Pringles and Bud Light will trot out famous faces like Ben Stiller, Sabrina Carpetner and Post Malone, Tecovas will do nothing of the sort.\n\n\tInstead, the small leather-apparel company will run a commercial that has already streamed frequently on YouTube and other media venues. Hiring a celebrity wouldn’t feel authentic, says Krista Dalton, the company’s chief marketing officer. “We don’t put boots on feet that don’t want to wear them,” she says during an interview, and the commercial, which shows a young boy exploring the west with real cowboys making appearances, has generated results. “We do not believe we’ve reached anywhere near the saturation rate for this ad to feel like, oh, we’ve seen this a million times before. We think a lot of new eyeballs are going to see it.”\n\t\n\n\tTecovas’ commercial won’t appear on NBC during its February 8 telecast of the Big Game, which will show the Seattle Seahawks squire off against the New England Patriots — but it’s a Super Bowl commercial all the same.\n\n\n\tWith more people cutting their connections to traditional TV and moving to streaming video, some of the nation’s biggest media companies see a chance to make extra money. NBC has sold a bunch of streaming-only ads that will appear on Peacock during its simulcast of Super Bowl LX. The spots, which typically turn up in ad time reserved for local stations, will be seen by a smaller, but younger audience than the one tuned in to the TV network. That gives NBCUniversal the chance to seek in the neighborhood of $3 million for a 30-second ad, according to a person familiar with the matter. And there’s more: Like Super Bowl TV ads, streaming-only commercials require a “match,” or potentially another $3 million, for other pieces of NBC ad inventory.\n\t\n\n\tStreaming gives Tecovas a chance to step into an arena that would typically be impossible to enter. NBC has sought between $7 million and $10 million for a 30-second TV ad in this year’s game, which Dalton says is simply out of Tecovas’ range. “I think I’d have some questions to answer for quite a few people if I spent that much over budget,” she says.\n\n\tStreaming-only Super Bowl ads aren’t new. The financial-services firm Ally ran one on Paramount+ during the 2024 Super Bowl that aired on CBS. Both Fox and NBCUniversal have offered them in the past, according to two people familiar with the matter. But the offering is starting to gain more traction, with some advertisers acting as if their commercials will be seen by the TV millions.\n\n\tWK Kellogg’s Raisin Bran has enlisted actor William Shatner to tout its high fiber cereal. E.L.F. Cosmetics enlisted Melissa McCarthy in a spot that evokes the soapy feel of Spanish-language “telenovelas.” Oikos will run a streaming-only spot with Kathryn Hahn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Super Bowl has long stood as a bastion of mass marketing; it’s hard to think of another media vehicle that gives an advertiser a stage in front of so many potential customers. In recent years, however, more marketers have tried to use the Big Game to reach smaller niche crowds, harnessing new technology and paying more attention to the fact that interactive media like streaming allows for the placement of ads according to geography or knowledge of consumer likes and dislikes.\n\n\t“The Big Game has evolved from a singular broadcast opportunity into a multi-screen ecosystem, and our strategy reflects the shift in how modern audiences, especially younger generations, are consuming the game,” says. Doug VanDeVelde, WK Kellogg Co’s chief growth officer. The company’s Peacock buy, he adds, can help gain significant attention for a more reasonable price.\n\n\tMore piecemeal placement may be in the works. Within Disney, there is fervent hope the company can find a way to use its various properties to offer versions of the Super Bowl telecast that are tailored to different audiences, which could include sports die-hards or kids and families. Such experimentation has already surfaced. In 2024, for example, advertisers were able to place Super Bowl ads that ran only on Univision, which had the rights to air the game in Spanish. Others relied on ads that appeared only on kids-cable favorite Nickelodeon, which ran a telecast aimed at families. Some were able to place ads only on the version that streamed on Paramount+. Many, of course, chose the widely distributed original telecast on CBS.\n\t\n\n\tThe rise of streaming gives some Madison Avenue mavens the chance to do in bigger fashion what they’ve done quietly for years: Use less expensive means to get in front of the Super Bowl audience. For years, advertisers ranging from Sam Adams and Heineken to American Family Insurance and Procter & Gamble to the Church of Scientology have snatched up local ad time available on various stations tied to the network airing the Super Bowl. To the average Super Bowl viewer attending a party or snacking on buffalo wings, the differences are hard to discern. And yet, the cost of the ad buy is millions of dollars less than a commercial appearing in national time. Streaming changes the dynamic somewhat by giving the advertiser a chance to appear to viewers all across the U.S,, not just those in specific regions.\n\n\tOikos, the yogurt made by Danone, ran commercials in the traditional TV Super Bowl for six years. For it’s seventh, the company will run a celebrity-studded ad – Kathryn Hahn and football player Derrick Henry — only on Peacock. Doing so “helps us reach a younger audience,” says Victoria Badiola, senior vice president of Oikos Danone U.S. “Gen Z and Millennials are looking for viewing experiences that are more mobile, more on demand, more flexible.”\n\n\tE.L.F. sees the streaming spot as “an important test and learn moment for us,” says Kory Marchisotto, the company’s chief marketing officer. The cosmetics brand’s hopes to stand out are as big as any Super Bowl TV advertiser, with a spot that was inspired by a monologue by Bad Bunny on the debut of this season’s run of “Saturday Night Live,” when he told the audience they had four months to learn Spanish before he appeared in the Super Bowl halftime show. ELF shot the ad with McCarthy just a week ago, says Marchisotto, and McCarthy provided enough material for something even more ambitious.,\n\n\t“At the end of the day, I looked at the director, and I said, ‘I think we just shot a 30-minute movie,’” she recalls. “Not a 30-second commercial.”\n\n\tStreaming-only ads may reach just a portion of the Super Bowl audience, but they have become significant enough to capture the attention of a very important viewer: the NFL. The league scrutinizes the streaming ads for elements that might offend audiences, just as it does with the TV pitches. “You still go through the same stuff,” says Marchisotto. “We had to go through a lot of gates.”\n",

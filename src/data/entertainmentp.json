    "body": "\n\tU.K. broadcaster ITV has confirmed it has received a £1.6 billion ($2.1 billion) bid from Comcast’s European pay-TV platform Sky for it media and entertainment unit. \n\n\tThe shock news — which landed overnight in the U.K. — would see Comcast take control of ITV’s linear channels and ITVX streaming business, significantly expanding its foothold in the British TV landscape, having already acquired Sky for around $30 billion in 2018. According to news reports, the bid from Sky centres on the potential creation of a U.K.-focused streaming giant.\n\t\n\n\tIn a short statement sent Friday morning, ITV it note “the recent press speculation and confirms that it is in preliminary discussions regarding a possible sale of its M&E business to Sky for an enterprise value of £1.6bn.”\n\n\n\tIt added: “There can be no certainty as to the terms upon which any potential sale may be agreed or whether any transaction will take place. A further announcement will be made in due course if appropriate.”\n\n\tThe discussions do not include ITV’s production and sales arm, ITV Studios, which has the center of numerous takeover rumours in the last year. RedBird IMI and Banijay are understood to have expressed an interest in the unit. \n\n\tConfirmation of the deal talks came shortly after ITV reported that it would “temporarily” shave $46 million from its budgets over the U.K.’s “softening economy” and advertiser uncertainty. It said it expected ad revenues to fall by 9% in the key fourth-quarter period in the lead up to Christmas. \n\n\tITV shares leaped 18% at the start of trading in London on Friday following news of a potential deal with Sky.\n",

    "body": "\n\tShudder and Independent Film Company have closed a deal for Rod Blackhurst‘s horror film “Dolly” covering North American, U.K., Ireland and Australia-New Zealand territories, with plans for a theatrical release next year.\n\n\tThe film centers on Macy, a young woman fighting to survive after being taken by a monstrous figure intent on raising her as its child. Critics have noted its blend of New French Extremity aesthetics with 1970s American horror sensibilities.\n\t\n\n\tThe ensemble includes Fabianne Therese, Seann William Scott, Ethan Suplee, Russ Tiller, Kate Cobb and Michalina Scorzelli. Former NWA TV Champion Max the Impaler, also known as The Non-Binary Nightmare, makes their film debut in the title role.\n\n\n\tThe Witchcraft Motion Picture Company production, which earned strong reviews at Fantastic Fest and Sitges Film Festival, marks another genre project for Blackhurst, the Emmy and Critics Choice-nominated filmmaker behind “Blood For Dust” and Netflix’s “Amanda Knox” documentary. He also co-wrote Universal and Blumhouse’s “Night Swim” with Bryce McGuire.\n\n\tBlackhurst wrote the screenplay with Brandon Weavil. Ross O’Connor produces alongside Noah Lang and Blackhurst through Witchcraft Motion Picture Company, with Set Point Entertainment, Grim Discoveries, Gentile Entertainment Group, Monarque Entertainment and Mama Bear Studios attached. Additional producers include Joseph P. Grano, Betty Tong, Esteban Sanchez, McGuire, Isaiah Smallman and cast members Therese, Scott and Suplee.\n\n\tSamuel Zimmerman negotiated the acquisition for Independent Film Company and Shudder, while Blue Finch Films represented the filmmakers.\n\t\n\n\tSteven Schneider, whose credits include “Paranormal Activity” and “Insidious,” executive produces with Matt Patterson, Barry Large, Bobby Campbell, Sinan Germirli, Scorzelli, Rudy Mawer, Cam Doody, Jared Houghton, Travis Truitt, Anthony and John Gentile, Mike Chapman, Fatima Hayward, Antonio D’Intino, Lawrence Dossche and John Neumann.\n\n\t“‘Dolly’ is a grotesque, beautiful backwoods nightmare,” said Zimmerman, senior VP of programming and acquisitions. “Rod Blackhurst and team transcend their influences to create a beguiling, terrifying new monster; one to love and definitely fear.”\n\n\t“‘Dolly’ is both the exact kind of relentless uncompromising genre filmmaking we grew up loving and a testament to what Witchcraft as a studio understands is possible and most important right now; creating original IP and making films that audiences want,” added Blackhurst. “Truly independent, thematically rich, and created with care and craft. ‘Dolly’ is here to stay and we are excited for everyone to see the first chapter in an expansive horrifying universe.”\n\n\tWitchcraft Motion Picture Company’s slate includes Amblin’s “The White Room,” Carter Smith’s “Swallowed,” Peacock series “John Wayne Gacy: The Devil in Disguise” and Independent Spirit Award nominee “This is Not a War Story.” The company is prepping Blackhurst’s action thriller “Die By Night” while completing post-production on sci-fi film “Into the Sky,” starring Sam Richardson and David Cross, and drama “Ruby Road,” executive produced by Rosario Dawson.\n\n\tBlue Finch’s international lineup includes Fantasia selections “Hellcat” and “Hold The Fort,” plus horror sci-fi “Affection” with Jessica Rothe.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrance’s vibrant VFX sector now stands at the forefront of the country’s broader push to strengthen its global production appeal, reflecting a national strategy that has championed the craft ever since the 2020 revision of the Tax Rebate for International Production (TRIP). \n\n\tThat update introduced a 10% bonus on all eligible expenses for productions spending over $2.3 million with local VFX houses. Five years on, the incentive has proven transformative, driving studio expansion, nurturing talent and attracting a steady stream of high-profile international projects to French soil.\n\t\n\n\tToday, the sector has reached maturity — and with maturity comes resilience. The unexpected collapse of Technicolor triggered layoffs and production disruptions, while a broader post-pandemic slowdown has seen commissions drop nearly 30%. With AI disruption and studio consolidation looming, growth increasingly depends on adaptability.\n\n\n\t“Flexibility, agility and teamwork define the new business model,” says the Yard founder and CEO Laurens Ehrmann. “Our midsize structure offers a real advantage. Clients know their projects matter, that they’ll get an A-team, and that we’ll always respond quickly.”\n\n\tWith outposts in Paris, Montpellier and now London — a move to access multiple tax credits while staying close to partners like Amazon and Netflix — the Yard has tied its expansion directly to relationship management.\n\n\tCase in point: after working on 2019’s “Ford v Ferrari,” the Yard maintained strong ties with the project’s VFX supervisor, who later entrusted them with advanced creature work on this year’s “Predator: Badlands.” Tasked with a milestone sequence, the studio built an animation, character, creature and digidouble pipeline from scratch, handling 120 complex shots and creating a robust toolset for future creature FX.\n\t\n\n\t“Working on creatures is one of the most complex parts of VFX,” Ehrmann explains. “Mastering it allows you to bid on entire sequences with vast environments and complex characters, now positioning us as a tier-one VFX company.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tParis’ One of Us is handling work on upcoming features “The Bride!” and “Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tExecutives from VFX studio One of Us describe their work on 2024’s “Damsel” as similarly transformative. The studio delivered over 400 shots, including 250 featuring a fully realized, emotive dragon, with the rest dedicated to large-scale destruction and fully 3D environments. Splitting the work between outposts in London and Paris, the studio’s teams collaborated seamlessly, emerging from this trial-by-fire with cost-saving insights.\n\n\t“Getting involved early is critical,” says Emmanuel Pichereau, CCO of One of Us. “It allows us to plan strategically, reduce shot counts, control costs and, most importantly, align with the film’s storytelling from the very beginning when changes are still flexible.”\n\n\tThe studio is applying this philosophy to upcoming projects like “The Bride!” and “Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man.” For both, the team is working from its Paris office to qualify for the full French tax rebate, crafting visual effects designed to be seamless rather than showy.\n\n\t“We want to blend into these worlds,” says CEO Rachael Penfold. “We’re there to serve the story and realize the filmmakers’ vision, not to show off. The best visual effect is often the one you never notice.”\n\n\tBut Penfold is happy to tout the French value proposition — and she recently traveled to Los Angeles to championed Gallic talent at industry sessions and case studies.\n\n\t“The French film industry is mature, and its talent is often immersed in a culture of great filmmaking, not just trained on specific software,” Penfold says. “The emphasis is cultural — it’s about artistic problem-solving and craftsmanship. While some focus on technical details, French artists tend to take a more holistic, well-rounded view. That mindset brings added value to every project.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHong Kong sales company Cappu Films has picked up Thai Girls’ Love series “Love Design” and is introducing the title to buyers at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF), which is currently taking place.\n\n\tGL and BL (Boys’ Love) series, which center on same-sex romantic relationships, have become a popular genre across Asia, with Thailand emerging as a major production hub for such content.\n\n\n\tUnder the arrangement, Cappu Films and VelCurve Studio — the production company behind the sci-fi film “Uranus 2324” — will jointly handle international sales for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, North America, Latin America and Singapore.\n\t\n\n\tHelmed by Fuse Kittisak Cheewasatjasakun, the series follows two female architects, portrayed by Kao Supassara Thanachart and Jane Methika Jiranorraphat, whose romantic relationship deteriorates into professional animosity after one uses the other’s designs in a competition without permission.\n\n\n\tThe show debuted Oct. 2 with weekly Thursday releases. Thailand’s Channel 3 is airing an eight-episode version, while Tencent’s WeTV platform carries an extended cut with 10 episodes. Fan events for the final two episodes are planned for early December 2025.\n\n\tKeetawat Chinnakote, CEO and executive producer at VelCurve Studio, and Janice Woo, founder and head of sales at Cappu Films, negotiated the agreement.\n\n\t“‘Love Design’ is a GL series that tells the story of the architecture profession — exploring both the challenges of work and the romantic relationships of its characters,” said Keetawat. “It stars the talented Kao Supassara and Jane Methika, alongside promising newcomers Friend Tofan and Palm Paramee. Produced by VelCurve Studio, the series is crafted with a strong commitment to high production standards and storytelling that allows global audiences to easily understand and connect with its context and emotions.”\n\t\n\n\tHe characterized the series as Thai soft power content that showcases the country’s creative capabilities internationally, noting his hopes for global audience support through the Cappu Films partnership.\n\n\t“At Cappu Films, we are passionate about bringing distinctive Asian stories with global resonance to audiences worldwide,” said Woo. “‘Love Design’ is a bold and emotionally layered GL series that combines romance, rivalry, and ambition in a fresh way. Partnering with VelCurve Studio allows us to champion diverse storytelling while tapping into the phenomenal energy of the GL fan community across Asia and beyond.”\n\n\tCappu Films handles international sales for emerging directors and commercial genre content. The company’s TCCF slate features the Busan Vision competition winner “Malika” from Kazakhstan, the action-thriller “Fox Hunt” with Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Olga Kurylenko, Josh Radnor’s “All Happy Families,” the Karlovy Vary entry “Promise, I’ll Be Fine” from Aerofilms/Filmtopia, and the Chinese action title “Assassin,” which Film Movement’s Omnibus Entertainment label will distribute in North America.\n\n\tVelCurve Studio’s previous work includes “Uranus 2324,” which Netflix acquired for its streaming service throughout Southeast Asia, covering Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, East Timor, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and Indonesia.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOne of the defining qualities of Tyler Perry’s movies — it’s what keeps you watching but also what can make them, on occasion, seem borderline loopy — is the wild mix of tones, sort of like mood swings. Perry’s films can lurch from romance to madcap Madea comedy to skeletons-in-the-closet family drama and back…all in the space of 20 minutes. Recent years have seen him growing as a filmmaker (the complex historical fable “A Jazzman’s Blues,” the wartime drama “The Six Triple Eight”), but “Tyler Perry’s Finding Joy” is a throwback, and not in a good way. It’s Perry’s version of a holiday movie and a connect-the-dots love story, but it’s cliché-driven in such a minimal way that it almost makes you yearn for the Perry movies that can feel like a long night of channel surfing all rolled into one.\n\t\n\n\t“Finding Joy” is basically a two-hander that sets itself up when Joy (Shannon Thornton), an aspiring New York fashion designer, winds up driving through a Colorado blizzard, at which point she and her stalled car plunge through the ice. The next things she knows, she wakes up, warm and dry, in a remote cabin that’s the home of Ridge (Tosin Morohunfola), one of Perry’s Noble Rugged Deep-Voiced Dreamboats Who Could Be Your Salvation.\n\n\n\tHe was out hunting and rescued her (how that happened isn’t clear — the last we saw she was 20 feet under the icy water). Okay, he’s a little unfriendly at first. But he’s ripped, he’s handsome, he’s a stoic gentleman who, in his beard and flannel shirt, looks like (in Joy’s words) a “Black lumberjack.” And the movie, with these two sexy people sparring for about 10 minutes, only to settle their differences over whiskey before a roaring fire in a snowbound cabin that looks like a vacation hideaway, has an unironic romance-novel baby-it’s-cold-outside vibe of old-school desert-island love. They’ll wait out the storm, which might take a week, and he’ll drive her in his truck the 12 miles down the mountain. But it’s beyond obvious where this is all going, and that’s kind of a dramatic problem. We’re simply waiting for the ice — outside and between them — to thaw.    \n\t\n\n\tHow did Joy nearly die in the wilderness of Colorado, a place that, in a joke the film keeps repeating, is almost all white people? The early scenes introduce her as a gifted designer who, despite her beauty and charisma, allows herself to be a doormat in both career and love. Pat-Treek (Eric Stanton Betts), the head of the label she works for, is a disdainful cad who rips off her colorful designs from years before. And she keeps dating men who don’t love her. That’s why she follows Colton (Aaron O’Connell) to his family’s house in Colorado, thinking that this amiable Ken doll likes her, only to learn that he’s engaged and that he wants her to be the equivalent of his best man.\n\n\tBut once Joy gets rescued and settles into Ridge’s small warm rosy candle-lit cabin, the film’s only dramatic question is: Why is he living like the Unabomber, cooking his rabbit stew in the middle of nowhere, without even a cell phone or radio? (There are tender reasons why, most of them hinging on how devoted he was to his late mother.) The two are united by Perry- esque symmetries. Both are still recovering from relationships that ended in their partners’ infidelity. And his mother’s name was…Joy.\n\n\t“Finding Joy” is no comedy, but Joy’s friends back in New York, the stoner Littia (Inayah) and the harder-bitten Ashley (Brittany S. Hall), lighten the proceedings a bit, and there’s one rom-com moment. Joy goes to the frozen outhouse, sits on the wet toilet seat, and sticks to it like the kid’s tongue sticking to a pole in “A Christmas Story.” So Ridge has to come in there, while her pants are down, and pull her off the seat before she freezes to death. Yet the only real chuckles I got from “Finding Joy” were the unintentional kind — like in response to the grand reversal of fortune that happens to Joy once she returns to work. It’s the stuff of fairy tales, but a romantic fairy tale can carry you away, or it can merely play, as it does here, like the adult version of kids’ stuff.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTisca Chopra’s directorial debut feature “Saali Mohabbat” is set to premiere on Indian streaming platform ZEE5 later this year, following festival runs at IFFI Goa and the Chicago South Asian Film Festival.\n\n\tThe film centers on Smita, a small-town housewife whose seemingly ordinary life unravels into a narrative exploring infidelity, deceit and moral ambiguity.\n\n\tThe thriller-drama stars Radhika Apte, Divyendu Sharma, Anurag Kashyap, Anshumaan Pushkar, Sauraseni Maitra and Sharat Saxena. The film marks a reunion for Apte with ZEE5 after her previous platform appearance in “Mrs. Undercover.”\n\t\n\n\t“Saali Mohabbat” is produced by Jio Studios and Manish Malhotra‘s Stage5 Production, marking the celebrated fashion designer’s digital debut as a producer. The project represents ZEE5’s third collaboration with Jio Studios, following “Hisaab Barabar” and “Mrs.,” which starred R. Madhavan and Sanya Malhotra, respectively, as well as “Bhagwat” featuring Arshad Warsi and Jitendra Kumar.\n\n\t“I’ve always been fascinated by the quiet tensions that exist beneath the surface of relationships — the invisible power struggles, the unspoken expectations, the ways in which love can transform into something darker,” Chopra said. “This film explores those fragile boundaries — of trust, betrayal, and identity — but through a deeply female perspective.”\n\n\tKaveri Das, business head of Hindi ZEE5, added: “With ‘Saali Mohabbat,’ we’re thrilled to present a thriller that’s not just about suspense, but about the intricate emotions that drive human choices.” \n\n\tJyoti Deshpande, president of Jio Studios, characterized the film as “an ingeniously crafted thriller that marks our proud collaboration with producer Manish Malhotra, who seamlessly extends his creative brilliance from fashion to film.”\n\t\n\n\tMalhotra explained that Stage5 Production was established to support original stories with strong craft. “This project has been built with deep involvement at every stage — from development to the final cut — because at Stage5, we don’t just produce films, we stand by them,” he said. “Every creative and strategic decision has been shaped with purpose, rigour, and responsibility.”\n\n\tThe producer noted the film features “an ensemble of exceptionally talented actors, each bringing a distinct rhythm, restraint, and truth to their characters — the kind of performances that don’t speak loudly but linger.”\n\n\tChopra credited Malhotra with providing crucial early support for the project. “Manish’s response — just three minutes into the narration — gave me the conviction that this story had found its right home,” she said. “He and his team supported the film not just with resources, but with genuine artistic trust and emotional understanding, allowing it to retain its raw, unpolished honesty.”\n\n\tThe director described the filmmaking experience as “both terrifying and liberating — terrifying because it demanded emotional vulnerability, and liberating because it allowed me to step outside the boundaries women filmmakers are so often placed within.”\n\n\tZEE5 serves 190-plus countries with a language-first platform approach, delivering content in seven languages: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Malayalam, Kannada and Marathi.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor nearly the entirety of the “Wicked: One Wonderful Night” TV special, which aired on NBC Thursday night, the performances were focused on Stephen Schwartz’s songs from the two “Wicked” movies. But for the two-hour show’s climax, stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo veered deliciously off-topic to cover a medley of songs first made famous 62 years ago by Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland.\n\n\tSome younger viewers may have been initially puzzled by the mashup, but fans of a certain age, or of a certain show-tune leaning, got it from the very first bar, or might have even dared to anticipate it when Erivo and Grande sat down on stools, side by side. It was the pairing of two distinct standards that both date back nearly a hundred years, “Get Happy” and “Happy Days Are Here Again.” The two classics have come to be conjoined in some people’s minds, but that is only because they were first sung that way by Garland and Streisand on a legendary episode of “The Judy Garland Show” in 1963.\n\t\n\n\n\n\nCynthia Erivo & Ariana Grande singing “Get Happy/Happy Days Are Here Again”This arrangement was inspired by Barbra Streisand & Judy Garland’s performance in 1963.  pic.twitter.com/uLNyXRrlKZ— Wicked Updates 🧹 (@wicked_updates) November 7, 2025\n\n\n\tThe Judy/Barbra performance became the stuff of legend partly because it captured two legends at opposite ends of their careers. Streisand, then 21, was not only far from a superstar but hadn’t even done “Funny Girl” on Broadway yet — although she had earlier that year released her debut LP, “The Streisand Album,” which had as its Side 2 leadoff number “Happy Days Are Here Again.” That 1929 tune (written by Milton Ager and Jack Yellen) has remained a staple of her concerts (minus duets or interpolations) right up through her last tour in 2019.\n\t\n\n\tGarland was also singing a signature song for her half of the entwined duet — which was reportedly her idea, to jazz up the special. “Get Happy,” originally penned in 1930 (by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler), was a pseudo-gospel number she popularized in the 1950 MGM musical “Summer Stock” and continued to sing through the end of her life. Then 41, Garland was considered on the professional decline and was six years away from the end of her life when she personally brought in the nascent upstart for several numbers on the Oct. 6, 1963 episode of her weekly variety show.\n\n\tThis particular mashup hardly counts as culturally ubiquitous in 2025. But Grande and Erivo are far from the first to revive it in the modern era, as the medley continues to have cachet among musical theater actors looking for an impressive way to pair up. \n\n\tErivo herself has had some practice at it: She previously did it in tandem with Ben Platt one night during his London concert run in 2024. Scroll down to see video of the Erivo/Platt duet, along with other covers. (There’s no apparent record of Grande having sung it with anyone before; she has sung with Streisand both live and on record, but they missed an opportunity in not attempting the tune together.)\n\n\n\n\n\tIf the doubled-up cover feels somewhat familiar to a somewhat younger generation, it may be because it did get significant exposure through an episode of “Glee” from that show’s second season in 2011, as Lea Michele and Chris Coffer teamed up side by side — with Michele’s costuming obviously designed to resemble Streisand’s from 1963.\n\n\n\n\n\tOther duets that can be seen or heard in clips below include Rufus Wainwright with Kristin Chenoweth; Billy Porter with Cyndi Lauper; Audra McDonald with Patti LuPone — on repeated occasions over the years! (we know, we know); and, going back to 1964, Garland with her daughter, Liza Minnelli.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIn the fall of 1963, Garland was determined to have Streisand on her show after catching her at the the Cocoanut Grove in the summer. Norman Jewison, later to be a famous feature helmer, was the director of the Streisand episode (which also featured Ethel Merman and the Smothers Brothers). Mel Tormé was employed to work on special musical material for the series, and he offered backstory for the duet in his book “The Other Side of the Rainbow; With Judy Garland on the Dawn Patrol.” There, he wrote that Garland summoned him to her dressing room and suggested an inspired idea for the show, playing Streisand’s LP version of “Happy Days Are Here Again” while singing a counter-melody of “Get Happy.”\n\t\n\n\tWrote Tormé: “The result was electrifying, one of those chance discoveries in which two great songs jell into one extraspecial opus.”\n\n\tThat and the other performances by Streisand mightily impressed CBS executives, regardless of whether the guest was yet a major star at the time. They bumped the episode up ahead of some others that had already been filmed, and it aired just two days after it was recorded, on Oct. 6, 1963.\n\n\tA half-century or more later, it continued to impress. Profiling Streisand for the New York Times in 2016, the paper’s theater critic, Ben Brantley, wrote: “Each interpreted an upbeat song with a big, trumpeting voice that nonetheless hinted at a small, solitary figure within. Happiness, as hymned in these renditions, would never be won easily. You can find that video on YouTube, and it is impossible to watch it without shivering.”\n\n\tTalking with Brantley, Streisand said of Garland, “Afterward, she used to visit me and give me advice. She came to my apartment in New York, and she said to me, ‘Don’t let them do to you what they did to me.’ I didn’t know what she meant then. I was just getting started.”\n\n\tIn a 2005 interview with Diane Sawyer, Streisand said that Garland “was great. She was wonderful. Loved her … I was very secure then. I was only 21, I think. I wasn’t afraid of failure or anything. But it was interesting to see someone who was so great and so famous and so gifted … She was drinking Liebfraumilch — you know, a white wine — and her hands were shaking and she was holding onto me. I thought, what was this about? As one grows older, what is this fear? And I understand it now.”\n\n\tStreisand received her first Emmy nomination for the episode, in the category of Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program.\n\n\tFew contemporary singers would have the nerve to recreate a moment so very tagged to two of the greatest of the 20th century (or in Streisand’s case, 20th going on 21st), but few enjoy the good will, on top of the chops, that Erivo and Grande have going into the second and final part of the filmic “Wicked” franchise. If it turns out to be happy days for them at the Oscars, their ability to nail a tricky duet classic might have contributed just a little, if clips of the performance become as widely circulated as expected.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, let’s hear it for the audience that saw the taping at the Dolby Theatre Sept. 24 and somehow managed to keep the climax under wraps even on social media until now. EIther that, or they were too young to recognize its significance… Nah, let’s go with discretion.\n\n\tHere are a few of the other versions rendered from over the years, including another of the many, many times LuPone and McDonald did it over a period of at least a decade and a half, long before the former called the latter “not a friend” earlier this year. Perhaps this revival of the medley will inspire them to hold space for one another yet again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGerman production company Traumfabrik Babelsberg is doubling down on its investment in international moviemaking, with a burgeoning slate of productions with global appeal in the works, as well as its first series.\n\n\tThe company was founded in 2017 by Tom Zickler and Christoph Fisser, when the latter also was managing director of Babelsberg, the major film studios on the edge of Berlin, which was its parent company. Zickler was best known as the producer of German star Til Schweiger’s films up until 2016. The company takes its name from its first film, 2019’s “Traumfabrik,” which translates as “Dreamfactory.” Sadly, Zickler died of cancer in 2019 at the age of 55.\n\t\n\n\tFollowing Fisser’s departure from Babelsberg at the beginning of last year, Traumfabrik Babelsberg was reborn as an independent entity, led by Fisser and Sebastian Fruner, who has been at the company since it began. They were then joined by Konstantin Mayer, the former COO at Veronica Ferres’ company, Construction Film Produktion. Since then, the company has been reinvigorated, and has a number of high-profile projects on its books.\n\n\n\tTalking to Variety, Fruner said that when he met Mayer in Cannes it was a “match made in heaven” as the two producers had a similar desire to make ambitious projects with the potential to find an international audience.\n\n\tOne film has already wrapped production and post. It is a theatrical feature produced with Kreisfilm, which is directed by Robert Gwisdek and stars Christian Friedel, best known for “The Zone of Interest” and “The White Lotus,” and Corinna Harfouch, whose credits include “Downfall” and “Never Look Away.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film, which is at present untitled, is described as a “philosophical drama.” It is, in part, inspired by the death of Robert Gwisdek’s father, which is intriguing as Harfouch is the director’s mother. The film will be released next year and Fruner hopes it’ll have a strong festival run, with an eye to a premiere at Berlin or Cannes. Discussions with potential German distributors are ongoing.\n\n\tThe film marks the beginning of a long-term collaboration with Kreisfilm, according to Traumfabrik Babelsberg, with two additional major international films now being packaged and seeking financing.\n\n\tAnother project is teen horror film “Bali Demons,” which is in development. It is based on an idea by Mayer, with the script written by Sophia Vester. The film is “about the conflict between cultural tradition and mass tourism,” Mayer says. He notes that in the past year or so this has become a bigger issue with public protests against mass tourism in several tourism hotspots, such as Venice, Majorca and Barcelona.\n\n\tMayer says the film is intended to be the first in a franchise, and will be followed by “Venice Demons” and “Tokyo Demons.” He says it is about “tourists behaving badly in holy places,” adding, “Nobody would go in a bikini in a church in Munich and have sex there but in Bali that happens all the time. It is disrespectful to their culture, their ancient tradition.”\n\n\tIn the film, “there’s a group of tourists, young, beautiful people,” he says. “I call this ‘Scream’ on Bali, or ‘Scream’ in exotic places, because one after another gets killed by a figure who has a traditional mask on.” Mayer adds, “The people start thinking, ‘Maybe the demons want to have their island back.’”\n\n\tHe says that some people have described it as a cross between “Scream” and “Midsommar.”\n\n\tIt stars Indonesian singer Adriana Raisa, German actress Helena Zengel (“The Legend of Ochi,” “News of the World,” “System Crasher”) and U.S. actor Gianni Paolo (“Ma,” “Power”). A major U.S. star and the director will be revealed soon.\n\n\tThe film is likely to shoot next year in Bali and is produced in association with Bo Holmgreen of Viking Sunset Studios and Orlando Bassi of Movie Studios Bali.\n\t\n\n\tTraumfabrik Babelsberg is also planning to produce its first series, young adult romance “Because of You,” based on Nadine Kerger’s bestselling novels of the same name. The showrunner is Martin Schreier, whose “Maxton Hall” became the most successful non-U.S. Prime Original worldwide. The series is set at a boat club on Malta, where they plan to shoot in March 2027, with backing from German public broadcaster SWR.\n\n\tThe company is also producing crime comedy “Himmel, Herrgott, Hirschgeweih,” which is set in Bavaria, Southern Germany. It has been developed with German distributor Tobis Film and will receive a theatrical release. It is envisioned as a franchise.\n\n\tTraumfabrik Babelsberg is also developing a spoof comedy with David Zucker, Mayer says, which will be released worldwide with a yet-to-be announced partner.\n\n\tTraumfabrik Babelsberg has also experimented with AI on “Einstein – Bringing a Legend Back to Life.” Using cutting-edge AI they have brought Einstein back to life, based on a performance by actor Heiner Lauterbach, but using Einstein’s own words. The film, which is two hours and 22 minutes long, is entirely composed of AI-generated content. It was released on the Meet Your Master platform last month. Traumfabrik Babelsberg is now developing a fiction feature, “Einstein,” using the same technology.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has unveiled the trailer for the third season of its hit spy-thriller series “The Family Man,” with Manoj Bajpayee‘s iconic character Srikant Tiwari now finding himself on the run from both new adversaries and his own intelligence unit.\n\n\tThe trailer was unveiled at a fan and media event in Mumbai on Friday, previewing the series created by Raj & DK under their D2R Films banner. Season 3 sees Srikant racing against time to protect himself, his family and the nation from an imminent threat, with the hunter now becoming the hunted.\n\t\n\n\t“For the past four years, fans have hounded me with the question, ‘When is Srikant Tiwari coming?’ And we finally have the answer with a new season that’s not only bigger, bolder, and more exciting but also raises the stakes higher than ever for Srikant, as he finds himself cornered with no respite in sight,” said Bajpayee. “Thanks to Raj and DK’s vision and masterful storytelling, and the continued support of Prime Video, ‘The Family Man’ has become one of the most-loved Indian series.”\n\n\n\tThe latest season introduces two formidable new adversaries: Rukma, played by Jaideep Ahlawat (“Paatal Lok”), and Meera, portrayed by Nimrat Kaur (“The Lunchbox”). \n\n\t“I have always admired Raj and DK for their creative abilities and bringing to life a series like ‘The Family Man,’ which has become one of the most watched and loved Indian series all over the world, and I am thrilled to be a part of the latest season,” said Ahlawat. “Without giving away much about my character, I am certain that everyone will be surprised to see me portraying this role.”\n\t\n\n\tThe series is written by Raj, DK and Suman Kumar, featuring dialogues by Sumit Arora. Raj & DK direct alongside Suman Kumar and Tusshar Seyth, who join as directors for Season 3.\n\n\tKaur, who described herself as a fan of the series since Season 1, called joining the show “a dream come true.” “Playing Meera was both thrilling and challenging, as I had to match the caliber and performative brilliance of Manoj and Jaideep,” she said. “And the way Raj, DK, and Suman have crafted the story with its rich characters and unpredictable twists, I believe audiences will want to binge the new season in one go.”\n\n\tThe explosive trailer showcases the series’ signature elements including witty dialogues, high-octane action, thrilling chases and the blurred lines between Srikant’s personal and professional life. In Season 3, Srikant must navigate life on the run with his family while being pursued by TASC, his own intelligence unit, in addition to the new threats.\n\n\t“Season 3 of ‘The Family Man’ turns Srikant’s covert professional and fragile personal life upside down, as he is forced to go on the run with his family while facing an even more alarming threat in Rukma and Meera,” said creators, directors and writers Raj & DK. “Both Jaideep and Nimrat are the perfect choice, as actors and personalities to embody these dynamic and menacing foes, testing not only Srikant’s grit and resolve but also his commitment to his family and his nation. Taking the story several notches higher the new season will grip audiences with its edge-of-the-seat tension and nail-biting moments as they witness their favorite spy navigating uncharted territories and peril.”\n\n\tReturning cast members include Sharib Hashmi as J.K. Talpade, Priyamani as Suchitra Tiwari, Ashlesha Thakur as Dhriti Tiwari, Vedant Sinha as Atharv Tiwari, Shreya Dhanwanthary as Zoya and Gul Panag as Saloni.\n\n\t“The Family Man” Season 3 will premiere exclusively on Prime Video on Nov. 21 in India and over 240 countries and territories worldwide.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) has unveiled its second Focus program for the 55th edition, turning the spotlight on Japan’s V-Cinema — the direct-to-video movement that exploded in the late 1980s and profoundly shaped the country’s contemporary film culture. \n\n\tThe section, curated by Tom Mes, will run as part of the festival’s 2026 edition from Jan. 29 to Feb. 8.\n\n\n\tOriginating with Toei’s “Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage” (1989), V-Cinema responded to Japan’s booming home video market by producing films that bypassed theaters entirely. The low-budget, high-speed production model gave directors unprecedented creative freedom, birthing a generation of filmmakers who went on to define modern Japanese cinema — including Miike Takashi, Nakata Hideo, Kurosawa Kiyoshi and Aoyama Shinji.\n\t\n\n\tIFFR’s V-Cinema Focus will showcase a range of Toei titles, among them the “Crime Hunter” trilogy — “Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage,” “Crime Hunter 2: Bullets of Betrayal” and “Crime Hunter 3: Killing Bullet.” The lineup also features Nakata’s debut feature “Female Teacher: Forbidden Sex,” the psychological noir “Betrayal Tomorrow,” and the cult action thriller “XX Beautiful Weapon.”\n\n\n\tThe program expands beyond Toei to highlight the anarchic spirit and genre experimentation that defined the movement. Among the selections are the ghostly anthology “Scary True Stories: Second Night,” the eerie found-footage investigation “Psychic Vision: Jaganrei,” and Miike’s hyperviolent “Fudoh: The New Generation.” Other highlights include the surreal gangland fable “Tuff: Part I,” Kurosawa’s deadpan yakuza comedy “Suit Yourself or Shoot Yourself!! VI: The Hero,” Aoyama’s archetypal action drama “A Weapon in My Heart,” and “The King of Minami,” about a loan shark aiding small business owners.\n\t\n\n\t“V-Cinema offered filmmakers the space to take risks, move fast and work with a freedom rarely possible within the traditional studio system,” said IFFR festival director Vanja Kaludjercic. “What emerged was a wild and inventive cinema embracing everything from anarchic yakuza tales and psycho-horror experiments to surreal hybrid pieces — work that still feels electric today.”\n\n\tIFFR’s full 2026 program will be unveiled on Dec. 16.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tDove is entering the Ton.\n\n\tThe personal care brand has teamed with Netflix’s “Bridgerton” for a limited-edition bodycare collection timed to the show’s highly anticipated fourth season next month. The Dove x Bridgerton line is packaged in bespoke Regency-inspired packaging and includes four new limited-edition scents: Moonlit Masquerade (hydrangea, eucalyptus and warm musk), Whispering Wisteria (orchid, champagne and watery florals), Raspberry Rendezvous —(raspberry, rose, peony and whipped cream) and Love & Meadows (bergamot, wildflowers and rose with amber and cedarwood).\n\n\n\tThe lineup launched exclusively on Target.com on Dec. 25 and rolled out in Target stores beginning Dec. 28, with prices ranging from $3.99 to $7.99. The products are available for a limited time only.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIMITED-EDITION\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDove x Bridgerton Personal Care Collection\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe Dove x Bridgerton collection spans body wash, body scrub, body mist, hand wash, antiperspirant deodorant and beauty bars, all featuring Dove’s familiar moisturizing formulas. The four fragrances nod directly to the show’s romantic storylines and set pieces: Moonlit Masquerade pairs hydrangea, eucalyptus and warm musk; Whispering Wisteria blends orchid, champagne and watery florals; Raspberry Rendezvous leans into a playful gourmand mix of raspberry, rose and whipped cream; and Love & Meadows combines bergamot, wildflowers and rose with amber and cedarwood, inspired by Sophie and Benedict’s long-awaited connection.\n\n\tProduced by Shondaland, the Netflix series has become a merchandising and cultural juggernaut since its debut, with fashion, beauty and lifestyle brands increasingly eager to tap into its pastel-drenched fantasy. Sandie Bailey, Shondaland co-president and chief innovation and design officer, framed the partnership as a natural extension of the company’s long-standing values around inclusivity and authenticity. “We are proud that this incredible product line carries those values forward and are excited to see fans of the Ton and Dove give themselves the ‘Bridgerton’ royal treatment they deserve,” she saidi in a statement.\n\n\n\tSeason 4 of “Bridgerton” will premiere on Netflix in two batches, debuting Jan. 29 and continuing Feb. 26, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is flying to streaming. The blockbuster musical sequel, which made more than $200 million at the global box office, is now available to rent/purchase on VOD. \n\n\tStarting today, the film is available on major digital platforms including Prime Video, Apple TV and Vudu, marking the latest step in Universal Pictures’ strategy of extending the life of its biggest theatrical titles across premium home-entertainment windows. Universal also announced that it will arrive on Blu-ray, DVD and 4K on Jan. 20, and will like arrive on Peacock (where the first film lives) in the coming months. \n\n\n\tDirected by Jon M. Chu, “Wicked: For Good” picks up after the events of last year’s first installment, pushing the story deeper into the moral and political fault lines of Oz. The sequel follows Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) after she has been declared the Wicked Witch and forced into hiding. As she works covertly to expose the Wizard’s lies and the oppression of Animals in Oz, Glinda (Ariana Grande) ascends as the regime’s celebrated “Good Witch” and and the Wizard and Madame Morrible intensify their hunt for Elphaba.\n\n\t“Oz has never felt more great and powerful than it does in ‘Wicked: For Good,’ Variety film critic Peter Debruge wrote in his review, adding that the “art nouveau-style sets and ornate costumes are nothing short of astonishing.”\n\n\tThe film didn’t receive a Golden Globe nomination this year for Best Picture but received five nods including for two original songs (“No Place Like Home” & “The Girl in the Bubble”) for Cynthia Erivo.\n\n\n\tRent/purchase “Wicked: For Good” on digital here, and stream “Wicked” on Peacock here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tAs the calendar flips and viewers once again choose between braving the cold or celebrating from the couch, television networks are rolling out their annual New Year’s Eve spectacles. This year’s lineup includes a mix of musical performances, celebrity hosts and live countdowns designed to carry audiences into the new year. From “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” to Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen’s more PG-13 CNN special, here’s a look at the biggest New Year’s Eve broadcasts airing this year and how to stream them live at home.\n\n\t\n\t\t‘Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve’\t\n\n\tABC once again anchors the night with “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve,” the most watched New Year’s Eve program on television. Hosted by Ryan Seacrest, the long-running special kicks off in primetime and stretches through midnight, offering a steady parade of chart-topping performances and live check-ins from Times Square and other U.S. cities before culminating in the iconic ball drop. Cable-cutters can watch the broadcast live via streaming TV services that carry ABC, including DirecTV, Sling TV, Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.\n\n\tOver on cable, CNN continues to position itself as the looser, adult-leaning alternative with “CNN New Year’s Eve Live,” hosted by Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen. Broadcasting live from Times Square, this year’s special promises special guests such as Brandi Carlisle, Sarah Squirm, Leanne Morgan and Patti LaBelle.  The broadcast will air live on CNN and is also available to stream through live-TV streaming bundles such as DirecTV, Hulu + Live TV and Sling TV (with the news add-on).\n\n\t\n\t\t‘New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash’\t\n\n\tCBS offers a different flavor of celebration with New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash, which broadcasts from downtown Nashville and leans heavily into country music and live performances. Airing in primetime on CBS, the concert-style special doubles as a showcase for the network’s music-event programming strategy and has become a reliable alternative for viewers less interested in Times Square spectacle. The show streams live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime, while CBS affiliates also carry the broadcast over the air.\n\t\n\t\t‘A Toast to the New Year’ \t\n\n\tNBC rounds out the major-network offerings with “A Toast to the New Year,” which this year reunites former “Today” co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush. The dynamic duo will take a look back at the year’s most memorable moments, with special guest appearances from Howie Mandel, Kristin Chenowethm Ethan Slater, Jim Gaffigan and more. The broadcast airs live on NBC and is available to stream in real time on Peacock for subscribers.\n",

That’s the season’s second-best weekly total after its debut with 59.6 million views in November, which was Netflix’s best-ever opening week for an English-language title. \n\t\n\n\tIt should be noted that Netflix does not separate viewership of each volume when it reports the Top 10; while the 59.6 million-hour debut after Thanksgiving represented the total number of viewing hours divided by the runtime of the first four episodes, this week’s 34.5 million views were calculated based on all seven available episodes. Therefore, it isn’t possible to know whether Volume 1 or Volume 2 had a bigger debut. \n\n\n\tThere is still one episode left of “Stranger Things” Season 5. In a surprising move from Netflix, the series finale will debut in movie theaters on New Year’s Eve with a concurrent release on the streamer. \n\n\tIt can be expected that “Stranger Things” Season 5 will soon join Netflix’s list of its most popular English-language TV titles of all time given the new entry’s strong performance thus far. The season isn’t yet eligible for that list given the upcoming finale, but the Dec. 31 release will then begin the 91-day clock through which it will be able to accrue viewership that counts towards the chart. \n\t\n\n\tMore to come…\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\t“Tron: Ares” will park its light cycle at Disney+, as the movie arrives on the streamer on Jan. 7.\n\n\tThe science-fiction film is the third in the “Tron” franchise, following the 1982 original and its 2010 sequel, “Tron: Legacy.” It focuses on a powerful AI being called Ares that travels from the eponymous digital program into the real world. Jared Leto stars as the personified AI alongside Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Jodie Turner-Smith, Hasan Minhaj, Arturo Castro, Gillian Anderson and Jeff Bridges, who reprises his role as protagonist Kevin Flynn from the previous two movies. The film was directed by Joachim Rønning.\n\t\n\n\tDisney released “Tron: Ares” in theaters on Oct. 10, 2025. It opened to $60 million at the global box office, toppling its competitor “Roofman,” which opened that same weekend. However, it dropped precipitously in its second week, when its No. 1 spot was usurped by “Black Phone 2.”\n\n\n\tIn total, “Tron: Ares” grossed $142 million at the worldwide box office, falling short of “Tron: Legacy,” which grossed $400 million 15 years prior.\n\n\tThe original “Tron,” directed by Steven Lisberger, grossed $50 million in 1982. Though it received mixed reviews, it was a pioneering film for visual effects, endorsing a unique aesthetic that combined live-action footage, backlight animation, rotoscoping and early CGI. The sequels forwent the original’s singular look for more contemporary digital effects. \n\n\tIn addition to “Tron: Legacy” and “Tron: Ares,” “Tron” also inspired the 2012 animated series, “Tron: Uprising,” which aired on Disney XD for two seasons. \n\t\n\n\tBoth “Tron” and “Tron: Legacy” are also available to stream on Disney+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJack White had some strong words for Republican Congressman Tim Burchett after the politician shared an AI-generated video of the singer likening Trump supporters to fascists.\n\n\tBurchett, who is a sitting politician in White’s home state of Tennessee, reposted a fake video on X that showed the rocker saying, “Don’t even think about listening to my music, you fascists.” Along with his post, Burchett commented, “That cute girl from the Addams Family got really ugly and angry.” Later, when one user noted that the video wasn’t real, Burchett doubled down and responded, “You mean it’s not the girl from the Addams Family?”\n\t\n\n\tWhite did not take kindly to Burchett’s initial post, publishing a long screed on Instagram that blasted the politician. “What kind of joke are we all living in now?” he wrote. “All of Trump’s lackeys and bootlicks like this elected official are cowards that would never talk this way to anybody like me or you in person. Trump really lowered the bar when he brought his scourge to this government. Neither him nor his sycophantic congressmen and women manifest class or dignity, they all just regurgitate cheap, childish, grade school bullying points and fake christian(!) rhetoric.\n\n\n\t“It’s really sad how embarrassing our leadership has become, I so wish the average American conservative could have a conversation with any intelligent people in other countries around the world, just for one brief moment, and actually see just what a joke our government (and by proxy our country) has become,” he continued. “All down to giving power and a soapbox to low class playground bullies the likes of Trump and Congressman Burchett. The great state of Tennessee deserves better Mr. Burchett but you and your cult are too dug in and blinded to even realize it.”\n\t\n\n\tThough White clearly did not say what was portrayed in the AI video, he has been an outspoken critic of Trump and the administration. In August, he called Trump a danger “not just to America but the entire world” and got into a back-and-forth with the White House. In September 2024, White and his White Stripes band member Meg White filed a lawsuit against Trump, accusing him of “flagrant misappropriation” for using their song “Seven Nation Army” in a social media post.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichael Lippman, who worked with David Bowie, George Michael, Matchbox Twenty and other top stars as a manager, lawyer or label executive, died Monday at age 79. No cause of death was immediately given.\n\n\tIn later years Lippman was best known for serving as a manager to Michael, first at the peak of his fame during the “Faith” era in the late 1980s, and then again, after a 17-year gap, beginning in the mid-2000s.\n\n\n\tBut his first major notoriety came in his stint as attorney and, briefly, manager for Bowie from 1971 through 1975, with the rock star even living at Lippman’s home during the “Station to Station” period before an abrupt split.\n\t\n\n\tAfter his experience with Bowie, Lippman switched gears and took a label role as VP of west coast operations for Arista Records for three years into the late ’70s, after having become friendly with the imprint’s founder while making a deal for Patti Smith to join the label. “Clive Davis was the boss and I always thought my job was to take people to lunch and dinner for a living, and I did it very well,” he quipped. More seriously, perhaps, Lippman said Davis “really made an impact on me. I never saw a man work that hard and that long every day. He’d be in the office until nine or 10 o’clock and then would have ­dinner. He inspired me to put in the time.”\n\n\tAt Arista, Lippman worked closely with artists like Melissa Manchester. He took credit for forcing the Oscars to allow Manchester to sing two best-song-nominated numbers on the Academy Awards telecast in 1980, a first (the songs being “Through the Eyes of Love” from “Ice Castles” and “I’ll Never Say Goodbye” from “The Promise,” both of which she had sung on the original soundtracks).  \n\t\n\n\tLippman was an innovator in seeing a need for producers and songwriters to have managers just as recording artists did.\n\n\t“What I saw was that record producers and songwriters were really treated like low men on the totem pole and represented by a lawyer but never a manager,” he recalled in a 2010 interview. “I realized they’re artists in their own right and need to make sure their deals are done properly and their records they make are worked. That’s what I did and started a company representing producers and songwriters.”\n\n\tIn 1980, he began managing producer Ron Nevison, and soon took on Elton John’s writing collaborator, Bernie Taupin, in a professional partnership that lasted for 37 years.\n\n\tLippman saw the advent of so-called 360 deals as a natural extension of the cross-platform interest he had always taken in developing artists as a manager.\n\n\t“That’s what I’ve always done, taking are of all aspects of my artists’ career from touring to merchandising to selling records to making videos,” he said. “I’m a unique breed when it comes to managers who have the experience on the business and the creative/marketing side. In the old days record companies would tell (managers) ‘Don’t talk to radio stations or TV stations!’ That was their control. I built these incredible relationships with TV and radio around the world. Now a manager’s role is more important than ever in marketing an artist. Our motto is always to try to do something that no one’s ever done before. I’ve always been an international manager and it was always important for us to sell records worldwide, tour worldwide and market our artists worldwide. I still think you have to go to all of those territories, but it’s easier to do it on a worldwide basis with the internet.”\n\n\tLippman began working with his son, Nick, in an official partnership in 2004, under the name Lippman Entertainment. \n\n\t“I believe I’m the luckiest guy in the world to have been able to work with my two sons and my brother in the same business,” he said in a Billboard profile in 2016. “At the same time, I wasn’t the greatest father because I was always on the road. So now that I have the opportunity to see them every day and work side by side, it’s been incredible. Nicholas is my best friend today.”\n\t\n\n\tLippman is survived by his wife, Nancy, and two sons, Nick and Josh.\n\n\tHis sons offered respective statements to Rolling Stone. “Michael was my mentor and the greatest teacher,” said Nick Lippman. “For over twenty years, we traveled the world and shared a bond that grew deeper with time. We spoke every day and often finished each other’s sentences. Our relationship was shaped by the work we did side by side, and a bond of love, trust and mutual respect.”\n\n\tSaid Josh Lippman, “Dad was a relentless advocate for his clients, his friends and his family. He was the person you wanted in your corner in any situation. He transitioned from bulldog to effortless charmer on a dime, often multiple times in a conversation, and never met a challenge he couldn’t solve.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCanadian romance novelist Rachel Reid first saw Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams in person on the set of “Heated Rivalry,” Jacob Tierney’s television adaptation of her queer hockey book series “Game Changers.”\n\n\t“They were filming the very first sex scene, their first hookup and it’s the longest sex scene on the show,” Reid tells me. “It was a closed set, so I was just sitting on a couch for four hours while they did that. I had headphones, so I could hear it and I had read the script, but I couldn’t see it. I was just listening. I was listening to them pretend to have sex for four hours, and I didn’t really know them, so that was weird.\n\t\n\n\t“I do remember Hudson saying, ‘Should I keep my socks on?’” she continues. “I was nodding, but nobody could see me. I’m glad he did.”\n\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” stars Storrie as Russian hockey star Ilya Rozanov and Williams as his archrival Shane Hollander. The six-episode series follows the two men as they carry on a secret years-long affair before eventually falling in love.\n\n\tThe show became a runaway hit as soon as HBO Max, which acquired the series for U.S. distribution from Canadian streamer Crave, dropped the first two episodes over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n\tOn set, Storrie tapped Reid on the shoulder to introduce himself. “He looked so much like Ilya and he speaks with a Russian accent all day while on set,” Reid recalls. “He was asking all these thoughtful questions about the character. I couldn’t even talk to him because it’s like I’m explaining Ilya to Ilya. It was very weird, but I could tell right away he was really smart and funny and charming. He’s so talented and fearless. I mean, introducing yourself to the author for the first time while doing a Russian accent is, I think, a fearless choice.”\n\t\n\n\tShe watched Williams film the moments before Shane and Ilya have their initial tryst in a hotel room. “He was turning the lamp on and off waiting for Ilya to come for the first hookup,” Reid says. “He had no lines, but I was like, ‘Oh, that’s Shane.’”\n\n\tIn just over a month, Storrie and Williams have become household names, the series has been greenlit for a second season and several of Reid’s novels have become New York Times bestsellers.\n\n\t“I’ve been asked to speak at the University of Cambridge,” Reid says. “I write hockey smut. I’m not Kurt Vonnegut. They were like, ‘We’ve had Robert De Niro and the Dalai Lama.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, and me — I fit right in there.’”\n\n\tI caught up with Reid over Zoom from her home in Nova Scotia. “I’ll warn you, I think I’m still in shock,” she says. “I don’t know if I could speak coherently about any of this, but I’ll try.”\n\n\tWhen you initially talked to Jacob, was there any discussion of you having any sort of creative control or a say in what he does?\n\n\tThe first conversation I had with him, I could tell he understood the characters so well and the story so well. He laid out his whole vision for the show, and that really is exactly what everybody just watched. That’s how he described it to me. He wanted that Scott and Kip episode. We talked about what we were going to have to do to make sure we got everything right, how the sex was going to have to be an important part of the show and it was going to have to be explicit. He wouldn’t do it if he couldn’t do that. As soon as we had that first conversation, I was like, “You know what? He knows exactly what he’s doing. I’m not even worried about it.” I wasn’t really pushy at all. He just wanted me to read the scripts and I was really excited to do that. Obviously, he was very capable of doing this without my help, but he still included me. They [Tierney, Williams and Storrie] continued throughout all of the media and everything mentioning me and the books. I really appreciate that because I don’t think a lot of authors get that.\n\n\tWhich casting did you know about first?\n\n\tConnor was first. I didn’t even hear about another possibility for Ilya. If there was one, I didn’t know about it. I know that Jacob was very excited about Connor. But it was a thing where we said that he pretty much has to be actually Russian because if he’s not, it’s going to be so distracting. People will be able to tell. The whole thing falls apart if he’s not believably Russian. So when he told me, “Well, he’s American and does not have Russian heritage, but he’s really good,” I was like, “Well, OK, if you say so.” I think it took a little longer to find Hudson, but as soon as they did their chemistry read, Jacob was very excited about it. I can’t even imagine what other actors would’ve been like.\n\t\n\n\tWhen you saw Connor and Hudson, did they look like what you were imagining when you were writing Ilya and Shane?\n\n\tAt first, not quite, because I was just looking at still images of them [on Instagram]. Hudson had a lot of pictures where he looked like a badass and he was smoking or showing off all of his tattoos. I was like, “I’m not seeing it.” But then as soon as I met them on set, I was like, “Yep, they’re actually perfect.”\n\n\tWriting is such a solitary profession. What is it like going from being by yourself writing to now having all these eyes and attention on you?\n\n\tIt’s overwhelming. Authors don’t want to be looked at. It’s not a natural thing. I used to be in a rock band, and that’s an art that you make where you get your audience feedback right away live and you can feed off of it. But writing, even if it’s big and popular and you know a lot of people are reading it, you don’t know about it. You don’t get that feedback really until something like this happens. And then suddenly it’s like, “Oh, I can actually get mobbed sometimes.” People are just very excited to meet me in a way that kind of confuses me, but I’m trying to get used to it.\n\n\tHave you spoken to Jacob about what you’d like to see in Season 2?\n\n\tI think we’re on the same page about it. Obviously, the focus has to stay on Ilya and Shane. We’re not going to do Season 2 and it’s a totally different couple. It wouldn’t be very popular. Not that we weren’t expecting it, but I think we’re all surprised at how popular Scott and Kip were. So now it’s, “OK, how do you get more Scott and Kip?” I think it’s going to be mostly “The Long Game.” Jacob’s already said that in interviews, but there’s another book “Role Model” that kind of overlaps it. So I’m hoping that we’ll get both stories told at the same time. I don’t think there’s another way you could do it. I’m hoping we get more episodes.\n\n\tHow many episodes do you want?\n\n\tI’d go as high as 12, but maybe if it was just eight or 10, that would be nice.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrendan Brady, Jacob Tierney, Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova, Dylan Walsh, Hudson Williams, Connor Storrie, Christina Chang and Rachel Reid attend the premiere of “Heated Rivalry” at TIFF Lightbox on November 24, 2025 in Toronto, Ontario. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDo you have a group of gay friends who you have ask you to read your writing, specifically the sex scenes, to make sure they’re realistic?\n\t\n\n\tI don’t send them writing. Actually, I realized when the show came out that a lot of my gay male friends have never read my books because they’re all obsessed with the show and they were all on their edge of their seats. They couldn’t believe things that were happening. I was like, “So you’ve not read the books?” I have discussions with them. I don’t like showing anybody my writing until it’s done. My husband is somebody that I can send them to because he is bisexual and does know what it’s like to have sex with men. So that’s somebody I can bounce things off of. But mostly I just talk to people and get information that way.\n\n\tWill there ever be a “Heated Rivalry” Broadway musical?\n\n\tI hope so, because I still hold the stage rights to that. It was the thing that when I signed the contract, I was like, “Yeah, that’ll never happen.” But now I’m like, “Maybe.” We’re talking about all sorts of things right now. I was saying to Hudson a couple weeks ago that it feels like we could do literally anything. It just seems like we have too much power and we also have the power to destroy ourselves very easily. We could take it all down with one bad post, one bad tweet. We could destroy the whole show and everybody’s lives. I was just like, “This is too much power.”\n\n\tYou have talked about being diagnosed with Parkinson’s at the same time Jacob approached you about the television adaptation. How is your health today?\n\n\tIt’s making it hard to write because I can barely control a mouse. I can’t type for very long. It’s hard for me to sit in a chair for very long. I need to figure out new ways to write. I don’t know if that will be voice to text. I don’t know if I can write that way. It doesn’t feel natural, but I need to figure out something because it is taking me a very long time to write now. But an amazing thing that’s come out of this though is Jacob was on CNN a few weeks ago. For whatever reason, the interviewer asked him about my Parkinson’s diagnosis. I thought it was kind of odd, but then the next day, one of the top Parkinson’s experts in the world reached out to me and asked if he could help me. I’ve never gotten to talk to a Parkinson’s expert. I’ve been on a five-year waiting list here because I live in a very small place. Now he’s found me a Parkinson’s expert, a neurologist, and I have an appointment in a couple weeks. That could change things for me because I’m not really getting the treatment that I should be getting. He also told me how to change my medication so I can sleep because I never slept. That change made me sleep through the night, which really helps with writing.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBelieve it or not, two of broadcast TV’s biggest events aren’t even in primetime. They also happen to pretty much bookend the year: ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Years Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest” opened 2025 with record numbers, while NBC scored another big win last month with the 99th “Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.”\n\n\tKicking off the year by peaking with 29 million viewers at midnight as 2024 turned into 2025, “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest” continues to be a juggernaut as viewers watch the ball drop in Times Square. \n\t\n\n\tRELATED: The 100 Most-Watched Telecasts of 2025: Super Bowl, ‘Tracker,’ ’60 Minutes’ and the ‘Dancing With the Stars’ Season Finale\n\n\n\tThe telecast has turned into an all-night event, encompassing both primetime and late night elements (and for the 2026 edition, led by guest Diana Ross, will include a Central Time Zone countdown for the first time). But the main portion, of course, is still the 11:30 p.m. ET to 1:09 a.m. telecast. For the Dec. 31, 2024 — Jan. 1, 2025 edition of “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve,” the special’s Part 1 averaged 17.9 million viewers with a 4.73 rating among adults 18-49, according to Nielsen. Viewership peaked during the midnight quarter-hour, reaching a total of 21.5 million and an 18-49 rating of 5.70. \n\n\t“New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” continued its reign as the most-watched New Year’s Eve show on television, reaching an audience 2.5 times the size of its closest competition at 11:30, CBS’ “New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash.” “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” was easily the No. 1 program of the night, and was ABC’s most-watched entertainment telecast since the 2024 Oscars. \n\t\n\n\tRELATED: Top-Rated Television Networks: Ranking 2025’s Winners and Losers\n\n\tHere were a few more of the year’s big broadcast TV events:\n\n\tGOLDEN GLOBES (Jan. 5): The 82nd Golden Globes averaged 10.23 million viewers on CBS, placing the ceremony among the top 100 primetime telecasts of the year for the first time since 2020.

Hosted once again by Trevor Noah, the ceremony focused on fundraising efforts to help support those impacted by the L.A. fires — raising more than $25 million in the process. Variety‘s Chris Willman called it the best Grammys in years in his review of the telecast. \n\n\tSNL50: THE ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL (Feb. 16): An average of 16.52 million people caught the three-hour “SNL50: The Anniversary Special” on Feb. 16, making the show second (only behind the Oscars) as the most-watched primetime entertainment event of the year.\n\n\tOSCARS (March 2): The 97th Oscars, hosted by Conan O’Brien, Back on March 10, an average of 20.99 million people in live+7 watched “Anora” win the best picture prize — up from 20.2 million in 2024, and larger jumps from 19.4 million in 2023 and 17.6 million in 2022.\n\n\tOPRY 100 (March 19): The event posted an average of 6.32 million viewers on NBC.\n\n\tAMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS (May 26): This year’s American Music Awards on CBS, hosted by Jennifer Lopez, averaged 5.52 million viewers in Nielsen live+7, making it the telecast’s largest performance since 2019.

    "body": "\n\tTatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of John F. Kennedy who chronicled her blood cancer battle in a devastating recent New Yorker column, died Tuesday. She was 35. \n\n\tThe JFK Library Foundation announced her death, writing on behalf of her family, “Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts.” The social media message was signed George, Edwin and Josephine Moran (her husband and children) and Kennedy family members Ed, Caroline, Jack, Rose and Rory.\n\t\n\n\tSchlossberg was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia after her daughter was born in 2024. In a widely read New Yorker essay published in November, she revealed that it had become a form of terminal cancer. \n\n\n\tIn the essay, she brutally took aim at Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his health policies. \n\n\t“In August, 2024, he suspended his campaign and endorsed Donald Trump, who said that he was going to ‘let Bobby go wild’ on health. My mother wrote a letter to the Senate, to try and stop his confirmation; my brother had been speaking out against his lies for months. I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having worked in medicine, public health, or the government,” Schlossberg wrote.\n\n\tSchlossberg was a climate and energy reporter at the New York Times, and left in 2017. She wrote about the dead bear cub found in Central Park in 2014, and didn’t realize it had been put there by her relative Robert F. Kennedy Jr. until he revealed it in 2024. Her book “Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don’t Know You Have” was published in 2019.\n\t\n\n\tSchlossberg’s mother was John F. Kennedy’s daughter Caroline Kennedy; her father was designer Edwin Schlossberg.\n\n\tShe is survived by her husband George Moran and two young children. \n",

According to a police report taken by the Miami Beach Police Department, the reality star was waiting for her order when a male approached and started making \"inappropriate remarks toward her,\" which she told cops she ignored.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to the report, a female accompanying the male apparently became agitated and struck her on her right cheek. Police said the couple then left the scene in a white Mercedes.\n      \n\n          Escobar tells us she ended up in the hospital, where she says doctors determined she suffered a concussion. Now, she says she's resting at home and taking a break from the internet.\n      \n    \n          The Miami Beach Police tell TMZ ... they are actively investigating the incident but no arrests have been made.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Instagam/@yulissaescobar\n          \n    \n          Escobar speculates it might be related to the backlash she received during her short time on \"Love Island USA\" -- but she isn't sure. But Escobar says she's now \"walking in fear\" and worried she may be in harm's way.\n      \n    \n          Escobar exited 'Love Island' before the second episode of Season 7 after videos surfaced online showing her using the R-word while discussing her drama with men.

The two walked hand-in-hand Monday on the way to the dinner in Miami, Florida.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The \"Miss Understood with Rachel Uchitel\" podcast host first crossed paths with her businessman beau through the dating app Bumble. While they matched years ago, they didn't meet in person until 2024.\n      \n\n          And 8 months after their first in-person meeting, they were engaged.\n      \n    \n          Their March engagement announcement came just after Tiger Woods confirmed his new relationship with Vanessa Trump. Vanessa is Donald Trump Jr.'s ex-wife and Donald Trump's former daughter-in-law.\n      \n    \n          Rachel’s clearly found her happily-ever-after now, but we all know her intro to the limelight was anything but smooth -- she’s infamous for her 2009 affair with Tiger while he was still married to Elin Nordegren.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Dan Donovan\n              \n                          \n                Rachel Uchitel\n              \n                          \n                Tiger Woods\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Weddings\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

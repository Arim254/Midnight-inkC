    "body": "\n\t“I’ve been plugged into some sort of matrix,” Jonathan Bailey says to David Corenswet. “I feel like I’ve been slowly working on the hardware over the years, but the software has just been accidentally upgraded exponentially.”\n\n\tThe “Wicked: For Good” star is enjoying his newfound fame, but he’s struggling to make sense of it. He shares that feeling with Corenswet, who ushered in a new era of superhero movies earlier this year with “Superman,” the summer blockbuster directed by DC Studios co-chief James Gunn. Bailey, 37, and Corenswet, 32, both began acting as children of the theater and expected to have humble careers. Instead, they’ve become heartthrobs — with Corenswet’s dark hair and strong jaw earning him Clark Kent comparisons years before he booked the role and Bailey recently being crowned as People’s first openly gay Sexiest Man Alive — at the center of box office smashes. But as they marvel at their own successes and each other’s, their most profound similarity isn’t their career trajectories. It’s their earnestness.\n\t\n\n\tDavid Corenswet: I said to James Gunn, “If you wanted somebody cool, you should have hired somebody else.” And he was like, “Oh, believe me. I know.”\n\n\n\tJonathan Bailey: That’s a really good place to start. What is cool these days?\n\n\tCorenswet: Not caring. “It doesn’t matter what happens, because I’m cool.” That’s what cool is, and that’s why I reject it outright.\n\n\tBailey: But I think you’re cool. Because you care. “Superman” felt like a very honest version of integrity, and therefore values, and therefore cool. The hero was fallible and sees the world in a different way. The thought processes were very scientific.\n\t\n\n\tCorenswet: Scientific curiosity does take a willingness to look a little foolish by trying really hard. James is that way in life, and especially with his movies.\n\n\tBailey: When you get the call for “Superman” — presumably no one’s ever mentioned that to you before in your life, because that was a wild casting against type — must’ve been crazy.\n\n\tCorenswet: Well, when I got the audition, I was standing on a ladder changing a light fixture. My agent said, “We think you know what this is about.” I said, “Is it ‘Top Gun 3’? What am I waiting for?” I really was not expecting it, although I think other people thought that I should be expecting it. Just statistically speaking, it feels completely impossible.\n\n\tBailey: We’ve got things in common, haven’t we?\n\n\tCorenswet: Theater is one of them.\n\n\tBailey: And from a young age. How old were you when you started?\n\n\tCorenswet: I was 9 when I did my first professional play in Philadelphia. I played Bert in “All My Sons.” I had two scenes in the first act, and then I fuck off before intermission to go home to bed so I can wake up for school the next morning. One of the adult actresses, when the gunshot goes off at the end of the play, she would squeeze my shoulders. And I always thought, “I’m not sad.” I was so happy to be there. At some point my dad explained to me, “She’s not trying to comfort you. I think she’s trying to comfort herself.” I remember, as the lights came up, seeing the faces of the audience light up with relief at seeing this 9-year-old boy running out all carefree after this sad ending. That was when it struck me.\n\n\tBailey: The crackle of energy, and how it can change.\n\n\tCorenswet: That in-person, immediate impact was quite intoxicating for a 9-year-old kid. I liked school, but I didn’t understand why it all felt like “Because next year, and because next year, and then you want to get into a good school” — and it all sort of fades off in the distance. With the theater, you need to go to rehearsals, because in three weeks there’s going to be a paying audience, and if you don’t know your lines, you can imagine how that’s going to feel. It wasn’t for some other reason. It wasn’t to get the next part.\n\n\tBailey: No. It was to be there and maximize the experience with the people around you. With that in mind about theater, the performances in “Superman” are so brilliant. The long scenes with you and Rachel [Brosnahan], they play out like theater scenes.\n\t\n\n\tCorenswet: And we rehearsed them like theater. That was when I realized that I had not done a deal with the devil in taking this big role. I was actually sort of returning home. Let’s talk about “Wicked: For Good,” because I think there’s some interesting parallels here too.\n\n\tBailey: Jon M. Chu and James Gunn must’ve been in a room together. Jon was someone who, probably like James, could see it all in his head and would know how to invite the right people.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCorenswet: You would think those are antithetical. James storyboards every shot of the movie, and with a musical like that, you’ve got to have a very clear vision. But then to invite people in, not to fit your vision, but to contribute in a real way — that’s much harder. You also shot two films back to back.\n\n\tBailey: At the same time. On a Monday, you’d be shooting Dr. Dillamond’s classroom in the first film, and then on Wednesday, it would be “For Good,” the duet at the end of the second film. It’s testament to the two extraordinary women playing those two roles [Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande], because they were so locked in with Jon. It’s great when you’re playing a supporting role where you know your job is making your contribution, but mostly you don’t want to fuck up the process that’s already going on.\n\n\tCorenswet: What was your singing prep?\n\n\tBailey: Being in a film like this, you get these extraordinary experts who are there to gift you technique and time. We’ve actually trained with the same physical trainer, Paolo.\n\n\tCorenswet: I forgot we have Paolo in common. Love you, Paolo!\n\n\tBailey: If you think about your — forgive me. I assume your body wasn’t — I mean, maybe you were born Superman?\n\n\tCorenswet: No, no, no. I was what one of my high school crushes very unaffectionately described as a string bean.\n\n\tBailey: Some people are Popeye, and some people are Olive Oyl.\n\n\tCorenswet: And I was Olive Oyl. So yeah, I put on 40 pounds with Paolo.\n\n\tBailey: That’s incredible. But also, the process there, if you apply that to vocal training, you get the same [result]. For me, it’s about confidence. Those eight days of doing “Dancing Through Life” were some of the most extraordinary and toughest days I’ve had on a film set. Jon Chu had a baby, so we did one day without a director. You have to train that hard. There will be variables on the day. You might not sleep. You might have a cold. The director might have a baby. It’s so satisfying to really commit fully.\n\t\n\n\tCorenswet: And to have a good reason to put so much into it. I had always wanted to put on weight, and I would love to take singing lessons for six months, but when you’re not Cynthia Erivo or Ariana Grande, you feel like you might have a long way to go. The first couple months, maybe you don’t sound so good, or you’re not putting on so much weight.\n\n\tBailey: Trust the process. Something similar [between] “Superman” and “Wicked”: Like you said about Cynthia and Ari, it’s so easy with superhero films to go, “They’re just so talented. It’s a God-given gift.” Absolutely, yes, of course — but there’s years of honing craft.\n\n\tCorenswet: And they still have to warm up in the morning.\n\n\tBailey: Totally. Ari changed her whole tone and her voice, and Cynthia was training so that she could deliver that every single take. If it looks like it’s something that you were born to do, then you’ve done the work so well.\n\n\tCorenswet: Part of it is making it look easy.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBailey: There’s something about the values of Superman, and this version of Superman, that felt so alive and connected to the audience. Did you feel that?\n\n\tCorenswet: Yeah. It’s interesting, because there’s so many different measures of that. How do the cast and crew feel about the film? How does the director feel? The publicists, the agents and managers who get to watch it ahead of the release. The press. The screenings you do for diehard fans, people who really want to love it or have extremely high expectations and are easy to disappoint. And the people who are writing about it and who want to talk about the zeitgeist and how it fits in. And then you have the box office, which is just a measure of how many people buy tickets. You can tell a bunch of different stories depending on what you focus on.\n\n\tBailey: It’s a lot of noise, isn’t it? Because there’s only so much you have control over: the process and the making of it.\n\n\tCorenswet: When I leave set, I have done my work. To a certain extent, promoting the film is part of your work as well. But people can love the press tour and not love the film. My contribution happened a year ago when I was on set. It’s that thing of running out for my curtain call and seeing the audience’s face light up. That’s the feedback that tells you whether you’re on track or not. If my scene partner gets what they need from me, or if my director says “That was good. We’ve got it,” and even more importantly, if the crew is happy to see me — I like to put my energy there.\n\t\n\n\tBailey: It comes through on screen.\n\n\tCorenswet: Well, good. I don’t pretend to know how that happens, because so much happens between your performance and it showing up on screen. The edit. Color correction and sound design.\n\n\tBailey: I feel like you’ll probably, one day, write and direct.\n\n\tCorenswet: Probably. Do you have any interest in writing and directing?\n\n\tBailey: I’m in reverence to every person on set and every moment of the process, and actors come on set for 15% of the whole process. So it would be a great honor working with something all the way through.\n\n\tCorenswet: Is this your humble way of saying yes?\n\n\tBailey: I’m, like, wriggling nervously.\n\n\tCorenswet: I also think, as an actor, there is just a desire to be more involved. You are the last person to find anything out. And there’s a culture of protecting actors from too much information, which I think can hamstring us. I often get frustrated feeling like I want to contribute in this moment when we’re shooting the scene, but I don’t know why we’re shooting it in this room.\n\n\tBailey: There’s amazing footage of you and James having an extraordinary conversation. Obviously, this is coming with such privilege to be able to say this, but certain career paths are very restrictive. It feels entirely right to be curious all the time. And the conversation you had with James was so brilliant because — godGod, this is such a nerd thing to say, but — I always think there should be tension, but not friction. And that was such a good example. It was actually kind of vulnerable. You have to be able to make those mistakes.\n\n\tCorenswet: I love that. Tension without friction. Because friction creates unnecessary heat.\n\n\tBailey: And it’s not economic. You hemorrhage energy, whereas tension holds energy.\n\n\tCorenswet: I feel so lucky that that is on film, and it was interesting hearing from people what they thought of it — everything from, “Well, that’s what always happens,” all the way to, “What a terrible working environment.” For me, it does happen all the time. It was amazing how indefatigable James was. He very rarely got fed up with me, because I think he knew that the reason I’m having those conversations with him is, at my boldest, because I think I might see something that he doesn’t see and he might value. I never want any director to say, “Fine. If you need that, go do it.” I’m not doing it just for me. I might see something here that you actually like, and then you’ll feel like it’s yours.\n\t\n\n\tBut on the other end, I don’t know how to do a good job otherwise. I got this criticism in theater school quite a lot, and that was a good lesson to learn. As an actor you do need to let go. As a young actor, you’re sort of waiting to feel ready to make the action. There’s a practice of just, “Walk before you’re ready to walk. Just say the line before you’re ready to say the line.”\n\n\tBailey: That’s what we do as humans, isn’t it?\n\n\tCorenswet: I think we do it at our most interesting. And as actors, you don’t want to just be human. You want to be humans at their most interesting, dynamic, dramatic moments. Drama is life with all the boring bits cut out.\n\n\tLet me ask you this. Sexiest Man Alive. Where do you go from here?\n\n\tBailey: No. Okay. [Laughing nervously, he turns to the director and gestures to cut.] It was so lovely to chat. OK.\n\n\tCorenswet: “Wicked: For Good” is fucking fantastic. You fly in this movie.\n\n\tBailey: We both kiss levitating!\n\n\tCorenswet: Yes. But you have the bigger challenge. As the man, and as Sexy Man — and that’s not me saying that — which magazine does Sexiest Man Alive?\n\n\tBailey: All of them. Horse & Hound.\n\n\tCorenswet: Anyway, Sexiest Man Alive, you are carried by Cynthia. She’s levitating you. Every man out there would think there’s no way you can look masculine and powerful and in control when you’re being levitated by a woman. And you, in that moment when she’s lifting you by your fucking massive arms, maintained your masculinity. Well done, mate. Because it’s a lot easier when you’re carrying the girl.\n\n\tBailey: I mean, listen, I’d be carried by both Cynthia and Ari for the rest of my life if I could be. I was like, “Oh, shit” when I saw your kiss at the end [of “Superman”]. My favorite moment of chemistry is the chuckle.\n\n\tCorenswet: James, when I was doing that chuckle when she says, “I love you too,” he came up to me and said, “It’s not working. It needs to be solemn.” I was like, “No! The whole point is, ‘I fucking know that you love me.’” Credit to James. He was right on 90% of everything, but on that one, he saw that chuckle was a very truthful thing.\n\n\tBailey: That is what makes a leading man smash it out of the park.\n\n\tCorenswet: So how do you top Sexiest Man Alive?\n\t\n\n\tBailey: Ugliest.\n\n\t[They stand up to say goodbye.]\n\n\tCorenswet: Should we kiss or something?\n\n\tThis is a conversation from Variety and CNN’s Actors on Actors.

    "body": "\n\tAudiences returned to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza in force, turbocharging a traditionally sleepy post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office. \n\n\t“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” the second film inspired by Scott Cawthon’s popular horror game franchise, easily captured first place, opening to $63 million domestically. That topped projections that had the film debuting to between $35 million to $40 million, though it does pale in comparison to the $80 million that “Five Nights at Freddy’s” launched to in 2023. What made that result all the more impressive was that the first film simultaneously debuted in theaters and on Peacock. It went on to gross nearly $300 million on a $20 million budget. \n\t\n\n\tStill, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” is an undeniable win for Universal, which released the film, and for Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, which produced the picture and really needed it to work after slogging through an uncharacteristic rough patch. Blumhouse-Atomic Monster is one of Hollywood’s biggest hitmakers, producing everything from “The Purge” movies to “Get Out,” but the company’s had a bruising 2025, releasing duds like “M3GAN 2.0,” “Wolf Man” and “Drop.” With last October’s hit, “Black Phone 2,” and now “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” the company seems to be turning a corner. \n\n\n\tThe film is the latest video game adaptation to connect with audiences, joining the likes of “A Minecraft Movie” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” \n\n\t“These video game adaptations are slaying at the box office,” says Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations.  “They have captured the attention of a younger generation of moviegoers like no other genre.”\n\t\n\n\t“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” was made for a lean $36 million. Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail and Piper Rubio return for the sequel, which follows a former pizzeria night guard who must face off against an array of animatronic killers. Emma Tammi, who directed the first film, was behind the camera for the follow-up. Internationally, “Five Nights at Freddy 2” earned an estimated $46 million from 76 markets, including Mexico, the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Italy and France. That brings it global total to $109 million. \n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2,” which dominated the Thanksgiving box office, settled for second place earning a sizable $43 million. The animated sequel is already one of the year’s biggest hits, having earned $220.5 million domestically and $915.8 million globally. It should easily top $1 billion in ticket sales.  \n\n\tAnother hit sequel, “Wicked: For Good,” captured third place with $15.6 million in its third weekend of release. That pushes its domestic gross to $295.8 million through Sunday. \n\n\tGkids’ “Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution,” which cuts together portions of the “Jujutsu Kaisen” anime series, debuted to an estimated $10.2 million, securing fourth place on the charts. Lionsgate’s “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” rounded out the top five, earning $3.5 million to bring its domestic haul to $55.3 million. \n\n\tOn the indie front, Sony Pictures Classics released “Merrily We Roll Along,” a filmed version of the hit Broadway production of the Stephen Sondheim musical, debuted to $1.2 million on 1,084 screens. The show starred Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe and Lindsay Mendez and won the Tony for best musical revival. \n\n\tFocus Features’ “Hamnet” expanded from 119 theaters to 744, earning $2.3 million. The acclaimed drama about William Shakespeare has earned $4.2 million since opening over Thanksgiving. It is expected to be a major Oscars contender. \n\n\tAlso of note, Quentin Tarantino’s super-sized “Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair,” which combines “Kill Bill: Vol. 1” and “Vol. 2” into one, four-and-a-half-hour epic, grossed an estimated $3.2 million. Much of the attention around QT lately hasn’t been about reviving The Bride, but on the backlash his dismissal of Paul Dano as “the limpest dick in the world” has generated. \n\t\n\n\tTheater owners, who have struggled through a rough fall filled with flop films, are hoping that holiday hits like “Wicked: For Good” and “Zootopia 2” along with upcoming blockbusters like “Avatar: Fire and Ash” will help them end a roller-coaster year on a high note. Overall, revenues are running roughly 1% ahead of 2024, which is a disappointment as many analysts expected this year to be more in line with pre-pandemic periods that saw ticket sales routinely top $9 billion annually. \n\n\t“Every film this holiday season is going to have to punch above its weight if we’re going to get anywhere close to that benchmark,” says Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at ComScore.\n\n\tBeyond a sluggish box office, movie theater operators are also facing existential questions after news broke this week that Netflix, long viewed as an enemy of the cinematic experience, has a deal to buy Warner Bros. for $82.7 million. The prospect of the streaming giant swallowing up one of the movie business’s most legendary studios has left exhibitors staring into the void. \n\n\t“Netflix is taking over one of the crown jewels of Hollywood, so you have to wonder if they will keep movies in theaters in a meaningful way or will they stay true to their business model, which has nothing to do with that,” says Bock. “Netflix already killed Blockbuster. Will they kill movie theaters too?” \n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a “Weekend Update” that featured jokes about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, a sunburned vacationer played by cast member Ben Marshall and how Netflix will jack up its prices to $50 million in order to buy Warner Bros., Sarah Sherman stole the show playing the drunk raccoon that (actually!) got wasted in a Virigina liquor store this week, and passed out in the bathroom.\n\n\t“Here to explain their actions is that drunk raccoon,” said Colin Jost.\n\t\n\n\tComing on to Jost, while writhing around the Update desk, the raccoon complained that it doesn’t have any privacy, as Jost said she has a “serious drinking problem.” She countered that the “problem being I can’t get drunk in a bathroom without people taking pictures of me face down, ass up!” \n\n\tWhen Jost asked her whether Bradley Cooper’s portrayal of Rocket Raccoon in Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies is considered a positive representation of raccoons, she said, “I wouldn’t know, I haven’t seen it — I’m not a virgin.”\n\n\tAfter saying she was starving and asking to DoorDash something, she said, “You know what’s actually good that you wouldn’t think is good? Poop!” When Jost seemed grossed out, she said, “Quiet, piggy.”\n\n\tJost then told her he thought raccoons ate only trash, and she said, “We hear what you call us. Trash pandas. Dumpster dogs. The Sarah Shermans of the forest.” To which Jost responded, “You’re not nearly as hairy as Sarah Sherman.”\n\n\tJost said she just hoped she got the help she needs for her drinking problem, and that he hoped she didn’t give him rabies. “Rabies is the last thing you need to worry about getting from me,” the raccoon said to Jost.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the sketch below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpeaking in conversation at the Red Sea Film Festival in Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong director and producer Stanley Tong (“Rumble in the Bronx”) traced the unlikely, injury-filled route that led him from stunt work to one of the most consequential collaborations in Jackie Chan’s career.\n\n\tTong began at the beginning, recalling how he first entered the film industry not behind a camera, but directly inside the action. After meeting Bruce Lee at age 11 through his brother-in-law, an actor, Tong began training in martial arts and gymnastics before becoming a stuntman in 1980. “I broke my shoulders, my ribs, my back, and my kneecap,” he said. “It’s not easy work. I had many stitches. My ankles got twisted many times on both sides.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter a severe shoulder injury, Tong said his mother pushed him to leave stunt work altogether. “She said, ‘Stanley, get a new job,’” he recalled. Instead, he followed advice to shift into production roles as a way to learn filmmaking inside out, starting with script supervisor, which the veteran director says allowed him to follow “every shot, every scene, every dialogue.” He added, “You’re right there watching how the director talks to the actor. This is a tip for anybody.”\n\n\n\tTong quietly continued doing stunt work to support himself while progressing through nearly every department, including assistant director, screenwriter, production manager and camera operator, before becoming a stunt coordinator in 1986, the same year he first trained Michelle Yeoh.\n\n\tReflecting on his ambitions, Tong said directing was not always the initial goal. “In Hong Kong at the time, a stunt coordinator was more powerful than the director,” he said. “You’ve got all the stuntmen behind you. You go everywhere, you feel more safe.” But after reaching that position, he realized directing, and eventually producing was the only way to fully shape a film.\n\t\n\n\tThat realization set the stage for a defining moment: being handed the script for “Police Story 3: Supercop,” starring Chan. Tong recalled walking into a studio meeting where, in a single day, he met Chan, studio executives, and the film distributor. “When I go back in the afternoon, they give me the script of ‘Police Story 3,’” he said.\n\n\tTurning to his collaboration with Chan, Tong admitted he was overwhelmed. “They said, ‘You be the director,’ and I said, ‘What about Jackie’s team?’ They said, ‘We won’t use it, just you,’” he recalled. “I didn’t reply for five days. I was very scared.”\n\n\tTong ultimately accepted after studying Chan’s films and recognizing a fundamental problem with the existing script, which centered on a gun-heavy robbery on Hong Kong streets. “We don’t have permission to shoot guns in Hong Kong,” Tong said. “The police won’t block the road. The producer and production manager could go to jail.”\n\n\tBecause “Police Story” entries one and two were already iconic, Tong felt repeating the same approach would be pointless. “If I shot ‘Police Story 3’ as it is, I don’t think I can do anything better than that,” he said. “So I told my boss, ‘Can I change the script?’ It was brave to ask.”\n\n\tTong proposed relocating the film to a location where authorities would allow helicopters, large-scale stunts and weapons. “Jackie deserved to have the biggest story,” he said. He also pushed to cast Yeoh as a true action co-lead. “In Jackie’s movies, you’ve never seen the girl fight,” Tong said. “So I talked to Jackie. Jackie liked the idea. The boss likes the idea.” From there, Tong said, the film was rebuilt from the ground up around that shift.\n\n\tThe rewritten “Police Story 3: Supercop” became a milestone, earning Chan his first Hong Kong Film Award for best actor and opening doors internationally. Looking back, Tong said the film’s impact came not from its scale, but from working within constraints. “As a filmmaker, you want to make dreams come true,” he said. “But you have to think about how to get through all these hurdles.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump didn’t throw much support behind Secretary of War Pete Hegseth in the cold open of the Dec. 6 episode of “Saturday Night Live.”\n\n\tColin Jost reprised his role as Hegseth, berating the press as they were asking about the United States’ strikes on boats that were alleged to be operated by narco-terrorists. After calling one journalist fat and berating another for being single, he made a less-than-believable denial that the military operation went as planned. \n\t\n\n\t“That kind of cruel, heartless act has no place in operation ‘Kill Everybody,'” Jost-as-Hegseth said. “Second, I wasn’t even in the room when it happened. OK, I was so jacked up after the first strike I had to make an emergency call to my sponsor … I’m sorry, a guy I met at an anonymous meeting. So I don’t drink something I want, but I can’t have. But I want it, and I need it and I want it right now. It’s booze.”\n\n\n\tHegseth then brought out James Austin Johnson’s Donald Trump as support, but the president was too busy sleeping and dreaming about newly elected NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani, mumbling that the politician can “freeze my rent anytime.”\n\n\tTrump then woke up enough to say, “I stand by Pete, and nothing can change my mind. Unless, of course, he could hurt me in any way, in which case I’ll throw him under one of Mamdani’s free buses.”\n\n\tMelissa McCarthy is the host of the Dec. 6 episode, with Dijon as the musical guest.\n\n\tWatch the cold open below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tLauded French actor Juliette Binoche, who is currently at the Red Sea Film Festival both as an honoree and to present her directorial debut “In-I in Motion,” praised Arab filmmakers Cherien Dabis (“All That’s Left of You”) and Shahad Ameen (“Hijra”) during a conversation event organized by Kering’s Women in Motion initiative. Binoche, who shared the panel with the directors, told Dabis and Ameen that, “in the Western world, we need to hear stories like yours.” \n\t\n\n\tSpeaking directly to Ameen following the Saudi director’s account of breaking into filmmaking during the rise of her country’s burgeoning film industry, the “Chocolat” actor said: “When a young woman from your country watches a film and wants to direct, it’s amazing. You’re so courageous. I think it’s remarkable.” \n\n\n\tThe panel, the first-ever “Kering | Women in Motion” event to take place at the Red Sea Film Festival, was preceded by a passionate speech by Kering’s chief brand officer Laurent Claquin. The French exec said being in Jeddah was “meaningful and inspiring,” particularly given 2025 marks ten years of the initiative that was first launched in Cannes back in 2025. “As we look for the next 10 years, our commitment remains unchanged: to stand with all those who dare to challenge boundaries and move forward. The Red Sea Film Festival in just a few editions has become far more than an event, it is a platform for creativity and bold expression, a place where artists from the region and all over the world bring their stories to life. We are really proud to be here this year.”\n\t\n\n\tThe talk revolved around the directors’ latest works, with Binoche recalling how her directorial debut started with advice from Robert Redford. The late U.S. actor-filmmaker watched the French actor’s stage show “In-I” in New York, and told her she must direct a film about its making. Redford’s wish came true 17 years later, with Binoche’s documentary on her creative process alongside dancer Akram Khan premiering at the San Sebastian Film Festival earlier this year. \n\n\tRedford was also somewhat involved in Dabis’ lauded drama, given it premiered back in January at the director’s Sundance Film Festival. Talking about the film, the Palestinian-American director said she wanted to tell a story “that has not been told about what happened to Palestinians in 1948,” when the Palestine War led to the Nakba. The Arabic word for “the catastrophe” is used to refer to the mass displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in order to establish the State of Israel. \n\n\t“The impact of displacement and occupation in different generations continues to this day,” added the director. “I wanted to really explore the human toll of all of these events that people have been reading about in the news for decades. Western media in particular has a way of dehumanizing Palestinians. For me, making this movie was a way of honoring Palestinians.” \n\n\tDabis said she feels there is “much more support for our Arab stories in Europe than the U.S.,” recalling how Arab filmmaking changed after 9/11. “As someone who was living in New York at that time, it felt like the Arab world was like, ‘Oh, we need to invest in our stories. We have to change the narrative and start making this a priority because our image is being shaped for us, and it’s not a good one.’”\n\n\t“I’ve gotten to watch the Arab world blossom in this way,” she continued, praising events like the former Dubai Film Festival, the work of the Doha Film Institute, and now the initiatives taking place at Red Sea. “It’s been really exciting to see.”\n\n\tAmeen felt in a full-circle moment at the panel, stating she was inspired to get into filmmaking as a young woman thanks to Dabis’ trailblazing work. “I saw ‘Amreeka’ in film school, and I bought it immediately,” the Saudi filmmaker told her now peer on stage. “I couldn’t wait because there were not enough films telling our stories. I saw your film and kept thinking: What can I do in the future?”\n\t\n\n\tThe Saudi filmmaker, whose “Hijra” premiered at the Venice Film Festival, appeared thrilled about premiering her film back home. “Saudi Arabia is the most exciting place on the planet to make films right now,” she said. “You can do whatever you want. There’s a place for every voice. I dislike it when Saudi filmmakers try to copy American films. Be yourself, be weird, be odd, and someone will recognize [it]. Having the opportunity to tell our stories is an incredible privilege.”\n\n\tTo that, Binoche enthusiastically said: “I think it’s wonderful. Go for it, baby! We’re waiting!” \n",

    "body": "\n\tSaudi filmmaker Shahad Ameen’s road movie “Hijra,” about the bond formed between different generations of Saudi women during a journey across the desert, delves deep into the country’s multi-cultural DNA, intending to show the country’s little known aspect “as a melting pot,” says the director.\n\n\t“Hijra,” which is Saudi’s Academy Award submission and is in competition at the Red Sea Film Festival this week, is the second feature from Ameen whose feminist fable “Scales” made a splash after launching from Venice in 2019.\n\t\n\n\tShot in a vast swathe of desert and in several Saudi cities and urban areas including Jeddah, Medina, AlUla and Neom, “Hijra” is set in 2001 and revolves around a Saudi grandmother named Sitti (Khayriya Nazmi) traveling from Taif to Mecca to perform the sacred ritual of Hajj with her two granddaughters Janna (Lamar Faden) and Sarah (Raghad Bokhari).\n\n\n\tThe ambitious film, which features stunning visuals of remote parts of Saudi, is a co-production between A Beit Ameen and Iraqi Independent Film Center Production in association with Ideation Studios, Film Clinic, Human Film, Daw’ Film – Film Commission | MOC, Noon Art Media Production and Three Arts.\n\n\tVariety speaks to Ameen about taking her vision as filmmaker to the next level with “Hijra” and depicting Saudi Arabia “in a very different way.”\n\n\tHow did this story germinate?\n\n\tI had this missing girl idea that I had been playing around with for years. I had a script about a younger sister looking for her older sister with her father in Jeddah. The whole script was ready to go. I wrote it after “Scales.” And then, all of a sudden, I hated it. I outgrew it. I thought it was childish. I threw it out. Then, years later, I was talking to my producer Mohamed Al-Daradji – we really collaborate a lot on writing – and he said: “Aren’t you tired of the [patriarchal] father story that you already did in “Scales”? What if you make a woman’s story with a grandmother in a multi-generational context? So that’s how it re-started.\n\t\n\n\tDo you have a personal connection to this story?\n\n\tWell my family – it’s not something I say a lot – but my father’s family are immigrants from China, fifth generation. So I thought: “what if the missing girl is an immigrant?” That became an exciting thread. Then, I went back to the earlier script and the best scene in that was when they passed a checkpoint through Mecca with all the pilgrims and all of that during Hajj. And suddenly everything was connected and it became a story about immigration. It’s a story about a girl trying to escape from her grandmother to a different country. \n\n\tTalk to me about casting Lamar Faden as the younger granddaughter Janna. She’s so expressive!\n\n\tI was talking to one of the film’s producers Faisal Baltyuor at the Red Sea festival and Lamar passed by with her sister. I said [to myself]: “Who is this girl?” And like a crazy person, I chased her and got her sister’s phone number. She really stayed in my mind. She was nine at the time. Then, a couple of years later, when we started casting I called her. She came do to a screen test with her sister and I was like: Oh my God! I knew I wanted her even before she started acting the scene! Then Lamar acted and I saw that my instinct was right. She was talented. And she has a very nice ethnicity as well. She has a grandmother who is Pakistani, and Indonesian heritage from the father’s side. So sometimes she looks super Saudi; sometimes she looks like she’s from Philippines; sometimes she looks like she’s from Mexico; sometimes she looks like she’s from Indonesia.\n\n\tThe film’s opening scene is quite symbolic. Ice is wiped away from the windshield of a bus headed to the holy land, and we meet Sarah, cloaked in a white abaya. Can you talk to me about how you conceived it?\n\n\tI wanted it to reflect how 20 years ago in Saudi you just couldn’t see a woman like you see a man. So the viewer should be able to do this gradually. You start to peek in slowly, a man is opening a curtain, and you are allowed to peek in a little bit to see what both of them are feeling. How they act around each other. And then we are allowed to enter into the lives of these three women.\n\n\tTalk to me about the choice of ice. It’s such a non-typical Saudi element.\n\n\tIn these areas, it gets very cold. They have to scrape the ice off the windshields of their cars. I know it might sound very mundane. But people, when they think of Saudi, they think desert, right? But we have incredible locations in Saudi like the south of Saudi Arabia and the north of Saudi Arabia are all mountainous areas with a very high altitude, you know. So I wanted to bring out this diverse landscape.\n\t\n\n\tSomewhat similarly, the most important thing in this film for me was to present Saudi as a melting pot. A diverse place where a lot of Muslims have sought refuge and they live there in peace and security. That, and also the diversity in locations. That was very important to me. Because, you know, people don’t know Saudi. We don’t have many films. And through that, I wanted to present Saudi in a very different way. Who would think that Saudi would have ice? It’s very ambiguous. And I wanted that ambiguity to carry the story forward.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Venice Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOf all the attendees at the Red Sea Film Festival, only jury member Nadine Labaki can lay claim to having directed the most successful Arabic film in history. \n\n\t“Capernaum,” Labaki’s third feature after “Caramel” and “Where do We Go Now,” became an unexpected smash hit for the groundbreaking Lebanese director back in 2018. The film earned critical acclaim when it first bowed in Cannes that year, winning the Jury Prize, and would go on to land an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film, making Labaki the first female Arab director to be nominated in that category. But when it was later released in China, something astonishing happened and the film — about a young refugee boy living in the slums of Beirut who sues his parents for child neglect — became a phenomenon, pushing its overall global box office to more than $68 million. \n\t\n\n\tBut for Labaki, having such a hit film and being swept up in awards season didn’t necessarily bring her the joy she anticipated. In fact, speaking at Variety Lounge presented by Red Sea Film Festival, she claimed it was the opposite.\n\n\n\t“For me, 2019 was the year where I really achieved every dream I used to dream of when I was a kid. I went to the Oscars, I went to Cannes where I got the jury prize, the Golden Globes, BAFTAs, Cesar Awards, all of it,” she said. “But 2019 was the hardest year of my life. Emotionally speaking, it was very hard, it was very difficult, even if it was so successful.”\n\n\tThe development of the film itself — a devastating exploration of the forgotten street children of Lebanon  — was a lengthy and deeply affecting undertaking. But then amid the acclaim after it was released, “Capernaum” also received criticism over accusations that it both exploited non-child actors (the lead star, Zain Al Rafeea, was himself a refugee, and helped shape the story) and suffering of the poor to generate sympathy and awards. \n\t\n\n\t“There’s always many, many, many different things that come with this kind of recognition and success, and sometimes also the backlash is is difficult to deal with,” Labaki acknowledged. (It should be noted that, after making the film, the director and production team helped Al Rafaee and his family resettle in Norway and set up scholarship fund for the other children involved).\n\n\tSuch was the emotional toll of the experience, Labaki took a step back from directing to focus on her acting, appearing in films such the Arabic adaptation of “Perfect Strangers” and last year’s “The Sand Castle,” both of which became hit for Netflix. \n\n\t“For me, the best way was to be on a film set with less responsibility, with less stress, because I needed it,” she said. “I needed to feel like I was working, but I was not ready to start working on another film of my own or writing another film. Emotionally, I wasn’t ready. I needed time.”\n\n\tThankfully, for those who have been waiting seven years to see another film directed and written by Labaki, she is now ready to take the plunge again, with another project now in development. \n\n\t“I’m working on it, I’m writing my next film and hopefully, if everything goes well, we’ll be shooting next year,” she said. “But it’s going to take a while, it’s not an easy project. It should take a bit of time to shoot, but if everything goes well and if I am in the right mood.”\n\n\tBut whereas Labaki’s previous three features have shone a light on various aspects of Lebanese society, this time, without going into detail, she said she was broadening her scope.\n\n\t“I might be happening in different countries… this is what I’m aiming for.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Marrakech Film Festival has grown alongside Morocco’s flourishing film industry. When the festival debuted in 2001, the local scene produced just five films a year. Today, that number has surged to around 40, reflecting a variety of initiatives aimed at nurturing and sustaining new generations of talent. \n\n\tPrograms like the Atlas Workshops have been instrumental in connecting emerging auteurs onto the international stage, while initiatives such as the female-focused Tamayouz Foundation — founded by three Moroccan filmmakers and two producers — work to remove barriers to entry. The foundation provides entry-level training for women interested in the industry, along with financial support and mentorship in directing, screenwriting, production and post-production, and has also experienced significant growth in recent years.\n\t\n\n\tHere are four filmmakers from four very different backgrounds who are making waves in Marrakech.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Meriame Essadak – Producer \n\n\tMeriame Essadak has worn many hats throughout her career, moving from education to foreign services to marketing before breaking into film through incubator programs with the Tamayouz Cinema Foundation and the Atlas Workshops. She currently has three features in development, including Mohcine Nadifi’s psychological thriller “La Piste.” The project won the Tangier Film Festival pitch competition in 2024 and was one of five titles selected for a Franco-Moroccan co-production session in Cannes — meetings that sparked serious interest from several French companies. \n\n\t“Mohcine initially approached me to co-write the film, which I did,” she explains. “But when we started looking for a producer, I took the bull by the horns. I told him, ‘You have me. I’m your warrior, and I’ll defend this project body and soul.’ As a producer, I only take on projects that hit me hard, because they demand sleepless nights and immense mental energy. If it doesn’t make me vibrate, it’s not worth it — the connection has to be physical.” \n\t\n\n\tEssadak is also developing “Potes,” directed by Hamza Atifi, and “Rajol,” from Adnane Rami, both of which have gone through the Tamayouz professional lab. \n\n\t“Potes is about Moroccan students who go abroad to study and struggle to reconnect with home,” she says. “It’s the voice of a young generation that sees itself as resolutely modern, only to discover abroad that certain expectations and gazes remain unchanged.” Meanwhile, “Rajol” explores “what it means to be a man in Morocco today, in a society where women’s voices are increasingly heard.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDriss Ramdi – Actor\n\n\tBorn in Morocco and based in France, Driss Ramdi first broke out with a supporting role in Mehdi Ben Attia’s Berlin-selected “Je Ne Suis Pas Mort,” earning a spot on the César shortlist for Most Promising Newcomer. Since then, he has built a steady career with roles in Rachel Lang’s “Baden Baden,” Emmanuel Hamon’s “Escape from Raqqa,” Emmanuel Finkiel’s “A Decent Man,” and the popular Canal Plus rap series “All the Way Up.” \n\n\tThis year, Ramdi steps into the spotlight for the first time as the tortured protagonist of Meryem Benm’Barek’s “Behind the Palm Trees,” which premiered in competition in Marrakech. Looking ahead, he is determined to build on the emotional intensity and authenticity he tapped into for Benm’Barek’s film. \n\n\t“Now I want to work as deeply as I did on this role,” he says. “I want to do more and more interesting films. I’m very particular: I refuse cliché roles — the terrorist, the meaningless thug. I choose carefully. I want leading roles. I want to meet directors, dive into projects where you really invest yourself.” \n\n\tRamdi is also exploring a lighter, more playful side through stand-up comedy. “That actually scares me the most,” he admits. “I’ve been writing a lot — with notebooks scattered all over my home — but direct contact with an audience still gives me chills. I can stand in front of [someone incredibly famous, like] Brad Pitt and be super focused, super calm. But on stage… that’s my next challenge.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYoussef Michraf – Director\n\n\tBorn into a self-described “lower-middle-class family,” Youssef Michraf left his native Casablanca at 18 to train as an engineer in France. But once he arrived, he felt compelled to follow his true calling. He studied film at La Sorbonne before earning a directing spot at the prestigious national film school La Fémis, and soon set out to launch his debut feature, “Sweet Disposition.” \n\t\n\n\tThe film blends body-horror with a coming-of-age narrative, centering on a young boy so ashamed of his modest origins that he invents an elaborate ruse — one that soon spirals into a literal corporeal transformation. Michraf presented the project at the Atlas Workshops in 2021, winning the Artekino International Prize, and has since sought to reposition the film outside the French system after moving to Los Angeles. \n\n\t“American friends are launching a production company,” he says. “They have financiers ready, and things are going well. They’re much more open than the French — genuinely enthusiastic about the complexity and specificity of the film. In France, films set in Morocco have to fit certain expectations, and I found that suffocating. There’s not enough openness to nuance or complexity, whereas the Americans I met really valued the film’s identity and felt it was worth protecting.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLeyna Tahiri – Director\n\n\tLeyna Tahiri began in politics, driven to “understand the world.” She soon realized she needed another language: “the language of emotions, of cinema.” \n\n\tAfter working as a development executive for “In Therapy” writers David Elkaïm and Vincent Poymiro, Tahiri turned to Moroccan television, contributing to serialized dramas while developing her own personal projects. \n\n\tPreparing her next short, she also brought her feature, “Earth and Ashes,” to this year’s Atlas Workshops. The film follows a tense judicial process after the death of a France-born architect, leaving his Moroccan family — and the Gallic courts — to decide whether he should be buried according to secular or Islamic traditions. Nabil Ayouch and “Calle Malaga” producers Amine Benjelloun and Jean-Rémi Ducourtioux are on board.\n\n\t“I realized this situation happens often,” Tahiri says. “It also raises the question: is a funeral for the dead, or for the living?” \n\n\t“Like many children of immigrants, I ask myself a lot of questions,” she adds. “I was raised in France, built my career in Morocco, and want to explore those cultural dynamics. Nabil also comes from a dual culture, so it resonated with him immediately. So many people share similar stories from their own lives — what happened to my aunt, my grandmother. Everyone has a story that echoes this film, which makes it feel universal.”\n",

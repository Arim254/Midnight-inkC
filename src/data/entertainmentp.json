    "body": "\n\tRob and Michele Reiner died “minutes” after sustaining “multiple sharp force injuries,” the couple’s official death certificate confirms. \n\n\tRob, 78, the legendary actor-turned-director, and his wife Michele, 70, were found dead on Dec. 14 in their Brentwood home. The death certificates listed the cause as “with [a] knife, by another” and noted the time between the attack and death as “minutes.” Rob was discovered at 3:45 p.m. and Michele was found at 3:46 p.m. on Dec. 14. They have since been cremated, according to the death certificates. Their son Nick, 32, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder.\n\t\n\n\tRob and Michele Reiner met while he was directing the rom-com “When Harry Met Sally” and got married several months later in 1989. They had three kids, Nick, Romy and Jake. Rob also adopted his daughter, Tracy, during his first marriage to Penny Marshall.\n\n\n\tRob and Michele’s bodies were found by Romy, who was called to the house after a massage therapist couldn’t reach the couple, according to the New York Times. Nick was arrested later that night.\n\n\tJake and Romy first spoke out about the death of their parents on Dec. 17. “Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day. The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren’t just our parents; they were our best friends,” they said in a statement.\n\n\tThey have since released a statement to People to share their gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support.” Jake and Romy added that a memorial service honoring Rob and Michele will be held “at a later date.” \n\t\n\n\tRob Reiner, the son of famed writer-director-comedian Carl Reiner, starred in the 1971 sitcom “All in the Family” before directing films like “This Is Spinal Tap,” “When Harry Met Sally,” “A Few Good Men” and “Stand by Me.” Rob’s most recent film, “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,” was released earlier this year.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sometimes I’m so fucking glad that I never have to be young again.”\n\n\tFilm critic David Ehrlich’s brief review of Charlie Polinger‘s “The Plague” on Letterboxd succinctly sums up scores of sentiments shared on social media. The film, which opens in theaters on Dec. 24 via Independent Film Company, is an unconventional horror tale about a young boy named Ben (Everett Blunck), who is new to the social structure of an all-boys water polo camp. Other children, under the direction of their cruel peer Jake (Kayo Martin) and with very little adult supervision, alienate shy young Eli (Kenny Rasmussen) by saying he has the titular disease. Things get uncomfortable from there.\n\t\n\n\tThe casual viciousness of children is the centerpiece of the film, which has triggered audiences who grew up in the same era as Polinger. After he directed a 2018 short film named “Sauna” with similar themes, he caught COVID and was quarantined in his childhood bedroom. While there, Polinger went through his journals and was reminded of the genesis of the “Plague” game and the memories of people he hadn’t thought about in ages.\n\n\n\t“I’ve been surprised every step of the way, even just how cross-generational and cross-cultural that sentiment of youth seems to be,” he says. “I had that experience looking at these journals, where it was a sensory portal bringing me back to a time that I had really buried. It was very intense and visceral and overwhelming. I think that the movie has that effect on other people, where it’s like that smell, that candle that brings you back to certain times in life. That takes you on your own journey, and anyone might apply something personal to the movie. People come up to me after screenings and talk to me about their experiences, very personal stories.”\n\t\n\n\tAlthough the film is a period piece set a few decades ago without cellphones, it’s being released at a time when the country is run by President Trump, who frequently uses bullying to set the national tone. Polinger says that although his film is informed by specificity, it can speak broadly to many different cultural touchpoints.\n\n\t“My feeling about films in general is, when you’re making something that feels as honest as possible and personal, those things usually apply in larger political ways,” he says. “I think there are dynamics of how bullying works, but also how social hierarchies are developed, and myths are made. ‘The Plague’ is kind of a myth. In the beginning, it’s clearly a very dumb game and a dumb joke, and it’s not taken very seriously. But because everyone else chooses to take it seriously, because everyone else is doing it, it starts to become something increasingly real because the collective has made it so.\n\n\t“Jake, as a ringleader, will look at you like you’re crazy if you don’t take it seriously,” Polinger continues. “You want to fit in with Jake because it’s too scary not to have his approval, because he’s so charismatic, and he’s bonding with everyone else by making fun of the outcast. So you don’t want to be that person. You play the rules of the game, and suddenly they become crystallized. I think that paradigm applies to bigger social structures, political things … in general, authoritarianism. There are cycles of this throughout history that are built around the same human instincts that, hopefully, this film is exploring through a more personal lens.”\n\n\tAfter “The Plague,” Polinger is set to adapt a high-profile property, helming a feature-length version of Edgar Allan Poe’s short story “The Masque of the Red Death,” starring Oscar winner Mikey Madison. Polinger is excited to start filming his unique vision of the classic text.\n\n\t“It’s definitely inspired by the short story, but it goes into a completely new story,” he says. “So it’s a very bombastic, irreverent, dark comedic tale, set in this medieval, slightly fantastical world. It’s not a modernized version of it at all. It’s high energy, it’s out there and very different in many ways on the surface from ‘The Plague,’ but also exploring claustrophobic group dynamics — just from a very different genre and tone.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “The Plague” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs “Stranger Things” comes to a close, with the Netflix hit’s series finale set for release on New Year’s Eve, its impact on culture over the last nine years is hard to ignore.\n\n\tThe fifth and final season helped the show achieve new viewership records before it was even released, then achieved Netflix’s biggest-ever opening week for an English-language series. Now, less than a month after Season 5 Volume 1 and days ahead of Volume 2, Netflix reports that the entirety of “Stranger Things” has crossed 1.2 billion views in total.\n\t\n\n\tThat statistic, calculated by dividing the total amount of time the series has ever been streamed by the combined runtime of all available episodes, puts “Stranger Things” as a whole above any series in Netflix history — even “Wednesday” and “Squid Game,” which are the only projects with individual seasons that rank above “Stranger Things” Season 4. Released in 2023, Season 4 remains at No. 2 on Netflix’s list of its most popular English-language TV title of all time. Season 3, which is more than six years old now, only recently fell off that chart. \n\n\n\tAs such, the most-rewatched scenes in the show’s history came in those seasons: No. 1 is the scene in Season 4 Episode 7 when Nancy (Natalia Dyer) falls into a trance while being possessed by Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), followed by the Season 3 Episode 8 scene when Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Suzie (Gabriella Pizzolo) sing the “NeverEnding Story” theme song together.\n\n\tIn just 25 days, Volume 1 of Season 5 has reached 102.6 million views. It’s all but guaranteed that Season 5 will make the all-time viewership chart next month; if it was eligible now, before its final episode have been released, it would already rank at No. 9, between “Bridgerton” Season 3 (2024) and “The Night Agent” Season 1 (2023). Plus, Netflix measures its all-time chart ending 91 days after each title’s final episodes are released, meaning Season 5 will continue accruing views until three months after the New Year’s Eve finale. The season has a solid shot to make it to No. 1 during the first quarter of 2026.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition, “Stranger Things” Season 5 has ranked as the most-watched title of the week in 90 of the 93 countries Netflix tracks while also directing viewers back to previous seasons. “Stranger Things” became the first Netflix series to have four seasons in the Top 10 at once, then the first to chart with five seasons — and all five seasons remain on the chart even now, four weeks since Season 5 debuted. And since the advent of the Netflix Top 10 in 2021, the series’ five seasons have made the global Netflix Top 10 a combined 78 times. All 93 countries tracked have seen on “Stranger Things” on their individual Top 10 lists at one point or another. \n\n\tStill, the reach of “Stranger Things” expands beyond Netflix views. \n\n\tThe show made headline after headline for its use of “Running Up That Hill” in Season 4. 38 years after the song was released, “Stranger Things” helped earn Kate Bush her first-ever Top 10 hit in the U.S. Additionally, Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” (1986) made the U.K. Top 10 for the first time after being used in the season.\n\n\tWith Season 5, that effect has been replicated again and again. According to Spotify, several oldies have seen major streaming boosts since their use in Volume 1. Among Gen Z, Diana Ross’ “Upside Down” (1980) saw an increase in streams of 1,250% and Tiffany’s “I Think We’re Alone Now” (1987) jumped by 880%. Across all demographics, streams have risen for The Chordettes’ “Mr. Sandman” (1954) by 625% and for ABBA’s “Fernando” (1976) by 335%, with the latter getting a 645% boost with Gen Z. The music streamer also reports that users have created 205,000 “Stranger Things”-themed playlists since Season 1 debuted in 2016.\n\n\tEggo, the frozen waffle brand that has existed since 1956, enjoyed renewed interest after being prominently featured in “Stranger Things” as the favorite snack of Millie Bobby Brown’s character, Eleven. Parent company Kellogg’s reported 14% growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, which followed the release of Season 2, and 9.4% growth in the first four months of 2018.\n\n\tNetflix also boasts that interest in “Dungeons & Dragons” has grown by 673% since the 2016 debut of “Stranger Things,” which constantly references the table-top role-playing game — though it must be noted that the “Dungeons & Dragons” universe has made many big strides of its own over the last nine years, including expansions to the game itself, a 2023 feature film and more. Still, its rise — which also includes sales increases of 96% in both 2017 and 2018 — was still heavily impacted by “Stranger Things,” and the show and game have released multiple official collaborations. \n\t\n\n\tThe show also drove a collaboration between Netflix and Nabisco, with the snack company releasing limited-edition “Stranger Things” Chip’s Ahoy cookies ahead of Season 5. The campaign around the cookies reached 11 billion impressions.\n\n\tNaturally, the series has been a massive boon to the business of content. Since 2016, “Stranger Things” has created more than 8,000 production jobs in the U.S. and contributed $1.4 billion to the national GDP. \n\n\tThat impact has been strongest in Georgia, where most of the series was filmed, with $650 million contributed to the state GDP and more than 2,000 vendors involved in production. Next in line was California, with $500 million contributed to the state GDP.\n\n\t“Stranger Things” has also spawned a universe of its own, even before on-screen spinoffs have been released. In the U.S. alone, “Stranger Things” books, comics and other publishing projects have crossed 3.1 million sales since Season 1. “Stranger Things: The Experience,” a live event that was first produced in 2022, has led to 850,000 ticket sales across cities including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, London, Paris, Brazil and Australia. In 2023, the prequel play “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” debuted in London’s West End, and a Broadway transfer opened earlier this year. \n\n\tAfter opening in the U.S. and the U.K., the play won four Tony Awards, two Olivier Awards and two U.K. Critics’ Circle Theatre Awards, adding to the 70 awards and 230 nominations the TV series has earned to date, including 12 Emmy wins.\n\n\tAnd when looking at the career trajectories of the young cast of “Stranger Things,” the series can be looked at as a Disney Channel-like talent pipeline, generating celebrities out of tweens who were relatively unknown beforehand. Brown has become Netflix royalty, leading the films “The Electric State” and “Damsel” — the latter being the streamer’s No. 10 most popular English-language movie of all time, plus the “Enola Holmes” franchise, which has a third film premiering in 2026.\n\n\tSocial media is another good measure of the cast’s rise. Netflix’s earliest tracked Instagram follower count for Brown — which came before “Stranger Things Season 1 debuted but potentially after trailers and marketing had been released — was 2.1 million, and she now has more than 68 million. Sadie Sink, who plays Max, has the next-highest following with 26.8 million, up from 1.1 million before her debut in Season 2. Other following increases include 6,400 to 23 million for Finn Wolfhard; 10,000 to 23.4 million for Noah Schnapp; 18,000 to to 13 million for Caleb McLaughlin; and 20,000 to 17 million for Matarazzo. New Season 5 stars Jake Connelly and Nell Fisher have seen increases from 12,000 to 582,000 and 30,000 to 875,000, respectively.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift is ringing in the holiday cheer with a sizable donation of $1 million to Feeding America, a nonprofit network of 200 food banks combating hunger in the United States.\n\n\tThe charity announced the donation on Instagram, thanking the singer for her act of altruism. “We are incredibly grateful for Taylor Swift‘s $1 million gift to Feeding America,” reads the post, authored by Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot. “This holiday season, her continued support is a powerful reminder of what’s possible when we unite to end hunger. When we join together alongside people facing hunger, we can make sure families have a full table this holiday season and beyond.”\n\t\n\n\tSwift previously donated $5 million to Feeding America in October 2024 in an effort to provide relief to communities struggling in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. She also made similar contributions in the past, including $1 million towards natural disaster relief after storms impacted Tennessee in December 2023, as well as $100,000 to the family of a 44-year-old woman killed at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade in February 2024.\n\n\n\tMore recently, Swifties banded together to rally support for Feeding America to help support food banks and those affected by potential cuts in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). Swifties for Hope used social media this past October to encourage fans to donate $13 or whatever they could provide.\n\n\tEarlier this morning, Swift released the final two episodes of her docuseries “The End of an Era,” which bowed on Disney+ just ahead of the holidays.\n\n",

Four seasons of “The Legend of Korra,” the 2010 film “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” as well as the original Nickelodeon show are already available on Paramount+.\n\t\n\n\t“The Avatar Universe has captivated audiences for two decades, and Paramount+ is proud to be the exclusive streaming home for its beloved animated incarnation,” said Jane Wiseman, head of originals for Paramount+. “‘The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender’ and ‘Avatar: Seven Havens’ represent the next evolution of storytelling from Avatar Studios — bringing together remarkable talent both in front of and behind the camera to deliver the epic adventures and emotional depth fans have come to expect. These additions, alongside ‘The Legend of Korra’ and the original series, solidify Paramount+ as the destination for the animated Avatar Universe.”\n\n\n\tWithout “Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender” on its schedule, Paramount has a nearly barren theatrical slate in 2026 that seems void of heavy hitters. “Primate” is set for January, with “Scream 7” to follow in February, “Scary Movie 6” in June, “PAW Patrol: The Dino Movie” in August, “Street Fighter” in October and “The Angry Birds 3” in December.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore “Heated Rivalry” quickly became a global television phenomenon, star Connor Storrie wasn’t quite sure how fans would receive his portrayal of the Russian hockey player Ilya Rozanov — especially having seen “adaptations be torn apart online previously,” he said on a recent podcast episode of “Shut Up Evan” hosted by Evan Ross Katz. \n\n\t“I’m very optimistic, but I’m also a firm believer in optimistic nihilism: accept the worst, but expect the best,” Storrie continued. “I went through this entire process, even if it sounds pessimistic, accepting the worst case, which is that they’re going to hate my performance, I’m so wrong for the part [and] it’s going to be torn apart by people who love the book, and be like, well, if that were the case, all I can do is really try to give an honest performance and trust that Jacob [Tierney] knows the story well enough to to bring the right moments to it.”  \n\t\n\n\tThe show, which centers on a decade-long secret relationship between Rozanov and fellow hockey player Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams), was created by Jacob Tierney, who adapted the material from author Rachel Reid’s popular “Game Changers” book series. Since the show’s debut in November, it has swiftly topped the charts: the Crave-created romance has become the Canadian streamer’s most-watched original series and HBO Max’s top-rated non-animated acquired series. \n\n\tThe center of conversation has been William’s and Storrie’s performances. Later in the podcast, Storrie discussed how he approaches significant moments in the show that book fans will have expectations for. \n\t\n\n\t“For moments like that,” Storrie explained, referring to his now-viral “I’m coming to the cottage” moment at the end of the fifth episode, “I had some ideas about trying to really play to the book. But Jacob just knows that book. He knows that story like the back of his hand. I read the book twice, read all the scripts a million times.”  \n\n\tStorrie also noted the importance of not getting too wrapped up in “trying to please the fans.” “Honestly, I think with acting or art in general, trying to feed too much into what you think other people want is kind of the death of anything that’s actually humane and inspiring.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tHikaru Sulu and Leonard “Bones” McCoy, two iconic characters from the original “Star Trek” series, will make their first appearances in “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” during the finale of the fifth and final season.\n\n\tThomas Jane will play Bones and Kai Murakami will play Sulu in the episode, which recently wrapped production. The news comes ahead of the 2026 release of Season 4. \n\n\n\tJane’s credits in film include “Boogie Nights,” “Deep Blue Sea,” “The Punisher” and “The Mist.” His TV work has included HBO’s “Hung,” Syfy and later Amazon Prime Video’s “The Expanse” and Amazon’s “Troppo,” which he also executive produced. \n\t\n\n\tMurakami is making his TV debut in “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.” Previously, he has acted on stage with the Royal Shakespeare Company and worked in performance-capture on the video games “Assassin’s Creed” and “Rise of the Ronin.” He is repped by Identity Agency Group in London.\n\n\n\t“Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” is produced by CBS Studios, Secret Hideout and Roddenberry Entertainment. Season 4 stars Anson Mount, Rebecca Romijn, Ethan Peck, Jess Bush, Christina Chong, Celia Rose Gooding, Melissa Navia, Babs Olusanmokun and Martin Quinn, along with guest stars Carol Kane and Paul Wesley.\n\n\tAkiva Goldsman and Henry Alonso Myers serve as co-showrunners, and executive produce alongside Alex Kurtzman, Mount, Aaron Baiers, Dana Horgan, Alan McElroy, Robbie Thompson, Frank Siracusa, John Weber, Chris Fisher, Rod Roddenberry and Trevor Roth.\n\n\t“Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” premiered in 2022, followed by Season 2 in 2023 and Season 3 in 2025. Paramount announced the series’ renewal for a fifth and final season in June of this year, ahead of the Season 3 premiere.\n",

With so many new shows to navigate, there’s no bigger let-down than turning on a series you were excited to indulge in, only for the experience to fall short. As TV critics, it’s our job to tell audiences about the elevated storytelling, worthwhile characters, and transportive settings of the medium at its very best. (You can find our selections for the best shows of 2025 right this way! There’s plenty to feel good about.) Regrettably, the flip side of that pursuit means sharing the series that didn’t quite capture our attention or imagination, to spare our readers the same disappointment.\n\n\tOur list of the year’s worst TV shows includes spinoffs and stale IP, reminding us all why Hollywood desperately needs to open its doors to new creators and new ideas. There are also promising premises that failed to capitalize on their name-brand stars and intriguing concepts. As the year ends, Variety TV critics Alison Herman and Aramide Tinubu have identified eight series that we definitely wouldn’t recommend to viewers in pursuit of a good time. Of course, everyone has their own unique tastes, so your own mileage may vary — though several of our picks have already been canceled, suggesting we weren’t alone in our assessment. From lackluster procedurals to misguided attempts at prestige, read on to see Variety’s picks for the least successful shows of the year (in alphabetical order).\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Countdown” (Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Elizabeth Morris/Prime Video\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFrom “Chicago Fire” and “Chicago PD” creator Derek Haas, Prime Video’s “Countdown” — which Prime Video canceled — follows an elite task force. Helmed by FBI Special Agent Nathan Blythe (Eric Dane), Task Force Hurricane is put in place following the shocking murder of a beloved Department of Homeland Security officer. Blythe brings in LAPD Detective Mark Meachum (Jensen Ackles), DEA Special Agent Amber Oliveras (Jessica Camacho), DHS Office Damon Drew (Jonathan Togo), FBI Special Agent Keyonte Bell (Elliot Knight), FBI Special Agent Evan Shepard (Violett Beane) and LAPD Detective Lucas Finau (Uli Latukefu) to find out who murdered the man. However, what they uncover is a years-long global conspiracy. Despite the action throughout the 13-episode first season, each episode is duller than the last. None of the characters is particularly compelling, and the storyline itself hangs by a thread. In fact, the mission itself is so lackluster that audiences will struggle to remain engaged throughout the season. Ultimately, there is nothing new or enriching about the series, which makes it woefully forgettable.

Created by Zoe Robyn, “Pulse” has compelling themes, following the emergency and surgical residents at Maguire Hospital in Miami. Like most hospital dramas, the series is a remix of medical incidents and the doctors’ personal lives. But “Pulse” crashes and burns amid its horrid depiction of sexual harassment. The series opens as resident Dr. Danny Simms (Willa Fitzgerald) is unexpectedly promoted after filing a sexual harassment claim against her boss, Chief Resident Dr. Xander Phillips (Colin Woodell). Amid an impending hurricane, Xander is suspended indefinitely, and Danny takes over his role. However, as the backstory of the pair’s relationship unfolds amid the show’s disorienting structure, audiences realize that all isn’t what it seems. In fact, all the back-and-forth is more irritating than revelatory. (Link to full review.) — Tinubu\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Prime Target” (Apple TV+)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Apple TV+\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThere is no shortage of espionage thrillers on TV, and with a robust cast led by Leo Woodhall, Apple TV+’s “Prime Target” should have soared. Created by Steve Thompson, the series follows Edward Brooks (Woodhall), a Cambridge University Ph.D. candidate on the verge of making a world-changing discovery about prime numbers. However, he soon finds himself being hunted by those who have no interest in letting his world-altering prime finder come to life. Seeing that Ed’s life is in peril, National Security Agency (NSA) agent Taylah Sanders (Quintessa Swindell) takes it upon herself to try to keep him safe. Though the series has a wide-ranging, thorny plot, it is increasingly dull, relying too heavily on mathematics and side characters that never elicit true excitement. In the end, the show feels bewildering, as if Thompson mashed several TV shows together only to end it with a lackluster thud. (Link to full review.) — Tinubu\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“The Runarounds” (Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Jackson Lee Davis/Prime\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Outer Banks” creator Jonas Pate’s YA music drama is egregiously terrible. The series follows 18-year-old Charlie Cooper (William Lipton), who, after graduating from high school, decides to get serious about taking his band, The Runarounds, to the next level. Though the show’s music is excellent, it’s bogged down by baffling plot points and lacks a fundamental grounding in present-day teen-dom. Moreover, the cast are musicians, not actors, which becomes increasingly apparent amid the bewildering dialogue. It also doesn’t help that the plot is neither unique nor distinct, especially when it comes to representing young adult men of today. (Link to full review.) — Tinubu\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Sheriff Country” (CBS)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: CBS\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe “Fire Country” spinoff takes place in the same California small town as its predecessor, but displays little sign of that procedural’s proven appeal. Morena Baccarin stars as a divorced cop working to earn her community’s trust while dealing with her chaotic family, including a daughter struggling with substance abuse. But “Sheriff Country” isn’t content to settle for small-scale character studies, deploying a series of cartoon villains (like evil weed growers who enslave college students) who feel jarringly out-of-place in the show’s chosen setting. Even as the dialogue waxes poetic about how much Baccarin’s Mickey Fox loves Edgewater and its people, “Sheriff Country” never makes us understand the source of her deep feelings. There’s an art to a good network law enforcement show, and “Sheriff Country” suffers for its absence — but maybe a recently announced Season 2 can make some much-needed corrections. (Link to full review.) — Alison Herman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Suits LA” (NBC)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Trae Patton/NBC\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRemakes and reboots rarely hit the ball out of the park, but “Suits LA” is truly a disappointment.  “Suits,” creator Aaron Korsh attempted to showcase a new crop of lawyers on an entirely different coast. Unfortunately, the show lacks the original magic and intrigue that made the original such a success. The series (which was canceled shortly after its debut) follows attorney Ted Black (a miscast Stephen Amell) as he tries to hold off a hostile takeover of his entertainment law firm while contending with the incidents that forced him to flee New York more than a decade earlier. Not only does the series look terrible visually, but its gimmicky cameos and a barely pieced-together narrative prove it never even tried to take itself seriously. (Link to full review.) — Tinubu\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“The Terminal List: Dark Wolf” (Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Amazon Prime Video\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe problem with this prequel to the hit Chris Pratt series isn’t the overt jingoism — not that defenders care much what a coastal elite critic has to say about the series’ creative shortcomings. Rather, it’s the blatant mismatch between the espionage thriller implied by the premise, in which a CIA handler recruits an ex-Navy SEAL to work against Iran as the country negotiates its 2015 nuclear deal in Europe, and the brawny, brute force war fetishism that seems to be the true interest of author Jack Carr and co-creator David DiGilio. As hero Ben Edwards, Taylor Kitsch dons a stoic grimace that’s belied by the explosions, gunfights and testosterone-fueled camaraderie “Dark Wolf” captures with an admiring eye. This doomed marriage between delicate diplomacy and a barely contained desire to start blowing things up couldn’t be over fast enough. (Link to full review.) — Herman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Zero Day” (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHow could a limited series starring no less a luminary than Robert De Niro be so milquetoast and forgettable? That’s the real mystery of “Zero Day,” more than who’s behind the cyberattack De Niro’s ex-president is commissioned to investigate. A mumblemouthed statement on a smorgasbord of contemporary themes (partisanship! plutocrats! podcasting!), “Zero Day” was so lifeless even the combined powers of De Niro, Jesse Plemons and Angela Bassett couldn’t inject some much-needed verve. A thriller lacking tension and a political drama lacking insight, “Zero Day” never built on De Niro’s surprising presence on the small screen, turning an easy way to stand out from the crowd into an almost impressive fumbling of the bag. “Zero Day” will be little more than a footnote in any of its stars’ CVs, but those of us who watched may remember it for the wrong reasons.

    "body": "\n\tIn business, the power of individual leaders is an inherently hard thing to measure. It’s subjective, and it fluctuates on any given day, just like the strength of an electrical current goes up and down depending on environmental conditions. To commemorate Variety’s 120th anniversary year, we gave ourselves a tough assignment. We wanted to take a snapshot of leadership and muscle in the entertainment industry at this fraught moment of turmoil and transition for Hollywood. After months of internal debate, months of arguing over draft lists and a last push of double-checking titles and name spellings, here we finally arrive at the end result: The Variety 120 list of the most powerful executives in entertainment. Notice the emphasis on executives. We realized early on that we needed strict guidelines for who to include and who not to include. The Variety 120 is a survey of executive leadership at the industry’s biggest and most influential companies. That includes some companies that are far removed from Hollywood geographically but still have influence in the global business of entertainment, which we define here as film, TV, music and gaming. We intentionally did not include actors, writers, directors, producers, multihyphenates, lawyers, talent agents or managers, simply to make the ranking process more manageable. We also kept our lens focused on traditional entertainment, thus this list does not include leaders from sports or news. When you get down to it, 120 isn’t that many slots to cover a truly global business. So we lean toward the C-suite – the senior managers who are responsible for driving their companies forward and delivering the bottom line. Also, notice the emphasis on big. This list leans toward the biggest studios, labels, streamers and game publishers who dominate mass media production and distribution. We considered a company’s market share and market cap in determining this ranking. A person’s career achievements and overall industry stature were also a factor for inclusion. We also considered things that can’t be tallied with a calculator. In many of the entries, you’ll read our assessment that the individual has strong ties or deep connections to the creative community, or the investment community, or that he or she commands great respect among colleagues. It’s a relationship business, after all. Executive careers rise and fall on the strength of reputations. All kidding aside, it really is like high school with money and stock options. Variety journalists write every day (every hour) about how dramatically our industry is being transformed by the streaming revolution, by the growth of the global demand for content and by the rise of digital-native creators who would scoff “TLDR” at the idea of getting notes from a creative executive. But in reality, if you want to break a new artist, launch a TV show, open a movie or orchestrate a blockbuster video game release – most roads to achieving a bona fide hit still run through the companies and the leaders highlighted here. Spoiler alert: Our selection for the last slot on this list, No. 120, was carefully considered. The person is the leader of Indonesia’s largest media conglomerate. Indonesia is one of the world’s fast-rising entertainment hubs. We noticed that from our internet traffic and by the growing number of markets and festivals that we cover in the region. We made this choice to bookend the list with a signpost of the future and an example of the reach and influence of movies, TV, music and games. From our very first issue, published Dec. 16, 1905, much of Variety’s focus has been on the people who work behind the scenes to make things happen for those who take the stage. We hope this list can be a scorecard for readers who, like the staff of Variety, are eager to see what comes next for our fascinating industry in 2026 and beyond.\n\tProfiles written by Jem Aswad, Matt Donnelly, Steven J.

He’s now one of the most powerful content executives in Hollywood, rubbing elbows with celebs, showrunners, directors and other creatives who make content (or want to) for Netflix’s 300 million-plus subscribers worldwide. He’s overseen all content operations at the company since 2000, when it was still a DVD-by-mail outfit, and has had his hand on the steering wheel throughout its monumental rise. Sarandos led Netflix’s move into original content starting with the 2013 launch of “House of Cards.” He has famously called the moviegoing experience “outdated,” irking not just theater owners but filmmakers. In a reflection of Netflix’s clout, Sarandos has made a serious bid to acquire the Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max. Even if Netflix doesn’t win, Sarandos is showing that the company is definitely playing in the big leagues.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t2.

As NBCUniversal and other top traditional media companies focus on the power of big events to draw large audiences, Langley must translate her success with content franchises into devising spectacles that bring people to screens all at the same time. Look for NBCU to celebrate more anniversaries like the 50th anniversary of “Saturday Night Live” and NBC’s centennial in the months to come. She must also help stock the pipeline with new content favorites that draw viewers to the Peacock streaming service as well as traditional TV. After a sweeping reorganization of NBCUniversal in 2024, Langley controls greenlights across the entire enterprise, overseeing programming, marketing, distribution, acquisitions and operations for the film and TV studios, the linear network, Peacock and Bravo. Her trademark poise served her well through the M&A noise of 2025, delivering consistent support for creatives. Langley’s beloved film studio Universal Pictures, her training ground, look to blow the doors off of 2026 with releases from Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg, as well as animated sequels in the “Minions” and “Super Mario Bros.” franchises.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t3.

Discovery to advance his larger vision for Paramount Skydance as a streaming contender.\n\n\n\n\tEllison has a network of influential friends and family, starting with his ultra-wealthy dad, Oracle mogul Larry Ellison. After a career as a film producer with hits that included Tom Cruise’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” Ellison donned the mantle of media mogul. He led Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, bankrolled by his father and RedBird Capital Partners — a deal that met with the approval of Donald Trump and his administration. After installing a mostly new management team, Ellison’s early moves at the new Paramount Skydance have included inking a rich deal for UFC rights and the acquisition of Bari Weiss’s The Free Press (with Weiss installed as editor-in-chief of CBS News). Ellison is now looking consolidate more power in Hollywood: He’s in the thick of a public brawl with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, pitting him against Netflix. The sale process is turning in to a referendum on the future of Hollywood.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t4.

In addition to overseeing YouTube’s significant core ads business, Mohan has been driving growth of the platform’s subscriptions businesses, including YouTube TV. With more than 10 million pay-TV subscribers, YouTube was in a position to flex its market power in programming renewals in 2025 — and its tough negotiating tactics led to blackouts of Disney and Univision nets before the parties reached deals. Mohan is now setting YouTube’s AI agenda, balancing concerns of Hollywood players with the rollout of powerful new content tools for its millions of creators.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t5.

Now she’s on the short list to succeed Bob Iger at the helm of Disney next year. This fall, Walden faced a test with ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel amid a right-wing backlash over his comments about Charlie Kirk’s murder. After a PR storm, she brought Kimmel back and got two big affiliate groups to resume airing his show. She was also in the thick of Disney’s two-week battle with YouTube in November over a carriage agreement.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t6.

Since his return, Iger has reinvigorated Disney’s movie studios and overseen the theme park and cruise biz’s recovery from the COVID crash. Iger has moved to combine Disney+ and Hulu (after closing the buyout of Comcast’s Hulu stake) into a supercharged unified streamer while finally launching a streaming-only version of ESPN. The stock hasn’t recovered from its streaming-bubble highs, but Iger has proven a deft manager of the global entertainment conglomerate’s many moving pieces. Even as he says goodbye — after postponing his retirement five times! — Iger will have a part in the selection of the next CEO.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t7.

Discovery.\nComcast stepped up to allow NBC and Peacock to land an expansive NBA rights package.\n\n\n\n\tAn unassuming media executive in an industry filled with CEOs willing to pitch, promote and propagandize, Roberts presides over one of the largest distributorships of video in the nation, as well as the NBCUniversal entertainment empire. He has quietly worked to keep the company current by investing in sports rights as well as overseas assets like Sky. Roberts must now steer the company around new hurdles, including cord cutting and the rise of streaming video. Because nothing stays the same in pay TV for long. With the planned Versant Media spinoff expected to be completed early next year, Comcast will soon part with the basic cable networks that were so central to its purchase of NBCUniversal from General Electric back in 2011.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t8.  Lucian Grainge\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTitle: Chairman and CEO, Universal Music Group\n\n\tHeld job since: 2010\n\n\tSources of power:\n\n\nHe’s finishing his 15th year at the helm of the world’s largest music company.\nWith artists ranging from Taylor Swift and the Beatles to “KPop Demon Hunters,” company’s labels hold 35-40% of U.S. market share annually,\nHe has taken leadership position in music industry’s negotiations with AI companies.\n\n\n\n\tGrainge joined Universal in 1986 at leader of its Polydor publishing division and rose through the ranks during periods of galvanizing change in the industry, assuming the helm in 2010 just as streaming was beginning to take hold. In the years since he has presided over UMG’s expansion into the world’s largest music company — with artists ranging from the Beatles and Taylor Swift to the Weeknd and “KPop Demon Hunters” — its public listing in 2021, the expansion of its publishing and merchandise divisions, and the rise and plateau of streaming growth. Most recently, UMG has taken a leadership position in steering the industry through the challenges of AI (striking deals with and/or lawsuits against major AI companies — or both, as with Suno) and its next areas of growth, including initiatives to increasingly monetize “superfans.” There are certainly challenges: UMG’s $775 million acquisition of the artist-services company Downtown is under fierce scrutiny from the EU, and it was actually sued for defamation by Drake, one of its biggest artists, in bizarre collateral damage from that artist’s feud with fellow UMG artist Kendrick Lamar. But in the third quarter of 2025, Universal held nearly 36% U.S. market share — and that was before the release of Taylor Swift’s “Life of a Showgirl,” which sold a record-breaking 2.7 million copies on its first day.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t9.  David Zaslav\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTitle: CEO, Warner Bros. Discovery\n\n\tHeld job since: 2022\n\n\tSources of power:\n\n\nHe’s in the middle of a brawl between Netflix and Paramount Skydance to sell off WBD, the company he assembled with AT&T’s WarnerMedia spinoff in 2022.\nHe led Discovery Communications for 15 years before merging with WarnerMedia.\nHe was a cable programming pioneer at NBC who became one of John Malone’s favored CEOs.\n\n\n\n\tDavid Zaslav has been on a hire-wire act of debt, restructuring and outrunning the marketplace to prove the merger thesis that brought WarnerMedia and Discovery together in April 2022. But time ran out. David Ellison’s aggressive overtures forced his hand to initiate a sale process for all or part of the Warner Bros. Discovery (depending on who’s buying). For the foreseeable future, Zaslav still holds the keys in Burbank and Hudson Yards – and he’s demonstrating that in rebuffing Paramount’s offers more than half a dozen times in favor of Netflix’s $83 billion offer. Leading WBD for the past three years has been Zaslav’s highest profile job in Hollywood – and he’s become a lightning rod in the creative community at a time of disruption. Zaslav got his start in the go-go early days of cable in the 1980s with a long tenure at NBC where he helped launch CNBC and MSNBC. He gained prominence as a CEO – and for his huge paychecks — after he took the reins of Discovery Communications in late 2006.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t10.

He has long steered its expansion on the software and services side of the ledger for the company that has transformed the world with its hardware. He also clearly has the trust of CEO Tim Cook to set the agenda for Apple in Hollywood. Cue has embraced a build-not-buy strategy as Apple has revved up the Apple TV content business with big-budget series, sports rights, documentaries and children’s programs. The success of Apple’s first mega-budget film production, “F1: The Movie,” reflected well on Cue’s steady-hand stewardship. And his ambition was on display when he told Variety during a cover story interview that he really wanted “F1” to reach moviegoers in a profound way. “I hope that when most people go see the movie, they walk out wanting to be a race car driver,” he told Variety in April 2025.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t11.

Discovery. For now, Bajaria’s focus is on continuing to grow Netflix’s local-programming offerings throughout the globe and pushing the streamer further into live events and sports.

Building on his background in distribution and sales from his time as CEO at Hulu and president of Fox networks, Hopkins continues to push Amazon into TV ad sales through its Amazon Ads infrastructure to growing success. Under Hopkins, Prime Video currently offers more than 100 add-on subscription options in the U.S., including Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max, Paramount+, Sony’s Crunchyroll and Amazon-owned MGM+.

So far in 2025, Live Nation is on pace to have its biggest year yet, with overall revenue for the first nine months hitting $18.89 billion, up eight percent compared to last year’s $17.5 billion. Much of the company’s growth can be attributed to the demand for live entertainment in international markets, where fan count is projected to surpass the United States for the first time. Chalk that up to major tours that saw artists like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé traipsing the globe, yet it’s also the company’s ongoing ventures into management, venue ownership and other related areas of the business.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t15.

In 2025, the combined outlets landed 30 Emmys — tying Netflix for the most — thanks to the strength of series like “The Pitt” (outstanding drama series), “The Penguin,” “Hacks,” “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” and more. His current roster also includes smashes like “House of the Dragon,” “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us” and “Euphoria” — which recently gave him four current original series with cross-platform audiences averaging more than 15 million viewers per episode – a first for the pay cabler. Other titles that have driven the TV conversation under his watch have included “Succession,” “Barry,” “The Rehearsal,” the “True Detective” franchise, “And Just Like That” and “Peacemaker”; and earlier, “Veep,” “Girls,” “Silicon Valley,” “Watchmen,” “Westworld,” “Big Little Lies” and “Chernobyl.” Bloys first took over HBO series, late night and specials as president in February 2016; he joined the network in 2004 as director of development at HBO Independent Productions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t16.

Under Landgraf, FX has produced solid ratings and acclaim with bold (some might say risky) bets such as “Shōgun” — winner of 18 Emmy awards, a one-year record for a single series — as well as series like “The Bear,” “Fargo,” “Alien: Earth,” long-running fan-favorite “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and Ryan Murphy’s “American Horror Story” franchise. After Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Landgraf aligned with the Mouse House’s streaming strategy to make Hulu the primary streaming outlet for FX, which has let him continue to take big swings on standout content.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t17.

Peters, who joined Netflix in 2008, was previously chief product officer and spent several years as general manager of Netflix Japan. While Sarandos handles the content side, Peters focuses on technology, product development, pricing and partnerships. His purview also includes the still-nascent games initiative and the growing ad-supported business.

In a rare interview with reporters over the summer, Feige declared that well-documented problems Marvel’s been facing stem from an overabundance of supply, not a sudden drop in demand. As such, Marvel’s output for 2026 will be drastically decreased, with just three movies launching in theaters: “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” the studio’s co-production with Sony Pictures; a special re-release of “Avengers: Endgame” and “Doomsday.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t19.

Ahuja’s first big test at Sony was steering the “Jeopardy” host transition, which took two tries to get right, but America’s favorite quiz show endured. Now he’s got a long runway to lead the studio into its second century (Columbia Pictures marked its centennial in 2024) and its endowed with a library of more than 3,500 films and more than 35,000 episodes in an IP-hungry marketplace.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t20.

In the run-up to the transition, he was closely involved in steering Sony’s entertainment businesses toward greater IP coordination across Pictures, Music and PlayStation, reinforcing a strategy built on franchises that can move across formats and markets. That approach aligns with Sony’s long-standing focus on Kando — emotional impact delivered at scale — and has shown up in properties ranging from anime juggernaut “Demon Slayer” to cross-media adaptations like “The Last of Us.” Totoki also took direct oversight of Sony Interactive Entertainment during a leadership transition, underlining his role as the executive trusted with execution when the stakes are high. As CEO, he now controls a company where games, music, film and anime drive strategy — alongside the hardware that carries them.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t23.

They turned things around the old-fashioned way – by banking on bold directors and new ideas during a time where reboots and sequels have reigned supreme. Movies of all shapes and sizes, from Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” Zach Cregger’s “Weapons” and Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” scored with audiences. It’s an ethos that De Luca has embraced throughout his career, which took off when he was named production chief at New Line Cinema at the age of 27. He championed films such as “Seven,” “Boogie Nights,” “Friday” and helped to launch the careers of David Fincher and Anderson. The pair headed MGM prior to its sale to Amazon, which was around the time that Warner Bros. was in the market for new film leadership.\n\n\tAbdy and De Luca got to work quickly and took big swings while brokering deals with directors and stars like Ryan Coogler, Emerald Fennell, Zach Cregger and Tom Cruise. The 2025 slate backs up the pair’s promise to use WB’s considerable resources to make the studio an attractive place to work for “filmmakers with singular visions,” as they wrote in a memo to staff in October after renewing their contracts.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t24.

He bet on Keke Palmer, SZA and Issa Rae with the commercial and critical hit “One of Them Days,” relaunched Danny Boyle’s “28 Days Later” franchise with a sequel to follow immediately in ’26 and captured the zeitgeist with “KPop Demon Hunters” (though that film released via Sony’s pay-one partner Netflix). As always with Rothman, the man guaranteed to deliver an expletive-laden sound bite at CinemaCon, it’s about next year’s slate. 2026 will bring “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” and the innovative four-part biopic release “The Beatles” from filmmaker Sam Mendes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t25.

Just two years prior, Lin had been in negotiations to become head of DC Studios but decided to stick to his own shingle, Rideback, but the Netflix offer proved to be the right kind of challenge. Since joining the streamer, Lin has enforced a strategy of making one major tentpole film each quarter — upcoming offerings include “The Rip,” from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; “Apex” with Charlize Theron; and “Here Comes the Flood,” with Denzel Washingont, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Robert Pattionson. Among Lin’s biggest wins so far was overseeing the final cut of “K-Pop Demon Hunters,” which has become Netflix’s biggest film ever and greenlighting an ambitious slate of films, including Greta Gerwig’s “Narnia,” which will also play an exclusive engagement at Imax theaters worldwide.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t26.

They worked together for 15 years as programming executives at Sony Pictures Television and its predecessors before being recruited in 2017 by Apple services boss Eddy Cue to drive the company’s leap into original content production and commissioning what was born in November 2019 as Apple TV+ (in October, they nixed the + sign with a rebrand as Apple TV). The two have built the operation in the fishbowl of being a high-profile startup effort within a corporate giant of immense influence and a $4 trillion market cap. Erlicht and Van Amburg have endured waves of rumored shakeups and scrutiny of their creative strategies. This summer “F1: The Movie” was the kind of popcorn vehicle at the global box office that made the parent company proud. It also dovetailed nicely with Apple TV’s five-year deal unveiled in October that will bring F1 racing rights to its platform in the U.S. starting in 2026.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t27.

Partnered with Josh Greenstein on the film front and flying solo at the top of TV, Goldberg is plotting out long-term strategy for both divisions under David Ellison’s new regime. As of this year, Goldberg now oversees production, marketing, distribution and strategic planning, and has added Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Films and Paramount Television Studios to her purview. Goldberg joined Skydance in 2010 as president of production and helped found Skydance Television in 2013. Most recently, Goldberg was chief creative officer of Skydance overseeing several entries in the “Mission: Impossible” film franchise, as well as hit series like “Reacher” and “Jack Ryan.” Before joining Skydance, Goldberg was head of production at Village Roadshow Pictures.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t28.

For the previous 10 years, Greenstein was at the top of Sony’s Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films, AFFIRM Films, and Sony Pictures Animation, overseeing films including the “Spider-Man” and “Spiderverse” franchises, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “James Bond” and Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women.” During Greenstein’s tenure, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” became Sony’s highest-grossing film of all time, earning $1.91 billion worldwide at the box office and “Into the Spider-Verse” won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Prior to joining Sony, he was head of marketing at Paramount Pictures, overseeing franchises including “Transformers,” “Star Trek,” “Jackass” and “Scary Movie.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t29.

Gunn, the operation’s creative mind, took those efforts into his own hands with last summer’s hit “Superman,” which had epic responsibility of relaunching DC Universe. (The studio’s last iteration of superhero movies imploded with the unfortunate losing-streak of “The Flash,” “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” “Shazam: Fury of the Gods” and “Blue Beetle.”) Gunn will return to the director’s chair for what he describes as the “next installment in the Super-Family,” but he’s passed off the reins for “Supergirl” and “Clayface,” two spinoffs set in 2026 that’ll be a bigger test of DC’s popularity. Both focus on comic book characters that don’t enjoy the benefit of being household names. Safran, a business-minded executive and a former talent manager with Brillstein-Grey, has proven a flair for knowing the projects that’ll speak to audiences. He’s a lead producer on the “Conjuring” universe, which is the highest-grossing horror franchise with more than $2 billion across nine films.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t30.

The Canadian-born studio emerged as a global contender on Feltheimer’s watch with hits such as the “Twilight” and “The Hunger Games” film series. The studio rode the pre-Peak TV wave of scripted expansion with such distinctive hits as “Mad Men,” “Weeds” and more recently “Ghosts,” “Yellowjackets” and “The Studio.” But like every other studio, Lionsgate’s traditional profit engines are under new pressures that will challenge the leadership of a long-serving CEO.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t31.

In 2012, she returned to NBC, and quickly saw her star rise as she worked in drama on series such as “The Blacklist” and “This Is Us.” Moving to Universal TV as president, she expanded the Dick Wolf empire (which now includes the “Law & Order,” “Chicago” and “FBI” franchises) and built a thriving business as a supplier to outlets like Netflix and HBO. Taking over Universal Studio Group in 2020, Igbokwe now oversees teams that handle staples like NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “America’s Got Talent” as well as HBO Max’s “Hacks,” Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside” and all those Wolf shows.

Movie.”\nThe studio’s movies are produced in Paris and frequently cost half of what Disney and Pixar spends on films.\n\n\n\n\tChris Meledandri founded Illumination in 2007 after a stint running animation at Fox. He quickly established the company, which was backed by Universal, as one of the most successful producers of family fare in Hollywood. It all kicked off with 2010’s “Despicable Me,” the story of a reformed supervillain named Gru that has spawned four films and three spinoffs featuring the Minions. But Illumination didn’t stop there, producing hits such as “The Grinch,” “Sing” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” What makes the company’s output particularly appealing is that its movies cost between $70 million to $100 million to produce, far less than the $200 million that Disney typically spends. Next up, Illumination will release “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” and “Minions 3,” both of which are expected to be among 2026’s biggest box office players.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t37.

Pictures executive came to Amazon MGM following the ecommerce giant’s purchase of the studio that Variety famously dubbed “the Lion.” Valenti’s arrival was seen as sign that the enlarged studio operation was getting serious about revving up a slate of commercial theatrical films. Valenti’s experience ranges from Harry Potter franchise films to Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby” to LEGO movies that helped revive Warner Bros.’ feature animation activity. Now she’s been entrusted with one of filmdom’s crown jewels, James Bond. Valenti’s first move was to turn to seasoned franchise film pros, Amy Pascal and David Heyman, to shepherd Agent 007 into a new chapter with a new star.

And while full-year annual profit for 2025 declined 23%, largely due to the termination of WMG’s distribution deal with BMG, publishing and recorded music revenue thrived, surging 14.6 percent to $1.87 billion. Much of that can be credited to the success of various WMG artists — Rosé, Alex Warren and Sombr, to name a few. Under Kyncl’s leadership in 2025, WMG struck major licensing deals with AI startups Klay and Udio, the latter of which it had previously sued for copyright infringement. He has an ambitious blueprint to lead the company into the future — he even wrote a “10 year plan” for the company — but its execution will be a challenge.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t41.

The successful adaptation of the “Fallout” gaming franchise into an Amazon Prime Video drama series was another feather in Spencer’s cap.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t44.

By that time it will have been 13 year since the debut of “GTA 5.” Outside of Take-Two, Zelnick may well wind up with a bigger footprint in entertainment if ZMC finds opportunities in the M&A wave that is gripping traditional media and entertainment.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t45.

However, Perkins’ latest film, “Keeper,” was a rare miss.

After helping launch iconic series like “Friends” and “ER” at Warner Bros.

He also developed “The Good Wife” and its spinoffs with Robert and Michelle King, and is guiding Kathy Bates’ successful “Matlock” series. Stapf brought the “Star Trek” world back to life on TV with “Star Trek: Discovery,” “Picard,” “Lower Decks,” “Strange New Worlds” and “Starfleet Academy.” In late night, he oversaw the launches of Stephen Colbert’s and James Corden’s talkers — and their wind downs (including Colbert’s exit this coming May). And he launched the first new daytime soap in years, CBS’ “Beyond the Gates.” Stapf even expanded his domain as a supplier for streamers like Netflix, and as an international producer on shows including “Colin From Accounts” and “King & Conqueror.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t58.

Over the past few years, he’s survived a pandemic that devastated his business and withstood rollercoaster share prices amid a box office that has failed to regain its pre-pandemic strength. Rather than relying entirely on the studios that supply the blockbusters, Aron has made several attempts to expand AMC’s business outside of box office, including the viral “Dune” popcorn bucket and other movie-themed merchandise that has contributed tens of millions in annual sales. He also spearheaded the chain’s foray into distribution with 2023’s commercial hit “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert film and this year’s “Taylor Swift: The Release Party of a Showgirl.” And he turned AMC into the de facto choice for movie lovers after hiring Nicole Kidman for the chain’s now-iconic promotional campaign to get people back to the movies. (Patrons even petitioned when AMC attempted to shorten the commercial, in which Kidman famously declares that “somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this.”) Now that’s movie magic.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t64.

With Gelfond’s strategic release schedule, the company delivered its best year ever in 2025 with $1.2 billion globally.\n\n\n\n\tBlockbuster directors and stars like Christopher Nolan, Tom Cruise and Ryan Coogler are known to rhapsodize about the singular experience of watching their films in Imax, a premium film format that has skyrocketed in popularity since COVID. That makes Richard Gelfond, who controls access to the finite number of screens that tend to generate outsized ticket sales, a very popular person when those mega-watt talents have a new movie to unveil. Thanks to Gelfond’s key relationships, Imax has benefited in recent years as audiences opt for premium large formats to distinguish the out-of-the-home moviegoing experience. When Gelfond joined Imax in 1994, the company was best known for supplying science documentaries to theaters inside museums. Over the decades, Gelfond, who became CEO in 2009, has turned the technology brand into a legitimate powerhouse in Hollywood.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t65.

Partnerships — with Louis Messina for Swift, with Goldenvoice’s Paul Tollett for Coachella and Stagecoach, with Latin powerhouse CMN Events — are a key strength, and he’s also more than doubled the company’s venue portfolio to over 100 (which include L.A.’s Crypto.com Arena and the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas), and also runs other iconic events like London’s BST Hyde Park, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and many more across the globe.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t77.

Pictures’ longtime marketing and distribution chief, responsible for launching the wildly popular “Harry Potter” and “Lord of the Rings” franchises, among other blockbusters.\nShe served as lead consultant on Amazon MGM’s extensive rollout campaign for the first season of “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” before she was hired as the studio’s head of global marketing.\nShe launched the production company Kroll & Co. Entertainment and counts “A Star Is Born” and “Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn” among her credits.\n\n\n\n\tSue Kroll is skilled at selling movies. The former Warner Bros marketing chief was responsible for major promotional campaigns, including “Harry Potter,” “Lord of the Rings” and Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy, as well as awards fare like “Argo” and “The Blind Side.” So when Amazon MGM decided to get into the theatrical business and ramp up its film slate, the studio recruited Kroll – reuniting her with Courtenay Valenti, Amazon MGM’s head of film and Warner Bros. former production chief – to market its movies to the masses. The studio admittedly hasn’t had a ton of theatrical offerings since Amazon MGM committed to the big screen. (Making movies takes time.) So 2026 releases, including the Chris Pratt-led “Mercy,” Ryan Gosling’s space drama “Project Hail Mary” and Colleen Hoover adaptation “Verity,” will be a better showcase of Kroll’s talent. And once they get around to casting the next James Bond, she’ll be responsible for shaking and stirring the 007 franchise for a new generation.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t82.

Since taking the helm in 2015, Saada has doubled the group’s subscriber base to more than 40 million across 70 countries, while tightening cost structures, cutting losses and sustaining a €5 billion annual investment in content. Saada joined Canal+ Group in 2004 and moved through the ranks, has fueled the company’s growth through targeted acquisitions, including stakes in The Pictures Company in the U.S., Nordic pay-TV group Viaplay and Asian streamer Viu, capped this year by the takeover of MultiChoice Group, cementing Canal+’s leadership in Africa. In parallel, Saada  secured a 34% stake in UGC, reinforcing vertical integration alongside Studiocanal, the producer behind “Paddington.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t85.

The self-made French producer co-founded Mediawan with telecom billionaire Xavier Niel and investment banker Matthieu Pigasse as a special-purpose acquisition vehicle in 2015. Ten years and (likely) over a thousand transatlantic flights later, Capton has turned Mediawan into one of Europe’s leading production-distribution players amid a fiercely competitive market, generating upwards of $1 billion in annual revenues and housing over 80 labels worldwide, including the producers of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” “Miraculous” and “Call My Agent” — with a movie spinoff in post boasting George Clooney and Eva Longoria cameos, and a U.S. remake set in the sports representation worlds with HBO and SpringHill. Capton has been the architect of this international expansion, gaining the trust of high-profile talent and spearheading headline-making acquisitions that put the company on the English-language map, including majority stakes in Oscar-winning banners such as Brad Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner’s Plan B (“Adolescence,””F1”), and “Slow Horses” producer See-Saw Films. Capton also just enlisted Margot Robbie’s LuckyChap for a joint venture based in London.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t86.

Eighteen years later, the London-headquartered company has evolved from a niche streamer into a full-fledged studio spanning theatrical distribution and production, with more than 400 employees across 15 markets. Mubi broke through in the U.S. with Coralie Fargeat’s body-horror breakout “The Substance,” which it distributed in theaters and grossed $83 million worldwide in 2024. It also earned five Oscar nominations, which meant that the ceremony last March marked Cakarel’s first trip to the Academy Awards. Cakarel, who says he “built Mubi brick by brick,” remains bullish on reinvigorating moviegoing culture.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t87.

Appointed vice chair in 2004, she oversaw CJ’s shift from domestic film and TV operations into a vertically integrated entertainment group with reach across Asia and the U.S. Under her watch, CJ-backed projects included Oscar winner “Parasite,” while platforms like KCON and the Mnet Asian Music Awards grew from local showcases into international fixtures. As global demand accelerated, Lee pushed CJ further into the U.S., backing CJ ENM’s majority acquisition of Endeavor Content, now Fifth Season, and the launch of the First Light StoryHouse label with Janet Yang. As Korean film, TV and music have broken firmly into the U.S. mainstream, Lee remains behind one of the few companies built to operate across all three at scale. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t88.

Banijay now operates over 130 production companies across more than 25 territories with a huge library of global IP.\n\n\n\n\tMarco Bassetti is navigating the current age of consolidation without losing sight of the bottom line. As streamer budgets shrink and linear channels lose relevance he is judiciously continuing to grow the company’s footprint while attaining scale with a wide range of premium content. Scale gives Banijay leverage in its negotiations with streaming giants and bolsters its efforts to retain IP ownership rather than selling it outright. The company’s production side, that includes brands such as  “MasterChef,” “Big Brother,” “Peaky Blinders” and “Black Mirror,” is looking to expand its reach in English-speaking markets, including the U.S., though Bassetti is not planning to compete directly with Hollywood studios in the scripted sphere. Diversifying beyond traditional TV content, Banijay since 2023 holds a majority stake in live entertainment outfit Balich Wonder Studios that is driving growth thanks to production of high-profile events such as the opening ceremony of the upcoming Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Banijay has also made inroads in the creator-led entertainment space, notably its Creators Lab launched with YouTube. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t89.

But he’s repositioned the company to better exploit opportunities in other lines of business with Mattel’s fan-favorite brands, including with the company’s first movie: box-office bonanza “Barbie,” which indisputably became a cultural moment. He has loaded up more projects in the pipeline in film, TV, consumer products, games, live events and experiences, publishing and music. Kreiz’s background as CEO of Fox Kids Europe, Maker Studios and Endemol over the past three decades affords him a keen understanding of how to capitalize on the value of Mattel’s multigenerational fandoms through media.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t99.

The outspoken — if not combative — exec also has stood up to tech giants Apple and Google, battling them in court to try to force them to make their app store policies fairer for independent developers. Meanwhile, Epic’s Unreal Engine 3D graphics platform has been eagerly embraced by professional vfx artists and creators for its ease of use.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t100. Wang Jianlin\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: NurPhoto via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTitle: Chair, Dalian Wanda Group\n\n\tHeld job since: 1988\n\n\tSources of power: \n\n\nHe retains influence over China’s largest cinema footprint through Wanda-branded theaters embedded in Wanda Plaza real estate he still controls. \nHe owns major exhibition assets outside China, including Australia and New Zealand’s Hoyts Group. \nHe controls Infront Sports & Media, a global sports marketing firm managing rights for major winter sports, Serie A and selected FIFA-related events. \n\n\n\n\tFor a decade, Wang Jianlin was the most visible symbol of China’s global entertainment ambitions, snapping up marquee Western assets and building the world’s largest cinema footprint. That expansion unwound after Beijing tightened controls on outbound capital and targeted highly leveraged overseas acquisitions, forcing Wanda into debt restructuring and the exit from assets such as AMC Theatres and Legendary Entertainment. What remains is narrower but durable. While Wang no longer controls Wanda Film, Wanda Cinemas continue to operate at scale under a brand synonymous with his legacy and are largely housed within Wanda Plaza properties he still owns. Overseas, Hoyts preserves exhibition muscle in Australia and New Zealand. Most resilient is Infront Sports & Media, whose grip on premium sports rights anchors Wang’s influence beyond film. His power now rests in infrastructure rather than dealmaking. \n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t",

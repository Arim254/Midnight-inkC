    "body": "\n\tCJ ENM‘s upcoming military drama “The Legend of Kitchen Soldier” will world premiere at Series Mania 2026.\n\n\tThe Studio Dragon-produced series has been selected for a special screening in the festival’s program, marking it as the only Korean content premiering at the event.\n\n\tSet to launch as a TVING Original, the high-concept drama follows a so-called “plastic-spoon man” — a term referencing those born into economic disadvantage — who enlists in the military to escape difficult circumstances. His journey toward becoming a legendary army cook takes an unexpected turn when he encounters a mysterious virtual “Quest” system that guides his path as a kitchen soldier. Each mission he completes, from the cookhouse and dormitories to the training grounds, pulls him deeper into uncovering the unit’s hidden problems. Armed only with kitchen implements, his unconventional military adventure unfolds.\n\t\n\n\t“Rarely does a drama embrace such freedom and a gonzo joy,” said Carlo Fasino, programming manager at Series Mania. “‘The Legend of Kitchen Soldier’ is a surrealist joyride that finds profound vitality in the wreckage of loss, weaponizing its formal daring with a truly original wit – all anchored by Park Ji-hoon’s revelatory, deeply felt lead turn.”\n\n\n\tSebastian Kim, head of content distribution business unit at CJ ENM, added: “Based on a famous original webtoon, the series has been brought to life by the outstanding creative teams at TVING and Studio Dragon. Through this special screening, we hope to make a strong impression on industry professionals and audiences alike, and open up opportunities for the series to reach viewers across streaming platforms and TV channels worldwide.”\n\t\n\n\tThe selection continues CJ ENM’s strong presence at Series Mania. The company previously showcased “The Cursed” and “Mouse” in the International Panorama section, while “Pyramid Game” and “Duty After School” were featured in Special Screenings.\n\n\tCJ ENM said it is pursuing multiple strategic initiatives to expand its global content distribution capabilities as it strengthens its position in the international Korean content market.\n\n\tKorea is the inaugural Country of Honor at the Series Mania Forum.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrance’s Series Mania, the biggest TV festival in Europe, will open with Disney+ title “The Testaments,” the sequel to the “The Handmaid’s Tale” from  Bruce Miller, showrunner of both series. Stars in attendance at Series Mania will include Ann Dowd, Aunt Lydia in “The Handmaid’s Tale” who narrates “The Testaments,” and Chase Infiniti and Lucy Halliday.\n\n\tThis year’s lineup also includes AMC Network’s “The Audacity,” created by Jonathan Glatzer (“Succession,” “Better Call Saul”) and featuring Billy Magnussen, “The Big Bang Theory” star Simon Helberg and Zach Galifianakis, plus Netflix “Peaky Blinders” movie “The Immortal Man.” \n\t\n\n\tAs reported by Variety‘s Co-Editor-in-Chief Cynthia Littleton, “The Audacity” revolves around an aspiring tech CEO character (played by Magnussen) and a “successful but deeply alienated” founder and inventor played by Helberg.\n\n\n\t“There’s times in history where there’s a Renaissance and Silicon Valley is one of those times in our modern era which is defining humanity,” said Magnussen, while Helberg called his character a “maladjusted genius.”\n\n\t“He’s a bit of a recluse. And there’s loneliness at the heart of all the characters, and they’re all trying to connect, and they’re trying to connect through technology, which has some pitfalls.”\n\n\tOpening up about this year’s trends, Managing Director Laurence Herszberg and Artistic Director Frédéric Lavigne noted that while there has been an “undeniable contraction” in the sector – fewer series submitted, shorter formats, and seasons with fewer episodes – an unexpected benefit has emerged: \n\t\n\n\t“Today’s series creation seems to be less about scale and more about accuracy. There are fewer epic narratives and more concentrated, sometimes harsh offerings, often directly connected to a world under tension.” \n\n\tTalking about the selection, they noted: “Europe is asserting itself as a nerve center of creativity.” \n\n\tApart from Belgium’s strong showing with “Breendonk,” “The Best Immigrant” and  “Eternal,” Sweden will be represented by “My Brother” and “Burden of Justice.” Poland will have two series in the official selection for the very first time: “Love Is Enough” and “Variola Vera.”\n\n\tThe creators have been responding to the rise of authoritarian and fascist systems, stated Herszberg and Lavigne.\n\n\t“Whether rooted in history or veering toward barely veiled anticipation, these series question our ability to resist, collaborate, or flee.” \n\n\tThis includes “Breendonk” and Spain’s “The Anatomy of a Moment,” as well as “The Best Immigrant” which depicts a government organizing the deportation of foreigners.  \n\n\t“These are all works of fiction that implicitly extend the prophetic intuitions of ‘Years and Years’ by [Welsh screenwriter and producer] Russell T Davies, our guest of honor, and force viewers to take a stand: submit, collaborate, resist from within, or go underground?”\n\n\tThemes of violence and masculinity in crisis will be explored in “The Audacity” and “Dear Killer Nannies,” which follows Pablo Escobar’s son and explores “brutality as a legacy.” John Leguizamo will play Escobar. \n\n\tIn the International Panorama, the lawyers in Sweden’s “Burden of Justice” will have to test their own convictions – in “Waiting for the Out,” a philosophy teacher ends up working in prison. The show is based on Andy West’s memoir “The Life Inside: A Memoir of Prison, Family and Learning to be Free.” The cast is led by Josh Finan, known for “The Responder.”\n\n\tThat being said, Herszberg and Lavigne stressed that “heroines are never far away and their struggles are a powerful theme throughout the selection.” \n\n\tAustralian “Dustfall” takes on the sexual violence suffered by women, while “Babies” explores “the joys, sorrows, and social pressures experienced by infertile women.” French series “All Shapes of Us,” created by Fanny Riedberger, won’t shy away from the topic of eating disorders.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to “All Shapes of Us” featuring Catherine Frot, French Competition will welcome “Camarades,” “Eldorado” with Jérémie Rénier and Karim Leklou, “Summer Of ’36,” “Unchained” and “Privilèges” with Manon Bresch and Melvil Poupaud.\n\n\tAnd as for genre offerings? There will be “burlesque Western” (“Lucky Luke”), Japanese science fiction (“Queen of Mars”) and Korean and German comedies (“The Legend of Kitchen Soldier,” “The Flaws”). \n\n\t“More necessary than ever, this year’s series remind us that telling stories about the world remains an essential way of questioning it. And sometimes, an invitation not to resign ourselves to it.”\n\n\tJohn Hopewell contributed to this article.\n\n\tInternational Competition\n\n\t“The Anatomy of a Moment” \n\n\tSpain / Movistar Plus+, Arte / 4×50’\n\n\t“The Audacity” \n\n\tU.S/ AMC, AMC+ / 8×45’\n\n\t“Dear Killer Nannies” (World Premiere)\n\n\tColombia / Disney+, Hulu / 8×35’\n\n\t“Dustfall” (World Premiere)\n\n\tAustralia / ABC TV, BBC, ZDF / 6×50’\n\n\t“Love Is Enough” (working title) (World Premiere)\n\n\tPoland / HBO MAX / 8×35’\n\n\t“Major Players” (World Premiere)\n\n\tU.K. / Channel 4 / 6×30’\n\n\t“My Brother” \n\n\tSweden / SVT, DR, NRK, YLE, Rúv / 4×45’\n\n\t“Paolo” (World Premiere)\n\n\tFrance / HBO MAX / 7×52’\n\n\t“Waiting For the Out”\n\n\tUK / BBC / 6×45’\n\n\tFrench Competition\n\n\t“All Shapes of Us”\n\n\tFrance / TF1 / 6×52’\n\n\t“Camarades”\n\n\tFrance / Arte / 8×30’\n\n\t“Eldorado”\n\n\tFrance/Belgium / Arte, RTBF / 6×45’\n\n\t“Privilèges”\n\n\tFrance / HBO Max / 6×52’\n\n\t“Summer Of ‘36”\n\n\tFrance / Tf1 / 6×52’\n\n\t“Unchained”\n\n\tFrance / France Télévisions / 6×52’\n\n\tInternational Panorama\n\n\t“Babies” (World Premiere)\n\n\tU.K. / BBC / 6×60’\n\n\t“The Best Immigrant” \n\n\tBelgium / Streamz / 5×45’\n\n\t“Breendonk” (World Premiere)\n\n\tBelgium / VRT, Streamz, New8 / 6×55’\n\n\t“Burden Of Justice” \n\n\tSweden / Svt / 8×45’\n\n\t“Eternal” \n\n\tBelgium / RTBF, Proximus / 6×45’\n\n\t“The Flaws” (World Premiere)\n\t\n\n\tGermany / ZDF / 4×25’\n\n\t“Prisoner 951” \n\n\tUK / BBC One, BBC iplayer / 5×55’\n\n\t“Queen Of Mars” \n\n\tJapan / NHK / 6×49’\n\n\t“Small Prophets” \n\n\tUK / BBC / 6×30’\n\n\t“These Sacred Vows” \n\n\tIreland / RTE One / 6×52’\n\n\t“Welcome To Kingston-Falls” (World Premiere)\n\n\tCanada / Ici Radio-Canada / 6×43’\n\n\t“Variola Vera” \n\n\tPoland / TVP / 7×45’\n",

    "body": "\n\tParis-based sales outfit MMM Film Sales has boarded Rima Das‘ “Not a Hero,” which is set to world premiere in the Generation section at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\tThe India-Singapore co-production, shot in Assamese, Hindi and English, centers on a young boy who is sent from the city to live in his ancestral village. There, he encounters his embittered aunt, forms a bond with a horse and embarks on wild escapades with the local children, ultimately uncovering an inner strength and the simple beauty of rural life.\n\t\n\n\tThe film stars Bhuman Bhargav Das, Sukanya Boruah and Mrinmoy Das.\n\n\n\t“We were deeply impressed by this beautiful, contemporary Huckleberry Finn–like story set in today’s global, hectic world, one that contemplates the world that younger generations will inherit,” said MMM. “‘Not a Hero’ is a film about roots and origins, friendship and values – an encounter between younger and older generations, and a reconciliation between the world of yesterday and the one the protagonists will have to face tomorrow.”\n\n\tDas is known for intimate narratives exploring human connection, self-discovery and maturation against natural landscapes. Her previous works include “Village Rockstars” (2017), which represented India at the 2019 Academy Awards; “Bulbul Can Sing” (2018); “Tora’s Husband” (2022); and “Village Rockstars 2” (2024). Her films have screened at more than 150 festivals globally, collecting over 75 awards, with stops at Toronto, Berlinale and Busan.\n\n\t“Not a Hero” is produced by Flying River Films in India, Akanga Film Asia in Singapore and TrainTripper Films in India.\n\t\n\n\tChippy Babu and Abhishek Sharma of TrainTripper Films stated: “TrainTripper Films has always supported filmmakers who have a distinct voice that have empowered change, no matter how small it may seem, even as a conversation starter. Our ethos is to champion films such as Rima’s that have an impact that lasts beyond the screen. Rima is an artist and a singular force of nature, and we are truly honored to join her on this journey and support her in her expression of freedom, and work on making this a larger conversation across the globe.”\n\n\tAt the European Film Market, the newly launched MMM will also present Cris Tapia’s genre offering “Gunman,” which recently premiered at Rotterdam; Abdelkarim El-Fassi’s “Porte Bagage,” which world premiered at Marrakech; Junna Chif’s “Invisibles” and Andrés Clariond Rangel’s “Versalles,” produced by Nicolàs Celis, both in competition at PÖFF Tallinn.\n\n\tThe company’s slate additionally features K. Papadakis and S. Dinopoulos’ “Bearcave,” selected for Venice’s Giornate degli Autori; Stroma Cairns’ “The Son and the Sea,” a BIFA nominee that screened at TIFF, San Sebastián and BFI London Film Festival; and Laurent Slama’s “A Second Life,” starring Agathe Rousselle and Alex Lawther, which will be released in Germany by Port au Prince.\n",

    "body": "\n\tShirley Jackson’s classic horror novel “The Haunting of Hill House” is being adapted for the stage, with a U.K. tour launching this fall. The production marks the latest iteration of Jackson’s 1959 supernatural thriller, following the 2018 Netflix series that brought the story to a new generation of viewers.\n\n\tThe production centers on a group of investigators who take on the mystery of Hill House, with curiosity descending into fear as strange disturbances ripple through the mansion’s corridors.\n\t\n\n\tOlivier and BAFTA award-winner Stef Smith has written the stage adaptation, which will be directed by Martin Constantine. Wiltshire Creative is producing in association with Theatr Clwyd, with Mark Puddle, Alexander “Sandy” Marshall and Patrick Myles presenting.\n\n\n\t“From film and television to the stage, my mother Shirley Jackson’s legacy continues to endure through her iconic novel ‘The Haunting of Hill House,'” said Laurence J. Hyman, Jackson’s son. “I’m thrilled that this haunting classic will return in a new form, and that Stef Smith’s adaptation will capture the novel’s remarkable and unsettling spirit for audiences in a whole new way.”\n\n\tSmith described adapting Jackson’s work as “a true privilege,” calling it “one of the greatest supernatural novels of the last one hundred years.”\n\n\t“I find Shirley Jackson’s world intoxicating, thrilling and gut-wrenching,” Smith said. “I believe there is something so deeply theatrical at the heart of Hill House. From the spooky, to the surreal, through heartache and hope. I hope that our cast of characters will take the audience along for a ride quite unlike anything else. Above all we will examine that the biggest horrors are usually human.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production launches Sept. 11 at Salisbury Playhouse, running through Oct. 3 before transferring to Richmond Theatre Oct. 6-10. The tour continues to Theatr Clwyd (Oct. 13-17), Theatre Royal Brighton (Oct. 20-24), Palace Theatre Manchester (Oct. 27-31), Liverpool Everyman & Playhouse (Nov. 3-7), and concludes at Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh Nov. 10-14.\n\n\tJackson (1916-1965) was an American writer celebrated for horror and mystery works. Over her career spanning more than two decades, she authored six novels, two memoirs and more than 200 short stories. Her novels include “The Road Through the Wall,” “Hangsaman,” “The Bird’s Nest,” “The Sundial” and “We Have Always Lived in the Castle.”\n\n\tSmith’s theater credits include “Roadkill” (Theatre Royal Stratford East, winner of the Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre), “Girl in the Machine,” “Swallow” (Traverse Theatre/Edinburgh Festival Fringe) and “Human Animals” (Royal Court Theatre). Her screenwriting credits include “Float,” which won the BAFTA Scotland Award for best television scripted, and “The Outrun.”\n\n\tConstantine is an award-winning theater and opera director whose theatre credits include “Peter Pan” (Storyhouse Theatre, Chester), “The Owl and the Pussycat” and “Marsha” (Arcola Theatre). His opera credits include “The Elixir of Love,” “The Silent Twins” (Almeida Theatre) and “Dead Man Walking.”\n\n\tPuddle has over 20 years of experience producing and touring large-scale plays and musicals across the West End, U.K. and internationally. West End highlights include co-producing “Dr. Strangelove” (starring Steve Coogan), “Elektra” (starring Brie Larson), “True West” (starring Kit Harington and Johnny Flynn) and “The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole: The Musical.”\n\n\tThe production is supported using public funding by Arts Council England.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA new marketplace aimed at bringing French scripted content to Asian screens will debut at Mumbai’s Red Lorry Film Festival, connecting rights holders from France with buyers across India and Southeast Asia looking to develop local versions of film, television, animation and digital properties.\n\n\tThe French IP Market has secured backing from France’s Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs alongside the Institut français. The marketplace model emphasizes face-to-face interaction, offering curated pitches, meetings between individual buyers and sellers, and discussions analyzing successful adaptation case studies.\n\t\n\n\tFifteen French entities will showcase their catalogs at the market. Goodfellas Films, Le Pacte, Banijay Kids, MK2, La Belle Télé, France Films TV, Mediatoon, Matriochkas, Lukarn, PitStop Studio, Fayard, Robert Laffont, Habebo Studios, Maremako and Astier Pêcher represent a cross-section of cinema, television, animation and publishing, all with track records in international markets.\n\n\n\tThe market responds to growing appetite across the region for proven properties that can be reimagined for local audiences. Distributors, broadcasters, streamers and literary agents from throughout India and Southeast Asia are expected to participate.\n\n\tRed Lorry Film Festival’s 2026 edition (March 13-15) will screen several French titles within its Rendezvous With French Cinema program, including “Case 137,” “Colours of Time,” “Nino” and “The Orphans.”\n\n\t“The French IP Market aligns perfectly with Red Lorry Film Festival’s ambition to be a meaningful industry platform for Asia,” said Ashish Saksena, festival director of Red Lorry Film Festival and COO Cinemas at BookMyShow. “France has an extraordinary depth of storytelling and IP that travels well across cultures. By creating a focused marketplace within the festival, we are enabling concrete conversations between creators and buyers, and helping accelerate collaborations that can translate into compelling local adaptations for Asian audiences.”\n\t\n\n\tMathieu Béjot, attaché for audiovisual, cinema and digital content at the French Institute in India, added, “Partnering with Red Lorry Film Festival allows us to place French creators and rights holders at the heart of one of Asia’s most dynamic content markets. The French IP Market is designed to foster long term creative and business relationships while showcasing the diversity, strength and adaptability of French IPs.”\n\n\tThe initiative marks Red Lorry Film Festival’s continued expansion of its industry-focused programming.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Berlin Film Festival got off to a political start on Thursday as the competition jury, led by Wim Wenders, fielded several questions about the current state of the world, including the war in Gaza.\n\n\tAsked if films can affect change in the political realm, the celebrated German director said that “movies can change the world,” but “not in a political way.”\n\n\t“No movie has really changed any politician’s idea. But we can change the idea people have of how they should live,” he continued. “There’s a big discrepancy on this planet between people who want to live their lives and governments who have other ideas. So I think films enter that discrepancy.”\n\t\n\n\tWenders is serving as president of this year’s jury, which includes American helmer Reinaldo Marcus Green (“King Richard”), Japanese filmmaker Hikari (“Rental Family”), “The Zone of Interest” producer Ewa Puszczyńska, Nepalese director Min Bahadur Bham (“Shambala”), South Korean actress Bae Doona and Indian director-producer Shivendra Singh Dungarpur (“Celluloid Man”).\n\n\n\tThe jury was then questioned specifically about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the support the German government — which funds much of the festival — has shown for Israel.\n\n\tPuszczyńska was the first to respond, saying that she felt the question was “a bit unfair.”\n\n\t“Of course, we are trying to talk to people — every single viewer — to make them think, but we cannot be responsible for what their decision would be to support Israel or the decision to support Palestine,” she said. “There are many other wars where genocide is committed, and we do not talk about that. So this is a very complicated question and I think it’s a bit unfair asking us what do you think, how we support, not support, talking to our governments or not.” \n\t\n\n\tWenders added that as filmmakers, “We have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics. But we are the counterweight of politics, we are the opposite of politics. We have to do the work of people, not the work of politicians.”\n\n\tThe livestream of the press conference experienced technical difficulties during this question, with some inquiring if the feed was cut purposefully. But the Berlinale said in a later statement: “We had technical problems with the web streaming of the Press Conference with the International Jury this morning. We would like to extend our sincere apologies. The full recording of the Press Conference will be made available on the Berlinale Website and on YouTube as soon as possible.”\n\n\tElsewhere during the press conference, Wenders — who is no stranger to the Berlinale, having received an honorary Golden Bear in 2015 — talked about what makes the festival stand out from others. “You can be sure you’ll see more facets of the world than in any other festival,” he said. “That’s their great strength, you know?”\n\n\tThe 76th edition of the Berlin Film Festival kicks off on Thursday night with the premiere of Shahrbanoo Sadat’s “No Good Men” and runs until Feb. 22. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSamuel Goldwyn Films has acquired U.S. distribution rights to the supernatural thriller “The Wolf and the Lamb” from Concourse Media, which will continue global sales at the European Film Market.\n\n\tDirected by Michael Schilf, “The Wolf and the Lamb” stars Cassandra Scerbo (“Sharknado”), Jaydon Clark (“9-1-1: Lone Star”), Eric Nelson (“1883”), Angus Macfadyen (“Braveheart”), Q’orianka Kilcher (“The New World”), Sammi Rotibi (“Django Unchained”), Adrianne Palicki (“John Wick”), Zach McGowan (“Black Sails”) and James Landry Hébert (“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”).\n\t\n\n\tThe film follows Jo Beckett, a devoted schoolteacher whose life is upended when her young son mysteriously vanishes. Jo’s desperate search leads her through a maze of folklore, paranoia and faith. Facing hostility from neighbors, local authority figures and her own unraveling grip on reality, she must confront terrifying forces that challenge everything she believes.\n\n\n\tSamuel Goldwyn Films plans a 2026 theatrical and digital release.\n\n\t“’The Wolf and the Lamb’ is a singular genre experience — atmospheric, character-driven and the kind of story that rewards both horror aficionados and broader audiences,” said a spokesperson for Samuel Goldwyn Films. “We’re thrilled to bring this chilling journey to U.S. audiences and support Michael Schilf’s bold vision.”\n\n\tThe deal was negotiated by Matthew Shreder of Concourse Media with Miles Fineburg of Samuel Goldwyn Films.\n\n\tAlongside “The Wolf and the Lamb,” Concourse Media is presenting an EFM slate that includes the crime thriller “The Smack,” starring Casey Affleck, Sam Rockwell, Marisa Tomei and Kathy Bates, as well as the action-thriller “Hour of Reckoning,” led by Kiefer Sutherland.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKatie Holmes penned a heartfelt tribute to her “Dawson’s Creek” co-star James Van Der Beek following the news of his death at the age of 48. \n\n\tHolmes — who broke out on the teen drama as Joey Potter, the love interest of Van Der Beek’s Dawson Leery — posted on Instagram late Wednesday night to share a handwritten note to him. He died on Wednesday after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2023 and is survived by his wife, Kimberly Brook, and their six children.\n\t\n\n\t“I formed some words with a heavy heart,” Holmes wrote in the caption of her post. “This is a lot to process. I am so grateful to have shared in a piece of James’ journey. He is beloved. Kimberly, we love you and will be here always for you and your beautiful children.”\n\n\n\tHolmes and Van Der Beek starred together on “Dawson’s Creek” from 1998 to 2003. In the handwritten letter, Holmes thanked Van Der Beek for all the memories they made together. “To share space with your imagination is sacred — breathing the same air in the land of make believe and trusting that each others’ hearts are safe in their expression,” she wrote.\n\n\t“These are some of the memories, along with laughter, conversations about life, James Taylor songs — adventures of a unique youth… Bravery. Compassion. Selflessness. Strength. An appreciation for life and the action taken to live life with the integrity that life is art — creating a beautiful marriage, six loving children – the journey of a hero. I mourn this loss with a heart holding the reality of his absence and a deep gratitude for his imprint on it. To Kimberly and the children, we are here for you always. And will always be there to shower you with love and compassion.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t If Cannes’ Annecy Animation Showcase is now an established appetizer for June’s Annecy Festival, this first EFM Animation Days lineup is nothing short of a hearty breakfast. Beyond the five projects listed in Annecy’s Friday presentation, a carefully curated selection completes a solid slate of 28 presentations. Producers will have the opportunity to present projects at different stages of development and financing, but all have something of note and are worth discovering. \n\t\n\n\tRanging from small independent producers to well established animation powerhouses, all teams will use Berlinale as a global platform to prove once again the medium’s potential, and its strong market appeal. \n\n\n\tOur 10 picks underscore the diversity of what the animation industry is capable of in these shifting landscapes: Pushing forward unique creative visions and bold artistic choices. \n\n\tAnnecy EFM Animation Showcase \n\n\tThis year’s five titles range from historical drama to folk horror and sci-fi eco-conscious adventure, carefully selected by Annecy’s teams. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA Door to the Woods\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“A Door to the Woods,” Jola Kudela (Poland, France, Czech Republic, Belgium)\n\n\tInspired by real people and true historical events, this new animated feature tells the tale of two young Poles (Antek, hiding in Breslau and Wiktor surviving a gulag) reunited decades after their separation through Jola, Antek’s granddaughter, whose creative future Wiktor helps unlock. A voyage through the history of three oppressive regimes that tore Europe apart during the last century: Fascism, Stalinism, and Communism.\n\t\n\n\tProducers: Opus Film, Les Films Du Poisson Rouge, PFX\n\n\tGenre: Historical Drama\n\n\tArtistic technique: 2D, 3D, rotoscope\n\n\tCompletion: 2028\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGranny is a Tree!\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Granny is a Tree!” Hugo de Faucompret (France, Luxembourg)\n\n\tGranny Onion, Jane’s whimsical grand-mother, takes one last eternal after-lunch nap. Against her mother’s decision, Jane takes it upon herself to fulfil her granny’s last wish: Granny Onion’s will states that she choses natural organic reduction for her funeral. In short, she wants to be “humused”! Cécile, Jane’s mom, is against it. Besides, it’s not even legal in France!  But Jane is determined. And with her granny’s facetious ghost, she’ll set off on a wild escape to the edge of the tangible world.\n\n\tProducers: Laïdak Films, Dandelooo, Doghouse\n\n\tGenre: Comedy, Adventure, Modern tale\n\n\tArtistic technique: 2D, hand-painted backgrounds\n\n\tCompletion: 2028\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMouMoush – The King of Plastic\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“MouMoush – The King of Plastic” Milorad Krstic (Hungary)\n\n\tWhile vacationing in Transylvania, two curious siblings (10 year-old Margot and 14-year-old Liam) from Paris are thrust into a time-traveling adventure. Their mission? To thwart MouMoush, a powerful figure known as the King of Plastic who is plotting to seize control of the entire world. From the team behind “Ruben Brandt”comes this awaited feature blending fantasy, time travel and environmental themes together, along with the directors’ unique humor.\n\n\tProducer: Mumus Production LLC\n\n\tGenre: Fantasy, Adventure\n\n\tArtistic technique: 2D, 3D\n\n\tCompletion: 2028\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPesta\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Pesta” Hanne Berkaak (Norway, Germany, France)\n\n\tAs the horrors of the Black Death fuel fear and superstition, Catholic noble girl Astrid experiences the bliss of first love with Ilkka, a heathen outcast. When Ilkka is accused of witchcraft by a system based on lies, telling the truth becomes the most dangerous act of all. Set in Norway in 1349, “Pesta” is a romantic horror folk tale that will blur the lines between reality and fantasy to craft a compelling story of love beyond societal norms. A title that promises chilling journey into the dark side of Nordic folklore.\n\n\tProducers: Mikrofilm, Knudsen Pictures, Rosalie Films and Charades\n\t\n\n\tGenre: Romantic Horror\n\n\tArtistic technique: 2D\n\n\tCompletion: 2029\n\n\t“Zako” Tigran Arakelyan (Armenia, France, Lithuania)\n\n\tOtherwise known as Sargis Mangasaryan, the Armenian painter Zako (a name he was given by the Germans) survived Nazi’s POW camps only by drawing portraits of his tormentors. In 1956, he discovered with shock one of Picasso’s iconic masterpieces: “Guernica” and realized how much of his own talent was stifled by both Nazi Germany and later the communism of Armenia’s Soviet Era. According to Arakelyan, who adapts the graphic novel “Zako”with this feature, the filmwill use modern VR technology combined with classical CG tools to create a new visual language, the makers say, fit to adapt this story to the screen.\n\n\tProducers: OnOff Studio, Sacrebleu Productions, Broom Films\n\n\tGenre: Historical Drama\n\n\tArtistic technique: 3D\n\n\tCompletion: 2028\n\n\tSpotlights\n\n\tBeyond this lineup, Spotlights from Canada, Germany, U.K. and CEE and an International Animation Showcase complete this packed slate. Here are five projects at (very) early stages that piqued our curiosity. \n\n\t“Fifteen Dogs” Chris Landreth (Canada)\n\n\tBased on André Alexis’s Giller Prize-winning novel, “Fifteen Dogs” marks the latest project from Copperheart Ent. (“Night of the Zoopocalypse”). What begins with a wager between Greek gods who grant a group of Toronto dogs human intelligence turns into quick-paced animated drama, where these newly smart pets navigate shifting loyalties, new language, and emerging identities. \n\n\tProducers: Copperheart Entertainment (Steven Hoban, Mark Smith)\n\n\tGenre: Drama (teens and adults)\n\n\t“Acorn’s Adventure” Filip Mašek (Czech Republic, Germany)\n\n\tPitched last year as part of Annecy’s MIFA Features presentation, “Acorn’s Adventure” puts animation in the hands of children, with visionary director Filip Mašek at the wheel. The film is a beautiful CG project filled with quirky forest characters designed by the daring imaginations of nature-loving children. Quido, a boy made of acorns, will try to find its purpose in a forest village where every tiny character seems to already have a definite role. An animated adventure with a catchy and child-friendly log(line): be yourself, even if you don’t know what that is yet.\n\t\n\n\tProducers: Pure Shore, Fabian & Fred\n\n\tGenre: Family-friendly Adventure \n\n\t“The Pirate King” (Netherlands/Taiwan)\n\n\tPresented by Alex Dowding, Submarine’s animation producer on the project, “The Pirate King,” a 3D animated fantasy adventure, is currently in development as a rather unique Netherlands-Taiwanese co-production. A story of unlikely friendship, myth, and adventure, blended in a project that reflects Submarine’s passion for globally collaborative storytelling.\n\n\tProducers: Submarine, Studio2 Animation Lab\n\n\tGenre: Fantasy, Adventure\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTreasure Island\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Treasure Island” (Germany)\n\n\tWhat if the hero of Stevenson’s beloved classic was a girl… and a cat? In this new animated musical, Jane Hawkins is fed up with the boring life of her cat boarding school. Could that ship setting off on a treacherous treasure hunt to a remote island be the key to her freedom? \n\n\tAnimated in lush CG animation, this new take on the pirate classic story with an animal twist could conquer the hearts of global audiences. \n\n\tProducers: Little Dream Entertainment\n\n\tGenre: Family Entertainment, Musical\n\n\t“Reds & Grays” (U.K.)\n\n\tPowered by Two Daughters Entertainment (“Master Moley”, “The Land of Sometimes”), “Reds & Grays” is an original story rooted deep in the real-life ecological conflict between red and grey squirrels. In a distinct British setting, this adventure blends romance, rebellion and political intrigue in what seems like a funny and fluffy Romeo and Juliet inspired story, with universal themes.\n\n\tProducers: Two Daughters Entertainment\n\n\tGenre: Family Entertainment\n",

I’m Bill, and I’m the city slicker who’s going to head to Texas with you to break down new episodes of this lovable Billy Bob Thornton drama. As Season 2 begins, the characters are facing many changes. Among them, Monty Miller (Jon Hamm) is dead and his wife Cami (Demi Moore) is taking over M-Tex; cartel boss Jimenez (Alex Meraz) was killed by his boss Gallino (Andy Garcia); Cooper (Jacob Lofland) is trying to make his scandalous relationship with Ariana (Paulina Chavez) work as he heads off on his own to try to be an oil tycoon; and Tommy (Thornton) is promoted to have even more responsibilities at M-Tex after Monty’s death. It’s a stressful time, so let’s dive right in.\n\t\n\n\nBetween Tommy’s breakfast conspiracy lecture and mainlining coffee and cigarettes before the sun’s up, I’m worried about him having a heart attack, too!\nThere’s good music already this season — a Turnpike Troubadours needle drop not even five minutes in? Hell yeah!\n“The mosquitoes are so big, they can fuck a turkey flat-footed.” Is it possible that’s not a folksy Texas expression but rather a horrifying reality in the South?\n“It’s a young woman’s game here — no offense.” I’m sorry, Demi Moore made “The Substance” — you must treat her with respect or prepare to be eaten alive.\nCami’s speech rules, and is a great reminder of the take-no-prisoners attitude that makes this show special. “The only difference between me and Monty is I’m meaner. Test me and you’ll find out how much.” Fuck yeah!\nHow is Cooper’s first drill this successful? Another shoe has to drop on this get-rich-quick operation, right?\nWow, Ariana couldn’t be less excited about being an overnight multimillionaire. Why is she so cagey?\nAngela (Ali Larter) expressing her love of grey sweatpants to her daughter, Ainsley (Michelle Randolph), is pretty gross! Will we see Tommy wearing them in a future episode?\nAinsley and this college counselor couldn’t be less of a fit — give me a bottle episode with these two on a road trip!\nShout out to Randolph, who walks a tricky line during this scene between being way over her head and disarmingly sweet. It’s hard to empathize with someone who spends the bulk of their admittance meeting babbling on about the importance of hot people having kids together, but she makes it work.\nOof, what a sad introduction to T.L. (Sam Elliott). Is it too soon to cry this season?\nT.L.’s harsh rebuttal of reconnecting with his wife after he passes: “If I do, that means I’m in hell too.” Woof, we’ve got some trauma to explore soon.\nThe way the Norris women act around Cooper, you can practically smell him through the television.\nIt’s funny how quickly everyone scatters when Angela starts throwing plates during her tantrum. Bonus points to those around the table who escaped with their drinks and food in hand.\nTommy and Angela’s rapid, NC-17 make-up after the dinner fight proves that those two loonies are meant for each other.\nThere’s something about Thornton’s cigarette smoking that makes the ugly habit look so appealing, right?\nLove that final shot of the sunset, mirroring Tommy to who we now know is his father, T.L., as they both search for meaning in the family matriarch’s death.\n\n\n\n\tUntil next week, feel free to discuss your own conspiracy theories and far-fetched easy money schemes in the comments below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Fast Rise, Long Decline, and Agonizing Downfall of the MTV Empire\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMeet Strangelove, the Cult-Favorite Fragrance House Powered by Oud\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder Armour’s CEO Just Did the Thing He ‘Couldn’t Imagine’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSara Happ Leaves Namesake Brand\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” pulled off a nifty magic trick, besting Glen Powell’s big-budget action-thriller, “The Running Man,” and the second weekend of “Predator: Badlands,” the critically adored reboot of the long-running monster franchise. \n\n\tThe third “Now You See Me” film picked up $21.3 million over the weekend, a solid result for a series that hasn’t had a new entry since 2016. The film also grossed $54.2 million across 64 international territories this weekend for a worldwide total of $75.5 million. \n\t\n\n\t“This is still a viable franchise,” says Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at ComScore. “The international audience really delivered for the film.”\n\n\n\tIt’s good news for Lionsgate, the studio behind the $90 million illusionist adventure, which has failed to materialize many hits in recent months (the list of duds includes “Ballerina” and “Good Fortune”). It may signal a shift in the studio’s fortunes, with “The Housemaid,” an adaptation of Freida McFadden’s best-selling potboiler, hitting theaters in December, and “Michael,” a biopic of Michael Jackson, and “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,” opening in 2026. Ruben Fleischer, who previously helmed “Venom” and “Zombieland,” handled directing duties on “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” with stars Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco returning as a group of magicians who fleece corrupt one-percenters. A fourth film is in the works.\n\n\t“We gave the audience exactly what they wanted,” says Kevin Grayson, head of domestic distribution for Lionsgate. He argued that “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” was able to broaden its audience by bringing back franchise mainstays and adding a new generation of stars such as Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa and Ariana Greenblatt. “The new cast helped bring in younger moviegoers,” Grayson added. \n\t\n\n\t“The Running Man,” which paired Powell with cult favorite filmmaker Edgar Wright, was no match for “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” settling for a second-place finish with a lackluster $17 million. Internationally, the film earned $11.2 million for a global haul of $28.2 million. That’s a troubling result considering that Paramount shelled out $110 million to make the movie. It’s also Powell’s first stumble since he began building a following with hits like the rom-com “Anyone But You,” “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Twisters.” Oh, and it’s bad news for Wright, who could have used a box office winner after his last film, “Last Night in Soho,” had the misfortune of opening in 2021 as Omicron was hitting the scene. Heading into the weekend, Paramount had hoped the film would debut to more than $20 million. “The Running Man” was greenlit and produced long before David Ellison’s Skydance took control of Paramount in August.\n\n\t“This thing is dead in the water,” says Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “It doesn’t have enough traction to survive the coming holiday season.” \n\n\tThe weekend’s two major new releases appealed to slightly different demographics. “The Running Man’s” audience was 63% male and 70% between the ages of 18 and 44, while the opening crowd for “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” was 54% female and 65% over the age of 25.\n\n\t“The Running Man” is the second attempt at adapting Stephen King’s dystopian novel; the first was a campy 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger flick. And Schwarzenegger has a connection to “Predator: Badlands,” having starred in the original entry in the series, which was also released in 1987 during his action hero heyday. In its sophomore weekend, “Predator: Badlands” dropped a steep 68% to $13 million to bring the 20th Century Studios release’s domestic haul to $66.3 million. The film cost $105 million to make and has earned $136.3 million globally.\n\n\tThe weekend’s other major new release, Neon’s “Keeper,” the latest indie horror effort from writer-director Osgood Perkins, earned a paltry $2.5 million for a seventh-place debut. That’s a pale shadow of what Perkins’ previous films, “Longlegs” ($22 million) and “The Monkey” ($14 million), earned in their opening weekends. Critics loathed the film, and audiences appeared to agree, handing it a “D+” grade, so word-of-mouth won’t come in handy. The only saving grace is that “Keeper” cost a mere $6 million to produce. Perkins will try to recapture his commercial touch with next year’s “The Young People,” which stars Tatiana Maslany and Nicole Kidman.\n\t\n\n\tParamount’s “Regretting You,” an adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s novel of the same name, took fourth place in its fourth weekend, earning $4 million. That pushes its domestic total to $44.9 million. Universal’s “The Black Phone 2” rounded out the top five, picking up $2.6 million to push its stateside haul to $74.7 million after five weeks of release. \n\n\tIn milestone news, “One Battle After Another” crossed $70 million at the domestic box office and $200 million globally after eight weekends in theaters. That would be a strong result for an R-rated, adult-oriented thriller, save for the fact that Warner Bros. gave director Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio $140 million to make the film. Critics called it a masterpiece, and the movie generated Oscar buzz, but given that “One Battle After Another” needed to make roughly $300 million to break even, the studio is looking at a very steep write-down.\n\n\tOverall, the domestic box office topped out at just over $75 million, slightly ahead of the same period last year when Dwayne Johnson’s holiday comedy “Red One” drove earnings to $73.2 million. Next weekend brings “Wicked: For Good,” giving theater owners renewed hope after they’ve suffered through one of the worst falls in movie business history. To prime the pump, Universal re-released “Wicked,” bringing in $1.2 million.\n\n\t“We’re in the calm before the Thanksgiving storm,” says Dergarabedian. “Things are about to heat up.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tSix months away from its 250th year, the United States of America is still in its infancy. It is an empire forever moving and shifting, trying to decide what it will be. Prolific documentarian Ken Burns and his co-directors, Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt, bring America’s bloody origin story to life in PBS’ vast, highly detailed “The American Revolution,” a project that took nearly a decade to bring to the small screen. Spanning three decades and two continents, the six-episode, 12-hour docuseries is a treasure trove of oft-forgotten history, illustrating who we were and illuminating who we are as a country.\n\t\n\n\tNarrated by frequent Burns collaborator Peter Coyote, “The American Revolution” starts well before that fateful July day in 1776 when the Second Continental Congress formally adopted the Declaration of Independence. The directors begin the tale almost 20 years earlier, when Benjamin Franklin first publicly called for the British colonies to form a union. Franklin’s proposal was initially rejected, yet, as the series highlights, the events of the subsequent years — including unfair taxation by the British government, the French and Indian War, the Boston Massacre and later the Boston Tea Party — led the colonists, who called themselves Patriots, to revisit Franklin’s plan.\n\n\n\tAs with many of Burns’ works, like “The Civil War,” “The American Buffalo” and even “Jazz,” “The American Revolution” is as intricate as it is dense. In the absence of photographs and other modern visuals, the crew used several techniques to bring the period and the hard-won battles to life. Using animated maps and portraits, voice-overs by distinguished orators including Keith David, Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep and Samuel L. Jackson and commentary from such historians and scholars as Vincent Brown and Maggie Blackhawk, the filmmakers and writer Geoffrey Ward create a multidimensional tapestry of the era. Moreover, in hearing firsthand accounts from loyalists and the English Crown, enslaved and free Blacks, Indigenous people, women and patriot fighters across the 13 colonies, the series conveys how diverse America has always been and how this war affected everyone.\n\t\n\n\t“The American Revolution” goes deep, almost tediously so. It’s also stuffed with riveting sequences, betrayals and shocking turns of events. Episode 3, “The Times That Try Men’s Souls (July 1776-January 1777)” is particularly compelling. The episode mostly centers on early battles, including the Battle of Trenton, a decisive American victory that boosted morale within the fledgling Continental Army. Audiences are immersed in the horrors of the war, which was fought eyeball to eyeball by landless men wielding muskets, unreliable rifles and terrifying bayonets. George Washington, who commanded the Americans, often made costly mistakes, and soldiers frequently went months without pay or proper food and clothing — even as they were exposed to the elements or the deadly smallpox. (Washington would later demand that all soldiers be inoculated in an early version of a vaccination mandate.)\n\n\tIn true Burns fashion, “The American Revolution” is exhaustively thorough, leaving no popular figure or person on the fringes overlooked. By portraying the war not simply from the American point of view but from a global perspective, “The American Revolution” presents a rounded picture of this country at its foundation. It was an idea that eventually became a reality. The series also highlights the cracks in our ongoing union and suggests how we might overcome our fallacies as a nation so that it might endure and truly become the place of liberty that it was intended to be. For now, however, the American Revolution continues.\n\n\t“The American Buffalo” premieres on PBS Nov. 16, with remaining episodes airing each consecutive night. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet and Adam Sandler joined for a conversation about their careers and crafts in the Fairfax High School gymnasium in Los Angeles, where Chalamet praised Sandler as “one of the best fucking actors of all time.”\n\n\tThe event, dubbed “Sandler x Chalamet,” took place on the evening of Nov. 15. Before packed bleachers, Chalamet and Sandler reviewed and discussed clips from their respective filmographies, including their upcoming releases “Marty Supreme” and “Jay Kelly.” After watching a clip of Sandler in Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2006 romantic dramedy, “Punch Drunk Love,” Chalamet expressed his appreciation for Sandler’s performance in the film.\n\t\n\n\t“It is one of the most important performances. It’s impactful, deeply moving,” said Chalamet. “As a young actor knowing you for your comedic work, seeing that thrown against the context of your other work, I’m like, ‘Wow, this is a fucking incredible actor. I hope I can give a performance like this.'”\n\n\n\tChalamet continued to compliment Sandler’s acting beyond “Punch Drunk Love,” stating, “I know it’s not about awards, blah, blah, blah, but you should have a golden man in your hand, because, man, you’re one of the best fucking actors of all time.”\n\n\tSandler returned the praise, telling Chalamet, “What you continue to do for cinema and for all of us is beyond it all. I just cannot wait to see what you bring in the future.”\n\n\tAdditional clips from the evening included Sandler in “Big Daddy” and “Uncut Gems,” Chalamet in “Call Me By Your Name,” “Dune: Part 2” and “A Complete Unknown,” sneak-peaks at “Marty Supreme” and “Jay Kelly” and clips of both actors in “Saturday Night Live” sketches.\n\t\n\n\tThough the two have never appeared in a film together, Chalamet was in a cut scene from Jason Reitman’s “Men, Women & Children,” which Sandler starred in in 2014. Despite Chalamet not making the final cut, Sandler noted, “I remember when Jason Reitman was talking about you being in it, he said to me, ‘Oh, I got this kid playing the quarterback. He’s coming. He’s incredible.’ He like, knew.”\n\n\tThe two broke down each other’s scenes, waxed nostalgia about their respective times on “SNL” and joked about their common hobbies of basketball and guitar, each showcasing their signature wit throughout. At the end of the night, two members of the audience were invited to play a game of 2-on-2 half-court basketball against the stars. \n\n\t“Marty Supreme” is directed by Josh Safdie, who was in the crowd and previously directed Sandler in 2019’s “Uncut Gems.” The movie releases in theaters on Christmas Day. “Jay Kelly” is directed by Noah Baumbach and comes to Netflix Dec. 5.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn the final day of BravoCon, during an “Ask Andy” panel, “Real Housewives” executive producer Andy Cohen announced the official cast for “The Real Housewives of Rhode Island,” the latest entry in Bravo’s mega-franchise. Cohen also confirmed that a new season of “The Real Housewives of New York City” has been cast, and will begin filming soon. Cohen declined to name who will appear in Season 16, but it’s safe to say that BravoCon attendees Erin Lichy, Sai De Silva and Jessel Taank will be among them. Brynn Whitfield and Ubah Hassan, whose toxic fight poisoned the already weak 15th season, have already announced their departures (which were foregone conclusions). \n\t\n\n\tCohen also expressed confidence that “The Real Housewives of New Jersey,” currently on pause, will come back eventually.\n\n\n\tWith “The Real Housewives of Rhode Island,” as has been rumored — since they’ve both been spotted filming — former “Bachelor” and “Bachelor in Paradise” contestant Ashley Iaconetti is one of the show’s fulltime cast members, and Dolores Catania of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” (who was also one of the winners of Season 3 of “The Traitors”) is a “friend” of the cast. (Official bios of the full cast are included below.)\n\n\tIaconetti’s casting is the first time a Bachelor Nation star has crossed over to “The Real Housewives.” Iaconetti, an influencer, co-hosts the “Almost Famous” podcast with ex-Bachelor Ben Higgins. She appeared on Chris Soules’ season of “The Bachelor” in 2015, and later married her “Bachelor in Paradise” castmate Jared Haibon. (They have two children.)\n\t\n\n\tAnd she’s new to Rhode Island, the show’s trailer emphasizes. It’s Iaconetti’s voice that kicks it off, serving as our guide. “In Rhode Island, everyone knows everyone,” she says over crashing waves and drone shots of huge mansions. “People here don’t look down on other states. But they are weirded out that other states exist.”\n\n\tAs for Catania, she’s introduced to the show in relation to her lookalike friend, Liz. With “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” currently paused, Catania has moved to more fertile pastures, and her cast bio reads: “Rhode Island captured Dolores’s heart years ago, and she’s longed to return ever since. With her dear friend Liz McGraw living there – and a shared business project on the horizon – a sun-soaked, beach-filled summer is a natural fit for this Jersey girl.”\n\n\n\n\n\t Here’s its official logline: “They may live in the smallest state in the country, but their drama? Extra large. As “The Real Housewives” hits its milestone 20th anniversary next year, Bravo is expanding the distinguished franchise with “The Real Housewives of Rhode Island,” spotlighting a fresh, charismatic group of women whose lives intertwine across the storied coastline of New England luxury. “\n\n\t“The Real Housewives of Rhode Island” will premiere next year.\n\n\tAlicia CarmodyRhode Island to the core, Alicia isn’t shy about her roots — just wait until you hear her say “cracker.” After eight years of engagement to fiancé Billy Kitsilis, this “Runaway Bride” still isn’t ready to take the plunge — even for their daughter, Celina. When she’s not dodging wedding bells, Alicia helps Billy run his restaurant, Pizza Mamma, proving she can handle the heat both in and out of the kitchen. \n\n\tRosie DiMareA former local television news anchor, Rosie now shines as the host of her own lifestyle program and as a sought-after DJ. Recently celebrating her first wedding anniversary with husband Rich DiMare, a well-known Frank Sinatra style singer — Rosie calls North Kingstown home, where the couple lives with their dog, Clementine.\n\n\tAshley IaconettiAfter finding love with her now-husband — and Warwick, Rhode Island native — Jared Haibon on “Bachelor in Paradise,” Ashley has traded rose ceremonies for real life as a proud mom to two boys, Dawson and Hayden. While Jared manages their beloved coffee shop, Ashley has built a thriving career as a social media powerhouse, all while acclimating her new life in her husband’s home state.\n\t\n\n\tLiz McGrawLiz is Rhode Island royalty — the woman everyone wants to know, and the state’s very own Cannabis Queen. Alongside her husband, Gerry, she owns and operates The Slater Center, the largest and most successful cannabis dispensary in Rhode Island. But Liz isn’t just a business powerhouse — she’s also a devoted stepmom toMiranda, Briana, and Skyla, balancing family, entrepreneurship, and her signature flair for style.\n\n\tRulla Nehme PontarelliRulla helms a financial empire as a Certified Financial Planner and Wealth Manager to some of the East Coast’s most distinguished families. Rulla is married to prominent Rhode Island podiatrist, Brian, and together they juggle life with their two young children, Luca and Laila. \n\n\tKelsey SwansonFormer Miss Rhode Island, Kelsey,keeps a full plate as one of the state’s top makeup artists. Kelsey has been in a 10-year relationship with one of Rhode Island’s most notable figures, enjoying the lap of luxury while keeping her social calendar full. \n\n\tJo-Ellen TiberiSelf-proclaimed town gossip, Jo-Ellen, knows everyone and everything worth knowing in Cranston. As one of the top aesthetic practice development managers in the country, she juggles a busy career with family life alongside her high school sweetheart and husband, Gary, and their three kids — Gian, Jolie, and Gia. \n",

    "body": "\n\tBrendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, reshared Donald Trump’s demand for Seth Meyers to be fired from NBC after being made the subject of his roasts on the host’s late-night show.\n\n\tTrump posted on Truth Social on Saturday, “NBC’s Seth Meyers is suffering from an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS). He was viewed last night in an uncontrollable rage, likely due to the fact that his ‘show’ is a Ratings DISASTER. Aside from everything else, Meyers has no talent, and NBC should fire him, IMMEDIATELY!”\n\t\n\n\tIn the past week, Meyers has repeatedly joked about Trump in his monologues, poking fun at his plans for health care, the government shutdown, a 50-year mortgage, a dinner with finance executives and the ongoing controversy over the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n\n\tShortly after Trump’s post, Carr reposted the president’s message to his X account.\n\n\n\tAlthough Carr didn’t comment, his public co-sign of the president’s demand for NBC to fire the late-night hosts comes after his apparent threat to take action against ABC over remarks by Jimmy Kimmel following the assassination of Charlie Kirk in September.\n\n\tWhile appearing on Benny Johnson’s podcast on Sept. 17, Carr suggested that the FCC has “remedies we can look at.”\n\n\t“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\n\n\tA few hours after Carr’s remarks, two major broadcasting stations, Nexstar and Sinclair, pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from airing on several of their affiliate groups, as well as ABC, indefinitely suspending Kimmel’s show. \n\t\n\n\t“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” returned on air on Sept. 23.\n",

    "description": "\n\tFranco-Egyptian filmmaker Namir Abdel Messeeh’s “Life After Siham” is screening in the Special Screenings section of the Cairo Intl. Film Festival, ",
    "body": "\n\tFranco-Egyptian filmmaker Namir Abdel Messeeh’s “Life After Siham” is screening in the Special Screenings section of the Cairo Intl. Film Festival, on Nov. 19 and Nov. 20, having previously received development support at the 2021 Cairo Film Connection. In addition to playing in Cairo, it is also screening in IDFA, Turin and Marrakech.\n\n\tThe autobiographical hybrid-doc is produced by Messeeh’s production company Oweda Films, in co-production with Camille Laemle, via Paris-based Les Films d’Ici, and supported by two Egyptian producing partners – Ambient Light and Red Star. It is distributed by Météore Films. The sales company is Split Screen.\n\t\n\n\tAfter its world premiere at ACID in Cannes 2025, the film screened in Zurich and recently won the El Gouna Star Award for Best Arab Documentary in El Gouna Festival in Egypt. \n\n\n\tThe film builds on themes that Messeeh developed in his debut feature-length documentary, “The Virgin, the Copts and Me,” which screened at Cannes, Berlin and CPH:DOX, and was released theatrically in France, with 112,000 admissions.\n\n\tBoth projects are linked to his parents, who were forced into exile in France in the 1970s, after his father was imprisoned under Nasser’s regime, due to his communist affiliations.\n\n\tIn his new film, Messeeh interacts with his late parents and explores the power of film to revive memories and bring back lost ones. The director spoke with Variety about the film, and its development process, that spanned over a decade.\n\n\tHow did your project come about?After my previous film, my mother told me she’d be willing to work on a new film, but wanted me to make a “real film” this time – with actors, like the classic Egyptian films. I started working on a script, but when I found out she had advanced cancer, I told her, we’re going to make a film together very quickly, but she died soon after, in 2014.\n\t\n\n\tI started to make a film as an act of survival and resistance – to say that she’s still here, in a way. With the help of my camerman, Nicolas Duchêne, we filmed her funeral and then I filmed some sequences with my father. But it was too painful, and I stopped completely for a few years. Much later, I showed the images to a friend of mine who is an editor and he told me I had to make the film. Because it’s a universal story.\n\n\tYou originally planned to include more fictional elements?Yes, I wrote a screenplay in which there were images of my mother and the funeral, but the rest was fictionalized. That’s what we presented at the Cairo Film Connection. But after around three years of development, in which we presented the film to television stations, investors, and the CNC, we couldn’t get funding, I felt like giving up. Instead I decided to film some scenes with my father. I called Camille, my co-producer. We shot some new footage with my father and from the moment we started editing the film with all the documentary material, we realized we didn’t need to shoot the fictionalized scenes. Instead we got the idea of using archive films to try to tell the story – the scenes that were missing from my film. So it’s really a film that was constructed, that invented itself, that rewrote itself completely, during the editing process.\n\n\tHow important was it to have the world premiere at Cannes?We presented it to the Cannes festival because we thought this film has no chance of being released in the cinema and to find an audience unless we showed it in a major international festival. Cannes saw a rough cut of the film and said, “We’ll take it,” and from then on everything accelerated. We showed an almost finished version at Cannes and had a great reception. Then we went back to the editing room because there were still things to finalize… the sound, the music. We finished the final version of the film, which was screened in Zurich, where it received some awards, then we went to the El Gouna Festival, where we received three awards. So the film is starting to have a career.\n\n\tYour father is a key presence in the film.Immediately after the funeral, I filmed a few days with him. Then in 2023 we had this crisis, when everyone was saying no to the film. My father was living in a nursing home, and we learned he was soon going to die, and I thought to myself, I absolutely have to film something before he passes away. I started the film with my mother’s death because I didn’t want to accept that she had died, and the film ends with coming to terms with my father’s death. It’s a moment when we learn to say “I love you” and say goodbye, and accept the fact that life goes on, that death is part of life, which is traumatic for everyone. The film has had a therapeutic dimension for me.\n\t\n\n\tHow have people reacted in the screenings?The reactions have been really very nice. From people who have lost their parents, or whose parents were dying, who saw the film and told us, “We cried, but it made us feel good because it was a kind of permission, to say goodbye. Some people told me that after seeing the film it made them want to go talk to their parents.\n\n\tWhy has it been important for you to screen the film in Egypt, first in El Gouna and now in Cairo?It’s like bringing my parents back to Egypt. They left Egypt in 1970s, not because they didn’t love their country, but due to political and financial reasons. We always have lived in Egypt, in our hearts. In my early years, I was brought up in Egypt by my aunt. My parents always remained Egyptians. My father, even in France, lived in Egypt. He read all the Egyptian newspapers, he mainly had Egyptian friends. In his heart, he was always in Egypt. We were able to return to Egypt in the holidays. But it was an exile, something irrevocable. They were buried in France. Making this film, and showing it in Egypt and receiving prizes, is like bringing them back to their homeland.\n\n\tHow have Egyptian audiences reacted to the film?When we showed the film in El Gouna, it was really beautiful because at first I sensed that the spectators were very disturbed, because I was exposing a personal story, an intimate story in front of the camera, where people talk very openly about death and all that. I think that the audience was a bit unsettled at first, but something really incredible happened. At one point in the film, there was a shift and the audience felt entitled, I can’t put it any other way, to accept the emotions that they themselves experienced while watching the film. They started laughing and they started to cry. At the end of the film, it was incredible. There were spectators who came up to me, who came to hug me, and kiss me. Complete strangers. Even though this involves taboo subject for us. There’s a level of modesty in Arab countries – certain topics are not discussed, even less so in front of the camera. Matters of love and death, everything related to feelings between children and parents.\n\n\tHow important were festivals for development of the film?Very important. The support we received wasn’t large sums, but psychologically it was hugely important, because suddenly there were people who said they believed in our project. Development support included the Atlas Workshops, the Cairo Film Connection, the Arab Culture Fund, the Doha Film Institute and CineGouna. We also had two Egyptian co-producers – Ambient Light and Red Star – who put money into the film. I also invested some of my own money to get the film made. My father passed away, and I invested some of my father’s inheritance. I thought to myself, it makes sense that this legacy can be used to make a film that is a tribute to my parents. Once we were in the editing stage, we also managed to get some assistance from France, from the CNC, and from the Île-de-France region.\n\t\n\n\tWhat role was played by your coproducer, Camille Laemle?She was always my safety net. She was the one who always managed to help me find the balance – of never being too close or too far away from my subject. Camille’s mother died during production of the film and so it wasn’t just my film. Benoît Alavoine, the film’s editor, had lost his father a few years earlier. So in a way we were all orphans.\n\n\tThe archive images from Youssef Chahine’s films play an important role.I used these images to transform my parents into fictional film heroes. By using the images from films directed by Youssef Chahine, precisely because I’ve recovered some old images from his films and used them to recreate a kind of fiction. In a way it’s as if I kept my promise and fulfilled my mother’s wish to make a “real film.”\n\n\tWas it difficult to gain permission to use images from the Youssef Chahine archive?We were really lucky, because Marianne Khoury, Youssef Chahine’s producer, and her associates, who own the rights, knows me, and likes my work, and she really supported us on the project. She made it feasible to use the images. I also hope that this has allowed me to revive certain films and a certain kind of cinema. Next year, it’s the centenary of Youssef Chahine’s birth. I think his films will be re-released in cinemas and I hope that my film will also help to restore people’s desire to discover this type of cinema.\n\n\tWhat opportunities does the Cairo Film Festival offer?Cairo is a festival that attracts large audiences, from the general public. El Gouna has a higher proportion of industry professionals. In Cairo, the spectators come from all walks of life. They’re curious to discover films and otherwise don’t necessarily have access to them. It’s extremely important. Even my family, my Egyptian family, for example, are coming to see the film. So it’s a great accomplishment to screen the film in Cairo.\n",

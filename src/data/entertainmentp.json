    "body": "\n\tBart Story, a veteran entertainment research executive who worked in the home video distribution industry before leading research and development at SAG-AFTRA and MarketCast, died on Tuesday in Los Angeles from complications related to metastatic urothelial carcinoma, according to a family representative. He was 63.\n\n\tFor more than two decades, Story served as the senior director of market research at entertainment advising firm MarketCast, where he guided the marketing arms of studios, networks and streamers in audience engagement, creative testing and positioning strategies.\n\t\n\n\t“Across his two-decade career with MarketCast, Bart helped hundreds of movies achieve success, meaningfully connecting with thousands of clients, focus group respondents, and teammates along the way,” said Jeremy Radisich, President of Entertainment at MarketCast. “His work was characterized by a thoughtful and gentle approach that made him not only an excellent collaborator and partner, but an incredible person who made an impact on everyone he met.”\n\n\n\tBefore joining MarketCast, Story was the director of research at SAG-AFTRA. He also worked at the Video Software Dealers Association, where he was instrumental in bringing the video distribution market into the modern age.\n\n\tThe longtime executive earned his master’s degree at USC’s Annenberg School and earned his bachelor’s degree from Cal Poly Pomona. As a young man, he worked in movie theaters, which sparked his curiosity and passion for joining the entertainment industry. Story resided in Denver, Colo.\n\n\tHe is survived by his husband, Patrick Jager, and their son, Brandt. A private celebration will be held in the near future.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichael Cavanagh, as he’s set to assume the role of Comcast‘s co-CEO on Jan. 2, extended his employment contract with the cable and media conglomerate that runs through Jan. 1, 2029.\n\n\tUnder the terms of the agreement, Cavanagh will be entitled to an annual base salary of $2.75 million and annual performance-based cash bonus target will continue to be 300% of his base salary.\n\n\tIn addition, Comcast awarded Cavanagh performance-based restricted stock units valued at about $35 million, which will vest after a three-year period (upon satisfaction of both time-based and performance-based conditions), the company disclosed in an SEC filing.\n\t\n\n\tNext month, Cavanagh, 59, will become co-CEO of Comcast alongside Brian Roberts, 66, the son of Comcast’s founder and the company’s chairman. It’s a move that seems to set a succession plan for Roberts’ role as CEO.\n\n\n\tAlso next month, Comcast is spinning off CNBC, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC), USA, Oygen, E!, Syfy, Golf Channel and other businesses into a new publicly traded company called Versant, a transaction that will close Jan. 2. The goal of the spin-off is to unshackle the NBC broadcast and Peacock streaming businesses from the declining cable TV networks. Comcast was among the bidders for Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming and studios business; WBD went with Netflix’s offer, although now Paramount Skydance is pursuing a hostile takeover effort.\n\n\tCavanagh joined Comcast in 2015 as chief financial officer, before rising to president in October 2022. He previously spent more than two decades in financial services, including as co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase’s corporate and investment bank. He also served as JPMorgan Chase’s CFO for six years, helping the company “successfully navigate the financial crisis.”\n\t\n\n\tCavanagh’s presence has grown at Comcast in recent years. He took on oversight of operations at NBCUniversal after the exit of former CEO Jeff Shell even as he maintained his larger corporate duties.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChevy Chase is addressing his exclusion from “SNL50: The Anniversary Special.” In CNN Films’ upcoming documentary, “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” (via People), the original “Saturday Night Live” cast member admitted he was “hurt” by not being included in the milestone anniversary celebration.\n\n\t“Well, it was kind of upsetting actually,” Chase said. “This is probably the first time I’m saying it. But I expected that I would’ve been on the stage too with all the other actors. When Garrett [Morris] and Laraine [Newman] went on the stage there, I was curious as to why I didn’t. No one asked me to. Why was I left aside?”\n\t\n\n\tChase, the first anchor and co-creator of “Weekend Update,” also expressed confusion over “SNL50’s” segment of the satirical news program, saying, “Why was Bill Murray there and why was I not? I don’t have an answer for that.”\n\n\n\t“I did bring it up once in a text to Lorne and then took it back,” Chase said, referring to “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels. “I said, ‘Okay, I take it back, silly.’ But it’s not that silly. Somebody’s made a bad mistake there. I don’t know who it was, but somebody made a mistake. They should’ve had me on that stage. It hurt.”\n\n\tChase attended the 50th anniversary special in February of this year. According to the CNN documentary, the anniversary show was initially set to feature more of Chase, with the actor’s wife, Jayni Chase, explaining that people “told Chevy up until that day that there were two bits, they were going back and forth.”\n\n\t“And then, all of the sudden, ‘No, there’s no bit,'” she added. \n\t\n\n\t“There were a couple versions of [‘Weekend Update’] and we went back and forth on that,” Michaels said in the doc. “There was also a caution from somebody that I don’t want to name that Chevy, you know, wasn’t as focused.”\n\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” premieres on Jan. 1 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CNN. \n",

    "body": "\n\tKate Hudson has revealed that she nearly played Mary Jane Watson in Sony’s original “Spider-Man” movie in 2002, but she turned down the role that eventually went to Kirsten Dunst.\n\n\tThe “Almost Famous” star confirmed that she had said “no” to the role and revealed the movie she made instead on Monday’s episode of “Watch What Happens Live” with host Andy Cohen.\n\n\t“It’s one of those things where I look back like, ‘That would have been nice to be in a “Spider-Man” movie,’” she said. “But at the same time, I did a movie called ‘Four Feathers.’ I got to meet Heath Ledger who became a very good friend and I got an experience that I would have never had.”\n\t\n\n\n\t“Four Feathers” released a few months after “Spider-Man” and was a war drama starring Hudson, Heath Ledger, Djimon Hounsou and Wes Bentley. It received mixed reviews and made $29 million at the box office, failing to recoup its $35 million budget.\n\n\n\t“A part of me is like, ‘Life happens exactly the way it’s supposed to,'” Hudson said. “And so, I’m grateful for it. But I do look at it and I’m like, ‘Aw, it would have been fun to be [Mary Jane].’”\n\n\t“Spider-Man” went on to gross $826 million and spawn a trilogy, starring Tobey Maguire and Dunst, with all three movies directed by Sam Raimi. Maguire hung up his web-shooters after “Spider-Man 3” in 2007, but returned for the MCU’s universe-crossing team-up film “Spider-Man: No Way Home” in 2021. Dunst has not returned to play Mary Jane since “Spider-Man 3.”\n\n\tHudson added, “It doesn’t feel good to talk about it ’cause the people who are in the movie are the right people and your circumstances in life happen the way they happen.”\n\t\n\n\tShe also revealed that she’s turned down movie offers that would pair her with her mom, actor Goldie Hawn.\n\n\t“It’s gotta be really funny,” she added. “It’s gotta hit in a different way. We think about it, it’s just we haven’t read it yet. We haven’t figured that one out.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob and Michele Reiner died “minutes” after sustaining “multiple sharp force injuries,” the couple’s official death certificate confirms. \n\n\tRob, 78, the legendary actor-turned-director, and his wife Michele, 70, were found dead on Dec. 14 in their Brentwood home. The death certificates listed the cause as “with [a] knife, by another” and noted the time between the attack and death as “minutes.” Rob was discovered at 3:45 p.m. and Michele was found at 3:46 p.m. on Dec. 14. They have since been cremated, according to the death certificates. Their son Nick, 32, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder.\n\t\n\n\tRob and Michele Reiner met while he was directing the rom-com “When Harry Met Sally” and got married several months later in 1989. They had three kids, Nick, Romy and Jake. Rob also adopted his daughter, Tracy, during his first marriage to Penny Marshall.\n\n\n\tRob and Michele’s bodies were found by Romy, who was called to the house after a massage therapist couldn’t reach the couple, according to the New York Times. Nick was arrested later that night.\n\n\tJake and Romy first spoke out about the death of their parents on Dec. 17. “Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day. The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren’t just our parents; they were our best friends,” they said in a statement.\n\n\tThey have since released a statement to People to share their gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support.” Jake and Romy added that a memorial service honoring Rob and Michele will be held “at a later date.” \n\t\n\n\tRob Reiner, the son of famed writer-director-comedian Carl Reiner, starred in the 1971 sitcom “All in the Family” before directing films like “This Is Spinal Tap,” “When Harry Met Sally,” “A Few Good Men” and “Stand by Me.” Rob’s most recent film, “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,” was released earlier this year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNorwegian director Emilie Blichfeldt’s feature debut “The Ugly Stepsister” takes inspiration from an unlikely pair of genres: Disney fairy tales and Italian Giallo films. The movie, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and was acquired by Independent Film Company and Shudder, reimagines “Cinderella” as a body horror film from the empathetic perspective of the titular, vilified sibling, Elvira (Lea Myren). As Elvira prepares for the prince’s royal ball, she undergoes body transformations large and small to try conforming to society’s highest beauty standards.\n\t\n\n\t“The most important thing was to make just a normal, cute teenager who is just really in love with this prince,” explains the movie’s makeup designer Anne Cathrine Sauerberg, “and to show what people do to themselves.”\n\n\n\tJust the initial effect of making the 24-year-old Myren look like a teenager was a feat for the prosthetic and makeup departments. “She was wearing cheeks and a nose and has a fake neck that actually stops in the middle of the neck,” says prosthetic makeup designer and special effects artist Thomas Foldberg. “We didn’t want her neck to be too broad. We wanted to erase the collarbone and some of the neck muscles. We wanted to make her softer without exaggerating, so it had to be kept really tight and really subtle.”\n\n\tAt first, Elvira’s transformations are indeed subtle. At the behest of her mother, Rebekka (Ane Dahl Torp), Elvira undergoes a cosmetic nose realignment, executed in the archaic medical practices of the film’s 19th-century setting. The doctor (Adam Lundgren) intentionally fractures Elvira’s nose and she wears a face brace for much of the first act, removing it once to reveal a partially healed, misshapen ridge and later removing it again to reveal a much more conventional nose. Because Foldberg and Sauerberg had Myren in a prosthetic nose from the beginning, they were able to adjust it accordingly to create the subtle change.\n\t\n\n\tThe subtlety decreases as Elvira further modifies her body in anticipation of the ball. Once her nose is in place, Elvira gets an eyelash transplant whereby the same doctor threads fake lashes through her lower eyelid. The camera captures the procedure in an extreme close-up of Elvira’s eye and reverse shots from Elvira’s horrifying perspective.\n\n\tTo achieve the realistic look of the extreme close-up, Foldberg opted for a blend of practical and digital effects. He collaborated with visual effects supervisor Peter Hjort to composite the actor’s actual eye onto a dummy head. “We did the whole scene with the actress and then we did it with the fake head, which I was actually stitching into, and everything was put together afterwards” Foldberg explains. “It’s basically half a dummy head from the eyelids below and then the other part is the actor herself.”\n\n\tThe film’s most gruesome scene, however, comes after the ball and is ripped straight from the pages of the original “Cinderella” folk tale. In an effort to fit into the slipper that her stepsister Agnes (Thea Sofie Loch Næss) left at the ball, Elvira severs the toes from her right foot. In a series of sanguinary close-ups, Elvira takes a cleaver to her digits, first slicing them and then fully dismembering them. \n\n\t“It was extremely complicated to do the slit where the blood is kind of beating out,” explains Foldberg. “That was one big prosthetic foot and then we had two fake legs that went from under her knees and below. We had this blood rigged leg for the initial chopping off of the toes and then it had some small attachments.”\n\n\tAfter Elvira cuts off her toes and is bleeding out, Rebekka finds her and realizes that she severed the wrong foot for the slipper. Obsessively, Rebekka recreates the wound on Elvira’s left foot, this time captured in a wide shot that shows the foot and leg attached to Elvira’s body. “The real leg was hidden under her dress,” says Foldberg of the shot. “It’s just bent and then the prosthetic leg goes from the knee and down.”\n\n\tDespite her pathological efforts, Elvira fails to win over the prince and in the final sequence, she crawls about on her broken feet, her hair thinning and teeth chipped from the trauma she’s put herself through.\n\n\tMuch of that trauma stems from a tapeworm egg that Elvira consumes to lose weight at the beginning of her transformation. By the end, the worm is fully grown, several feet long, and Elvira’s sister, Alma (Flo Fagerli) must help her remove it in a gristly game of tug of war. To achieve the effect of Alma extracting the worm from Elvira’s mouth, Foldberg and his team created several silicone worm pieces and then fed them through a contraption attached to the side of Myren’s face. The contraption was composited out in post-production to make it look like the worm is expelled from the depths of Elvira’s throat. “We also had a puppet head of her from the nose down,” says Foldberg. “Where you could push big chunks of this worm and slime out of her.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film as a whole used minimal CGI and instead went for practical effects paired with compositing, creating a raw and seamless look throughout. This ingenuity paid off, as “The Ugly Stepsister” is now shortlisted for Best Makeup & Hairstyling at the upcoming 98th Academy Awards. It is IFC and Shudder’s first shortlisted film in the category.\n\n\tFor the film’s success, Sauerberg and Foldberg credit Blichfeldt. “She was so well prepared and had so many ideas,” says Foldberg. “I was really, really blown away by her knowledge of genre films and she had really a specific vision for this project.”\n\n\t“We all know Cinderella’s story so well, so we all have different pictures of how it should look like, and [Blichfeldt’s] vision was just so extremely clear,” adds Sauerberg. “It was so easy to connect with her and her visions and align them with my own visions.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKevin Arkadie, the American television producer who created the police drama “New York Undercover” with Dick Wolf, has died. He was 68.\n\n\tArkadie was born on Dec. 10, 1957. He grew up in Maryland and received his BFA in acting from Southern Methodist University in Dallas before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in entertainment. He secured his first job as a staff writer on the NBC drama series “I’ll Fly Away.”\n\n\n\tHe subsequently created “New York Undercover” with Wolf in 1994. The series, which starred Malik Yoba and Michael DeLorenzo as undercover NYPD officers, was the first American cop drama to feature two people of color as the leads. It ran on Fox for four seasons before going off the air in 1999.\n\t\n\n\tDuring and after “New York Undercover,” Arkadie produced “Chicago Hope” on CBS, “NYPD Blue” on ABC and “The Shield” on FX, among other series. He also continued to write, penning episodes of the NBC miniseries “The Temptations” and serving as showrunner on BET’s “Sacrifice” for two seasons. He was twice nominated for an Outstanding Drama Series Emmy in 1996 and 1998, for “Chicago Hope” and “NYPD Blue,” respectively.\n\n\tHe recently collaborated with Tony Award winner Lamar Richardson and Zaire Julion-Richardson’s Ivy Lion Productions on the TV project “Freeman Ranch.” His additional credits include “Dr. Quinn,” “Medicine Woman,” “Law & Order,” “High Incident,” “Rescue 77,” “Ambitions” and “The Quad.”\n\n\tIn July, Arkadie said in an Instagram video that he was dealing with kidney failure. Since his death on Dec. 22, several of his colleagues and collaborators have made statements.\n\t\n\n\tWolf said, “Kevin brought the voice of the next generation to cop shows and was instrumental in bringing diversity to the forefront of network television. We will all miss him.” Wolf Studios also released an official statement, celebrating Arkadie’s impact on television through “New York Underground” and his other shows. “Beyond his creative achievements,” the statement concludes, “Kevin was a trusted collaborator and a generous presence. His legacy lives on in the meaningful and memorable stories he helped tell. We remain grateful for his contributions, and he will be deeply missed and always remembered.\n\n\tLamar also released a statement, calling Arkadie “a consummate professional, true collaborator, and astute researcher” while Arkadie’s cousin and fellow producer L True Green called him “one of America’s greatest storytellers” in a Facebook post. \n\n\tArkadie is survived by his wife and family. \n",

The tip launched the sting operation, which eventually nailed her.\n      \n    \n          Tatyana served time after being sentenced to 3 years and 8 months in prison.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent appearance on “The Howard Stern Show,” Ben Stiller gave his thoughts on the term “nepo baby,” which describes children of celebrity parents who become famous themselves. Stiller, who recently immortalized the life of his own famous parents in his documentary “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,” said he considers the moniker more of a “selling point” than a put-down.\n\n\t“I think it’s kind of like that Brat Pack thing, right? New York Magazine, they coined a phrase, and then it just became a thing,” Stiller said. “But it’s always been what it is, in humanity and life. It’s like, you buy a violin, a Stradivarius or whatever, it’s been in the family for hundreds of years. That’s a selling point.”\n\t\n\n\tStiller added that he does understand there are “other arguments to be made about access and all those things.” However, he also pointed out that when he was growing up in the industry, he also saw the less glamorous sides of Hollywood.\n\n\n\tStiller explained, “For me, I think growing up around it, we’re talking about all these things that I saw with my parents, you actually, as a kid, see the dark underside of it. The stress, the effects it has on relationships. You see that up close as a kid, and then you still wanna go into it.”\n\n\tThe “Zoolander” star recalled that his first acting job was an off-Broadway production of “House of Blue Leaves.” He said he got the final call back as “a favor” from his mom after he “couldn’t get in because the casting director didn’t want to see me.”\n\n\t“If you have the passion, you do it,” he added. “You go for it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tProducer Patrick Mao Huang (Cannes winner “Tiger Stripes”) of Taiwan’s Flash Forward Entertainment is presenting psychological thriller “The Sleepless Girl” at the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, looking to connect with international partners for the co-production that blurs the boundaries between dreams and reality.\n\n\t“The Sleepless Girl” follows Fan, a Taiwanese man who awakens with no memory except for a compelling urge to find a Japanese girl named Hitomi. When he finally meets her, he is drawn into a chain of surreal events that force them to live on the run.\n\t\n\n\tThe twist: Fan examines Hitomi’s mind and discovers he exists only as a figure created inside her dream. In Hitomi’s real life, they once shared a deep bond – he was her favorite singer who took his own life after being replaced by an AI-generated virtual idol. Now the girl lies in a deep coma, refusing to wake up in a world where he no longer exists.\n\n\n\tBut when Hitomi learns the truth, she refuses to return to her lonely reality. Her grief transforms into destructive power, turning her into a monster. Fan must find a way to wake her before they are both trapped in this nightmare forever.\n\n\tDirector François Chang, who is adapting the feature from his own 2017 short film, says he wanted to explore the boundaries between dreams and reality, and more importantly, between being seen and being heard.\n\n\t“The film follows a mute girl, Hitomi, who is eager to communicate through music, and a virtual idol she once loved, Fan, who now only lives in her dream,” Chang explains. “Their encounter inside her collapsing dream world becomes a metaphor for the loneliness of a generation that lives between social media and the real world.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director adds that the story is also about how memory, guilt, and projection shape relationships with those who can no longer be reached. “I wanted to create an emotional space where the invisible pain becomes visible, where illusion becomes both a bridge and a barrier.”\n\n\tThe production journey has involved balancing the original promise of the short film while creating an engaging genre piece. “The story deals with fragmented memories, language barriers, and digital reincarnation, so we needed to ensure that audiences still feel emotionally anchored even when the logic bends,” Chang says.\n\n\tThe project has built momentum over the past two years through participation in major development platforms, including Frontières at Fantasia International Film Festival in Canada, the Sundance Asia Pitching Forum, and the TAICCA x AFiS Development Lab. Chang was also selected for Talents Tokyo last year.\n\n\t“These milestones have allowed the project to grow substantially – expanding its world-building while refining its internal logic to remain emotionally accessible,” says producer Huang. “Our creative focus remains on developing strong characters and deepening the emotional resonance with contemporary young audiences.”\n\n\tThe project has already secured around 50% of its investment commitment from Taiwan and is moving forward with positive momentum. “The main challenge has been maintaining balance between conceptual ambition and human intimacy, but that has also been the most fulfilling part of the creative process,” Huang notes.\n\n\tAt the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, Huang hopes to connect with international partners who share the vision for the project. “The project has already received strong attention from Asia and Europe, and the Tokyo Gap-Financing Forum is the ideal platform to complete financing and secure key creative collaborators – especially since almost the entire film takes place in Japan,” he says. The team aims to strengthen ties with Japanese producers and start early conversations with distributors and sales agents who value visually ambitious, emotionally grounded genre films.\n\n\tFlash Forward Entertainment plans to complete financing by mid-2026 and begin principal photography in Japan by late 2026, with post-production based in Taiwan. The target is a late-2027 world premiere at a major international festival, followed by a coordinated global festival circuit and theatrical rollout.\n\t\n\n\tBeyond the feature, “The Sleepless Girl” holds strong potential for sequels, remakes, and a game adaptation, extending its universe across different formats and cultures. “The story’s central question – what happens when dreams begin to overwrite reality – offers a timeless foundation for reinterpretation and creative expansion,” Huang says.\n\n\tChang is already developing his next project, “Millennium Town,” a mystery/sci-fi series set in a small town trapped in the year 1999 after the Y2K bug. “Like ‘The Sleepless Girl,’ it deals with time, memory, and identity – but through another fresh and exciting story,” he says.\n\n\tIf “The Sleepless Girl” is about inner silence, “Millennium Town” is about a collective sense of being “born in the wrong time,” Chang explains. “How people always long for the past or the future, but nobody cherishes the present. Both stories belong to the same emotional universe: how to live a truthful, meaningful life in this more and more surreal, crazy world.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA Spanish director is bringing a distinctly Japanese story to the screen with “Konbini,” a humanistic drama about an elderly man who deliberately shoplifts to get arrested and the convenience store worker who derails his plan.\n\n\tThe project, selected for the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, follows Kisayo, a struggling sound artist working night shifts at a Tokyo convenience store, who thwarts an old man’s blatant attempt to get himself jailed through shoplifting. An unlikely friendship forms between the two, bridging their very different worlds.\n\t\n\n\tDirector Pedro Collantes (Venice selection “The Art of Return”) was drawn to the material after learning about a disturbing trend in Japan: an increasing number of elderly people committing petty crimes with the goal of imprisonment. “What kind of person chooses to go to prison on purpose? What emotions and circumstances lead to such a desperate decision?” Collantes asks. “It is a terrible irony that some people feel more a part of a community being in jail, than free in society.”\n\n\n\tWhile rooted in Japanese social reality, Collantes believes the film’s themes resonate globally. “The reflection on the place to which we, as societies, relegate people who reach old age resonates beyond the specific cultural context of Japan to a global audience,” he says. “The intention is to emphasize the universal value of human dignity and the need for empathy and intergenerational connection.”\n\n\tMaking a Japanese-language film in Japan as a foreign director presents unique challenges. “It constantly tests my sensitivity to culture, language, and nuance,” Collantes admits. Though his wife is Japanese and he’s spent extended periods in the country, he describes building a bridge between two creative worlds as “a delicate, humbling task.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production has already achieved significant milestones, winning the Tsutaya Creators’ Program and securing support from Japanese co-producers Culture Entertainment. “Among the highlights, winning the Tsutaya Creators’ Program was a true turning point,” Collantes says. The director is currently scouting locations and casting in Tokyo.\n\n\tProducer Pedro Hernandez Santos of Spain’s Aquí y Allí Films (“La deuda”) sees the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market as an opportunity to expand the project’s European footprint. “We already have a solid project in collaboration with Culture Entertainment, our Japanese co-producers, but we believe there’s room to bring in an additional European partner,” he says. The team is also focused on securing international sales following early interest.\n\n\tThe film represents groundbreaking territory as the first Spanish-Japanese co-production directed by a Spanish filmmaker but shot entirely in Japanese. Spanish and European funds have already backed the project, reinforcing its cross-cultural ambitions. “That pioneering aspect is precisely what makes the journey so special and challenging at the same time,” Hernandez Santos notes.\n\n\tProduction is scheduled for next summer, with delivery targeted for 2027. “We believe we have a unique, beautiful, and tender film that can perform very well in theaters worldwide,” the producer says.\n\n\tAfter completing “Konbini,” Collantes plans to continue exploring cross-cultural narratives with a project examining the encounter between France and Spain.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeff Bridges says opening weekend grosses are not the final word on the quality of a film.\n\n\tIn a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, the “Big Lebowski” star was asked for his thoughts on the growing importance of opening weekends, and some deeming “Tron: Ares” a disappointment for grossing below debut projections. Bridges says it’s “interesting” how movies are deemed a flop after only one weekend in theaters, and noted his 1980 film “Heaven’s Gate” as an example of a film that gained popularity over time.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s interesting, though, how movies are received at opening weekend,” Bridges said. “I remember ‘Heaven’s Gate’ was considered, you know, very disappointing or a flop, but nowadays it’s considered kind of a masterpiece.”\n\n\n\tSpeaking from personal experience, Bridges explained that films often “grow on you,” and that his initial reactions can flip in a matter of weeks or months.\n\n\t“Even as an individual, often, I have not liked a movie,” he added. “And then a couple weeks or months later, I’ll see it again. I’ll say, ‘What was I thinking?’ As the Dude would say, ‘That’s just like your opinion, man.'”\n\n\t“Heaven’s Gate” was famously pulled from theaters after critics lambasted its limited release. The 291-minute cut was slimmed down to 149 minutes for the wide debut, but even so, the film only grossed $3.5 million against a budget of $44 million. However, with time, the film has garnered critical praise and a deeper understanding of its historic production.\n\n\tAs for “Tron: Ares,” the $180 million budgeted sci-fi sequel was targeting a domestic debut between $45 million and $50 million, but only grossed $33.5 million during its first weekend in North American theaters. Since its release on Oct. 10, the film has grossed $123.4 million globally.\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount has signed a minimum 10-year lease agreement with 1888 Studios to occupy more than 285,000 square feet of the production company in Bayonne, N.J. as a way to capitalize on incentives offered from the state’s film and digital media tax credit program.\n\n\tVariety has learned that 1888 Studios is expected to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2028.\n\n\tCurrently under development by Togus Urban Renewal, 1888 Studios will offer 1.1 million square feet of production space spanning 23 smart sound stages with a minimum of 40-foot clear ceilings, production support space, flexible post-production space, offices, mills, base camp and backlot, and lighting and grip facilities to accommodate every phase of production.  \n\t\n\n\tThe tax credit program, which expanded in 2025, empowers the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) to designate three studio partners and three film-lease partner facilities, each linked to large-scale infrastructure commitments. \n\n\n\t1888 Studios was designated New Jersey’s first film-lease partner facility in May 2024, and Paramount has submitted its studio partner application, which is under NJEDA review and will be brought to its Board for consideration on Oct. 30.\n\n\t“With 1888 Studios, we set out to build a cutting-edge facility that would attract the world’s most ambitious storytellers – giving New Jersey true scale and a home for every facet of film and television production under one roof,” Arpad “Arki” Busson, chairman of Togus Urban Renewal, said in a statement. \n\n\tHe continued, “By keeping American productions at home, the project, which will be constructed by union workers, will generate thousands of jobs and additional opportunities for New Jersey’s small businesses.”\n\t\n\n\tThe 1888 Studios campus will provide infrastructure, proximity to Manhattan, access to the regional industry workforce and post-production tax incentives.\n\n\t“With industry leaders like 1888 Studios and Paramount choosing New Jersey, it proves that our film and TV tax credit law – while prudent, guardrailled, and built for long-term capital investment – is competitive and can significantly boost our economy and local small businesses,” Senator Raj Mukherji, representative of New Jersey’s 32nd District, said about the partnership.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter leaving “Saturday Night Live” before Season 51, Heidi Gardner and Ego Nwodim got candid about the work culture at the iconic late-night sketch show.\n\n\tWhile hosting Gardner on her “Thanks Dad” podcast, Nwodim said the “SNL” cast has to spend a lot of “intimate” time together writing and rehearsing, which can either bring everyone together or breed contempt within the group.\n\n\t“To have to share such an intimate space together for hours on end on Saturdays and Thursdays and Fridays, whenever we were rehearsing, yeah, it made us close quick,” Nwodim explained. “But it doesn’t have to work that way. It could also not make you close. It can make you not like each other. It can make you feel whatever mutually, ‘I’m sharing a space with this person.’ But I’m so grateful we got so close.”\n\t\n\n\tGardner added that she was grateful for the friendship she and Nwodim built while on the show and was thankful that egos never got in the way.\n\n\t“I’m so honored that we worked so hard there, and then we also worked on our friendship so hard, which wasn’t hard, by the way,” Gardner said. “I just mean we’re human, so we have egos, we want things for ourselves, we want to succeed. There weren’t a lot of times we were able to succeed the way we wanted at the exact same time.”\n\n\tLater in the discussion, Nwodim said it can be challenging to feel like the “SNL” cast is “winning together,” which, among other reasons, makes the show “not the easiest place to work.” However, she praised Gardner for being “such a light in what can be such a challenging place.”\n\n\tShe added, “But I’m like, if you can leave — in a place where it can get so competitive and you can become so self involved, if you can leave and be still remarkably lovely and such a light and still pouring into other people like you, I think you succeeded.”\n\t\n\n\tGardner unveiled her exit from “SNL” on Aug. 28 after being on the show for eight seasons, while Nwodim left on Sept. 12 after her seventh. The “SNL” cast experienced a major shakeup before Season 51, with Devon Walker, Emil Wakim and Michael Longfellow all leaving the show. Please Don’t Destroy member Ben Marshall was pulled up to the main cast, while Martin Herlihy moved to the writing staff and John Higgins left the show.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrankie Muniz revealed during an episode of “The Joe Vulpis Podcast” last month that he has not spoken to Hilary Duff in the 22 years since they starred in “Agent Cody Banks” together (via People). Muniz blamed Duff’s mother for creating a split between the two young actors after she allegedly interfered in the movie’s casting process and went behind Muniz’s back to get Duff cast as the female lead in the action comedy.\n\n\tMuniz and Duff met as teenagers as their careers took off around the same time, with Duff’s Disney Channel series “Lizzie McGuire” premiering in 2001 and Muniz’s Fox sitcom “Malcom in the Middle” debuting in 2002. Muniz even cameoed as himself on Duff’s series.\n\t\n\n\t“We became really, really good friends. We had a really great relationship for a long time,” Muniz remembered. “I was on the set of ‘Lizzie McGuire,’ and I was in Hilary’s dressing room and her mom was there… Her mom was like, ‘Do you know what you’re doing this summer? What are you doing this summer?’ And I go, ‘Oh, I’m filming this movie where I’m playing like a junior James Bond.'”\n\n\tMuniz said he told Duff’s mom all about “Agent Cody Banks,” and she allegedly responded by asking if the movie had a female lead yet. According to Muniz, the production was already interested in casting “Smallville” star Kristin Kreuk opposite him, and he “really thought” Cody’s love interest, Natalie Connors, would be played by her when he read the script. Plans suddenly changed, however. Muniz said the next time he spoke to Duff’s mother (which was the very next morning), she was informing him that Duff had already been cast.\n\t\n\n\t“Her mom’s like, ‘Guess what? We’re going to be spending the summer together… she’s doing “Cody Banks” with you… They signed the contract last night,’” Muniz said, adding that he was shocked and remembered thinking: “The movie you knew nothing about yesterday?”\n\n\tMuniz was surprised because he thought he was at a point in his career where he would have pull with the studio when it came to finding his “Agent Cody Banks” co-star. He called his agents, who confirmed that “calls were made” about casting Duff in the role. The agents “just assumed it was fine” since he was already close with Duff, as proven by his cameo on “Lizzie McGuire.”\n\n\t“Needless to say, I wasn’t thrilled about it. And not because I didn’t want it to be Hilary,” Muniz said. “I don’t know how much I want to say. I’m trying to think about it because I’ve already said way too much.”\n\n\t“Agent Cody Banks” ultimately went into production with Muniz and Duff as the leads, with Muniz saying: “I was very sad when Hilary’s mom would come on set… And if I told you I’ve never talked to Hilary since the last day of filming. I’ve not said one word to her since then. So that’s the truth of that. No one knows about my Hilary Duff story.”\n\n\tMuniz then got honest by sharing the guilt he feels for not having continued his friendship with Duff just because of what her mother allegedly did to him by going behind his back.\n\n\t“I regret not just continuing to be friends with her because we had a great friendship for such a long time, and I let her mom… it pissed me off,” Muniz said. “I would love to catch up with her [in the future]. I would love to even talk about that because I’m sure she doesn’t know any of that happened.”\n\n\t“Agent Cody Banks,” directed by Harald Zwart, opened in theaters in March 2003 from MGM and grossed nearly $60 million worldwide. Muniz played the title role, a 15-year-old teenager who goes undercover for the CIA as a super-spy. The supporting cast featured Angie Harmon, Keith David and Ian McShane. Muniz returned for the 2004 sequel, “Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,” but Duff did not.\n\n\tWatch Muniz’s full interview on “The Joe Vulpis Podcast” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe sequel to hit Hong Kong period action film “Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In” will start shooting in March next year, revealed its director Soi Cheang at the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\tSpeaking at a Q&A session for a screening of the first movie, Cheang also mentioned that the prequel will be shot immediately after, although the producers have not determined the release dates for either. Both prequel and sequel will be based on the novel “City Of Darkness” by Yuyi.\n\t\n\n\t“Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In” grossed some $111 million on a $39 million budget, a critical and commercial hit for a Hong Kong cinema industry that has seen little of either in recent years. The film followed Chan Lok-kwun (Raymond Lam), a mainland refugee trying to pay his way to a fake ID by winning bare-knuckle brawls. When he ends up double crossed by remorseless triad leader Mr. Big (Sammo Hung), the desperate outsider steals a satchel of the head honcho’s cocaine and makes a run for Hong Kong’s Walled City, a darkened citadel, hostile to anyone who approaches. Lok-kwun may be safe from Mr. Big’s cronies, who know better than to step into enemy territory, but he soon has to deal with the city’s own martial law, courtesy of the enigmatic crime boss Cyclone (Louis Koo),\n\n\n\tCheang’s own critical and commercial hits (and misses) were also up for discussion in the freewheeling discussion on his career, as were his experiences with mentors like Hong Kong luminary Johnnie To, who gave him his first directorial starts under his Milkyway Image banner, with films like the 2012 car chase action film “Motorway.”\n\t\n\n\t“’Motorway’ was another disaster of mine.” said Cheang. “It was the first time I had shot a racing film, and I had no budget to shoot the cars going fast. When I saw the assembly cut, my first reaction was to smash the television.”\n\n\t“I had to go back and ask Mr. To for money to do reshoots. I asked for 16 days of reshoots. At the end of the day, he used his own money to help fund the reshoots, so that I could recover the movie.”  \n\n\tThe director was surprisingly candid about other ups and downs of his career, and how he retreated to his indie roots after experiences with big budget filmmaking, such as the three-film, 3D fantasy series, “The Monkey King,” starring Donnie Yen.\n\n\t“The “Monkey King” [movie series] helped me in my career, perhaps not creatively, it didn’t have a great impact on my creativity, but it gave me the experience of working on a large scale film, with personnel from all around the world,” said Cheang. “But by the end of the experience I was feeling very lost, and that’s why I went back to shoot ‘Limbo,’ a more personal film.”\n\n\t“When you make a personal film, you end up slowly rediscovering the reasons why you started making films in the first place.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSomebody up there who likes epic baseball games also likes Brad Paisley. \n\n\t“I would like to be called Mr. More Baseball,” the country star tells Variety, the day after singing the National Anthem at a World Series game that went to a record-tying 18th inning. “If you’d like more baseball, I’m your guy.”\n\n\tIt’s not that this was an isolated occurrence. The previous time a World Series game went to an 18th inning, back in 2018, Paisley also happened to be singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” In fact, all four times he has sung the anthem before a Series game, it has gone into extra innings, although not always as radically as these two instances.\n\t\n\n\tA few wags have wondered if this is “the Brad Paisley curse,” but most baseball fans would be more likely to qualify as something like “the Brad Paisley blessing.” Rather than become bored by the lengthy standoff, many were agreeing with the sportcasters who called Monday’s game one of the most thrilling in the history of the sport, even though (maybe especially though) it went to almost seven hours.\n\n\n\tSo many people have credited him as the charm that made that possible again, he’d like to put himself up for more such possibly crowd-pleasing opportunities to usher in a two-for-the-price-of-one game.\n\n\t“I’m available also for football,” Paisley points out. “I’d like to see that go into more quarters, as well.”\n\n\tPaisley did an interview for an MLB program before his performance and was asked, presumably jokingly, if he could foresee something similar happening as went down in 2018. He brushed it off.\n\n\t“It’s statistically impossible. I don’t understand,” says the country star. “I was like, I just want to get the words right. I had no idea that there would be major cosmic ramifications.”\n\t\n\n\tAs another point of coincidence, his birthday is Tuesday. “Here’s the fun fact: On the east coast, they won this on my birthday. They almost won it on my birthday on the west coast. If they win tonight, I get two wins on my birthday. Wouldn’t that be nice? That’s all I want. I can’t think of anything stranger, first of all,” than the Dodgers winning two on his big day without there being a double-header.\n\nLet him sing it tonight, I want 6 more hours of Baseball— JumpyYaNub (@JumpyYaNub) October 28, 2025\n\n\n\tHe won’t really take any credit for Monday’s seeming serendipity. “I definitely don’t think it had anything to do with me,” the Dodgers megafan says. “I did start to wonder what we were headed for in the ninth. I was like, ‘Please God, let’s win this now.’ And then I thought, ‘Okay, please God, let’s win this now in the 10th.’ And then last year the walk-off was in the 11th with Freddy Freeman, and that was a grand slam, and I’m like, ‘That’d be fine. Let’s do that. Yeah, that’d be a fun stat — do that twice!’ Nope. And then it was like, oh no… But it was one of the best-played baseball games of all time. I mean, the defense that both teams showed, the way they kept the score tied, and then the pitching… I just don’t even know what we just watched. It really was one of the most exhausting sporting events that you could ever see. Anybody who’s on the fence about what it’s like to be a baseball fan…”\n\n\t“Last night when that was happening, it was the same exact feeling when I was waiting on that in 2018. Just every inning, a pitcher just absolutely out-dueling the other, and then some close calls and then, I mean, none of us could believe what we were seeing, and I thought, who’s gonna end this? And then all of a sudden, here comes Freddy, which is also poetic. He did it two years in a row. It’s crazy.”\n\n\n\tPaisley is a friend of the Dodgers, literally, and is closest to the legendary pitcher who came into the game for just one out, at a point when the bases were loaded, with a serious threat to see the Blue Jays finish the home team off and change the momentum of the series.\n\n\t“My favorite moment was with my dear friend Clayton Kershaw, who’s my favorite player of all time, and not just because we’re friends. I think he’s the exemplary baseball player of our generation,” Paisley says. “And for him to go in there… I couldn’t believe the situation he was asked to perform in last night. Never in history, going in an extra inning, ever, and then goes in an extra inning with bases loaded and doesn’t give up. To me, that’s just the beautiful thing about this game. They cut to Ellen, his wife, in the stands, and she’s crying when he gets that.” Paisley had chatted with him before the game. “He said it last night. ‘He’s like, ‘Four more games at most, and then I’m done.’ And it’s like, whoa. And then to see this play out, it’s like Brad Pitt said in ‘Moneyball’: ‘How can you not be romantic about baseball?'”\n\t\n\n\tSome thought that was a risky move on manager Dave Roberts’ part that could have had fans feeling sorry for the nearly-retired Kershaw if things had not gone his way. “That’s foremost on Dave’s mind,” Paisley says. “He must have really, really felt like that was the best shot at that moment. He needed that out, and he needed it from somebody that’s not gonna buckle. Clayton is the fiercest competitor you will ever meet. In the case of Dave, they’re very mindful of the fact that his legacy needs to be one of his entire incredible, massive career being this major accomplishment. And you don’t want that footnote at the end (if winning runs are batted in on Kershaw’s watch). I was really praying at that moment, but it worked out. And I think that somehow that was meant to be.”\n\n\tPaisley talks about the slow evolution of his relationship with the Dodgers before he became known as one of the most reliable musical faces in Chavez Ravine.\n\n\t“It goes back to when Kim (actress Kimberly Williams-Paisley) and I got married in 2003 and started living out there part-time in Santa Monica. We bought our first house, which was in the Palisades, which is one of my houses that burned down (this year). I didn’t own it anymore, but it’s a tragedy; it was a beautiful old place, built in 1922, and the first house we ever bought together. Just like everything else in that area, it’s gone. But around that time, my kids started to be of the age where they need to go to baseball games. I mean, that’s a rite of passage. And so I started to fall in love with the Dodgers as a team and got to know guys like Clayton and Justin Turner, and became good friends with Dave Roberts and Andrew Friedman and these folks. It kinda helps, too, that Nashville doesn’t have anything like that, other than the Sounds, who aren’t competing in that category. But it’s a really neat organization and I just love the sport.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrad Paisley, Jason Bateman, and Sean Hayes pose for a photo prior to Game Three of the 2025 World Series presented by Capital One between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium on Monday, October 27, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMLB Photos via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHe didn’t grow up obsessed with the game. “I grew up kind of half-watching baseball. In the years where the Pirates were good when I was growing up, my dad for some reason was a Cleveland Indians fan, instead of the Pirates, probably from his dad. But we just didn’t go to many games or anything like that and I just wasn’t invested.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen he was asked to do his first performance of the National Anthem for the Dodgers in 2000, it planted a seed. “That first anthem was interesting. It was a middle of the day, hot L.A.-sun-type sun game, and you sing and they give you the jersey and tickets and you have a hot dog and call itan accomplishment.” But eventually it got to be personal, not just a gig, with Paisley.\n\n\t“One of the more memorable ones I ever did was what they called opening day 2.0, I think — the opening day of fans being allowed back in ‘21, after that whole year of just our cardboard cutouts sitting in the stands over there. I sang that day and that was really emotional — I mean, it just felt like the world was right when people were allowed to watch this game again in person. I loved it. And that one was hard to get through; it felt like a cathartic thing.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrad Paisley, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Ellen Kershaw, and Clayton Kershaw attend Clayton Kershaw’s 7th Annual Ping Pong 4 Purpose at Dodger Stadium on August 8, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNow, “I think if you want more baseball, call me.  I would like to think it’s the blessing, being that my team won; I guess it would be a curse if every time I sang it went long and the team I was rooting for lost. But I love being some part” of the lore, he says. “Because look, I’m never gonna swing a bat or be anywhere near the real sport itself, and then, to see these articles today” on sports sites and in other news stories, “there’s so much fun to read mentions that are like, ‘Did you know he did this and this and this?’ It’s really mind-blowing to even be mentioned in the course of some baseball statistic, for a guy who loves the sport…\n\n\t“It’s my one historic contribution to mankind,” he cheerfully decides.\n\nIf Brad Paisley sings the national anthem at a World Series game, they should sell alcohol at least until the second 7th inning stretch.— Fantasy Beasts and Where to Find Them (@FantasyBeastsFF) October 28, 2025\n\n\n\tNext up for Paisley is a Christmas album he’s soon putting out, “Snow Globe Town” — and it’s hard to think about yuletide cheer being night when the boys of summer are still at it in the L.A. sun. But he’s ready for the transition, with or without a rocking holiday collection to soon promote. “That’s why you turn Hallmark on in November. Well, I do. It’s like, ‘Let’s leave this channel on for the next two months.'”\n\n\tPaisley is sticking around to attend Tuesday’s Game 4, naturally. From the stands. “Whatever happens tonight ain’t my fault,” he says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt can be challenging to deliver something fresh and unique to the memory play genre. However, in writer Bess Wohl‘s new Broadway show, “Liberation,” she manages to do just that.\n\n\tDirected by Whitney White, “Liberation” is set in the 1970s and in the present. In the years following the Civil Rights Movement, shepherded by Black Americans, women were fighting to find an equal place in society. Now, a half-century later, the American government is clawing back several hard-earned wins. Bridging the time periods, “Liberation” addresses what was and who we’ve become as a society. \n\t\n\n\tThe play opens in the present day. A woman (Susannah Flood) is grieving the loss of her mom, Lizzie (also portrayed by Flood), while trying to reconcile the traditional wife and mother she knew with the young, ambitious journalist who started a women’s consciousness group in 1970. Weaving back and forth between the present and the past, we are introduced to Lizzie and her five friends, who desired so much more than what the world was willing to offer them. \n\n\n\tDesigned by David Zinn, “Liberation” is set in a musty and nostalgic basement basketball gym in Ohio. Lizzie is a University of Chicago-educated journalist who finds herself assigned to the obituary and wedding sections at her newspaper job. Feeling stilted, she forms a weekly women’s group that draws in several different women from various walks of life. \n\n\tDora (Audrey Corsa) is a doe-eyed blonde, stuck in a dull and loveless relationship. She desperately wants to turn her fledgling job at a spirits brand into a full-on career. Her polar opposite, Isidora (Irene Sofia Lucia), is a fiery Italian desperate to take on the world, but tethered to her marriage because of her immigration status. The group also welcomes Margie (Betsy Aidem), a middle-aged housewife determined to escape her recently retired husband and the endless monotony of her life. Meanwhile, Susie (Adina Verson), an out lesbian, is fighting burnout from the cause but still clinging to her last bit of hope. Finally, there is Celeste (Kristolyn Lloyd), a Black woman who was forced to leave New York to come home and care for her ailing mother, but still dreams of writing and making a difference. \n\t\n\n\tAs “Liberation” presses forward with tons of humor, anguish, and candor, audiences learn a great deal about these characters —who they became even after the group disbanded — and why certain choices were made. While some dreams are realized, others are stifled or pushed aside altogether. Through Wohl’s sharp writing, the play explores frank themes, including what it truly takes to be a revolutionary and why self-sacrifice is often not something people are willing to engage in. Moreover, it highlights why people decide to veer in one direction or another, especially when it might serve them over others.  \n\n\tSome of the most compelling aspects of “Liberation” happen in the second half.  Leaping ahead to 1973, all of the women, including Lizzie, are in very different places. The second act begins with an explosion of vulnerability: Inspired by an article in Ms. Magazine, the ladies barricade themselves in the gym and strip naked. Going around, they each share one aspect of their body they love and one they hate. It’s a bold and daring scene, shepherded by intimacy director Kelsey Rainwater, that’s less about the nudity and more about the sisterhood and bond the women form to hold space for each other, even amid disagreements. \n\n\tLater in the act, Joanne (Kayla Davion), a Black woman, stumbles into the gym in search of her son’s lost bookbag. Sitting in on the group meeting, she questions them about excluding mothers who can’t meet on a school night at six o’clock. Additionally, she questions Celeste’s presence as a Black woman, reminding her (as we’ve seen most recently in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election),  there is no “we.” White women and Black women often vote, live and experience the world very differently. As Lizzie’s daughter grapples with this sequence, Celeste tells her to stick to her own story. It’s a bold reminder of how race and racism profoundly shape who we are and our varied perspectives. \n\n\t“Liberation” is a brilliant, well-acted, and sobering account of the women’s rights movement, complicity, and the lens through which we view our caretakers — namely, our mothers. Though it does lean toward melodrama, dragging just a bit in the final moments for a shaky ending, the core of the play is resounding, reminding us all that freedom in a patriarchal and white supremacist-led nation is a constant and continual fight. \n",

Witnesses shot camera footage that captured the surviving monkey climbing out of the trailer and wandering around in a rural area.\n      \n\n          Police warned the public the monkey is super aggressive toward humans. Translation: if you see a monkey on the run, don’t approach it... just call 911.\n      \n    \n          Mississippi wildlife officials and local cops are already out trying to nab the furry baboon, but can't seem to find the chimp anywhere.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          As for Tulane University, officials tell us -- despite what the cops say -- the primates in question belong to another entity and are \"not infectious,\" meaning they don't have diseases. They add, \"We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed.\"\n      \n    \n          TMZ also reached out to Tulane National Biomedical Research Center ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Animals\n              \n                          \n                Car Crashes\n              \n                          \n                Viral\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                Coronavirus\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

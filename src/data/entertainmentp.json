    "body": "\n\tDick Van Dyke started celebrating his upcoming 100th birthday early by hosting a two-hour sing-a-long charity event with fans on Nov. 30 in Malibu, Calif. (via People). The event, which the icon co-hosted with his wife, Arlene Silver, raised funds to benefit the Dick Van Dyke Museum and The Van Dyke Endowment of the Arts.\n\n\t“There are several reasons for having these — all good — but mine is to revive the art of conversation,” Van Dyke told the audience. “I don’t care if you’re on a street, you’re in a bus or in a restaurant, everybody’s looking at their phones. Nobody talks. I’ve seen young couples having dinner together and they’re both looking at their phones. I may be the only person in the United States over 10 who does not have a cell phone. I don’t have a phone.”\n\t\n\n\tVan Dyke will turn 100 years old on Dec. 13. Along with his quartet The Vantastix, he sang some of the most famous songs from his career at the event in addition to personal favorites. The group started by performing “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” the title song from the actor’s 1968 classic, and ended with “Let’s Go Fly a Kite,” the classic number from “Mary Poppins.” Van Dyke also performed other favorites from those movies, including “You Two” and “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.”\n\n\tAccording to People: “At one point, a fan asked Van Dyke what his favorite part of the Christmas season is, which he said was always ‘the singing, the caroling.’ On that note, he and The Vantastix sang ‘Caroling, Caroling’ by Nat King Cole.”\n\n\tOther songs during the sing-a-long event included “Carolina in the Morning” and the theme song to “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” the actor’s iconic CBS sitcom that ran for five seasons from 1961 to 1966.\n\t\n\n\tEarlier this fall, Van Dyke reflected on his upcoming 100th birthday by telling fans: “I brag sometimes about how I made it to 100 and the truth is, if I had known I was going to live this long, I would’ve taken better care of myself. And it is frustrating because I don’t know what I did right. Other than [my wife, Arlene], I didn’t do anything right.”\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety last year to mark his CBS special “Dick Van Dyke: 98 Years of Magic,” the actor spoke lovingly about his career in Hollywood and said: “I enjoyed everything I did, and not a lot of people can say that.”\n\n\t“I left a good example for a young generation,” he added about what he thinks his legacy is in Hollywood. “I have a positive effect on kids. And I can tell by the mail I get from kids that I’ve had a good effect. They want to emulate that behavior. And that, I think, is why what we really accomplish is worthwhile. I’m so happy the impact I had was a positive one, and I’m perfectly satisfied with that.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCharlie Puth has spoken out against critics who claim that he isn’t the best choice to sing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl.\n\n\tOn Sunday, the singer-songwriter was announced as a performer for Super Bowl LX in February alongside Coco Jones and Brandi Carlile, who will sing “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and “America the Beautiful,” respectively. But some on social media were quick to criticize Puth’s booking, including one who elicited a response from Puth himself.\n\t\n\n\t“Man we’ve fallen from when Whitney Houston sang at the Super Bowl,” wrote one X user, referring to the late singer’s iconic rendition of the song in 1991. “Charlie Puth? He’s not gonna give us vocals I’m afraid.”\n\n\n\tPuth was quick to respond, quoting the tweet and stating, “I’ll never claim to be as good of a singer as Whitney Houston ever was. But I assure you we’re putting a really special arrangement together- in D major. It’ll be one of my best vocal performances.”\n\nI’ll never claim to be as good of a singer as Whitney Houston ever was. But I assure you we’re putting a really special arrangement together- in D major. It’ll be one of my best vocal performances. https://t.co/N4POfitxhb— Charlie Puth (@charlieputh) December 1, 2025\n\n\n\tPuth, Jones and Carlile are the latest musicians tapped to perform at the Super Bowl, following Bad Bunny’s announcement as the Halftime Show star in late September. The Puerto Rican rapper quickly became a controversial selection, coaxing responses from House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump, who said that it’s “absolutely ridiculous” that he was booked.\n\n\t“I’ve never heard of him,” Trump said. “I don’t know who he is… I don’t know why they’re doing it. It’s crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment — I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”\n\t\n\n\tFor its part, the NFL stood by Bad Bunny amid continued MAGA backlash. “It’s carefully thought through,” said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. “I’m not sure we’ve ever selected an artist where we didn’t have some blowback or criticism. It’s pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching… We’re confident it’s going to be a great show. He understands the platform that he’s on, and I think it’s going to be exciting and a united moment.”\n",

Announced Nov. 20 during the Las Vegas Grand Prix — a fitting backdrop for an initiative built on speed — the company unveiled its “15-Minute Switch1” campaign, promising consumers a streamlined, digital-first jump to T-Mobile in mere minutes.\n\n\tThe move marks a fresh chapter in the brand’s long-running push to dismantle the traditional frustrations of wireless service. Now, customers can switch in 15 minutes per line through the T-Life app or T-Mobile.com, removing the paperwork and guesswork that have historically slowed the process. The company is positioning the feature as a fix for a process many consumers assume has to be painful.\n\n\n\tBacked by T-Mobile’s “It’s better over here” message, the new initiative leans into the freedom to switch virtually anywhere — whether that’s a school pick-up line, an airport gate, or between errands. The brand’s Easy Switch tool provides personalized plan comparisons and savings insights, aiming to take the anxiety out of choosing the right plan.\n\n\tThe rollout tees up a broader holiday push from the network, including same-day device delivery beginning Dec. 1. Customers who prefer to bring their existing device can claim a new phone anytime in the next 90 days. Find out more at T-Mobile.com.1. Check out in 15 minutes or less per line. Device activation, data, & number transfer will take additional time. Same-day delivery available for most customers, see if it’s an option during checkout. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tSimon Cowell is well aware that he gained a reputation for harsh, cutting criticism as a judge on “American Idol.” The record exec and TV personality apologized for some of his comments on the show in a new interview with The New York Times‘ podcast The Interview.\n\n\t“I did realize I’d probably gone too far,” Cowell said. “I didn’t particularly like audition days, because they’re long and boring. I would get fed up. And of course, out of a hundred nice comments, what are they going to use? They’re always going to use me in a bad mood. I got that. What can I say? I’m sorry.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked to identify what specifically he was apologizing for, Cowell responded with, “Well, just being a dick.”\n\n\n\t“I wasn’t trying to be a dick on purpose,” Cowell said. “All I wanted with these shows was to find successful artists to sign to the label. So when all these people were coming in and they couldn’t sing, we would say after 10 seconds, ‘You can’t sing.’ Not, ‘You’re going to be brilliant.'”\n\n\tAlongside Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul, Cowell was one of the original judges on “American Idol,” panelling the first seasons of the singing competition series from 2002 to 2010. Prior to that, he was an original judge on “Pop Idol,” the British series that inspired “American Idol.” As the U.S. series grew into a pop culture juggernaut in the aughts, Cowell became a pop culture fixture for cutting down celebrity hopefuls with his grouchy zingers, the most brutal of which finding a robust life online in the early ages of video sharing on the internet.\n\n\t“I’m not proud of it, let’s put it that way,” Cowell continued. “When I hear about these clips, I’m like, ‘Oh, God.’ But then again, the upside is that it made the shows really popular worldwide.”\n\t\n\n\tCowell is currently making rounds to promote his Netflix series “Simon Cowell: The Next Act,” which will follow the exec as he mounts the search to assemble a new boy band. The show premieres on Dec. 10. \n",

As part of his efforts with Broadway Licensing Global, he guided the licensing of more than 24,000 productions annually in collaboration with over 2,800 authors and 8,000 titles. Those include works by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and Lynn Nottage, as well as properties like “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” and “Clue.”\n\t\n\n\tCercone’s new initiative will launch with Barry Manilow’s “Harmony: A New Musical,” which had a short stint on Broadway, as well as the “Stranger Things”-inspired “Stranger Sings: The Musical Parody” and “Camp Kappawana: The Musical.”\n\n\n\t“After years of building and leading large global catalogs, I wanted to create a home where each show receives the kind of bespoke attention and long-range planning it truly deserves,” said Cercone. “The Licensing House is intentionally selective. Our job is to fiercely protect the work, amplify its reach, and architect smart, sustainable strategies so these stories can live on more stages, in more communities, for many years to come.”\n\n\tThe Licensing House’s leadership team includes David Abbinanti as VP of content and Scott Prisand as VP of business development. TLH has partnered with the Kaufer Group to head global distribution strategies.\n\n\t“I’ve been fortunate to see how powerful the right licensing team can be for a show’s life,” Cercone said. “With these seasoned industry professionals on our leadership team, The Licensing House will work hand in hand with authors and rights holders to think holistically about professional, international, amateur, and educational markets, building a long-term roadmap instead of just processing paperwork.”\n\t\n\n\t(Pictured above: “Harmony” on Broadway)\n",

    "body": "\n\tGuillermo del Toro nailed it when he told Roar Uthaug during a recent conversation that his “Troll” movie showcased a playful blend of Norwegian sensibility and American flair.\n\n\tUthaug, whose anticipated Norwegian monster sequel “Troll 2” drops Monday on Netflix, grew up watching the same 1990s sci-fi and disaster movies that shaped a generation of Hollywood filmmakers.\n\n\t“I got the idea for a troll movie like this back in the ’90s,” he tells Variety in an interview alongside Jenny Stjernströmer Björk, VP of Nordic content at Netflix. “That was after watching ‘Armageddon’ and ‘Independence Day’ and ‘Jurassic Park.’ I was thinking, ‘How could we do this in Norway? What would that be about?’”\n\t\n\n\tHe then stumbled on a century-old drawing by Norwegian artist Theodor Kittelsen portraying a troll striding down Oslo’s main street, and the idea for his action-adventure movie crystallized. “I thought, What would happen if a troll, for real, was walking through the center of Oslo today? How would the government and the army react? And that was the first inspiration for the movie,” he says, a few hours before unveiling ‘Troll 2’ at a lavish red-carpet bash hosted by Netflix in Oslo.\n\n\tConsidered the most ambitious Norwegian movie in recent history (if not all time), “Troll” made a splash on the streamer when it bowed in December 2022. With 103 million views in the first three months alone, it became the most streamed non-English language movie of all time on Netflix, and ranked in the top 10 across 93 countries. It even topped the charts in Norway, the U.S., and the U.K..\n\t\n\n\t“Troll 2” brings back kickass palaeontologist-turned-adventurer Professor Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann) who witnessed the emergence of an enormous troll in the 2022 movie. Tidermann is recruited once again to join forces with Andreas Isaksen (Kim Falck) and Kristoffer Holm (Mads Pettersen) to stop a dangerous new troll (nicknamed Megatroll) that has awakened and unleashed destruction across Norway. The supersized sequel also introduces new faces, such as government official Marion Auryn Rhadani (Sara Khorami) and historian Esther Johanne Tiller (Anne Krigsvoll).\n\n\tStjernströmer Björk says she knew immediately that the project had this global appeal. “It was something we had never heard before,” she says, remembering the moment Uthaug and his producers at Motion Blur pitched it. “What struck me was the combination of those big grand scenes with so much humor, warmth and emotions. It’s also very deeply rooted in Norway. The mix of all these ingredients was exactly what we’re looking for,” she explains.\n\n\tUltimately, “Troll” drew a huge fanbase, Uthaug says, because “it’s set in a genre that people understand, like the monster genre, but the exoticness of the local Norwegian folklore, the troll and the nature make it unique.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRoar Uthaug, director of “Troll 2” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLarry Tanz, Netflix’s head of EMEA, points out the first “Troll” movie “was number one of our most popular non-English language films on Netflix.” And crucially, he adds, “It’s super Norwegian.”\n\n\t“It really came from such an authentic place, from a storyteller’s perspective rather than us having a desire to make a creature film,” Tanz told Variety right before the International Emmy Awards ceremony. “It was Roar saying, ‘I want to tell this story about this thing that’s super connected to our culture here.'”\n\n\tUthaug – who credits Steven Spielberg for being a “big inspiration” for his talent in bridging entertainment and movie magic, always with a big heart” — was also eager to keep the authenticity in the aesthetic and visual style of “Troll 2,” as much as in the storytelling. “I think we have one day on a green screen on this movie,” he says of his sequel. “The rest was shot on real locations with the actors, on the snow, in the wind, so that it felt as real as possible and as grounded in Norway and in Norwegian landscape as possible.”\n\t\n\n\tThe trolls themselves are created with visual effects, so Uthaug had the actors interact with a drone hovering 30 meters above them to guide them. He also used extensive previs and concept art to help the cast understand the emotional stakes of each scene.\n\n\tUthaug also envisioned the “Troll” films as character-driven. “It’s really important that you care about the characters,” he says. “Those that you feel empathy with are the ones that make you invest in the movie.”\n\n\tThe one thing that doesn’t look local in “Troll 2” is the scale of the budget and production values. While Netflix hasn’t revealed the budget, Stjernströmer Björk and Tanz suggest it wasn’t cheap to make.\n\n\t“We really made sure that we had the right budget to make ‘Troll 2;’ with the first film being such a big success, we wanted to give members something even more extraordinary this time — so we have the two trolls!” she says.\n\n\tTanz says “Troll 2” is great example of Netflix seeking local stories and giving them enough scale to become worldwide successes.\n\n\t“We’re bringing the support for our filmmakers at a level they might not normally experience for something like that,” says Tanz. “Roar is a world-class filmmaker and we’re able to provide him with the resources to tell the story in its best form.”\n\n\tInternationally, the streamer has also pushed its dubbing strategy. “We’re dubbing in like 36 languages now,” Tanz says, citing a family anecdote illustrating how dubbing has made it possible for “audience members to watch something and feel it was made for them.”\n\n\t“When my mother-in-law told me, ‘I watched “Lupin,’” I said, ‘Oh yeah, that’s our show from France.’ She said, ‘No, it’s not. It’s in English,'” he says.\n\n\tUnsurprisingly, Uthaug has sparked some Hollywood interest since he made “Troll” but isn’t in a hurry to make his way across the Atlantic. “I get some scripts now and then,” says the filmmaker, “but being able to make a Norwegian language movie on this scale here in Norway has just been fantastic. That’s really the high point of my career.”\n\n\tWhile he’s keeping his options open for what’s next, he’s not fully ready to leave the “Troll” franchise behind. “We’ve talked about this and the word ‘trollogy’ does sound really good,” he says with a smile.\n\t\n\n\tTanz is hopeful about the “trollogy” prospects. “That would be a great outcome,” he says. “And success begets more success.”\n",

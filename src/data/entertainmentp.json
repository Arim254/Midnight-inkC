Things have definitely taken a turn! The finances of M-Tex Oil are looking pretty dicey, but at least one member of the Norris family is finding success at the casino! Read on to break down all the action from this week.\n\t\n\n\nUgh, can you imagine a worse start to your morning than getting lectured by Nate (Colm Feore)?\nTommy (Billy Bob Thornton) shows love for America by proudly not knowing a thing about its history. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\n“Am I talking to your fucking ghost?” Good early morning burn, Tommy.\n“It’s a curse my mind is sharp.” Damn, we’re not even two minutes into this episode, and T.L. (Sam Elliott) is making me tear up.\nI love this vulnerable side of Tommy and T.L.\nIf Tommy and Angela (Ali Larter) negotiating money for sex isn’t true love, I don’t know what is.\nTommy hiring an exotic dancer to teach his dad how to do physical therapy is…creative?\nOf course, Angela and Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) have taken the old folks to the strip club before.\nDamn, you know Angela can make some delicious (and dangerous) frozen cocktails with that margarita machine.\nExcellent George Strait needle drop.\nWhy has Rebecca (Kayla Wallace) been in so many car crashes?!?\nI guess Angela is a … gambling phenom? Who knew?\nBrave man to hit on Cami (Demi Moore) while she’s reading alone at the bar.\nEww gross … the man (Jay Huguley) touched her?!? Hands off!\nYikes, Cami is so short with Tommy immediately. This meeting is not going to go well.\nGood on you, Charlie (Guy Burnet)! You sound very smart in a high-pressure situation.\nCami trying to bring morality to the oil industry sure sounds nice, but she would be eaten alive. Listen to your advisors, Cami! You don’t get an award for sticking to your word.\nOof — Charlie, good luck locating that impossible-to-find gas!\nDouble oof, Charlie: “What a lonely woman you’re gonna be.” Cutting to the core!\nAww, Cami opening up to Tommy feels nice. She’s got a lot going on, and he cares!\nCheyenne (Francesca Xuereb) rocking the vanity license plate “Hot Lipps” is great.\nHa, I love Nate catching a stray insult.\nNice try, Dale (James Jordan)! You have rizz, but not T.L. levels of rizz.\nTommy, it seems like you’re digging your own grave by seeing Gallino (Andy Garcia) behind Cami’s back. Not smart!\nRebecca, Charlie cares about you enough to keep it real with you and challenge you. Don’t run from that!\nMargaret (Deidra Shanell) coming home post-makeover and immediately getting her husband (Bobby Ray Cauley Jr.) all excited was a cute button on that storyline.\nT.L. is so blissed out in the pool!\n“Can you ask T.L. if his hooker’s staying for supper?” — Angela, a perfect host.\nAlright, Dale — that was a fun, naughty joke. Here for it!\nT.L. wearing his jeans in the pool?

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tAwards season is officially in full swing. The 31st Critics Choice Awards kicks off Sunday night  with Chelsea Handler returning as host.\n\n\tThe ceremony will air live on The CW starting at 4 p.m. PT/ 7 p.m. ET, continuing the network’s recent partnership with the Critics Choice Association after the show spent decades on cable. The move has made the awards significantly easier to stream, with several live TV streaming services carrying local CW affiliates nationwide. The best way for cable-cutters to tune into the show is on DirecTV, Hulu + Live TV and Fubo TV. \n\n\n\t“Sinners” heads into the ceremony with the most nominations. The genre-bending horror film boasts 17 nods, including best picture, director for Ryan Coogler, actor for Michael B. Jordan, supporting actress for Wunmi Mosaku and a raft of craft mentions across cinematography, production design, costume, editing, visual effects, sound and hair and makeup. Close behind is Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” with 14 nods, including four acting mentions. At the same time “Frankenstein” and “Hamnet” scored 11 nominations apiece, solidifying the top tier of contenders that blend studio muscle with auteur prestige.\n\n\tEyes will also be on Timothée Chalamet, nominated in the lead actor category for his role in “Marty Supreme.” The 30 year-old actor took home the Spotlight Actor of the Year Award at the Palm Springs Film Festival on Saturday night. Supporting actress may also be a flashpoint category of the night, with Ariana Grande for “Wicked: For Good” and Teyana Taylor for “One Battle After Another” both top contenders. Even Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas (“Sentimental Value”) has the chance to spoil.\n\n\n\tStream the Critics Choice Awards live online on DirecTV. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSimu Liu pitched Melissa Barrera to be the next Wonder Woman during a recent interview with JoBlo, calling her dedication to stunt training “Wonder Woman-esque.”\n\n\t“She really pushes herself,” Liu said of his “The Copenhagen Test” co-star. “I don’t know who might be listening to this interview, James Gunn or anybody else out there. But I think she really pushes herself. There were a couple of moments during stunt training where I was like, ‘That’s Wonder Woman-esque.’ I’m just throwing it out there.”\n\t\n\n\tIn June of 2025, DC Studios boss James Gunn confirmed there was a new Wonder Woman movie “being written right now.” The film comes in addition to an upcoming HBO series about Wonder Woman’s homeland of Themyscira, which Gunn explained is “slow-moving, but it’s moving.”\n\n\n\t“Supergirl” screenwriter Ana Nogueira was tapped to write the script for the new Wonder Woman movie back in July 2025. She is also writing a live-action “Teen Titans” for DC.\n\n\tGunn told Extra that “Hit Man” star Adria Arjona was among the actresses he could see playing the DC icon.\n\n\t“I follow Adria on Instagram, but everybody came out [and thought], ‘He just followed her, that means she’s Wonder Woman,’” Gunn shared. “She’d be a great Wonder Woman, by the way.”\n\n\tGal Gadot was the first to bring Wonder Woman to the big screen in the modern era. She played the role in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” “Wonder Woman,” “Justice League” and “Wonder Woman 1984.” She also has two uncredited appearances as super heroine in “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” and “The Flash.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile speaking with “CBS Sunday Morning,” Michael B. Jordan said he needed to “decompress” in therapy after playing villain Erik Killmonger in 2018’s “Black Panther.”\n\n\t“After the movie, it kind of stuck with me for a bit,” Jordan said. “Went to therapy, talked about it, found a way to kind of just decompress. And I think at that point, I was still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.”\n\n\n\t“Acting is a solo journey a lot of times,” he added, “Auditioning by yourself, practicing by yourself. There’s a lot of preparation and the experience and the journey. So learning as I went, I [realized] that, ‘Oh man, I still got a little something on me I need to get off.’” You know, talking is really important.”\n\t\n\n\tJordan recalled that it was difficult to shake off Erik Killmonger because he fully immersed himself in the character before shooting. He shared that he spent a lot of time “isolated” and “didn’t really speak” to his family while preparing for the role.\n\n\t“Erik didn’t really know a lot of love. I think Erik didn’t experience that,” Jordan explained. “He had a lot of betrayal, a lot of failed systems around him that shaped him and his anger and his frustration.”\n\n\tJordan starred in Ryan Coogler’s “Black Panther” alongside the late Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright and Winston Duke. The film was a box office smash for Marvel. Released in February 2018, “Black Panther” went on to gross $1.34 billion worldwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe protagonist of the lighthearted new Fox series “Best Medicine” may be a doctor, but the hourlong show isn’t really a medical procedural. Instead, the series borrows a time-honored setup from “Schitt’s Creek,” infinite Hallmark movies and its own source material, the long running British series “Doc Martin”: uptight big city professional gets reluctantly acquainted with the charms of small-town life. In this case, the titular curmudgeon — yes, the name is a pun and the character is called Doctor Best — is played by erstwhile “The Good Wife” star Josh Charles, whose cantankerous charm keeps the sometimes forced-feeling zaniness in check through the first four episodes.\n\t\n\n\t“Best Medicine” takes place in a corner of coastal Maine currently best known to outsiders from Graham Platner campaign ads. (Ironically, this celebration of the country’s quieter corners was developed by Liz Tuccillo, an alumna of the quintessentially urban “Sex and the City” and co-author of the hit self-help book “He’s Just Not That Into You.”) Charles’ Boston heart surgeon used to vacation there as a kid, and returns when a childhood trauma-triggering incident at work gives him an occupationally hazardous fear of blood. Conveniently, the town doctor has just passed away, giving Martin — inheriting a first name from his English predecessor — a new job and a chance to work on his abysmal bedside manner.\n\n\n\tMartin wants nothing more than to diagnose his patients, treat their illnesses and move on with his day. Unfortunately for him, that’s not really the gig, as he learns the hard way when one woman’s use of estrogen cream to treat symptoms of perimenopause accidentally reveals her infidelity. (Both her male partners develop breasts due to estrogen contact. It’s called gynecomastia!) Dr. Best is more like a communal therapist, expected to be on call at all times to consult whatever minor problems his new neighbors may be working through, strictly medical in nature or not — “like the world is one giant doctor’s office,” he laments.\n\t\n\n\tEvery episode of “Best Medicine” establishes a new yet equally beloved local tradition to confound the fiercely anti-sentimental doctor: a baked bean dinner; a high-school baseball game against archrivals Bar Harbor; a handsome hermit who comes out of the woods once a year to teach the local ladies wilderness survival skills. Martin’s no-nonsense aunt Joan (Annie Potts), incompetent assistant Elaine (the mononymous actor Cree) and partner in will-they-won’t-they flirtation Louisa (Abigail Spencer), a teacher, serve as his guides through these local rituals. These women are flanked by an ever-expanding cast of quirk-forward local characters, from the gay couple who own a local restaurant and let their pet pig wander the kitchen to a father-and-son handyman duo who like to make unsolicited repairs.\n\n\tOn the one hand, it’s a relief that “Best Medicine” feels like the first rural-set story in half a decade to make no mention of the opioid crisis. But as endearing as these Maine denizens may be — like Louisa’s ex-fiancé Mark, played by Hollywood’s go-to funny himbo Josh Segarra — they collectively lack edge in a way that’s less than convincing. Lip service is paid to the decline of small towns, yet any contributing factors to that shift are ignored in the name of an insistently sunny (literally; no snow here!) disposition. Martin’s former bully Glen (Patch Darragh) has the makings of a villain before he’s swiftly reformed. Mark briefly flirts with manosphere-style aggrievement, but anger doesn’t suit him.\n\n\tAny hint of acid comes from Martin himself, a necessary counterpoint to the sugar in such abundant supply. “I’m not meant to be a town doctor because I don’t like people,” he complains, but Charles doesn’t play the physician as mean-spirited or even especially irritable. Martin just has little patience or understanding of social niceties, which happen to be the stock and trade of his new home: “I find the people demanding, irrational and far too chatty at supermarkets,” he sighs. To invoke another iconic TV doctor from the same network, Martin’s like a less gleefully bitchy Dr. House, a parallel that extends to his penchant for solving diagnostic mysteries like the source of a seemingly foodborne illness.\n\t\n\n\tMartin will doubtless have his edges sanded down over time, though hopefully later rather than sooner. For now, the contrast between Martin and his patients has a productive friction that gives Charles plenty of grouchy misanthropy to work with. Amid so much communitarian sweetness, a spoonful of bitter helps “Best Medicine” go down. \n\n\t“Best Medicine” premieres on Fox on Jan. 4 at 8 p.m. ET, with remaining episodes airing Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET starting on Jan. 6.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAdam Sandler delivered one of the most memorable moments of the Palm Springs International Film Awards gala on Saturday night, turning a heartfelt honor into a full-blown comedy set while accepting the Chairman’s Award.\n\n\tPresented by his “Jay Kelly” co-star Laura Dern, Sandler took the stage and quickly veered into a wildly funny alternate-history monologue, imagining what his life might have looked like had his acting career stalled after college.\n\t\n\n\t“When I graduated college, I got a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and my father told me he was very proud of me and I should try it out for one year,” Sandler recalled. “He said, ‘See if you get something going. If it doesn’t work out after one year, you’ll come work for me.’ My dad was an electrical contractor. I didn’t know very much about electricity or contracting.”\n\n\n\tFrom there, Sandler riffed on a fictional future spent wiring fuse boxes instead of movie sets, joking that he’d still be married to his wife, Jackie, but living in a much smaller house with “about 10 less bathrooms and a few less statues of me.”\n\n\tHe added that he’d “probably know how to charge my own phone” and would still get stopped on the street. “Not because of the fame factor, but because they’ve never seen anybody with that much scoliosis.”\n\n\tThe bit escalated as Sandler roped his longtime friend Rob Schneider into the fantasy, joking that Schneider would “work with me on every electrical contracting project I ever had to do.”\n\n\t“I probably would have not just had a vacation in Hawaii. If I wanted to go swimming, I would have just gone in the pond up the street next to the nuclear power plant. But it’s not all bad news, because then my penis would glow in the dark.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued riffing on what would happen if his wife wasn’t with him, saying, “But you’re gonna miss the glow in the dark penis!”\n\n\tAmid the laughs, Sandler repeatedly returned to gratitude, crediting the unlikely run that followed that pivotal first year out of college. “I’ve been acting a very long time,” he said. “I can’t thank you all enough for letting me have this career that I’ve been lucky enough to have.”\n\n\tHe singled out “Jay Kelly” his recent creative high point, praising the cast and director Noah Baumbach for pushing him to do some of his best work. \n\n\t“I didn’t want to let him down. I didn’t want to let down any of my castmates. I didn’t want to let down my family. I didn’t want to let myself down,” Sandler said sincerely. “So I always try my best.”\n\n\tThe speech closed on a characteristically sincere note, with Sandler thanking his wife — “my forever girl” — and promising the audience he’s not done yet. \n\n\tWatch Sandler’s speech below:\n\n\n\n\n\t“Thank you guys for letting me make all these movies over the years. I’m going to try to make more.”\n\n\tThe Palm Springs International Film Awards gala, held annually during the Palm Springs International Film Festival, has become a key stop on the awards-season circuit. Sandler is currently nominated for a Critics Choice and Golden Globe Award for his turn in Baumbach’s film.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmazon thinks it can do more for TV advertisers than traditional TV.\n\n\tThe digital giant is preparing to meet with marketers during the annual Consumer Electronics Show, which gets underway on Tuesday. And when the company does, executives plan to tout not only its ability to help sell goods and services via its large e-commerce portal, but to gain significant reach among consumers, thanks to its streaming content and a growing spate of programmatic alliances it has struck with rivals including Disney, Roku and Netflix, among others.\n\t\n\n\t“At some level, you want to be the ‘everything store’ for advertising,” says Alan Moss, vice president of global sales for Amazon Ads, during a recent interview.\n\n\n\tMoss’ willingness to preview Amazon’s plans for CES suggests the company continues to have confidence in its ability to lure new support from Madison Avenue as most video companies move earlier into negotiations ahead of the “upfront,” the annual sales market during which the bulk of TV ad inventory is sold. “We will expand beyond traditional channels and bring more advertisers, especially non-endemics, into our fold,” he says.\n\n\tAsked what categories of advertisers Amazon need to secure more dollars from, Moss replies: “The simple definition is: those that don’t sell on Amazon.”\n\n\tAmazon seems poised to put a bigger spotlight on its ability to connect advertisers with bigger audiences. The company has created an enviable suite of DSP agreements that can help advertisers reach both video and audio users of content tied to other companies. The hope is that giving marketers the chance to buy a broader set of programmatic inventory from a single venue might reduce the number of commercials they show to the same consumer and improve the effectiveness of commercials by distributing them with more precision.\n\t\n\n\t“We can now connect advertisers to 90% of all US households, giving us a broad, deterministic reach,” says Moss.\n\n\tAmazon’s ability to extend reach beyond its own content led it to launch a new “live events optimizer” that enables programmatic advertisers to connect with audiences during heavily watched live moments. These are fast becoming like gold for Madison Avenue stalwarts, who are grappling with a growing number of TV viewers who watch programs at times of their own choosing — in a splintered mass that is harder to reach in an efficient manner. A good chunk of Amazon’s content is watched in such disaggregated fashion, but the company continues to sink millions into sports rights. After winning “Thursday Night Football,” Amazon has now moved on to the NBA, with a new rights deal.\n\n\tRivals have their own big-ticket events to sell. Disney is expected to use its scheduled telecast of the 2027 Super Bowl to tout a broader series of live events against which it hopes to sell advertising packages. NBCUniversal has a new rights pact with Major League Baseball that will help extend its Sunday-night sports franchise, as well as a bigger celebration tied to the 100th anniversary of its broadcast network.\n\n\tAmazon has raised eyebrows in recent months among sales executives at many traditional advertisers after its use of sharp elbows in last year’s sales market. Amazon opted to hold a showcase last year on the first night of the industry’s mid-May “upfront week”  — a slot that has been used for years by rivals NBCUniversal and Fox for events and meetings with advertisers and buyers.\n\n\tThe strategy didn’t appear to crimp Amazon’s sales efforts. “We exceeded our own expectations in upfront commitments year over year with new and existing advertisers,” Amazon said in a statement in August, nodding to interest in a new NBA rights pact and series including “Fallout” and “Beast Games.”\n\n\tAmazon will also spotlight new capabilities powered via A.I. One analyzes a brand’s presence across Amazon’s properties, then “generates creative briefs and storyboards for campaigns,” says Moss.\n\n\tThere is also a new effort to combine ads that generate awareness and those that help lead to a sale, in a new “full funnel” product expected to debut in the first quarter of 2026. Such an effort might start with “premium streaming TV, audio, then reinforces brand message with display and online video across Amazon in the open internet and completes the conversion, whether it’s on a brand site or with sponsored ads,” Moss explains.\n\t\n\n\tThe economic outlook in recent months has been foggy, with concern about tariffs creating an overhang of sorts on optimistic sentiment. Recent forecasts have called for new reasons for hope in 2026. WPP Media has called for global ad spend in 2026 to increase 7.1%, compared with a previous estimate of 6.1%.  One of the factors cited is a raft of new products and services created by A.I., leading to new firms that need to advertise.\n\n\t“To some extent the uncertainty is a little bit of the new normal,” Moss says, adding: “No matter the economic climate, advertisers are focused on using advertising where it’s most likely to achieve their desired business goals, whether that’s awareness, consideration, or diversion.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaunched in 1967, the Consumer Electronics Show bounced around cities and spots on the calendar before finally settling down in 1998 as an event held every January in Las Vegas. For more than half of those years, the Variety Entertainment Summit has been a fixture of that New Year’s tradition, bringing together leaders from various media verticals for onstage discussions about how bleeding-edge technologies are transforming entertainment and shaping the culture.\n\t\n\n\tThis year, Variety’s CES offering comes in two parts, both held at C-Space Studio at the Aria: the Variety Entertainment Summit on Jan. 7 from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and the Variety Business of Creators Summit, presented by Samsung Ads, on Jan. 8 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. \n\n\n\tParticipants will include everyone from Disney president of global advertising Rita Ferro and Hasbro president of licensing and entertainment Kim Boyd to actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Simon Helberg.\n\n\tThis year, there will be added urgency to the conversations brought on by the lightning-fast emergence of AI, which is viewed by many as an existential threat. \n\n\tBut Jon Liebman, chairman and CEO of Brillstein Entertainment Partners, points out that AI is just the latest in a long line of tech disruptors that were supposed to spell doom for the biz, from the arrival of sound movies in the 1920s to home video in the 1980s and the internet in the 1990s.\n\n\t“I would say Hollywood has cried wolf a lot about technology destroying its business, and actually, the opposite has probably occurred,” says Liebman, who will appear on “The Future of Content” panel, moderated by Variety co-editor-in-chief Cynthia Littleton on Jan. 7. “The technology, when harnessed appropriately, has become a tool for what we now have, which is global distribution of content. And so while I don’t think anyone really knows what it will do to our business, I think that the fear that we have has to be tempered by the reality of what technology has actually historically done for the entertainment business, which is fuel its growth in era after era.”\n\t\n\n\tLiebman will get no argument from Jonathan Yunger, co-founder and CEO of AI-powered content production platform and studio Arcana, who will join actor-producer Breckin Meyer (who stars in Arcana’s AI short “Echo Hunter”) and Luminate chief analyst and president Andrew Wallenstein for a conversation on AI storytelling on Jan. 7.\n\n\t“The [AI] toolset can really make a difference and help with being able to maintain or raise production value, but lower costs,” says Yunger, adding, “AI doesn’t work without the creative, without the storyteller.”\n\n\tOther panels at the Variety Entertainment Summit on Jan. 7 include “The New Business of Entertainment,” moderated by Danny Ledger, telecom, media & entertainment leader for consulting services, Deloitte; “Experience This! What’s Next in Events Across Platforms” and “Fandom in the Zeitgeist,” moderated by Variety business editor Todd Spangler; “AI in Overdrive” and “The Big Picture Outlook — What Trends Will Shape 2026?” moderated by Littleton; and “Harnessing Fandom Through Live Sports Content Featuring Amazon Ads & WPP Media.” There will also be a “Brandmakers Elite Roundtable” and a headliner conversation with Anthony Wood, founder, chairman and CEO of Roku.\n\n\tThe Variety Business of Creators Summit on Jan. 8 will feature such panels as “The State of the Creator Economy in Media and Entertainment,” moderated Wallenstein; “New Hollywood Power Players: The Rise of Creators on TV” and “The Power of the Creator Brand,” moderated by Littleton; “The Live Shopping Era Has Arrived” and “Audiences Unlocked — The Future of Creator Marketing,” moderated by Spangler, as well as fireside chats with “media cartographer” Evan Shapiro and Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is blazing past $1 billion at the global box office after 18 days of release. Those ticket sales include $306 million domestically and $777.1 million internationally for a grand total of $1.083 billion.\n\n\tThe third installment has surpassed the billion-dollar benchmark a bit slower than its predecessor, 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which joined the $1 billion club after a brisk 14 days, and 2009’s “Avatar,” which achieved the milestone after 17 days. Of course, those films remained major draws on the big screen — topping the box office for seven consecutive weekends — and eventually became two of the biggest movies in history. The original Na’vi adventure earned $2.9 billion while the sequel generated $2.3 billion.\n\t\n\n\tWhether “Avatar 3” has the staying power to surpass $2 billion in worldwide revenues remains a question mark. Reaching the coveted achievement will rely heavily on international audiences, which were largely responsible for powering the first two films to stratospheric heights. (The first “Avatar” earned a mammoth $2.1 billion from just overseas markets, while the sequel generated a massive $1.65 billion from foreign territories.) For the third entry, top earning overseas territories include China with $138 million, France with $81 million, Germany with $64 million and Korea with $44 million.\n\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is Disney’s third release of 2025 to cross the $1 billion mark, following “Lilo & Stitch” and “Zootopia 2.” (For context, none of its rivals have fielded a single billion-dollar film since 2023.) These movies have capped off a banner year for the studio, which has generated more than $6.58 billion in global revenues for the first time since COVID. Disney is the biggest studio in terms of market share, having outgrossed its rivals by at least $2 billion at the box office.\n\t\n\n\t“Fire and Ash” centers on Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their family as they take on a new fiery foe. This is director James Cameron‘s fourth film to cross the billion-dollar mark, including “Titanic.” Cameron, the only filmmaker in history with three $2 billion blockbusters to his name, had planned a total of five films in the Pandora-set series. However, he has since joked that he’ll hold a press conference to determine whether he’ll move ahead with “Avatar 4” and “Avatar 5” — or if the franchise will conclude with the third adventure.\n\n\t“We’re getting ahead of ourselves [with ‘Avatar 4’] because, first of all, we’ve got to make some money with this one,” Cameron told Variety ahead of opening weekend for “Fire and Ash.” “Every time we go out, we have to prove this crazy business-case yet again.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is towering over the domestic box office during the first weekend of the new year.\n\n\tJames Cameron’s latest Na’vi adventure has collected $40 million from 3,825 North American theaters in its third weekend of release, declining 35% from the busy post-Christmas frame. Those ticket sales are pushing the third “Avatar” to $306 million domestically and $1.08 billion globally after just 18 days in theaters. “Fire and Ash” crossed the coveted billion-dollar benchmark slower than 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which took 14 days, and the original “Avatar,” which took 17 days. Now it’s a matter of where “Avatar: Fire and Ash” will top out at the box office — and whether the third installment has the stamina to surpass $2 billion like its predecessors.\n\t\n\n\tSince January is often glacial in terms of movie theater attendance, Hollywood studios barely release anything new around the dawn of the new year. That means a smattering of Thanksgiving and Christmas leftovers, such as “Zootopia 2,” “The Housemaid” and “Marty Supreme,” were behind “Avatar: Fire and Ash” on North American charts.\n\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” remained a force at No. 2 with $19 million from 3,285 venues, marking a minimal 4% drop from the previous weekend. After six weekends of release, the beloved animated sequel has grossed a mighty $363 million domestically and $1.588 billion globally. “Zootopia 2” recently outperformed “Frozen 2” ($1.45 billion) to become Walt Disney Animation’s highest-grossing movie of all time. That means the announcement of a third trip to the animal-filled metropolis can’t be too far off.\n\t\n\n\tLionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid” rose to No. 3 with $15.2 million from 3,070 screens, a barely-there 1% dip from the prior weekend. The R-rated film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has earned an impressive $75.7 million in North America and $133 million worldwide against a $35 million budget.\n\n\tFourth place went to A24’s “Marty Supreme” with $12.5 million from 2,887 locations, declining just 30% from the post-Christmas frame. So far, the Timothee Chalamet-led ping-pong dramedy has generated $56 million in North America, a great result for the original arthouse release. With those ticket sales, “Marty Supreme” has outgrossed the director Josh Safdie’s prior film “Uncut Gems” ($50 million globally) and ranks among A24’s biggest movies of all time. However, “Marty Supreme” cost $70 million to produce, making it the most expensive film to date for A24. It’ll need to remain a draw into the new year to justify its budget.\n\n\tSony’s action comedy “Anaconda” remained in fifth place with $10 million from 3,509 theaters, a drop of 31% from the prior weekend. After two weekends of release, the meta reboot of 1997’s “Anaconda, this one starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, has grossed $45.8 million in North America and $88 million globally against a $45 million production budget.\n\n\tAnother Christmas release, the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue,” slid to the No. 8 spot with $5.87 million from 2,705 venues, a scant 17% drop. So far, the tear-jerker, led by Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson as performers in a Neil Diamond cover band, has grossed $25 million domestically and $30 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.\n\n\tAlthough the year is very young, 2026 is already pacing ahead of 2025 by 26.5%, according to Comscore. Last year’s revenues hit $8.9 billion across 12 months, a modest 1.5% increase from 2024, though just short of the $9 billion that analysts had expected the industry to generate. As studios prepare to unveil major blockbusters — including “Avengers: Doomsday,” “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” and “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” — will this year’s grosses manage to return to pre-pandemic heights?\n\n\t“With a killer slate on the docket, there’s confidence that 2026 will be the biggest year for theaters since 2020,” predicts Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian.\n\t\n\n\tNow, Hollywood just needs audiences to show up at multiplexes.\n",

Bailey is done hiding his rare genetic disorder, which sometimes requires him to use a wheelchair ... and he hopes his bravery doesn't cost him his career.\n      \n    \n          The actor opened up in a lengthy X thread over the weekend, revealing he's been battling Congenital Myasthenia Syndrome for over five years.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He wrote, \"CMS is a genetic disease that disrupts the communication between the brain and the muscle at the 'nerve/muscle junction.' ... My muscles aren't clearly receiving all my brain's orders to do all the swell things muscles are meant to do. It's a drag.\"\n      \n\n          Bailey explained he kept the diagnosis a secret \"out of career caution\" but assured Hollywood he can still do most of the things he used to, as his wheelchair use is ambulatory.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He said, \"Much like walking my dog around the block, or helping at the store, I can still perform on my feet, limitedly. I can ambulate my way through simple 'walks and talks' with no problem. I can still rise to my feet to object to the judge, derail a town meeting, or yell at a cop for being a loose cannon. But, practically speaking, moving forward, it's time for my work, like in my life, to start skewing more wheelchair, if you will.\"\n      \n    \n          Bailey reassured he was the same guy ... just \"now with wheels.\"\n      \n    \n          In addition to playing Joe the bartender on 'Grey's,' Bailey has also appeared on \"Chicago Fire,\" \"You,\" \"Modern Family,\" \"Shameless,\" \"Scandal,\" \"All That,\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" among other hit TV shows.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

That's according to a show she had last night in Las Vegas, where she gave her relationship dealbreakers.\n      \n    \n          Just after singing her 1999 smash hit \"If You Had My Love,\" J Lo reflected on her love life over the quarter-century she's been performing the song.\n      \n    \n          The singer told the packed crowd, she sang it with hope at first, but over the years, she's also sung it when she was sad. Now, she says, she sings it in power.\n      \n\n          She explained ... \"Because the truth is, if you wanted to have my love, you would have to earn it. You would have to treat me right. You would have to respect me. You'd have to accept me for all that I am. You'd have to love me if you wanted my love.\"\n      \n    \n          But J Lo admitted love was complicated and didn't come without a price.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          \"You can't have love without heartbreak,\" she said.\n      \n    \n          In fact, the song itself may be closely tied to heartbreak. Drake used it as a sample on his song \"Teenage Fever\" amid rumors of a romantic fling between the two.\n      \n    \n          J Lo has, of course, weathered her share of ups and downs in her public love life. Her confirmed exes include Marc Anthony, Ben Affleck, Alex Rodriguez, and Diddy.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          She most recently finalized her divorce from Affleck last year.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jennifer Lopez\n              \n                          \n                Drake\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Jennifer Lopez Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Concerts and Tours\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Musk blasted the bill, saying it would increase the federal deficit and undermine his efforts to cut government waste while he was the head of the Department of Government Efficiency at the time.\n      \n    \n          Trump hit back at Musk, claiming he was only angry because the bill cancelled tax credits and mandates for electric vehicles, which would financially impact his company, Tesla.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The two men traded barbs on social media, insulting each other with Musk revealing that Trump was in the \"Epstein Files\" before the Department of Justice began releasing those documents.\n      \n    \n          Well, that didn't go over so well, and Trump and Musk stopped talking. But after Charlie Kirk's murder, they were seen sitting together and chatting at Kirk's memorial.

    "body": "\n\tWhen it rains reigning male pop superstars, it pours. The boys are back in town, and two of the three or four biggest guys in the recording business, Bruno Mars and Harry Styles, are coincidentally releasing albums on back-to-back weekends, as if teaming up to storm the barricades mostly held in recent years by pop’s girl bosses. So it’s interesting to see what these two alphas are bringing along as stylistic arsenals in their attempts to reassert some dominance, or at least parity. Coming next week is Styles’ intriguingly titled “Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally,” and we’ll find out soon enough whether Harry means to use the D-word there literally or just figuratively.\n\t\n\n\tBut for Mars’ first solo album in 10 years, “The Romantic,” it is as if disco never happened. It is a time machine back to the mid-1970s, just before dance music took over, with a heavy, heavy emphasis on retro-soul balladry. The album ends with a song called “Dance With Me,” but it’s a song dedicated to slow dancing, just like the surprisingly slow-simmering track that opens the album. When the pace does get upped a couple of times, it’s to bring us up to the tempo of the O’Jays, not to snap us back to the time of J. Cole. There’s not a moment on the whole nine-song collection that sounds like it was minted any more freshly than 1976. It’s already been well-established that the album’s first single (and one of its few bangers), “I Just Might,” reminds folks a little of Leo Sayer’s “You Make Me Feel Like Dancing,” which came out that year. So, truly, here, Mars is Bicentennial Man. \n\n\n\tGiven how unhappy many people are with 2026, a trip headed exactly 50 years back into the past will be a welcome ride for a lot of hitchhikers. But will you ultimately find “The Romantic” compelling as anything much more than a mood ring… er, mood piece? The best predictor for that will be how much you loved or liked “An Evening With Silk Sonic,” the similarly throwback album Mars put out with Anderson .Paak four and a half years ago. (How time flies when you’re arresting it!) Paak has moved on, but Mars is remaining committed to the bit — really, really committed. It takes some nerve, after a full decade of not putting out a solo album, when that last solo record was a Grammy winner for album of the year (“24k Gold”), to return with something that is completely beholden to styles that went out of fashion before you were born. But it’s slightly less nervy if you think of it more in terms of sticking with the formula that last brought you an album-sized smash. This is “Silk Sonic II,” for most intents and purposes. \n\t\n\n\tI am part of the target audience for “The Romantic,” as an admitted nostalgist who thinks the 1970s was a golden era for just about everything but gas lines. But I’m also not part of the target audience, inasmuch as I don’t prefer the homages to past eras to be completely hermetically sealed, without even slight nods to what has transpired since, let alone an attempt to bring them a little bit into the future. I think “The Romantic” is actually better than “An Evening With Silk Sonic,” in several quantifiable ways, including its bold emphasis on ballads, where you really get to hear Mars test what he can do with those pipes, which is a lot. And there’s something even craftier about how well he, his extremely talented co-producer, D-Mile, and his band, the Hooligans, have replicated the exact feel of a great era in record-making. But, among these two albums, it does have the disadvantage of coming second. The album is great as a stunt, but, slightly refined or not, it’s the second time in a row doing what amounts to the same stunt. You can admire his ability to reverse-engineer the cool sounds of his forefathers, but that doesn’t mean you’re going to be moved by it.\n\n\tEspecially when, once you get past admiring the encyclopedic knowledge of ’70s flourishes, you realize there’s not really much in the way of great songs here. Nearly everything sounds like a possible candidate for a followup single to “I Just Might,” but nothing jumps out as the pick. There’s actually a decent amount of sub-genre variation from song to song, but emotionally, it’s kind of a flat-line, with the most perfunctory lyrics you will hear on any album this year. There never seems to be even a remote possibility that Mars is telling us anything about his real life amid all the fill-in-the-blank cliches (“The fire don’t burn like it used to, girl”; “Let’s go to the moon a little later / Hope your wings get to fly”; “Turns out you don’t need a rocket ship, no / To find your own shooting star”). So, in the age of hyper-autobiographical pop, “The Romantic” feels weirdly and completely impersonal, unless you consider extreme pastiche a personality. It’s like a fun costume party where you never find out who actually attended. Although, to be fair, Curtis Mayfield is a hell of a mask, right?\n\t\n\n\tOne thing that’s kind of interesting, though, is a Latin current that ebbs and flows through a few pieces of the record, starting with the album cover itself, which features hand-written lettering that is meant to remind oldsters of a golden age of Chicano rock. The first couple of tracks seem to be headed toward a concept album in that direction. “Risk It All” is the aforementioned kick-off that really does feel like a bit of a risk, not just because it starts off the album on a slow, pleading note with acoustic guitar plucking and some of Mars’ most supple vocals. There are horns through a lot of the record, but in this number, they’re played as mariachi horns. (It also has arguably the album’s most vapid lyrics — “I would swim across the sea just to show you / Sacrifice my life just to hold you,” et al. — but never mind those.) He ups the Latin quotient with the tenser rhythms and strings and congas of the second track, “Cha Cha Cha”; maybe the title is a giveaway. (On the non-Latin tip, it also interpolates Juvenile’s’s 2004 “Slow Motion,” a nice combo.) But these Latin flavors turn out not to be a constant through the rest of the album. They do return in one of the most up-tempo tracks, “Something Serious,” a fairly direct cop of “Oye Como Va,” which is fun until you start thinking about how the chorus is not that special and you’d rather be listening to “Oye Como Va.”\n\n\tAfter the third number, “I Just Might,” snaps you to attention with its booty-shake-or-go-home machismo, the fourth, “God Was Showing Off,” is when it really settles into the groove where Mars is most comfortable these days, bridging the gap between Motown and Philly soul. “Why You Wanna Fight?” almost sounds like a parody of some of these genres, with a backing chorus repeatedly and dramatically cooing whyyouwannafight as a single word, in-between the singer’s more extenuated phrases. “On My Soul” and “Nothing Left” bring in some welcome electric guitar licks. Most of the tracks that follow will make you think of the kind of vintage Top 40/AC soul where it’s summertime and the listenin’ is EZ.\n\n\tOverall, it’s an album that seems designed to be background music, which is not entirely meant as an insult; there’s an art to making music that can be put on at literally almost any party and suit the tastes of grandmas as well as kids, and serve that function for a couple of years or more. But if you were planning to foreground “The Romantic,” this one may have a more limited shelf life. As a leisure suit of a record, this is not really album-of-the-year material, like “24K Magic” was. It’s not even meant to be that kind of tour de force, to be fair, but it’s also probably not meant to be quite this in-one-ear-and-out-the-other. How can vocals be as bountifully impressive as Mars’ are here and still leave you thinking that there’s no lived experience in any of the songs? \n\t\n\n\tThis really is a “romantic” album, but what’s missing is the sensation that the material has any tangible connection to actual love. Unless love for early Kool & the Gang counts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChris Hemsworth appeared on a recent episode of the “SmartLess” podcast while continuing to promote his latest movie, Amazon MGM’s “Crime 101,” and spoke honestly about his decision to move out of Los Angeles with his family during the height of his Marvel fame. Hemsworth and his wife, actor Elsa Pataky, were five years into their marriage when they decided to leave L.A. and relocate their family to Hemsworth’s home country of Australia. \n\t\n\n\t“It was right around the time my boys were born, and it was just, we kind of were set up in L.A. and not enjoying it, you know?” Hemsworth said. “Like nothing was shooting there. We were filming kind of everywhere else and then… you’d come home and paparazzi and all the sort of the trappings of, you know, living in that space.”\n\n\n\tHemsworth said moving out of L.A. was the “greatest decision,” one that did not disrupt his professional career as an actor since he was also traveling elsewhere to shoot a lot of his projects. \n\n\n\t“You know, when you come back from work, you wanna go on a holiday? Like coming home for me is — it feels like a holiday,” Hemsworth said of living in Australia. “We have a big farm and horses and motorbikes and surf.”\n\n\tThe actor’s exodus from Hollywood was years before the COVID pandemic, and Hollywood strikes even further reduced the amount of productions being shot in Los Angeles. As Variety reported last month, L.A. production days for film, TV and commercials fell 12.3% in the final quarter of 2025 compared to the previous one. That continued a downward trend that has persisted since 2022. For 2025 overall, production volume was about half what it was in 2019.\n\t\n\n\tHemsworth made his Marvel debut as Thor in 2011, two years after his Hollywood debut as George Kirk in J.J. Abrams’ 2009 “Star Trek” reboot. He had three Marvel sequels (“The Avengers,” “Thor: The Dark World” and “Avengers: Age of Ultron”) under his belt when he decided to leave L.A. for Australia. He continued to act in major Hollywood productions like 2016’s “The Huntsman: Winter’s War” and “Ghostbusters.” Hemsowrth will be back as Thor at the end of this year with December’s “Avengers: Doomsday.”\n\n\tListen to Hemsworth’s full interview on the “SmartLess” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

The rest of the cast includes Emily Watson as William’s mother, David Wilmot as his father and Joe Alwyn as Anne’s brother. The film is based on author Maggie O’Farrell’s 2020 novel of the same name.\n\n\n\t“Hamnet” is nominated for eight Oscars, including best picture, best director for Zhao, actress in a leading role for Buckley, adapted screenplay of Zhao and O’Farrell’s script, costume design, achievement in casting, original score and production design.

Discovery, leaving Paramount Skydance poised to claim victory.\n\n\tAlongside the stars, including the likes of writer/director Maggie Gyllenhaal, plus Jessie Buckley, Christian Bale and Jake Gyllenhaal, a decent crop of Warner Bros. Pictures execs — led by co-CEO Pam Abdy — were also in attendance.\n\t\n\n\tGuests noted a palpable sense of relief — a feeling that Hollywood’s most intensely fought contest in years was finally over.\n\n\tBut while the noise at the party for “The Bride!” may have been borne out of exhaustion following months of fierce back-and-forths between the teams of David Ellison, Ted Sarandos and David Zaslav, the news of Paramount’s WBD acquisition (which, as California’s attorney general noted, is still far from being a “done deal”) has sparked both optimism and concern from across the international cinema community.\n\n\tBut it’s a different concern than in the U.S., where there are fears over the rapidly consolidated media power of the Ellison family and their connections to Donald Trump. Outside the U.S., the issue isn’t political power, it’s more about bargaining power.\n\n\t“Paramount has been very supportive of windows, so for exhibition, it’s a positive,” says Clare Binns, the hugely respected British cinema veteran working at theater chain Picturehouse who on Sunday was awarded a BAFTA for her services to the industry. “But my main concern is the amount of films and the kind of films that are going to be made. The Warner Bros. slate over the last 12 months has been outstanding — all brilliant, original, bold films. I am very concerned about the merger and what it’s going to look like for the kind of films we’re going to see being made.”\n\t\n\n\tFor Tim Richards, CEO of cinema giant Vue who has been outspoken in his support for the Paramount deal, the result is certainly the most preferable of the two options.\n\n\t“It’s the best outcome for the industry,” he says. “You have a highly respected filmmaker in David Ellison, with a strong track record in theatrical releases, and I would rather have someone who has been releasing films theatrically successfully for 15 years running Warner Brothers than somebody who hasn’t.”\n\n\tOver in Germany, leading producer Martin Moszkowicz (whose credits include the “Resident Evil” franchise), asserted that further U.S. consolidation may not change the local market “overnight,” but says “fewer global decision-makers ultimately mean fewer buyers.” And for producer such as himself, this “usually translates into tougher negotiations and more centralized greenlight processes.”\n\n\tBut the Paramount deal “tilts more strongly toward a theatrical strategy — and that matters in Germany,” he says. “Warner Bros. has a very capable and successful local distribution team in place and a strong commitment to local language production, whereas Paramount’s footprint on the ground is far more limited.”\n\n\tLaura Houlgatte, CEO of Europe’s International Union of Cinemas (UNIC) that represents indie exhibitors, struck a more cautious note.\n\n\t“Our concerns remain,” she says. “We will continue to engage as discussions progress, stressing the importance of maintaining a strong and diverse theatrical slate, meaningful exclusivity periods, and appropriate marketing support.” “Our priority is to protect the long-term health of our members and ensure that robust safeguards are in place so that European cinemas can continue to thrive,” she added, noting that “This can only be achieved if any agreement is subject to the highest level of scrutiny by the relevant competition authorities, with legally binding commitments.”\n\n\tAccording to Francois Godard at research firm Enders Analysis, Paramount Skydance’s likely victory is actually not necessarily the best outcome for European theater owners.\n\n\t“Netflix was being very careful with the theatrical business and had made assurances about the theatrical window,” he says, referring to Ted Sarandos’ promise that Netflix would keep a 45-day window for theatrical runs of Warner Bros. movies. By contrast, “Paramount’s ownership of Warner Bros. means concentration on the distribution side,” Godard noted, meaning that as distributors the combined Paramount and W.B. entity “will have more leverage in negotiating with cinema owners.”\n\t\n\n\tOn the EU regulatory front, Sarandos, speaking to the BBC in London last week, said that the fact that there are sovereign funds from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar backing Paramount’s bid is a “bad idea” that could run into a regulatory hurdle.\n\n\tCould the Arab funds’ ties to Paramount and Warner Bros. be problematic in Europe?\n\n\t“It could be in the U.K.,” says Godard, noting that there is a recent precedent in which the U.K. regulator blocked a deal for RedBird Capital Partners — backed by Abu Dhabi-based International Media Investments (IMI) to buy the Telegraph Media Group.\n\n\tAnd they could also be a problem for the European regulator, he adds. However at a European Union level this potential hurdle “would be weighted in the balance of the broader trade relationship between the European Union and the United States,” Godard goes on to point out. “And we have seen last summer that the European Union is ready to make concessions to avoid a trade war.”\n\n\tFurther afield, Southeast Asian distributors are cautiously optimistic about what the WBD-Paramount Skydance deal means for their markets. “For our region, this likely means Hollywood studios will place renewed emphasis on theatrical performance and strong local distribution partnerships before moving titles into streaming ecosystems,” says Phong Duong, business director of Vietnam-based distributor Mockingbird Pictures. “That’s positive for markets like Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand, where box office remains culturally and commercially important.”\n\n\tDuong adds that the shift “may rebalance power back toward studio-driven release strategies — giving Southeast Asian distributors more room to negotiate and build value at the theatrical level rather than being bypassed by global streaming pipelines.”\n\n\t“The probably gives WBD relatively more clarity to continue growing their streaming service HBO Max deeply direct-to-consumer and with partners in Japan, Australia-New Zealand and greater Southeast Asia,” says Vivek Couto, CEO and executive director of research firm Media Partners Asia. “At the same time, strategic licensing and related partnerships can be continued with players in South Korea, India and Japan.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Indian filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, whose own work has migrated to streaming platforms, is more succinct about the broader implications: “Am all for theaters even though my films release on streaming now. This acquisition gives hope to ‘cinema in cinemas.'”\n\t\n\n\tHowever the regulatory review of the WBD-Paramount Skydance pact plays out, there’s also hope that, despite having failed in its bid for the studio, Netflix’s assessment of Warner Bros. and the pledges it made in terms of putting films in cinemas might impact its decisions moving forward.\n\n\t“I’m hopeful that, having seen the success of theatrical releases from Warner Brothers, Netflix will now look at their own pipeline of movies coming up, and hopefully we will have an opportunity of releasing some of those movies theatrically, maybe as a statement of good faith,” says Vue’s Richards.\n\n\tElsa Keslassy contributed to this piece\n",

    "body": "\n\tGhostface is back to wreak havoc at the box office with “Scream 7,” the latest entry in Paramount and Spyglass’ horror series.\n\n\tThe R-rated slasher has made a franchise-record $7.8 million in previews at the box office, beating the $5.7 million made by “Scream 6.” The new movie is on track to make between $40 million and $50 million, with some tracking services predicting it could go even higher. Seven could be the “Scream” series’ lucky number as it looks to set a franchise record for highest box office opening. The current record is held by its predecessor, 2023’s “Scream 6,” which made $44 million. An opening on the higher end would bode well for “Scream 7” after a year-long delay bumped the budget up to $45 million (“Scream 6” cost $35 million).\n\t\n\n\tAfter sitting out of “Scream 6” due to a pay dispute, franchise star Neve Campbell is back as Sidney Prescott, who must teach her daughter Tatum (Isabel May) how to survive the latest Ghostface killer attack. Courteney Cox is back as Gale Weathers, as are Jasmin Savoy Brown and Mason Gooding as Mindy and Chad Meeks-Martin from the past two “Scream” entries. Newcomers include Anna Camp, McKenna Grace, Asa Germann, Celeste O’Connor, Joel McHale, Tim Simons, Jimmy Tatro and more.\n\n\n\tMelissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, who starred as sisters in the fifth and sixth “Scream” movies, are both absent from the seventh outing. Barrera was fired after sharing a social media post accusing Israel of “genocide and ethnic cleansing” in late 2023. Shortly after, Ortega dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with her Netflix series “Wednesday.” Director Christopher Landon exited after receiving death threats over Barrera’s firing, even though he had nothing to do with Spyglass’ decision. Franchise creator Kevin Williamson took the reigns of “Scream 7,” making his directorial debut and co-writing with Guy Busick. The shake-up resulted in the seventh film getting delayed and the budget going up.\n",

    "body": "\n\tImax is undergoing a quiet but consequential strategic shift in Asia – and the numbers are beginning to make it unmistakable. \n\n\tThe premium exhibition giant delivered a record $1.28 billion in global box office in 2025, a 40% year-on-year surge, with the Asia-Pacific region alone accounting for roughly half of that total, up nearly 80% year on year. China contributed $407 million to that tally – its best-ever Imax performance, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019 by 5% – while Asia ex-China added a further $230 million, also the highest ever for that grouping. For a company that once relied almost exclusively on China to power its Asian growth story, the spread of records across markets as varied as Japan, India, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam represents a fundamental reorientation.\n\t\n\n\tGiovanni Dolci, Imax’s chief commercial officer, describes the shift plainly. The era of a single market driving the lion’s share of Imax’s theater growth is over – and that, he says, is entirely by design. Speaking to Variety, Dolci noted that when the company signed agreements for around 163 Imax locations in 2025, contributions came in a genuinely balanced way from markets across Asia-Pacific, continental Europe and beyond. Record theater-signing years in both Japan and Australia, new agreements in Germany – long a dormant territory – and multiple deals in France all contributed to what Dolci characterizes as a much more diverse and resilient growth engine.\n\n\n\t“Five years ago, if you asked me where Imax’s growth was coming from, the answer was China. Ten years ago, it was North America,” Dolci tells Variety. Now, he says, no single market dominates, and that balance is something the company actively welcomes.\n\t\n\n\tMainland China, with 797 Imax locations – the largest concentration in the world, representing nearly 44% of the company’s 1,796-strong commercial multiplex network – remains the biggest market and a critical part of the global story. The 2026 Lunar New Year holiday period offered a timely reminder of the market’s enduring power: the seven-day window delivered $28 million in Imax box office, with racing thriller “Pegasus 3” alone grossing $24 million, the strongest Imax performance for a Chinese film since last year’s animated blockbuster “Ne Zha 2.” The Imax China network captured 3.4% of the total holiday box office on less than 1% of screens. “Pegasus 3” also marks Imax’s fourth collaboration with filmmaker Han Han and will receive an exclusive North American Imax run alongside select U.K., Australian and New Zealand locations. The 2025 full year saw Imax’s China market share reach 5.5%, its highest on record.\n\n\tYet Dolci is candid that China’s role within the broader Imax narrative has evolved. Growth in the market continues, he says, but at a different pace and with a different emphasis – selectively pursuing the best new multiplex developments in high-tier cities, and increasingly exploring a newer strategy of converting existing cinemas that currently lack an Imax screen. The company struck a deal last year with its top Chinese partner Wanda specifically around that retrofit approach, placing Imax systems in established venues where the performance data justifies the investment. \n\n\tThe local language slate remains a pillar of that effort: since 2020, Imax has released 15 Chinese Filmed for Imax titles – among them “The Eight Hundred,” “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” “The Wandering Earth II,” “Decoded” and “Home Coming” – and more are in the pipeline as release schedules are confirmed. Last year, six of the top-10 Chinese Imax titles were local language productions, and the 2025 Lunar New Year alone saw Imax titles grossing over $180 million in the format’s box office. The financial impact of that shift is visible in the Imax China subsidiary’s Hong Kong-listed results: content solutions revenue – essentially box office-driven income – more than doubled from $15.5 million in 2024 to $33.9 million in 2025, driven in large part by the higher proportion of local language box office, which yields a greater take rate for the group.\n\t\n\n\tIf China is the market Imax grew up in, Japan has become the market that best illustrates how its current model works. The country delivered Imax’s highest-ever Japanese box office in 2025 at $90.7 million, beating the previous record by 23%, driven by a content mix that blended Hollywood tentpoles with a robust slate of local language titles. Five of the top-ten Japanese Imax releases last year were local productions, and “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” finished as the fourth highest-grossing Imax title globally in 2025 – a result Dolci describes as something he would not have believed possible a decade ago.\n\n\tImax now operates 62 locations in Japan, with 10 new sites opened last year alone, representing a roughly 20% footprint expansion, and agreements signed for a record 13 new and upgraded locations. The critical strategic move has been the push into suburban markets beyond Tokyo and Osaka. Dolci says the company had to first build a diverse enough local language slate to satisfy audiences outside the major metro areas before opening there. That work has paid off: the performance of the suburban openings in 2025 was, in his words, “absolutely stunning.”\n\n\tA significant milestone is also on the horizon. Imax will release its first-ever Japanese Filmed for Imax title later this year. While the project has not been publicly announced, Dolci describes it as a long-overdue step in cementing the format’s story in a market that has become, in his framing, a poster child for Imax’s virtuous cycle: more locations generate more relevance to local producers and studios, which generates more local content, which in turn draws still more interest in the format.\n\n\tIndia represents perhaps the most tantalizing long-term opportunity in Imax’s global portfolio, and also the most structurally constrained. With a population of 1.4 billion but only around 9,000 cinema screens nationally, the market is severely under-screened relative to its size – a stark contrast to China’s approximately 90,000 screens for a comparable population. Imax currently operates 35 locations in India, a network that has grown by roughly 60% over the past five years. The country posted its best-ever Imax box office in 2025 at $25.6 million, up nearly 75% from 2024, across a diverse mix of Hollywood, local and international content. Imax debuted a record 11 Indian language titles in 2025, with “Kantara A Legend: Chapter 1” finishing as the highest-grossing Indian title of the year and ranking among the all-time top 15 Imax releases in the market. International content also had its best year on record in India, with “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” becoming the highest-grossing anime title ever in the country.\n\t\n\n\tThe company’s next phase in India involves moving methodically into tier two cities, mirroring the suburban Japan playbook. Imax has historically been anchored by its partnership with PVR Inox, India’s dominant multiplex chain, but Dolci indicates the company is actively broadening its exhibitor base, with new partners Mirage Cinema and Rajhans already on board and more expected. The constraint, Dolci says, is not audience demand – the performance of existing screens more than justifies expansion – but the availability of suitable sites.\n\n\tOn the content side, India is on the cusp of its own Filmed for Imax era. Two upcoming Indian FFI titles have been confirmed: “Ramayana,” an epic production backed by Prime Focus, due around the Diwali festival this autumn, and “Varanasi,” the latest chapter in Imax’s ongoing partnership with filmmaker S.S. Rajamouli. The launch of the “Varanasi” teaser, screened in Imax format before an audience of around 50,000 at a venue in Hyderabad, offered a vivid illustration of the appetite for the format in the market. Dolci adds that further Filmed for Imax conversations are actively underway in India.\n\n\n\n\n\tAmong the most dynamic growth stories in the region are Indonesia and Vietnam, the two Southeast Asian markets that have most convincingly surpassed their pre-pandemic box office levels. In Indonesia, Imax has doubled its network from nine locations in 2022 to 18 today through a landmark deal with Cinema 21, with eight of the contracted 10 new sites already open. The market recorded its best-ever Imax performance in 2025 at over $6.5 million, with the format’s numbers outpacing overall industry trends. Vietnam similarly delivered its best-ever Imax year at $5.8 million, with a Galaxy Cinema location recently added to the network. Notably, 2025 also saw Imax’s first-ever Vietnamese-language titles – “Money Kisses” and “Hijack Siege” – with “God-Given Treasure” recently added to the programming slate. Local language horror content, a genre that resonates strongly with Indonesian audiences, is a focus for potential future Filmed for Imax productions there, with active conversations underway.\n\n\tMalaysia and Thailand also posted record Imax performances in 2025, at $9.8 million and $8.5 million respectively, with both markets expanding their footprints. Thailand’s “Death Whisperer 3” was a standout local title. Dolci singles out Vietnam and Indonesia as the top priorities in the broader Southeast Asia region.\n\t\n\n\tAustralia’s transformation has been among the most dramatic in Imax’s recent history. A little over two years ago, the company had a single operating location in the country – the Imax at the Melbourne museum. Today it has 10, with six of those opening in 2025 alone. The market delivered its best-ever Imax box office at over $12 million, with the slate of openings timed around marquee titles including an “Avatar” release that proved an ideal launch vehicle. Imax has already signed deals for 10 additional Australian locations. Dolci calls the market “enormous runway,” noting that 10 Imax screens for an entire country still benchmarks far below comparable markets.\n\n\tSouth Korea remains the one significant market in the Asia-Pacific region where Imax’s performance has not followed the broader upward trend. The country’s overall box office has deteriorated sharply, with average weekly grosses falling to levels that have perplexed exhibitors and analysts alike. Dolci declines to speculate on root causes, but is at pains to note that Imax has proven more resilient than the broader market, holding largely flat while the industry overall has taken a dip. He remains sanguine about the format’s prospects there, pointing to the CGV Yongsan location in Seoul, which consistently ranks among the top five highest-grossing Imax theaters in the world. “If you have a good offering, audiences are still responding in a positive way,” Dolci says.\n\n\tUnderpinning Imax’s multi-market momentum is a deliberate and accelerating shift in its content strategy. The company’s 2025 local language box office reached $405 million worldwide, 66% above the previous full-year record, as titles from Japan, China, India and beyond traveled further than ever before. Imax expects to expand its local language slate to 75 titles in 2026, up from 67 in 2025, reflecting a 24% compound annual growth rate since 2019. Concert films – including releases tied to acts such as the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin – have also expanded the format’s reach. The broader argument, Dolci says, is that the cinema space must continue to reinvent itself to remain relevant to new generations: drawing in someone for a concert film who might not otherwise have gone to the cinema, he reasons, makes it more likely they will return for a feature.\n\t\n\n\tOn the production front, the 2026 global slate is headlined by Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey,” for which Imax built a new generation of film cameras. Dolci confirms the title is expected to play across the large majority of Imax screens worldwide, with the usual caveats around Japan’s historically deferred release windows and China’s standard importation rules. Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Three” is also among the titles shot with Imax film cameras. Imax’s 2026 slate includes more than 12 Filmed for Imax titles. \n\n\n\n\n\tImax’s 2026 guidance calls for approximately $1.4 billion in global box office, which would represent another record, alongside 160 to 175 system installations. The company closed 2025 with a record $127 million in operating cash flow and a contracted backlog of 434 systems, more than 200 of which are concentrated across the Asia-Pacific region. \n\n\tFor Dolci, the figure from 2025 that best captures what Imax is becoming is not the global box office record but the balance behind it: a growth story drawing simultaneously from Japan and Indonesia and Australia and France and Germany, from Hollywood blockbusters and Japanese anime and Indian epics alike. “The appetite for Imax,” he says, “is really global.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe next generation of “Pokémon” has finally been revealed.\n\n\tDuring its “Pokémon Presents” 30th anniversary livestream, the company unveiled the first look at the long-awaited 10th generation, “Winds” and “Waves.” The three starter Pokémon and a look at the diverse, open world was also shown. The new games will release next year on the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\n\tThe three starters include the grass-type chick Browt, the fiery, Pomeranian-inspired Pombon and the water gecko Gecqua. In the final minutes of the presentation, the first teaser for “Winds” and “Waves” opened in an oceanfront home with a knock at the door. As it opened, two costumed Pikachu appeared, suggesting there will be some new level of customization for the electric icon. One Pikachu wore sunglasses, a white hat and floral shirt, and the other had a blue cap and matching dress on.\n\t\n\n\tThe short trailer zoomed over the unnamed region where the games take place. It looked much more expansive and detailed than the worlds we’ve seen in games like “Scarlet” and “Violet” or the recent “Legends Z-A.” There was a tropical forest with a roaming Tropius and Gloom, an ocean with a gigantic Wailord spewing water from its spout, grassy plains with Tailow flying about and a lava-filled volcano with Slugma oozing around. There were also quick looks at a massive tower floating in the water that could be some kind of gym, plus a beachside town with buildings connected by aquatic bridges. It also seemed like there was a robust day-night cycle, with different Pokémon appearing during the early morning, sunset and dusk.\n\t\n\n\tAs previously announced, “FireRed” and “LeafGreen” are coming to Nintendo Switch Online, as is the 2005 GameCube game “Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness.” The new battling game, “Pokémon Champions,” will release on the Switch in April and on mobile devices later this year.\n\n\n\n",

The payments are due on the 5th of each month starting March 5 and will continue until further order of the court.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          In addition, the docs state Denise must foot Aaron $25K in attorney's fees, plus an additional $5K that may be used for a forensic accountant. The $30K total will be paid in three $10K installments at the end of March, April and May.\n      \n    \n          The ruling stems from Aaron's October 2025 request for spousal support. Both he and Denise were sworn in and testified before the judge made the decision.\n      \n    \n          As we previously reported ... the split between the former \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" star and Phypers has been anything but amicable. The two have traded accusations over finances, income and business dealings, with disputes over who should shoulder mounting legal costs becoming a central fight in the case.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          In court docs, Ray J scoffed at Kim’s suggestion that his comments about her and her mother Kris Jenner being investigated by the feds could derail her getting her law license.\n      \n    \n          Ray J said ... “For this ever to be an issue, Kardashian must first pass the bar exam, something she admittedly has not yet done.”\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          He continued ... “Regardless, it is unclear why vague, third-party allegations from [an interview] and a Twitch stream could ever ‘jeopardize’ her legal career. It would be the underlying wrongful conduct, none of which [Kim and Kris have] denied.”\n      \n\n          Ray J said the lawsuit brought by Kim and Kris is nonsense. He points out while they deny any knowledge of a federal investigation, neither denied committing racketeering in their court declarations.\n      \n    \n          In previous court docs, Kim explained ... “It is my understanding that, before becoming an attorney, the California State Bar evaluates moral character through a comprehensive background investigation, including investigation of allegations of criminal misconduct or dishonesty.”\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          The reality mogul added, “I’m worried that I would need to address these entirely false accusations and that they might be taken seriously.”\n      \n    \n          Kris said in her recent declaration, “To say that my daughter and I are being pursued for doing something worse than Sean 'Diddy' Combs, is a horrific lie.”\n      \n    \n                    \n                          \n                                  \n      \n        \n    \n          As TMZ first reported, Kim and Kris sued Ray J for defamation in October. He responded by filing a countersuit claiming they violated a settlement agreement barring any party from talking about the sex tape. He demanded the lawsuit against him be thrown out. Both cases are ongoing.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Kim K for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      ",

Finding this strange, the photog notified Pima County sheriff’s deputies, who spoke to the man for a significant amount of time.\n      \n    \n          Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.\n      \n    \n          Entin reports they had the individual step out of the car and take a field sobriety test. Apparently, he did not perform well because it appears law enforcement arrested the man on the spot.\n      \n    \n          Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to the Pima County Sheriff’s Office for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n    \n          Story developing …\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Savannah Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Arrest\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                DUI\n              \n                          \n                Nancy Guthrie Case\n              \n                          \n                Culture\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

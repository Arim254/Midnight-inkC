    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/future-film-coalition/\">Future Film Coalition</a> has appointed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jax-deluca/\">Jax Deluca</a> as the company’s new Interim Executive Director. With this position, Deluca will help lead the FFC’s national membership launch, develop the group’s network and strategy, as well as helping to secure resources and public policy protections. </p>\n<p>\n\tDuring her tenure at the National Endowment for the Arts, Deluca oversaw more than $50 million in public investment in the arts through federal grant-making programs, spearheaded national initiatives such as the Independent Film & Media Arts Group. She previously served as the executive director of Squeaky Wheel Film & Media Arts Center, and is a current Documentary Film in the Public Interest Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Independent film sustains livelihoods nationwide, from artists to small businesses and industry workers across a diversity of skills and trades,” Deluca said in a statement. “With the Future Film Coalition, we are building a long-needed movement—one that invites the U.S. indie film sector to join forces in pushing back against market imbalances, educating policymakers, and championing policies that foster entrepreneurship and serve the public good. It is truly an honor to advance this coalition at such a critical moment.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe FFC was formed this year with the goal of uniting independent film professionals and organizations to champion efforts to secure visibility, resources, and public policy protections for the industry.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We are thrilled to have Jax join this dynamic coalition. Jax’s leadership is informed by deep field research and hands-on experience with the realities faced by those working independently in the film sector,” Jon Reiss, chair of the FFC Board of Directors, said in a statement. “Her ability to connect data, policy insight, and creative vision makes her the ideal leader for FFC’s formative stage.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/seth-rogen/\">Seth Rogen</a> has made some enemies at the Television Academy.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring a recent appearance on “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPglaLeJYaY\">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>,” “The Studio” star said he believed he was blacklisted from presenting at the Emmys after going off script while handing out an award in 2021.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I do have that theory,” Rogen said. “I presented there, I think it was, four years ago at this point, and I have not been invited back.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCOVID regulations were in full effect during the 2021 award show. Even so, Rogen recalled that the safety measures weren’t as strict as promised and that he was put in a tent with hundreds of people.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Let me start by saying there is way too many of us in this little room,” he explained. “What are we doing? They said this was outdoors. It’s not. They lied to us. We’re in a hermetically sealed tent right now. I would not have come to this. Why is there a roof?”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added, “It was true! They lied. They did lie. It said, ‘Outdoor event.’ And I had all intention of doing the dumb schtick that they had written for me, and then I showed up, and then I was like, ‘We’re in a tent. I can’t ignore this…Eugene Levy’s here! We’re gonna kill Eugene Levy? I don’t wanna do that.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tRogen said the producers were “outwardly pissed off” at him afterward.</p>\n<p>\n\tJimmy Kimmel, a three-time Emmys host, then took a jab at his guest, joking, “I checked today because I’ve hosted the Emmys quite a few times, and you are indeed banned from presenting.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve been blacklisted,” Rogen responded. “I’m like you. They’re trying to silence me. You can’t win.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite his joking resentment, Rogen admitted, “I went very off-book and made them look bad. So, I get that.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite possibly being barred from presenting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/emmy-awards/\">Emmy awards</a>, Rogen certainly hasn’t been banned from winning them. Apple TV+’s industry comedy “The Studio,” created by and starring Rogen, <a href=\"https://variety.com/lists/emmys-2025-winners-studio-penguin-severance/drama-series-4/\" target=\"_blank\">led the 2025 Emmys</a> with 13 total wins, including best comedy series and lead actor in a comedy series.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/byron-allen/\">Byron Allen</a> got his first big break at age 18 in 1979 as a standup comedian on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.” More than 45 years later, Allen is now a media mogul: But he’s still got his eyes on a late night prize.</p>\n<p>\n\tInterviewed on stage Wednesday during New York’s Advertising Week event, Allen said he’s pitching hard to land the 11:35 p.m. time slot on CBS next year after “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/\">The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</a>” ends its run. (In July, CBS announced it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cbs-cancel-late-show-stephen-colbert-financial-decision-1236464356/\">cancel “The Late Show”</a> after this current season, calling it a “financial decision.”)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“If they’re looking for a show, my hand is already up,” he told moderator Bill Carter. “50 years, I’ve been waiting for this moment. Definitely, I’m going for it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAllen’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/comics-unleashed/\">Comics Unleashed</a> With Byron Allen” currently airs on CBS at 12:35 a.m., in the timeslot most recently held by “After Midnight” (and before that, “The Late Late Show With James Corden”). It’s a low-risk endeavor for the network, since Allen pays CBS for the hour as a time buy and then sells the advertising spots himself. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m investing millions and millions of dollars to prove myself at 12:35,” he said. “I am winning the time period. If numbers matter, then we’re already winning.” (Because it’s a time buy, ratings for “Comics Unleashed” are not immediately available, so <em>Variety</em> has not yet been able to confirm that stat or which measurement he might be referring to.)</p>\n<p>\n\tCBS has not yet revealed its plans for the late night slot once Colbert’s show ends next May. Options include returning to drama reruns (“Crimetime After Primetime”), which is what CBS ran before “Late Show With David Letterman” premiered in 1993. The network could also expand local news, giving affiliates an extra half hour and perhaps plugging in reruns at midnight. Or, CBS could take Allen up on his offer and shift “Comics Unleashed” down to 11:35 or to midnight (if the network still opts to go with an hour-long local news slot at 11 p.m.). \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCurrently, “Comics Unleashed” airs as two half-hour episodes nightly: The first 30 minutes is a new episode, while the second episode is an older episode from the series’ library. “Comics Unleashed” originally shot around 233 episodes between 2006 and 2016 as a syndicated series before resuming production on new episodes for the 2025-2026 TV season on CBS.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter “The Late Late Show With James Corden” wrapped in 2023, Allen pitched the “Comics Unleashed” time buy as a stopgap for CBS in the 12:35 slot until the Eye’s replacement series, “After Midnight,” was ready to premiere in January 2024.</p>\n<p>\n\t“My whole thing was, ‘hey, we have a big opportunity here,'” Allen said. His pitch to CBS:  “‘Why would you spend $35 million on a television show at that hour? Let me provide you the show, and I will happily produce the show, and you can save that 35, 40 million, whatever it is, and put it elsewhere.’ So CBS said, ‘this makes it makes sense.’ We did a 19 week test in fall 2023. It did extremely well.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen “After Midnight” host Taylor Tomlinson decided to depart in early 2025, CBS canceled the show all together. That’s when Allen once again took over the 12:35 slot. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I said, ‘look, mathematically, you’ll never beat the show.’ At that point, we’d done about 260 episodes, which means 620 comedians have come through the show. I have 620 of the greatest comedy writers on planet Earth today. They’ve written the material. They performed it everywhere. They’ve perfected it. They come on our show. We shoot the show for close to an hour, and we cut it down to 22 minutes. Day one, I’ve always said the show has to be evergreen. That’s how I was able to put it on. No topical humor, no political humor. nothing. I don’t want anything that’s racist, sexist, anti semitic, homophobic, I don’t want to hear any of that… we have enormous support from the advertising community.”</p>\n<p>\n\tComedian-turned-mogul Allen launched his Allen Media Group 30 years ago, focusing first on syndicated fare, and then expanding into media outlets. He now owns a chain of TV stations (which is now in the process of divesting), numerous lifestyle channels, the Weather Channel and digital outlets including The Grio and HBCU Go.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe spotlight can be unforgiving — we live in a culture where society loves to elevate celebrities only to tear them down for the sheer thrill of doing so. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a>‘s newest docuseries, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/victoria-beckham/\">Victoria Beckham</a>,” helmed by “Becoming” filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nadia-hallgren/\">Nadia Hallgren</a>, audiences get an intimate look at the former pop star and fashion designer. At one point, Beckham was one of the most photographed women in the world, but she has since worked to reclaim her name and identity outside of the shadow of her footballer husband, David Beckham. A short yet intriguing series about growth, self-acceptance and determination, the docuseries explores evolution and what it means to truly be yourself.  \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Victoria Beckham” opens in late summer 2024. Beckham has been at the helm of her fashion brand for nearly two decades, but it has not been a smooth ride. Hearing from Beckham herself as well as legendary figures like Anna Wintour, Tom Ford, Donatella Versace and Beckham’s mentor, Roland Mouret, Hallgren offers a portrait of a woman who, though once famous in her own right, was relegated to the role of a sports wife and fashionista before breaking into a very volatile and unforgiving industry. Although Beckham’s penchant for style and design enabled her to build her brand, her business acumen was not up to par, resulting in significant financial mismanagement. As the series opens, Beckham is ready for a fresh start. Having climbed out of the red with a complete restructuring, proper funding and a powerhouse beauty brand, she and her team are preparing for Paris Fashion Week and the biggest and most ambitious presentation they have ever put on. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile “Victoria Beckham” primarily revolves around Beckham’s business and the preparation for the fashion show, it also briefly highlights her childhood and subsequent time in the Spice Girls. The experience, she says, changed her life, and solidified her confidence for a time. Although she briefly touches on the group’s initial breakup and eventual revival, her time as Posh Spice and her current relationships with her former bandmates aren’t truly addressed. When it comes to Beckham’s personal life, outside of her parents, husband and children, audiences hear onlyfrom her close friend, actress Eva Longoria. Instead, the series focuses on the end of Beckham’s pop career and the years that followed. Feeling lost, and putting her career on the back-burner to support her husband’s dreams and raise their children, led to a fracture in her identity, eventually prompting her to begin building a fashion house. </p>\n<p>\n\tBeckham’s ability in the fifth decade of her life to be honest and self-reflective is compelling. Our patriarchal society says beautiful women with families and wealth should feel lucky. The pop icon offers a different perspective. She is frank about harboring ambitions beyond being a wife and mother, and how her unhappiness was outwardly manifested during her years as a WAG. People often don’t consider how young the Beckhams were during their heyday, trying to build a relationship in the public eye. Now, 27 years later, the series showcases a couple who are still deeply committed, connected, and refreshingly considerate of one another. It’s a rarity in normie relationships, even more so among A-listers. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe three-episode series serves as a companion piece to Netflix’s 2023 docuseries “Beckham,” which focused on the designer’s soccer sensation husband. Though Hallgren gets unprecedented access to Beckham, and she does confront some of the heavier aspects of her story, including an eating disorder, as well as the reasons her brand nearly tanked, she avoids delving further into details, remaining instead on the fringes of these discussions. Having previously lived under the microscope at earlier stages of her life, the self-proclaimed control freak is now entirely in command of her narrative. </p>\n<p>\n\tStill, “Victoria Beckham” is highly effective in illuminating the reign of misogyny and sexism that Beckham (and her contemporaries) endured in the press, especially in the early 2000s, when the paparazzi were out of control and tabloid fodder was catnip to the public. It was a relentless scrutiny that Beckham found unbearable, and continues to taunt her even today. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, “Victoria Beckham” may not deliver exactly what audiences expect when they tune in initially. However, the narrative presented is far more thoughtful than the standard celebrity docuseries. The show allows Beckham to tell us who she is on her terms, which, even amid all of her accolades and privilege, is a formidable undertaking. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“Victoria Beckham” is now available to stream on Netflix.</em> <br /></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<em><strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong>: This story contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 6 of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/gen-v/\">Gen V</a>,” now streaming on Amazon’s Prime Video.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis week’s episode of “Gen V” Season 2 dropped a lot of news, most of which was learned during the God U students’ time in former Vought boss Stan Edgar’s (Giancarlo Esposito) “weird billionaire bunker,” as “Gen V” showrunner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/michele-fazekas/\">Michele Fazekas</a> put it to <em>Variety</em>, following their escape from Elmira.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong the top revelations during “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-boys/\">The Boys</a>” crossover cameo were: Thomas Godolkin (played by Ethan Slater) is actually the elderly burn victim in the hyperbaric chamber that God U dean Cipher (Hamish Linklater) has been caring for/abusing; Godolkin came up with The Odessa project; Marie (Jaz Sinclair) and Homelander (Antony Starr) are the only two Odessa subjects to survive the experiment; Zoe (Olivia Morandin) is safely in her adoptive grandpa Stan Edgar’s hands following the death of her mother Victoria Neuman in “The Boys” Season 4; and Marie’s long-lost sister Annabeth (Keeya King) is a supe with the power to see the future.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Cipher’s master plan — building off what Godolkin started with Odessa to then eliminate 75% of the student population at God U by targeting the weakest supes, then doing the same to the global supe community — becomes clear, Marie and Cate (Maddie Phillips) decide to head back to campus on their own in hopes that if they save Thomas Godolkin from Cipher, he will help them end Cipher’s plot and that they’ll even find a way to take out Homelander once and for all.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere, “Gen V” showrunner Fazekas breaks down the big reveal in Episode 6 and how the two remaining installments in “Gen V” Season 2 are meant to set up the upcoming fifth and final season of “The Boys,” which will premiere next year.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tMarie has proven her ability to heal to the point she was able to bring her sister back from the dead. Is this the power Cipher was trying to tap into? The end goal that he’s been trying to get her to, with her power over blood?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt is one of them. It is healing — but I would say that is a step along the way to his ultimate goal. That is not the ultimate goal. And I would differentiate between healing and resurrecting. Because I think we were careful to be like, it’s not like she’s reanimating the dead. But it is not the end of the agenda.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWas the form of death — Annabeth’s throat being slit and her bleeding out — what specifically made Marie able to heal her? Was it the bloody nature of this that allowed her to bring back her sister?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNot necessarily.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWe find out in this episode that Annabeth is herself a supe, a precog, and received Compound V. Was Annabeth part of Odessa like Marie?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo, I can safely say no. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThe reveal that Godolkin is the old burned man being kept alive by Cipher is a big lore drop. I know you and “The Boys” creator Eric Kripke said back in Season 1 that it would be possible to watch “Gen V” separate from “The Boys,” but now it really feels like we’re deep in the Vought backstory, and so it’s gonna be hard to watch the final season of “The Boys” if you haven’t seen “Gen V” Season 2.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’m not the person to ask about the next season of “The Boys,” because I really don’t know, but I doubt it. The way that I think of it and the way that Eric Kripke also thinks of it is, if you watch both shows, you will get the story on a different level than people who only watch one or the other. But we make sure you can still enjoy it and still understand the story having not seen one. Even if I’ve never seen “The Boys” before, the way they talk about Homelander, I get who Homelander is, whether or not I’ve seen. So will you get more out of watching this and then watching “The Boys”? Maybe, but it won’t be so entwined that it won’t be understandable.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat was Godolkin’s main focus and original plan here with Odessa? And why are Marie and Homelander the only ones so far to survive? What made them special?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think that’s what Cipher is trying to figure out. And part of it is just science; you do a bunch of different experiments, you try things a bunch of different ways, and some things work. The whole thing about science is, can you replicate it? I think that’s where it gets tricky, because why did it work with Homelander and Marie, but not with other things they’re experimenting on? You can go down a rabbit hole of genetics or whatever. But right now, these are the two that worked.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s a similarity — I don’t think this is spoiling — in how Marie was like a test tube baby. So was Homelander. So that is part of why it works differently with them.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAnd it was already said Annabeth specifically was not.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tCorrect. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tTalking about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/gen-v-dean-shetty-dead-cate-victoria-neuman-marie-powers-explained-the-boys-1235769694/\">Dean Shetty’s plan</a> in Season 1 versus what Cipher is trying to do here. Shetty was trying to eliminate all supes, while Cipher is trying to eliminate the weak supes. What is his goal here?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tHe wants to eliminate the weak, because it’s almost like resource control. Like, let’s get rid of the what he thinks are the stupid ones, and just focus all of our efforts on the perfect ones, on the ones that will elevate us. He is basically trying to be the supe version of Darwin. We are only going to let the fittest survive. We’re not going to waste our time and our efforts on the ones that are, what he estimates to be, dumb. And that is the theme that I really loved that came out of the season is, just because he thinks a power is dumb doesn’t necessarily mean anything, because they can still be heroes. Even the stupid powers end up making a difference, and he sort of writes them off. And that is a flaw, that’s a mistake.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIs there clarification yet at this point in the season on why Marie couldn’t feel the Compound V in Cipher?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo, there’s not. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tBut there will be?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tOh for sure. That wasn’t a mistake on our part. That was on purpose, and it’s going to make sense.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThere are two more episodes left in the season. No spoilers, but can you tease if there is going to be set up for a third season? How much longer do you see the show going when “The Boys” proper comes to an end, and then “Vought Rising” is a prequel to the series?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think there is any number of ways you could do a third season. Our task here was launching into “The Boys,” which doesn’t really mean that there wouldn’t be another season of “Gen V.” That’s what’s great about a college show —everyone’s always going to college! But our task was launch us into the new season of “The Boys.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“Dark Winds” star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jessica-matten/\">Jessica Matten</a> has joined the cast of historical indie drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/standing-bear/\">Standing Bear</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMatten will play Bird Song, the wife of Chief Standing Bear. She joins Chaske Spencer, who leads the project in the title role.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew Troy, who is part Chiricahua Apache, is set to direct the film along with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jim-sheridan/\">Jim Sheridan</a> (“My Left Foot”).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film tells the story of the Ponca Tribe’s harrowing forced removal on the Trail of Tears and the landmark 1879 trial of Standing Bear v. Crook, which secured recognition of Native Americans as “persons” under U.S. law — a precedent-setting civil-rights victory too often absent from American history books.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the synopsis, Matten will portray the historically identified Zazette (Susette) Primeau, daughter of Lone Chief/Antoine Primeau — wife of Ponca Chief Standing Bear, a central witness to her people’s ordeal during the forced removal of 1877. “A woman of quiet authority, she stood at the seam between homelands and exile, family grief and national awakening, helping carry a private promise into public history,” the synopsis says.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe screenplay written by Troy and Sheridan is based on the best-selling book “I Am a Man” by Joseph Starita.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe production is spearheaded by Troy Entertainment, in association with Sheridan’s Hell’s Kitchen Limited, and longtime Anonymous Content president Paul Green. René Haynes, whose credits include “Killers of the Flower Moon” and “Wind River,” is the film’s casting director.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film has garnered wide-ranging institutional and bipartisan governmental support, including endorsements from the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, the Tyonek Native Corporation, the Athabascan Tribe, the State of Nebraska, U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts, Governor Jim Pillen, and former Nebraska State Senators Burke Harr (Democrat) and Colby Coash (Republican) who have both joined the production as executive producers. Production is scheduled to begin in February.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Ponca Tribe is developing a Standing Bear Museum and cultural center in Niobrara, at the site of its traditional homelands and the film’s shooting location.</p>\n<p>\n\tMatten is repped by M88, Spencer by CESD, Troy by The Gersh Agency, and Sheridan is repped by WME.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIs the primary audience for “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ozzy-no-escape-from-now/\">Ozzy: No Escape From Now</a>” metalheads … or caregivers? There’s not often a significant crossover audience there. But there’s no mistaking that the Paramount+ documentary about the rocker’s final years is mostly somber stuff, focused more on his pain, frailty and depression than on the few moments when he is convinced to go into entertainer mode, as best he can. The “Diary of a Madman” singer is much more of a sad man in director Tania Alexander’s fairly unflinching portrait of a legendary musician grappling with a diminishing quality of life as his body finds new ways to fail him. Fans expecting something more overtly uplifting may need to buckle up.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s clear that when Alexander and her team began filming on the doc four years ago, there was some expectation or at least a hope of finding a story that would end with Osbourne rising up and overcoming his afflictions. But his followers may be surprised to learn — and probably Alexander was, too — that however bad his public thought Ozzy might have been doing as he rescheduled and then canceled gigs, he was actually doing a little bit worse than that. There’s not any whitewashing going on here as the singer’s physical condition goes from bad to worse as filming goes on in period visits over the last four years. It can be a tough watch, seeing someone who has been such an avatar of maniacal fun confessing that his pain is so chronic, he has moments of wanting it all to just end.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt times it does seem like the audience that is most likely to find “No Escape From Now” worth all the frustration and sorrow may be family members who have loved ones dealing with similar issues of creeping decrepitude. But eventually, in the second hour, the film does settle into “fun” mode, or as close as it’s going to get, as the tired and somewhat reluctant star gets nudged toward activities that will bring him moments of respite. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are all-star recording sessions with his greatest cheerleader, producer Andrew Watt, for what turns out to be a final album, 2022’s “Patient Number 9.” In 2024, he shows up for his even starrier Rock & Roll Hall of Hame induction as a solo artist, with Jack Black infectiously leading the cheer squad. And, of course, in July of this year, Osbourne actually roused himself to sing — from a throne — at a massively publicized and televised farewell concert in his native Birmingham, just three weeks before he died. Just how happy that counts as an ending will be in the eye of the beholder, but it’s happier than some of the earlier passages, where he seems ready to resign himself to a downhill slope, out of the public’s eye.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlong with anything else, this is effectively the two-hour series finale of “The Osbournes,” with a lot less madcap fun and repartee. It’s also a very flattering portrait of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/sharon-osbourne/\">Sharon Osbourne</a> — and of course it would be, with her as one of the executive producers — but credibly flattering. It’s hard for a viewer to know for sure if the subject’s wife is as even-tempered, patient and supportive off-camera as on. Still, the tenderness between the two of them, as they become somewhat long-suffering together, sure feels real, as she settles even further into the role of motivational coach for a husband who has very good reasons for feeling like he doesn’t want to get out of bed, let alone do physical therapy. If they gave an Emmy for “best supporting,” leaving off the actress part, you might say she merits it here. And while it seems that Ozzy is being hamstrung by some of the same issues that can befall anyone at his time of life, it’s clear not everyone has a navigator like this to help make a way through it. He’s gotten both the short end and the long end of the stick.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for what got Osbourne to the sorry state shown in some of these scenes, that’s a sad story that involves what the family insinuates is medical malpractice. If true, it’s a bracing reminder that not even great wealth necessarily brings a correct diagnosis or treatment at every turn. The litany of the singer’s setbacks almost requires a road map: In October 2018, in the middle of a two-year tour, he was forced to cancel everything after getting a staph infection in his neck and a compromised immune system. Four months later, he had a fall, “and that was it,” as Sharon tells it, for his future health. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe doc shows footage of Osbourne happily bopping around in his bed before going in for surgery, with the contention that he came out far worse than he came in — “having posture like fucking Gollum,” as daughter Kelly puts it. The family’s position is that the surgery was “overly aggressive,” with a different surgeon saying he can’t undo all the damage … leading to the crushing realization that, with some calamities in life, there are no do-overs.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I was getting ready to fucking off myself at some point,” Osbourne says, describing a pain that never leaves him, but “knowing me, I’d half do it and I’d be half dead … I’d fucking set myself on fire. I mean, I wouldn’t die. That’s my luck.” It is a big step forward to get from this mindset to at least being willing to force himself to go back to work, in very slight dribs and drabs, in a way that seems to offer at least a bit of replenishment. But the sight you may most remember from “No Escape From Now” is a scene from that farewell concert in July, half-backstage and on-stage. Osbourne steps onto a riser, looking like a defeated man … and then, a few seconds before coming into public view of his final audience, breaks into his trademark Looney Tunes grin. The abrupt, forced transition is a little bit sad, but we can sure hope that the adoration of 100,000 ultimately turned into a moment of real joy for him.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you’re a big Ozzy fan, you probably already love him for being brave enough to go out and meet his public one last time, against what we can now see from this film were nearly all odds. But the greater bravery might have been going on camera repeatedly for this doc, and allowing himself to convey that old age is not for the faint-hearted, even as it renders you fainter of heart. That truth feels at least as cathartic, in its own gallows-wisdom way, as a big farewell party.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNBC will air a special episode of “The Tonight Show” on Friday featuring an extended cut of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-fallon/\">Jimmy Fallon</a>‘s recent interview with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tSwift appeared on “The Tonight Show” on Monday in promotion of her 12th studio album “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-life-of-a-showgirl/\">The Life of a Showgirl</a>.” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-explains-why-shes-not-playing-super-bowl-halftime-fallon-1236541829/\">As reported by <em>Variety</em></a>, Monday’s broadcast excluded portions of the interview that were later posted online. On Friday, NBC will air those moments in place of Fallon’s interviews with the other guests who appeared on Monday’s episode.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong the segments to be featured is Swift’s explanation of why she isn’t playing the Super Bowl halftime show in 2026. (Roc Nation recently announced Bad Bunny as the headliner.) \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Jay-Z has always been very good to me — our [business] teams are really close,” she said to Fallon about the Roc Nation founder. “They sometimes will call and say, ‘How does she feel about — And that’s not, like, an official offer or a conference-room conversation, more: ‘How does she feel about it in general?’”</p>\n<p>\n\t“And we’re always able to tell him the truth, which is that I am in love with a guy who does that sport on that actual field,” she explained, referring to her fiancé Travis Kelce, who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs. “Like, [professional football] is violent chess. That is gladiators without swords. That is dangerous. I am, [for] the whole season, locked in on what that man is doing on the field. Can you imagine if he’s out there every single week, putting his life on the line, doing this very dangerous, very high-pressure, high-intensity sport, and I’m like, ‘I wonder what my choreo should be? I think we should do two verses of “Shake It Up,” into “Blank Space,” into “Cruel Summer,” that would be great!’”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Tonight Show” is executive produced by Lorne Michaels, with producers including Gerard Bradford and showrunner Chris Miller.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tOn his late-night talk show Tuesday night, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> pressed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/aziz-ansari/\">Aziz Ansari</a> for performing at the controversial, state-sponsored <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/riyadh-comedy-festival/\">Riyadh Comedy Festival</a> in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This is something that’s become a big part of the news because people, a lot of comedians especially, are very upset, because the people who paid the comedians to come to this are not good people. It’s a pretty brutal regime. They’ve done a lot of horrible, horrible things,” Kimmel said of the Islamic regime led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“People are questioning why you would go over there and take their money to perform in front of these people,” Kimmel added. “I’m curious as to why you decided to do that.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnsari said the decision to perform at the Riyadh Comedy Festival was “something I put a lot of thought into,” and he sought out advice from his aunt who used to live in Saudi Arabia. </p>\n<p>\n\t“There’s people over there that don’t agree with the stuff that the government’s doing, and to ascribe like the worst behavior of the government onto those people, that’s not fair,” Ansari said. “Just like there’s people in America that don’t agree with the things the government is doing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel agreed that “we’re doing horrible things over here” in the United States, but he pushed back on Ansari’s comparison. “They murdered a journalist. These are not good people over there,” Kimmel said, in reference to the 2018 state-sponsored murder of reporter Jamal Khashoggi. </p>\n<p>\n\tAnsari defended himself by saying, “I was just there to do a show for the people.” He added: “Whenever there’s repressive societies like this, they try to keep things out — whether it’s rock and roll music or blue jeans — because it makes people curious about outside ideas, outside values. And this is a very young country, like half the country is under the age of 25, and things can really change. And to me, a comedy festival felt like something that’s pushing things to be more open and to push a dialogue.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe continued, “You kind of have to make a choice of whether you’re going to isolate or engage. For me, especially being me and looking the way I do and being from a Muslim background, it felt like something I should be a part of. And I hope it pushes things in a positive direction.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKimmel is far from the first comedian to publicly raise skepticism about the Riyadh event, which runs from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9 and also featured Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Pete Davidson and many more American comedians on its lineup.</p>\n<p>\n\tMarc Maron was one of the first comics to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/global/marc-maron-human-rights-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236530044/\">criticize the Riyadh Comedy Festival</a>, quipping on his podcast: “I mean, the same guy that’s gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a fucking suitcase.” Shane Gillis said he took a “principled stand” and turned down a “significant bag” to perform. (Sources told <em>Variety</em> that comedian paydays ranged from mid-six-figures up to $1.6 million for one show.)</p>\n<p>\n\tAtsuko Okatsuka revealed on X that she declined an offer to perform at Riyadh Comedy Festival, writing: “The money is coming straight from the Crown Prince, who actively executes journalists, [people with non-lethal] drug offenses, bloggers, etc w/out due process.” She included screenshots of an offer letter including an alleged <a href=\"https://x.com/AtsukoComedy/status/1971705973288153310\" target=\"_blank\">“content restrictions” section</a> meant to prohibit comedians from joking about the Saudi government, legal system or religious customs.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid Cross <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/david-cross-slams-bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236534601/\">penned a statement</a> slamming his comedy colleagues who participated in the festival, writing: “How can any of us take any of you seriously ever again? All of your bitching about ‘cancel culture’ and ‘freedom of speech’ and all that shit? Done. You don’t get to talk about it ever again. By now we’ve all seen the contract you had to sign.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, many high-profile comedians have defended their decision to play the festival. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/bill-burr-defends-riyadh-comedy-festival-backlash-1236536805/\">Burr called it</a> “one of the top three experiences I’ve had,” saying “the royals loved the show.” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/louis-ck-riyadh-comedy-festival-positive-thing-backlash-1236540316/\">C.K. said it was a “good opportunity”</a> and “comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/dave-chappelle-saudi-arabia-riyadh-festival-free-speech-1236537335/\">Chappelle quipped</a> onstage in Saudi Arabia that “It’s easier to talk here than it is in America.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch Kimmel and Ansari’s conversation below.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JQUUNFGgls?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>",

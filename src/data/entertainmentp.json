    "body": "\n\tNone of the major studios elected to debut a film in wide release this Halloween weekend, ending what was already a quiet October box office on a down note. No feature is expected to even sniff a gross in the eight-digits, which hasn’t happened since the debut of “Novocaine” back in March. Among the newcomers, Netflix has a second theatrical engagement of “KPop Demon Hunters” — this time with AMC Theatres, the world’s largest exhibitor chain, on board — while Focus Features is expanding its acclaimed conspiracy thriller “Bugonia” after a limited bow.\n\t\n\n\tBut first place looks to go to the third outing of Universal and Blumhouse’s horror film du jour “Black Phone 2,” which earned $2.3 million on Friday and is projecting a third weekend gross of $7.6 million, down just 41% for the seasonally appropriate holiday weekend. The North American total is forecast for $61 million through Sunday, pacing a touch behind the original 2022 “Black Phone” ($62.4 million through 17 days).\n\n\n\tParamount’s “Regretting You” is looking at second, earning another $1.2 million on Friday and headed to a second weekend gross of $6.6 million for a 51% drop from its opening. Total domestic gross looks to hit $26 million through Sunday for the Colleen Hoover adaptation.\n\n\tSony and Crunchyroll’s “Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” technically got second on Friday, but is expected to drop more sharply as the weekend goes on. The R-rated actioner, which delivered a No. 1 opening last frame, earning $1.3 million on Friday and is expecting a $5.5 million three-day haul, which would be down 69% — a standard drop for anime, which is typically frontloaded by fans at the box office. Total domestic gross will surpass $30 million through Sunday.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters” is back in 2,890 locations for a three-day engagement. The animated smash — the streamer’s most watched feature ever on its platform — had a two-day bow back in late August, where it technically ranked as the No. 1 release of the weekend with earnings estimated at $19 million. But the theatrical averse Netflix did not report grosses then and, barring a sudden change in policy, it won’t now either. This new release isn’t expected to pull in the same crowds as the prior one.\n\n\tMeanwhile, “Bugonia,” a remake of the 2003 Korean film “Save the Green Planet!” from Universal’s specialty label Focus, is expanding into 2,043 locations after opening in 17 theaters last frame. The feature, which re-teams director Yorgos Lanthimos with his Oscar-winning “Poor Things” star Emma Stone, scored strong reviews and awards buzz out of its Venice Film Festival premiere in August. It earned $1.8 million on Friday and is projecting a $4.4 million three-day haul. The R-rated film earned a so-so “B” grade from moviegoer pollster Cinema Score, though it isn’t exactly intended as a crowdpleaser. Focus is aiming for the long haul.\n\n\tAlso out, Universal is re-releasing “Back to the Future” in 2,275 locations for the Robert Zemeckis classic’s 40th anniversary. The reissue comes with some Imax showtimes. The film earned $1.5 million across previews and Friday, with projections for a $3.9 million three-day.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe long-awaited collab between Fortnite and “The Simpsons” launches Saturday with a month-long season. As “Fortnite crashes into Springfield,” they’ll take part in an 80-player “Springfield Island,” where Fortnite promises “a fast-paced, back-to-basics Battle Royale experience.”\n\n\t“The Simpsons” gameplay will switch up each week during November. The show-themed “Springfield Battle Pass’ includes outfits such as Homer, Marge and Ned Flanders, as well as “Simpsons” versions of Fortnite characters: Blinky Fishstick and Springfielder Peely. (The skins are also reported to have alt versions, such as Evil Homer and Witch Marge from “Treehouse of Horror.”)\n\t\n\n\tThe battle pass also includes the first of Fortnite’s “Sidekicks,” which were announced on Friday: Peels, which is unlockable in the Springfield battle pass and the exclusive sidekick until more arrive on November 7 in the shop.\n\n\n\tThe cel-shaded “Springfield Island” will feature locations familiar to “The Simpsons” fans, like Krusty Burger, the Kwik-E-Mart, Moe’s Tavern, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Mr. Burns’ mansion, the Simpsons’ home and more.\n\n\tMeanwhile, four original “The Simpsons” shorts will premiere — once a week, starting Nov. 1 — serving as a preview of the week’s gameplay narrative and map updates. The shorts will appear on Fortnite’s social channels, as well as its “quests” tab (under “animated shorts”) and also run on Disney+. Co-produced by Epic Games and Gracie Films, the episode titles are “Apocalypse D’oh” (Nov. 1), “Sugar High” (Nov. 10), “Multiplidiocy” (Nov. 17) and “The Incredible Bulk” (Nov. 24). \n\t\n\n\t“The Simpsons” game play will also be found in Fortune’s Delulu this weekend, and the Rocket League x “The Simpsons” limited time event includes challenges that unlock in-game rewards. The Rocket League challenges, which end on Nov. 17, features players driving around Springfield that unlock items like the Blinky Topper, the Homer’s Hedges Player Banner, Waste Wheels and more! An unlimited challenge awards 20,000 XP each time.\n\n\tTimed to the launch of Fortnite x “The Simpsons,” this Sunday’s episode will feature “a special nod” to Fortnite, the company said.\n\n\t“The Simpsons” owner Disney last year invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite developer Epic Games. As part of the deal, Disney announced plans to create a universe there with IP including Disney, Pixas, Marvel, “Star Wars,” “Avatar” and more franchises. The project is powered by Epic Games’ Unreal Engine.\n",

Disney+ will premiere Marvel’s summer blockbuster “Fantastic Four: First Steps,” and it’s sure to be on a loop for comic book movie fans as there are no additional Marvel movies on the theatrical release calendar for the rest of the year. “Freakier Friday,” featuring the return of Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis 22 years after the first movie, is also debuting on Disney+ this month.\n\n\tNetflix is keeping its Oscar season going this November with the streaming premieres of “Frankenstein,” Guillermo del Toro’s passion project that stars Oscar Isaac as the mad scientist and Jacob Elordi as the tormented monster, Richard Linklater’s French New Wave love letter “Nouvelle Vague” and “Train Dreams,” an understated indie drama that is quietly becoming one of Netflix’s strongest best picture contenders.\n\n\tFor the A24 crowd, the beloved indie studio’s continued partnership with HBO Max means two buzzy summer titles, “Materialists” and “Eddington,” will hit the Warner Bros.

Julia Garner also stars as The Silver Surfer alongside Ralph Ineson as Galactus and Paul Walter Hauser as Harvey Elder/Mole Man.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFrankenstein (Nov. 7 on Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGuillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” arrives on Netflix with strong reviews and Oscar buzz. A passion project from the Oscar-winning filmmaker, del Toro adapts Mary Shelley’s iconic novel with Oscar Isaac as the eponymous mad scientist and Jacob Elordi as his misunderstood creature. At TIFF, the film came in as the runner-up for the fest’s coveted people’s choice award — an accolade that’s traditionally a key bellwether for the Oscar race. The supporting cast includes Mia Goth and Christoph Waltz. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMaterialists (Nov. 7 on HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA24 scored an indie box office hit with “Materialists,” Celine Song’s romance movie that crossed the $100 million mark at the worldwide box office over the summer. Headlined by Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal, the film centers on a New York City matchmaker caught in a love triangle between her deadbeat ex-flame and a millionaire new guy. Variety gave the film a positive review, writing: “It’s a sharp and serious social romantic drama full of telling observations about the way we live now, and about how connected that is (or not) to the way we’ve always lived. And there’s a dark side to it. It’s ‘Sex and the City’ filtered through a sobering reality check.” \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFreakier Friday (Nov. 12 on Disney+)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tExpect “Freakier Friday” to be a popular streaming choice on Disney+ all holiday season long. The sequel to the 2003 comedy classic once again stars Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis as a daughter and mother who swap places, but this time the women find themselves swapping with the daughter and soon-to-be daughter in law of Lohan’s character. “The movie winds up being rather touching,” wrote Variety‘s film critic Owen Gleiberman in his review. “It’s all about how Harper and Lily, in trying to break up their parents’ engagement, discover that they really do want to be sisters.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEddington (Nov. 14 on HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAri Aster’s “Eddington” struggled at the box office with nearly $14 million worldwide, but the dark comedy is sure to gain more traction when it debuts on HBO Max this month. Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone and Austin Butler, the movie is set in a small New Mexico town come undone by politics, COVID and more. “Just when you think you’ve got ‘Eddington’ pinned down as a coherent and even conventional suspense tale, the movie wriggles out from under you and enters a terrain of stranger things,” writes Variety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman in his review. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Roses (Nov. 20 on Hulu)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Searchlight Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBenedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman lead Jay Roach’s reimagining of the 1989 black comedy “The War of the Roses.” The film follows Ivy (Colman) and Theo (Cumberbatch), a seemingly perfect California couple with successful careers, great kids and a loving marriage.

Shot on 35mm film in black-and-white, the film stars Guillaume Marbeck as Jean-Luc Godard, Aubry Dullin as Jean-Paul Belmondo and Zoey Deutch as New Wave darling Jean Seberg. Linklater’s movie depicts the young Godard as a film critic, as a friend to other New Wave filmmakers such as Francois Truffaut and Jacques Rivette and as a director whose relationships with Seberg and Belmondo gave birth to one of cinema’s most iconic touchstones. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIn Your Dreams (Nov. 14 on Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe Netflix animated movie “In Your Dreams” features the voices of Craig Robinson, Simu Liu and Cristin Milioti.

The Boxer is always rankled and always on guard, with eyes that seem to dart and search for opportunity. He has a suppressed hunger within him, and tight facial muscles that speak to a rough upbringing.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFire And Water: Making The Avatar Films (Nov. 7 on Disney+)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Fire and Water: Making the Avatar Films” will premiere Nov. 7 exclusively on the streaming service Disney+.

    "body": "\n\tAnyone who has seen her seething Oscar-nominated performance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Phantom Thread” knows that Lesley Manville can be hard as nails on screen — though it’s a register the British veteran tends to play only in support, as her larger showcase roles, from “Another Year” to “Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,” usually put more fragile vulnerability to the fore. That “Winter of the Crow” places her front and center as a tough, resourceful protagonist in testing circumstances is reason enough to value Kasia Adamik‘s taut, frostbitten Cold War thriller, though the film’s pleasures extend beyond that one key casting coup.\n\t\n\n\tThe premise, on the face of it, is a familiar one, in line with dozens of political thrillers about hapless outsiders caught up in webs of systemic corruption. The setting is Warsaw in the winter of 1981, when Poland was placed under martial law by its communist government in an attempt to quash the rising pro-democratic Solidarity movement. Trapped in the process is Joan Andrews (Manville), a respected British psychology professor visiting the city’s university for a guest lecture on the very weekend of this seismic turn of events — though she’s not in any way a political player, her accidental witness status and potential access to foreign media place a major target on her back.\n\n\n\tA brisk, brittle type, married to her work and shown being somewhat high-handed with her colleagues in a brief, London-set preamble, Andrews takes early signs of disorder and unrest in Poland as a personal affront. When her luggage fails to turn up at Warsaw airport, she takes out her irritation on Alina (an excellent Zofia Wichlacz), the sharp young student and activist assigned as her assistant for the duration of her visit. Alina again takes the blame when Andrews’ lecture that evening is rowdily disrupted by Solidarity student protesters: Revolution is little more than an inconvenience to the outsider, whose intellectual concerns don’t extend to the political landscape of the country hosting her. Before the weekend is out, however, she’ll be forced to pay more attention.\n\t\n\n\tPut up for the night not in a hotel but in a drab high-rise apartment belonging to Alina’s parents — another point of annoyance — the piqued professor is instructed to await a morning pickup by Alina’s brother, though he never arrives. Instead, she happens to witness and photograph a murder by the police, and narrowly escapes with her own life. Suddenly on the run, with no papers and her minders either dead or gone AWOL, Andrews must navigate her way to safety through a strange, blizzard-hit city suddenly under violent new management, with little way of telling friend from foe. Even a British ambassador, played with oily unreadability by the ever-welcome Tom Burke, isn’t quite as straightforwardly comforting as you’d hope.\n\n\tIt’s a nervy waking nightmare, with our heroine’s disorientation emphasized by the grainy charcoal textures of Tomasz Naumiuk’s cinematography and Aleksandra Kierzkowska’s superb, nicotine-stained production design — which combine to make early-Eighties Warsaw a scruffy Brutalist labyrinth in which even the right turns feel like wrong ones. The brutal December winter, meanwhile, earns its title billing, bearing down on the action with tangibly clammy force, shortening breath and tempers alike.\n\n\tAdapting a short story by Polish Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk, Adamik and co-writers Lucinda Coxon and Sandra Buchta keep the action driving and urgent, and the characterisation spare — pretty much every figure here holds some degree of mystery, and that extends to Andrews herself, whose full capabilities (as well as previously hidden reserves of empathy) only emerge under extreme pressure. \n\n\tManville carries the film with an air of increasingly raw determination, the professor’s entitlement and irritability giving way to unblinking self-preservation instincts when required. It’s bracing to see the star at the centre of a story that would more commonly take the form of a wrong-man noir; like Emma Thompson in another frostily title thriller this year, “Dead of Winter,” she demonstrates the underestimated power of a woman who’s lived long enough to weather the cold.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Lawrence appeared on “The Interview” podcast from The New York Times as part of her “Die My Love” press tour and got honest about her newfound resistance to talking to the press about politics. The Oscar winner was outspoken against Donald Trump during his first administration as U.S. president, notably writing an op-ed after Election Day in which she declared that Trump’s victory meant “the only people that feel safe [in America], that their rights are recognized and respected, are white men.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked by “The Interview” host Lulu Garcia-Navarro about her thoughts on speaking out now regarding Trump and politics, Lawrence answered: “I don’t really know if I should. The first Trump administration was so wild and just how can we let this stand? I felt like I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off. But as we’ve learned, election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for. So then what am I doing? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart. We are so divided.\n\n\n\t“I think I’m in a complicated recalibration because I’m also an artist,” Lawrence continued. “With this temperature and the way things can turn out, I don’t want to start turning people off to films and to art that could change consciousness or change the world because they don’t like my political opinions. I want to protect my craft so that you can still get lost in what I’m doing. And if I can’t say something that’s going to speak to some kind of peace or lowering the temperature or some sort of solution, I don’t want to be a part of the problem. I don’t want to make the problem worse… You watch these actors’ faces who have had incredible careers and made incredible contributions and then one half of the internet doesn’t want to see their face anymore. I get so upset for those people and it feels so wrong.”\n\t\n\n\tLawrence noted thats he’s able to get across her political beliefs via her work, such as the movies she’s making at her production company. These projects include “Bread and Roses,” which follows three women in Afghanistan amid the effects of the 2021 Taliban offensive, and the abortion documentary “Zurawski v Texas.”\n\n\t“I try to express my politics through my work,” she noted. “A lot of movies coming out from my production company are expressions of the political landscape and that’s how I feel like I can be helpful.” \n\n\tShe then quipped when asked if she regretted how she’s handled speaking out in the past: “Probably? I regret everything I’ve ever done or said. I’m going to take the zip drives out of all of these cameras when I leave. The second term feels different. Because he said what he was going to do. We knew what he did for four years. He was very clear. And that’s what we chose.”\n\n\tLawrence’s press tour for “Die My Love” has largely been defined by her blunt reflections on her career and how the public turned against her brash personality and outspokenness. She told Vanity Fair in 2021 that she took a two-year break from Hollywood because “everybody had gotten sick of me. I’d gotten sick of me.” In a recent interview with The New Yorker, Lawrence admitted that she understood why the public “rejected” her  personality because she actually was “annoying” in old interviews. She expanded on the topic during her chat on “The Interview.”\n\n\t“As horrified as I am at some things — like an old interview or something, so cringe — I get it. I was young and nervous and defensive and awkward,” Lawrence told Garcia-Navarro. “I remember when I was nominated for ‘Silver Linings Playbook,’ somebody was like: ‘Everybody loves you! What does that feel like?’ I was like: It feels precarious. It’s going to come down. That’s just the nature of things. And then I fell getting my Oscar, and the next year I was waving to fans and I tripped on a cone and I remember being like: “[Expletive], that’s it. Nobody’s gonna believe that I fell two years in a row… everybody thought that meant everything that I did was fake and it was all a shtick. This is how it felt to me. That I got found out as this fraud.”\n\n\tLawrence explained that she grew sick of herself in part because “I was just sick of doing this,” referring to the grueling press tour cycle. \n\t\n\n\t“Doing interviews is really scary. I’m very blessed, I’m very lucky, I’m very grateful. But it’s terrifying,” Lawrence said. “You finish an interview or you’re gearing up to release a film and you’re putting yourself out there to be picked apart. I was just so tired of being quoted and people talking about the quotes, so tired of seeing myself in that way. I needed a break from it. People needed a break from it. It was a mutual breakup.”\n\n\tWhen “The Interview” host noted that Lawrence appears “a lot more reserved” than she used to be in press interviews, the actor noted: “I’ve also grown up. And yeah, I’m a lot more nervous about whatever I say publicly. I don’t want to give an interview that’s a bunch of sound bites and a word salad. I don’t think that’s interesting and it would feel so inauthentic and not like what I’m here to do. So I’m trying to strike that balance.”\n\n\tMubi is releasing “Die My Love” in theaters Nov. 7.

    "body": "\n\tCan Pat McAfee help Disney prevail over YouTube TV in TV’s never-ending carriage wars? \n\n\tDisney’s ESPN said it would make one of its most popular sports telecasts, “College GameDay,” widely available via the X social-media platform as the entertainment conglomerate grapples with a blackout of its networks on YouTube TV, one of a growing number of carriage battles traditional entertainment companies are having with the increasingly popular content distributor.\n\t\n\n\t“We understand the frustration that some fans are feeling about missing out, so we are making this gesture with them in mind,” Disney said in a statement. ESPN has broadcast “College GameDay” on Saturday mornings during the football season since 1987.\n\n\n\t“College GameDay” is one of ESPN’s veteran hits, a show that has long enjoyed advertising support from The Home Depot and that has been turbo-charged in recent years by the addition of maverick sports host Pat McAfee. Indeed, on X, the broadcast will appear via McAfee’s feed. Fans may also find the telecast at ESPN’s mobile app. In both cases, fans can watch the show without having to rely on a subscription to a cable or satellite company, or other means of video distribution, to gain access.\n\n\tESPN said on Tuesday that last week’s broadcast generated 2.5 million viewers between 9 a.m. and noon, and 3.2 million viewers in its final hour after 12 p.m. The broadcast, ESPN said, was its most-watched ninth-week broadcast ever.\n\n\tDisney may have hopes of spurring sports fans who are YouTube TV subscribers to find their match-ups in other fashion. ESPN earlier this year launched a new streaming service that makes all the content from its portfolio of channels available to people who don’t subscribe in traditional fashion — a reversal after years of trying to get consumers to keep old-school ESPN. Disney also makes content from other networks available on Disney+ and Hulu by various methods.\n\t\n\n\tThe economics of sport are no game to companies like Disney. The company and many of its rivals — including NBCUniversal, Amazon Prime Video, Fox, Paramount GLobal and Netflix — are investing increasing amount of money to offer sports more widely and in more prominent fashion. The match-ups represent the one programming format that continues to attract the large, live audiences that advertiser crave in an era when more consumers are gravitating to streaming their video favorites at moments of their own choosing.\n\n\tYouTube TV removed Disney’s networks late on October 30, after the two sides could not come to terms on a renewal that would keep ABC, ESPN and other Disney properties on the internet TV service. The main sticking point is price — Disney is asking for rate hikes that Google isn’t willing to agree to. At the same time, Google has been trying to push TV companies to accept new tiers of programming that could result in some subscribers opting to drop receiving certain networks.\n\n\tYouTube TV has said that if Disney’s channels remain unavailable for “an extended period of time,” it will offer subscribers a one-time $20 credit. YouTube TV’s base subscription plan costs $82.99 per month.\n\n\tDisney is the latest in a series of media companies to square off with Google over YouTube TV in recent months. Others that have fought with the company include Paramount Global (now Paramount Skydance), Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal. Each of those reached a new deal without a blackout albeit some did so with some frenzied moments as deadlines loomed. YouTube TV dropped Univision and other TelevisaUnivision-owned networks at the end of September after the two sides could not reach a new agreement — and those outlets remain sidelined from the Google service.\n\n\t–Todd Spangler contributed to this story\n\n\tMore to come….\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you’ve ever wondered what happened to Alice after she grew up and left Wonderland, or had a sneaking suspicion that the Lewis Carroll fantasy takes place in the same universe as “Peter Pan,” the new musical stage play “Alice in Neverland” will answer your queries and confirm your intuitions.\n\n\tThe tuner, featuring book, music and lyrics by Phil Kenny and Reston Williams and directed by Catie Davis, takes place between the events of “Alice in Wonderland” and “Peter Pan.” It follows a grown-up Alice who, bored and disillusioned with adulthood, escapes to Neverland to try and recapture her childlike vivacity. As the lines between reality and fantasy start to blur, though, the wish to never grow up takes on dangerous new meanings.\n\t\n\n\t“Alice In Neverland” will host an invite-only industry presentations at New York’s New 42 Studios on Nov. 6-7. The presentation is being produced by Hal Luftig, Kevin Connor, Jamie deRoy and 42nd.club.\n\n\n\tThe performance features choreography by Dominique Kelley, puppet design by Nicholas Mahon, music supervision by Kris Kukul and music direction by Adam Laird. The reading cast includes Jane Bruce as Alice, Akron Watson as James, Jake Pedersen as Peter, Jackera Davis as Tinker Bell, Beth Leavel as the Queen of Hearts and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe first teaser has been unveiled for “Early Days,” a Mumbai-set drama about the perils of influencer culture that will world premiere at the Red Sea International Film Festival. \n\n\tThe India-Singapore co-production, directed by feature directorial debutant Priyankar Patra, has been selected for the festival’s New Visions Competition, which runs Dec. 4-13 in Jeddah.\n\n\tThe film marks a timely exploration of digital-age relationships, following a young couple thrust into social media visibility as they navigate love, ambition and economic survival in India’s most expensive city. Blending cinematic realism with the visual language of social media, “Early Days” captures what Patra describes as “what happens when life itself becomes performance.”\n\t\n\n\t“I wanted to tell a story that feels intimate but universal,” said Patra, whose previous credits include producing several international festival titles under the For Films banner.\n\n\n\tThe project is executive produced by Aditya Vikram Sengupta, whose films “Labour of Love” won an award at Venice, while “Once Upon A Time In Calcutta,” where Patra was one of the producers, premiered there.  Co-producers Isabella Sreyashii Sen and Olivier Dock, co-CEOs of Singapore’s Hazelnut Media, bring global distribution expertise to the project.\n\n\t“Priyankar’s voice is distinct and urgent,” Sengupta said. “This film captures our times with empathy and sharp observation.”\n\n\tThe cast features newcomers Manasi Kaushik and Sarthak Sharma, with a creative team including editor-producer-composer Anupam Sinha Roy, sound designer Sukrit Sen and production designer Sayanika Mukherjee. Patra shot the film. \n\t\n\n\tSen and Dock said they were drawn to how the film “interrogates the human cost of online aspiration —it’s both a deeply personal story and a quietly incisive social portrait.”\n\n\tFor Films, based in Mumbai, focuses on character-driven cinema exploring intersections of technology, emotion and modern Indian life. Hazelnut Media specializes in impact production with a focus on cross-cultural storytelling.\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHeidi Klum, the Queen of Halloween herself, transformed into a stone-cold stunner at her annual Halloween party in New York City.\n\n\tThe supermodel showed up at the event, held at the Hard Rock New York Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, dressed as mythical Greek monster Medusa, complete with writhing snakes on her headpiece, a mouthful of fangs and a lengthy serpentine tail.\n\n\tKlum’s husband Tom Kaulitz, meanwhile, was dressed as a Greek soldier she turned to stone. Klum told Variety on the red carpet that it’s still “important to do live art” amid the rise of generative AI.\n\t\n\n\t“There still needs to be people that create moments with real people… to me, it’s like a beautiful art,” Klum said. She said a team of 15 artists created her Medusa look, which was hand-painted. About her monstrous get-up, she said: “This is only good for the night. Tonight. Everything goes down the drain, so to speak, in the shower.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHeidi Klum and Tom Kaulitz attend the 2025 Heidi Klum Halloween Party in New York on Oct. 31, 2025\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt was Klum’s 24th annual Halloween Party. In past Halloweens, Klum has gone as Jessica Rabbit, Frankenstein’s monster and, (with the help of five friends), six Heidi Klums.\n\n\tThis year, Klum returned to “Project Runway” for Season 21 (on Disney’s Freeform, Disney+ and Hulu) after exiting the fashion competition series in 2018. She had previously hosted the show for 16 seasons, beginning with the its 2004 debut on Bravo. In the intervening years, Klum and Tim Gunn created a new fashion competition series called “Making the Cut” for Amazon Prime Video, which debuted in 2020 and ran for three seasons.\n\t\n\n\tSee looks from Klum’s 24th Annual Halloween Party, which was sponsored by Butterfinger and Disney+ and Hulu’s Huluween:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

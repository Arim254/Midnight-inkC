    "body": "\n\tKate Winslet is opening up about the challenges she faced while making her directorial debut, “Goodbye June.”\n\n\tWritten by her son, Joe Anders, the actress revealed that she only planned to star and produce the film. When she was also offered the opportunity to direct the feature, Winslet said that her initial thought was that she “cannot do three jobs.”\n\n\t“I know I’m good at multitasking, but this is too many things,” Winslet told Digi Spy. “I desperately tried to recast myself [and] had a really good list of a handful of people who would have been absolutely brilliant in that role.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “But at that point… well, first of all, Netflix was like, ‘Uh-uh,’ and secondly, I’d cast all these incredible actors. How could I not go and play with them? Because that’s what we do. We play, we pretend, and it’s an amazing thing.”\n\n\n\tNow playing in select theaters, “Goodbye June” follows four adult siblings and their father as they navigate their family dynamic as their sick mother’s health takes a turn for the worse. Winslet stars as Julia, one of June’s children, with Helen Mirren playing June, the matriarch of the family.\n\n\t“I know it sounds a bit sickly, but we had to really become a family in order to make it feel as real as possible and as relatable as possible,” Winslet added. “You can’t just show up and do the job and go home again; it becomes something else. We were lucky on this film that that really happened.”\n\n\tIn addition to Winslet and Mirren, “Goodbye June” stars Toni Collette, Johnny Flynn, Andrea Riseborough and Timothy Spall. Additional cast members include Stephen Merchant, Fisayo Akinade, Jeremy Swift and Raza Jaffrey.\n\t\n\n\tAfter its theatrical run, the film will arrive on Netflix on Dec. 24.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSydney Sweeney was familiar with “The Housemaid” novel when she landed a starring role in Paul Feig’s movie adaptation.\n\n\t“I was juicy, it was delicious,” she told me at the film’s Los Angeles premiere on Monday. “I could not put the book down. I remember I opened it, and you know when you’re like, ‘I’m going to open this, read a couple of chapters and then go do something else,’ I did not move from my seat the moment I opened it until I finished. It was just so good. The characters, the twists, the turns, all of it, so I knew I really wanted to be a part of.”\n\t\n\n\tSweeney stars in the erotic thriller as a woman with a dark past who is hired as the live-in maid for a wealthy couple, played by Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar.\n\n\n\tThere’s already talk of a sequel. “We want to be able to give the people what they want,” Sweeney said. “This is such an amazing community of book lovers, and we would love to do another film.”\n\n\tFeig said, “Let’s just hope this one does well because we’re ready to do another one.”\n\n\tSweeney was attached to the project when Feig signed on to direct.\n\n\t “It was amazing,” Feig said of working with the “Euphoria” star. “She’s so lovely and so easy to work with, and the most professional person I have ever met. She shows up on set and is ready to go, and is prepared, and brings such an extra level to everything she does. She’s one of my heroes, I’ll tell ya.”\n\n\n\tSeyfried talked about her first day working with Sweeney. “We were doing one of those light camera tests, and we realized right away that we’re the same shoe size and the exact same height, and we thought that was really interesting. And I think it was just the fact that we were so in love with the book, and we couldn’t believe we were actually making this movie, that we related right away. Also, we have the same process. She doesn’t take herself too seriously, and neither do I. I think that’s where the fun comes in.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Housemaid” is in theaters now.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tBowen Yang will take his last turn as a cast member on “Saturday Night Live” tonight. His final episode will be hosted by his “Wicked” costar Ariana Granda and Cher as musical guest.\n\n\tIt was announced on Thursday that Yang will exit the NBC sketch show in the middle of his eighth season. Yang first joined “SNL” as a writer in 2018 for Season 44 before being promoted to join the main cast beginning with Season 47. His work on the show earned him nominations for the supporting comedy actor Emmy for four years in a row. \n\n\n\t“I loved working at SNL, and most of all i loved the people,” Yang wrote in an Instagram post following the news. “I was there at a time when many things in the world started to seem futile, but working at 30 rock taught me the value in showing up anyway when people make it worthwhile. I’m grateful for every minute of my time there.”\n\n\t“SNL,” currently in its 51st season, broadcasts live every Saturday night on NBC at 11:30 p.m. ET.. But the best way for cable-cutters to stream the show live is through the NBC-owned streamer Peacock, in addition to live TV streamers such as DirecTV, Sling TV, Fubo TV and Hulu + Live TV.\n\n\tNBC posted a promo of the episode featuring Grande, Cher and Yang on Thursday. “Ariana, I’m so happy you’re here,” Yang tells his “Wicked” costar. “And I’m so happy to be back!” she replies.\n\n\t“And Cher, am I dreaming?” he tells the music icon before she slaps him across the face. “Snap out of it!” \n\n\t“Cher just slapped us!” Grande and Yang squeal to each other in excitement as Cher deadpans to the camera.\n\n\n\tCheck out the “SNL” promo below, and stream the episode live online on Peacock.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDave Chappelle went after Bill Maher in his new Netflix special, “The Unstoppable,” for criticizing his appearance at Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh Comedy Festival.\n\n\t“Recently in the news, I’ve been getting a lot of grief, again, because I did a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia,” Chappelle said to applause. “And you hear those cheers? That’s Black people. America’s whites, they’re furious. Boy, I gotta tell you something. I’ve never not felt guilty about something. I don’t feel guilty at all. And Bill Maher, the famous comedian, I’ve known Bill since I was like, 18, 19 years old, and I’ve never said this publicly, but fuck that guy. I’m so fucking tired of his little smug, cracker-ass commentary.”\n\t\n\n\tMaher was largely positive about the Riyadh Festival, calling the participating comedians “brave” for breaking ground in a nation that hasn’t always been welcoming for stand-up. However, Maher did take issue with Chappelle saying it’s “easier to talk” in Saudi Arabia than in America.\n\n\n\t“It’s not true,” Maher said of Chappelle’s comment during an episode of “Real Time.” “Do your hunk on Mohammed, Dave.”\n\n\tIn the special, which premiered Dec. 19, Chappelle addressed the controversial claim.\n\n\t“I didn’t tell them to put this in the paper. I just said it on stage. I said, ‘It’s easier to talk in Saudi Arabia for me than it is in America,’” he said. “Oh, I stand ten toes on that. Don’t forget what I just went through. Two years ago, I almost got canceled right here in the United States for transgender jokes. But I gotta tell you something. Transgender jokes went over very well in Saudi Arabia.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Chappelle, Riyadh’s lineup included Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Whitney Cummings, Aziz Ansari and more.\n\n\tMaher was not the only comedian to come after Riyadh. Jimmy Kimmel, David Cross, Marc Maron and Shane Gillis all spoke out against the festival. Participants like Burr and C.K. spoke very favorably about Riyadh in the wake of the backlash. Burr called the event one of the “top three experiences I’ve had.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tHow did Miley Cyrus find herself writing a ballad for an “Avatar” movie? It’s all thanks to her Disney “legend-in-law,” director James Cameron.\n\n\tLa",
    "body": "\n\tHow did Miley Cyrus find herself writing a ballad for an “Avatar” movie? It’s all thanks to her Disney “legend-in-law,” director James Cameron.\n\n\tLast summer, Cyrus found herself waiting backstage at the D23 Expo in Anaheim to be inducted into the studio’s Hall of Fame. Who was in front of her in line? Just a few cinema icons: Harrison Ford, otherwise known as Han Solo or Indiana Jones; the iconic scream queen and “Freaky Friday” star Jamie Lee Curtis; and Cameron.\n\t\n\n\tFirst, Curtis cornered Cyrus, seizing the moment to recruit the Grammy winner to write the end credits song for her latest movie, “The Last Showgirl.” (That track, “Beautiful That Way,” later earned Cyrus a Golden Globe nomination.) Since they were talking business, Cyrus decided to shoot her shot, too, and asked Cameron how things were going with his latest “Avatar” movie, “Fire and Ash.” She’d been a fan of the blockbuster sci-fi franchise since it launched in 2009, so contributing to the threequel would be a bucket list opportunity.\n\n\n\t“I’m magnetized to the scale of the films and of it being larger than life,” Cyrus tells Variety, following the world premiere in Los Angeles.\n\n\tFor as epic as Cameron’s vision of Pandora and the Na’vi who inhabit the distant moon might be, she explains, the story is firmly rooted in human emotion and relatable dynamics. “I love things that kind of contradict themselves,” Cyrus says. “The acting is unbelievable. It’s the only way I think that you can get away with doing something so deep in this fantasy world, and it still feels really grounded in real human connection and relationships.”\n\t\n\n\tAnd, as luck would have it, Cameron had already pitched the idea of working with her to “Avatar” composer, Simon Franglen. Cameron wanted the song to be titled “Dream as One,” as the phrase evokes the film’s finale, but the rest would be up to Cyrus and her collaborators, Oscar winners Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt (“A Star is Born,” “Barbie”).\n\n\t“Coming in at the end was actually really helpful, because, when you’ve worked on something for like 20 years, you get so close to it that it’s hard to see it from that outside perspective,” Cyrus says. “I’m just writing it like someone who loves ‘Avatar.’”\n\n\n\n\n\tCyrus, Ronson and Wyatt worked on the song in Los Angeles while Franglen was in New Zealand with Cameron putting the finishing touches on the score. To help them understand the story, Franglen set the trio up with footage from the unfinished film, which they then projected on the walls of the iconic Sunset Sound recording studio as they wrote.\n\n\t“Simon gave us really beautiful, environmental shots, just so we could actually feel like we were in the water, that we were in the shade of the trees, that we were surrounded by that magical fantasy universe,” Cyrus says.\n\n\tDigging into the source material is key to Cyrus’ songwriting process. “I’m always trying to get to underneath it all,” she says. “‘What’s the heart of the universe that makes billions of people love it so much?’ Because people really adore it in a way that it’s really hard for a franchise to hit that level of emotion.”\n\n\tCyrus would also call Cameron to chat. “Sometimes I’d go to call him for two minutes, and we’d talk for two hours – just about life,” she says. “That was almost more helpful, even, than watching the film, because I could see his own story in the script.”\n\n\t“Fire and Ash” deeply resonated with Cyrus, too, as the movie introduces a new clan of Na’vi, the Ash people, whose home was destroyed in a volcanic eruption, and she lost her Malibu home to a wildfire in 2018. “It’s literally part of my life,” she says. “Losing my home, rebuilding from the ground up, having this real, like Phoenix resilience.”\n\n\tThe opening lyrics — “Our love will never fade away // We’re diamonds in the dark” — came to Cyrus as she recalled sifting through the rubble of her burned-out home to find a lone diamond in the dust. The fortitude of that gem was imprinted on her memory.\n\t\n\n\t“Living through it is the only way to fully understand what everyone goes through. And even if you’ve gone through it yourself, everybody has such a unique experience with loss,” Cyrus says about capturing the heartbreaking experience in song. “With my house, I had lived there for five years, and there’s people who have been living in their houses for 50 years. Everything they’ve ever had, every picture, everything that’s ever had an emotional sentiment to them, is gone.”\n\n\tShe continues: “Anytime I get to put something that I’ve experienced somewhere that gets to help other people, that’s really the medicine in music. It’s the truest healer.”\n\n\t“Dream As One” has been well-received thus far; the ballad is nominated for a Golden Globe and shortlisted for best original song at the Academy Awards. But it’s not the only Disney-related project Cyrus has in the works. Next spring marks the 20th anniversary of her iconic Disney Channel series, “Hannah Montana,” and she’s carefully considering how to celebrate.\n\n\t“Something that they always say in ‘Avatar’ is ‘I see you’ — and that’s something really important that I want the fans to feel during the ‘Hannah-versary,’” Cyrus says. “Someone called it the ‘Hannah’ anniversary the other day, and I was like ‘No, no, no, it’s the ‘Hannah-versary,'” she clarifies, then continues. “I want the fans to really feel seen. They know that I appreciate them, but I also see like their growth. Because I have these moments all the time where people celebrate my evolution, but I see theirs as much as they see mine.”\n\n\tSo, does that mean in-person festivities, like a concert tour?\n\n\t“TBD. That’s still in the works,” Cyrus teases. “Everything takes time. I want to make something that’s meaningful, thoughtful and really satisfying for the fans.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe first moment in my life when people began to talk about movies as if they could go away tomorrow was right after the pandemic struck. At that point, no one knew which end was up, but with America’s movie theaters having closed down, movies had gone away — at least temporarily. We all wondered: For how long? Theater chains were facing the kind of crippling debt that can hollow out an industry; they still are. And even after the theaters reopened, and moviegoers (or some of them, anyway) returned, the seemingly permanent erosion of the box office reflected a much larger story: the transition of audiences from the movie theater to the home theater, a technology-driven development that was also a cultural evolution. Call it The Cocooning of America.\n\t\n\n\tOf course, movies didn’t go away. They took a major hit, one they’ve never fully recovered from. Yet where some surveyed the cinema landscape and saw vulnerability and weakness, and maybe the end of a dream (that is, the end of the movie culture we’d known for 100 years), I saw faith and resilience. I saw the part of the glass that was full (more than half of it, by a long shot). I saw the stubborn persistence of the belief in the mass religion that movies had always been. In the end, audiences did return to movie theaters; they kept on coming. The dream was, and still is, alive.\n\n\n\tBut now, suddenly, for the first time since the dawn of the pandemic, the ground has shifted. The paradigm is bucking and lurching under our feet. Seemingly overnight, things are happening that have the potential to result in an extinction-level event for movies as we’ve known them.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s looming purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery is not yet a done deal, but with the WBD board having rejected Paramount’s counteroffer to buy the company, Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, appears to be moving toward his big victory. So let’s be clear about what that would portend. What a Netflix-WBD merger means for the future of movies has been the talk of the industry, and speaking privately (or anonymously), countless observers up and down the Hollywood food chain believe that it would be a catastrophe. Yet the party line that Sarandos has put out — that he’d maintain Warner Bros., at least for a while, as a company that distributes movies in theaters — has done its snake-oil PR job of smoothing over the panic. A venerable Hollywood reporter recently devoted many column inches to confronting this question (What Would Ted Do?), only to answer it with a benign shrug of “We don’t know! The jury is out.”\n\n\tI’m sorry, but the jury is not out. Ted Sarandos has been upfront about his plan — that over time he would diminish the theatrical window, which even as of now has been radically diminished. How much more diminishment can it take? If a newly powerful and game-changing Netflix Warner Bros. decides to shave down the window by one week per year, within four years the window would be down to a scant two weeks. And a theatrical window of two weeks is no window at all. As it is, too many people today skip going out to the movies because they know that a film they’re drawn to see will be available to stream in a month. If the window was just two weeks, the effect would be cataclysmic. The audience for movies would dry up. Ted Sarandos knows this. And anyone with an IQ over 100 should be able to see that this is his grand plan. He will kill movies through capitalist attrition, with a cheerleader war cry of “The future is streaming!”\n\n\tIf you think that sounds depressing, consider the icing that the last week poured on top of the doomsday-of-cinema cake. In a bombshell development, it was announced that the Academy Awards, starting in 2029, will no longer be broadcast on ABC, or on any television network. A deal was struck so that you will watch them exclusively on YouTube. A friend of mine said that this sounded like some horrifically just-plausible-enough satirical premise out of Seth Rogen’s “The Studio,” and he’s right: In what world are the Oscars going to be an event on YouTube? I get it: The monoculture is fading. Broadcast television is no longer the centralized force it once was. And a YouTubed Oscars could have an impressive international reach.\n\t\n\n\tYet forget all that for a moment and listen to your gut. It’s beyond obvious that the Oscars on YouTube would be radically diminished — that they would go from being must-see TV to maybe-see semi-background noise. And the timing is nearly karmic. The YouTube Oscars that a fading number of viewers will care about is set to come along just as a newly baptized Netflix Warner Bros. is diluting the appeal of movies in theaters enough so that a fading number of viewers will care about them. An extinction-level event? Yes, it could be.\n\n\tBut not if forces within the industry see what’s at stake, and rise up to fight it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs artificial intelligence lowers the technical barriers to making images, films and animations, a panel at the Hong Kong International AI Art Festival turned its focus to what still separates meaningful creation from effortless generation: human judgment.\n\n\tThe discussion, titled “AI Empowering Boundless Creativity,” was moderated on behalf of Variety by Quist Tsang, a Hong Kong–based photographer and visual artist, as part of the festival’s public forum program. Tsang steered the conversation toward concrete practice rather than speculation, asking how AI is already reshaping creative work, education and professional decision-making.\n\t\n\n\tPanelists represented a cross-section of platforms, academia and industry, including Zeng Yushen, head of operations at Kling AI; Jennifer Lin, associate VP for global strategy at City University of Hong Kong; Wang Lei, dean and professor at the School of Animation and Digital Arts at Communication University of China; veteran visual effects supervisor Ma Wenxian; Kling AI creator and digital artist Lin Gengxu; and HKUST master’s student and digital artist Ivy Zhang.\n\n\n\tAcross the discussion, speakers returned repeatedly to the idea that while AI accelerates production and lowers entry barriers, it does not remove the need for taste, responsibility and decision-making. Zeng described how AI tools have expanded what small teams can realistically produce, but emphasized that outcomes still depend on how clearly creators define what they want to make.\n\n\tDuring the panel, Zeng also referenced recent updates to Kling’s underlying models, framing them as part of an evolving effort to support more precise human–machine collaboration rather than as formal announcements. He pointed to the release of Kling O1, which integrates generation, editing and understanding into a unified multimodal workflow, as well as the Video 2.6 model, which introduces native audio generation and improved audio-visual synchronization, enabling creators to generate dialogue, sound effects and ambient sound alongside video in a single process.\n\t\n\n\tFrom an academic perspective, Wang argued that artistic standards themselves have not changed. Art, he said, remains a form of emotional communication between people, with works acting as intermediaries. Without that resonance, technological sophistication alone is meaningless. While AI may blur the boundary between producer and consumer by enabling broader participation, Wang stressed that sustained training in aesthetics and judgment remains essential.\n\n\tMa, drawing on decades of experience in film and visual effects, offered a more cautious industry view. While AI can speed up image generation, he noted that maintaining narrative continuity and meeting a director’s precise intent remains challenging. In professional workflows, control and accuracy continue to outweigh novelty.\n\n\tYounger creators on the panel framed AI less as a shortcut than as a collaborator. Lin Gengxu described using AI in both personal and commercial projects to explore ideas that would previously have been difficult or impossible to realize, provided the creator maintains a clear sense of direction. Zhang spoke about AI enabling artists to move more fluidly across media, allowing abstract ideas to be visualized without deep technical specialization.\n\n\tEducation emerged as a key fault line. Lin pushed back against suggestions that humanities and social sciences are becoming irrelevant in the AI era, arguing instead that judgment, ethics and aesthetic sensitivity are becoming more important as tools grow more powerful. Wang echoed the point, arguing that as AI absorbs many tool-based skills, what remains distinctively human is a combination of curiosity, experience and tacit knowledge that cannot be reduced to data.\n\n\tThe discussion formed part of a broader industry forum convened by Kling AI examining how generative tools are reshaping creative practice across art, education and screen industries. Those initiatives have included collaborations with established filmmakers and artists, including Academy Award–winning production designer Tim Yip, whose human–machine co-creation work with the platform was previously examined by Variety.\n\n\tLooking ahead three to five years, panelists offered differing views on what AI-native art forms might emerge. Ma argued for introducing AI creative tools at earlier stages of education, suggesting that younger students without entrenched assumptions may push the medium in unexpected directions. Lin Gengxu anticipated a proliferation of niche, community-driven content as creation tools become widely accessible, while Zhang pointed to interactive formats that could allow audiences to participate directly in shaping narratives.\n\t\n\n\tWang cautioned against assuming that today’s dominant AI aesthetics – often dreamlike and fragmented – will define the future. He characterized these styles as artifacts of current technical limitations rather than settled artistic languages, arguing that diversity, not uniformity, is the more likely outcome.\n\n\tClosing the session, Tsang noted that while AI continues to expand the physical limits of creation, meaning, judgment and responsibility remain firmly in human hands — a conclusion that underscored the panel’s central theme.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains details about Episode 5 of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tRobbie G.K. did some method auditioning when he read for the role of hockey champion Scott Hunter in “Heated Rivalry.”\n\n\t“I think living in Canada, I have a stereotypical view of what hockey is and what hockey people are like,” the actor tells me via Zoom from Toronto, where he’s visiting family for the holidays. “I had like a mullet and a mustache going on.”\n\t\n\n\tG.K. didn’t get the part. But no matter, because series creator Jacob Tierney asked him to play Kip Grady, the juice bar worker who has a steamy and emotional romance with the very closeted Scott, played by François Arnaud, in Episode 3.\n\n\tG.K. had chemistry reads with a couple of other actors before Arnaud. “After I did the one with François, I texted Jacob right after and I said, ‘That was the last one, wasn’t it?’ Because I could tell just by us reading it that it really felt like it went from a scripted conversation to a real conversation,” G.K. recalls. “I think that’s a testament to François’ ability of just making it feel so authentic. I was like, ‘Oh, wow. This is the first time this hasn’t felt like a chemistry read. This just feels like we’re talking.’”\n\n\tAt the end of Episode 3, Scott and Kip break up. Even so, Kip returns in Episode 5. He is in the stands when Scott’s team wins the Stanley Cup. During the final scene, Scott motions for Kip to join him in the rink as his team is celebrating the championship. Then, in one of the show’s most jaw-dropping moments, Scott comes out of the closet by kissing Kip. The episode then cuts to Ilya (Connor Storrie) telling Shane (Hudson Williams) he is going to take him up on his offer to spend some of the summer with him at his vacation cottage.\n\t\n\n\t“I knew it was going to be a very moving moment, of course, but it’s very different from when you film something like that and you’re in a hockey rink and there’s no music, and the whole build-up of everything,” G.K. says. “When I first watched it, I was just giddy about it. I think this is the moment where all these storylines intersect. I’m glad it turned out as it did. It’s much better than anything I could have ever imagined.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHeated Rivalry –  (L to R) François Arnaud as Scott Hunter and Robbie G.K. as Kip Grady in Episode 105 of Heated Rivalry. Cr. Sabrina Lantos © 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsabrina lantos\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt took about seven takes to get the kiss just right. “It was a fun day,” G.K. says. “That was my last day on set, so it was kind of an emotional day. It felt like a good little button to that storyline.”\n\n\tWhile “Heated Rivalry,” which is based on Rachel Reid’s queer romance novel series “Game Changers,” has been picked up for a second season, G.K. doesn’t know yet if Kip will return.\n\n\t“There is a whole world to explore after this,” he says. “I know that they are sticking to the books and that’s super exciting. And I know that ‘The Long Game’ has a lot in it, and the next couple of books have a lot of content in them, too. But outside of the show alone, I left that set feeling like this was one of the best projects I’ve ever worked on, just because of the people. I would do absolutely anything to be back in that setting.”\n\n\tI was at a big gay Hanukkah party last night, and all anyone wanted to talk about was “Heated Rivalry.” They were checking their phones to see if they’d be home in time to watch Episode 5.\n\n\tNo way. That is crazy. Honestly, it’s been such a whirlwind. Last night, I couldn’t sleep because I was thinking about the episode. Usually, anything that I’m in, I’m like,”This is garbage,” and I can’t fix it. But I was like, “I’ll watch the screener and maybe do some laundry just so I’m up to date and everything.” I found myself in my underwear, having done no laundry, sitting there giggling, watching the whole episode. I’m glad everyone is enjoying it as much as I am.\n\n\tWe have to see your audition with the mullet and mustache.\n\n\tI don’t think that is going to see the light of day, so I’ll have to show it to you in person at some point. The costume designer was Hanna Puley, who I worked with on “Overcompensating” [G.K. played nurse Riley in Benito Skinner’s coming-of-age Prime Video comedy series]. I was like, “Girl, I think we have to try to keep this. I think it fits for New York City.” Ultimately, we decided not to do that, but it was fun to try.\n\t\n\n\tDo you think Scott and Kip could have a future together? From what I can tell, this is Scott’s first relationship with a man, maybe the first time he’s ever really been with a man. And he asked Kip to move in the morning after their first night together.\n\n\tYeah, it was like in 10 seconds. François and I have chatted about this, and without a doubt, I think that there’s obviously a relationship that continues to exist. There’s so much to explore after this point, right? There are these weird parallels because the same way that the show is exploding and the episodes are exploding, the same thing would happen on an even bigger scale for Kip.\n\n\tHow was it doing the sex scenes? You worked with an intimacy coordinator, but it’s pretty steamy and you’re saying things like, “Will you fuck me?”\n\n\tHonestly, it was great. That was my first time doing any type of intimacy scene past kissing on camera with anyone. I couldn’t have asked for a better team. François is such a professional, and he’s obviously been in the industry and worked so much that I kind of leaned on him during those scenes. Once we started doing it, I was like, “Oh, this is so chill, and it feels so welcoming. I feel very comfortable.” Jacob made it clear from the start that our sex scenes or our montage was going to have a different flavor than the first two episodes.\n\n\tHow much pressure are you feeling to stay in shape now, especially if you’re back for Season 2?\n\n\tI’m enjoying the holidays. I’m gonna have a lot of turkey, and I have as many desserts as I can. I think we got quite some time until, if I am fortunate enough to be involved in anything after this, to work on it. I can be unrecognizable in the next three days.\n\n\tI think the show is going to help a lot of people who are struggling with their sexuality. Do you feel that?\n\n\tThat is something that I am still processing as well. I’ve gotten a lot of messages since Episode 3 came out from all over the world from people who are saying, “I live here in this country and being out is not really an option for me. I want you to know that seeing all this and this type of representation is priceless.” Without getting too cliche and too sappy, it is so moving and so beautiful. Growing up in musical theater, I have a lot of friends who have gone through that journey in different stages. I’ve seen firsthand the impact of having role models or having TV shows or any media like this. To be a part of something that allows these people to feel even for a second that there’s a world out there that exists for them is priceless.\n\t\n\n\tThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSince its release back on Nov. 21, I’ve had several social media followers and friends ask me: “What did you think of ‘Wicked: For Good?’” There’s a hidden undercurrent to this question. They aren’t asking me just because I’m an entertainment journalist and critic; I’m also a disabled person who routinely writes about representation on-screen. So the question they’re really asking is: “What did you think of how they handled Nessarose in the movie?”\n\t\n\n\tNessarose, the half-sister to heroine Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), has been a character I’ve had trepidation over since the movie was greenlit. The first movie in 2024 was a pleasant surprise. I knew they’d have to cast an actual wheelchair-using actor or risk the ire of social media, and Marissa Bode has been a highlight of both the first film and its sequel.\n\n\n\tDisabled women of color are still a rarity on-screen. Per this year’s Annenberg Inclusion Study, 61% of the disabled characters seen on-screen last year were men and 70.8% were white, so to see someone like Bode given a character who, historically, has never been played by a disabled woman on stage until March of 2025, is amazing.\n\n\tThe first movie gave director Jon M. Chu and screenwriters Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox an opportunity to combat some of the ableism from the stage play. In the film version of “Wicked,” Elphaba pokes fun at those who consider Nessa “beautifully tragic” and “tragically beautiful,” lines that are presented without irony in the original stage version. There’s also more inclusion presented in Oz. Little people aren’t specifically relegated to Munchkinland (though no little people seem to live there at all), and if you keep your eyes open, you’ll see ramps discretely integrated into the set design. I knew the first movie wasn’t going to be problematic because Nessa’s journey at Shiz University is woven through the earlier part of the film, and she is accepted like any other student.\n\t\n\n\tThe reason an abled actress plays Nessa on Broadway is because Elphaba, hoping to reconcile with her sister, grants Nessa’s wish to be cured by bewitching her silver shoes and giving her the ability to walk. The magic cure, another common disabled stereotype, presents the idea that every disabled person wants to be fixed. So the question arose, how would “Wicked: For Good” combat the magic cure Nessa asks for in Act Two? Bode said earlier in the year that the plotline would be changed to be “less harmful to disabled people” and, honestly, what ends up happening is about what I expected. It is less harmful, but it’s not setting the world of disability discourse on fire.\n\n\tShe doesn’t ask Elphaba to fix her but is irritated that Elphaba has never used her magic to benefit Nessa. Instead of giving Nessa the ability to walk, the shoes are enchanted to give her the ability to float. The slight change gives this a different vibe than the magical cure. Nessa, now the governor of Munchkinland, is still mired in a mix of mourning the loss of her father and condemnation of her sister, but it’s clear there’s an undisclosed change in her mentality. She doesn’t want to be fixed but instead wants to recreate the nostalgic feelings of her youth, and the feeling of love she once believed was present between her and her unrequited love, Boq (Ethan Slater).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBode in “Wicked” with Boq, played by Ethan Slater\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Boq/Nessa storyline remains fairly similar on screen to the stage version, and it’s still problematic. Boq wishes to go off and see the world, only for Nessa to change the laws so Munchkins can’t leave, especially Boq. On the one hand, disabled people are still people at the end of the day, with all manner of flaws and the ability to hurt people they care about. The problem is that Nessa’s plotline still boils down to her villainy stemming predominantly from being rejected by an abled man. Interabled relationships on-screen are still a rarity for women; disabled men participate in them frequently. Boq doesn’t necessarily reject Nessa because she’s disabled, but because he’s still hung up on Glinda (Ariana Grande). There’s little in the way of depth to Boq and Nessa’s relationship.\n\n\tBoth characters have apparently been pining for people who haven’t appeared to have shown them any consideration since the first movie. Nessa’s 180 into witchery and fascism feels as abrupt as Boq seeing Glinda on a magazine cover and believing he can suddenly change her mind about getting married. So while Nessa isn’t rejected because of her disability, her journey still feels like a stereotypical disabled-woman arc. We never see her lead and only act as a villain.\n\t\n\n\tHer ending is also expected because of the play. Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) uses Nessa as a pawn to draw Elphaba out, conjures up a tornado, and a house ends up dropped on Nessa. Nessa’s only given one major segment in the entire movie, and while it’s all necessary to the part, there doesn’t appear to be any good in Nessa’s life this go-round. We don’t see her do anything positive as a leader. She doesn’t get the guy. And she’s angry at her sister for her magical abilities.\n\n\tShe flirts heavily with falling into the trope of the “bitter cripple,” wherein the character is written to have little in their life other than anger and sadness. This could have been negated had the movie not been split in two, as Nessa gets a lot of happy scenes in that first movie. And while it’s clear that her bitterness is more of a recent phenomenon, there’s nothing to counter it. The audience doesn’t even really get a chance to mourn her passing. They just see the famous shot of her striped socks under the house before Elphaba and Glinda start fighting. To watch this movie, Nessa died as she lived: alone.\n\n\tNone of these are specifically issues exclusive to the movie. They’re all issues inherent in the original 2003 movie musical. So, for me, because I knew they weren’t giving Nessa an entirely new plot, my expectations were not hopeful of a radical change. The movie is fine. Removing the ableist walking plotline is great, but it’s the one major change. The rest of Nessa’s plotline is still there and still troubles me. Marissa Bode’s acting gives more life to the character, but there’s little more to Nessa than existed at the beginning. It proves there’s more awareness of ableist tropes in movies. Knowing is half the battle.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHernan Lopez got a phone call at home in April 2020 that upended his world. \n\n\tOn that day, the founder of the Wondery podcast network and former head of Fox International Channels learned that he was about to be indicted by federal prosecutors in New York. He had been caught up in a long-running white collar corruption probe related to TV rights deals involving FIFA and other leagues and sports. He was accused of taking part in a bribery scheme to secure various sports rights for Fox outlets in the U.S. and abroad. Lopez has steadfastly maintained he did nothing wrong and was not aware of a bribery scheme that involved one of Fox’s joint venture partners.\n\t\n\n\tBut a federal jury disagreed. After a seven-week trial, Lopez was convicted in March 2023, along with the sports marketing firm Full Play Group, of participating in a scheme to bribe South American soccer officials. But in September of that year, U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen granted Lopez’s motion for acquittal and also overturned the conviction of Full Play.\n\n\n\tIn July of this year, a federal appeals panel overturned Chen’s decision and reinstated the convictions. Lopez was about to take his appeal to the Supreme Court when prosecutors in New York’s Eastern District did an about-face, writing to Chen to ask her to dismiss the charges against Lopez and Full Play Group “in the interests of justice.” The Supreme Court is set to formalize the dismissal early next year.\n\n\tFor Lopez, the letter sent on Dec. 9 by prosecutor Joseph Nocella Jr., U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, marks the end of a six-year odyssey through the federal criminal justice system. The complicated legal battle erupted as Lopez was building the popular Wondery podcast network, which he launched after leaving Fox in 2016.\n\t\n\n\tLopez has asserted that his prosecution was driven by false allegations made against him by a defendant who cooperated with prosecutors, Alejandro Burzaco. Burzaco, a former sports marketing executive, pleaded guilty and testified during the trial to have been involved in bribery schemes.\n\n\tA spokesman for the Eastern District declined to comment on the decision to seek a dismissal of the case. Jim Walden, a lawyer for Burzaco, denies Lopez’s assertion about Burzaco, who pleaded guilty to a corruption charge. “Alejandro was a truthful and compelling witness, who risked much to fully accept responsibility and bring others to justice. This is why prosecutors dubbed him the ‘Super Man’ of restorative justice,” Walden said in a statement.\n\n\tHere, as Lopez awaits the final step of the dismissal, he discusses his experience in depth for the first time. He reflects on the toll that the prosecution took on his husband and two children, and how he has been changed by his journey through the federal courts.\n\n\tIt’s been a long process for you. Now that the Justice Department is taking the last step toward dismissing this case, how do you feel? \n\n\tI feel finally at peace that a prosecution that never should have been brought is about to be dismissed. At the same time, I know I won’t get back the six years of my life, and I would like to raise awareness in the business community that a wrongful prosecution can have incredibly strong effects on the lives of people and on businesses in the U.S.\n\n\tIn terms of your ability to see this through, to go through six years of hearings, a nearly two-month trial and to have a legal team on board the whole time. What kind of emotional stamina and financial resources did you need?\n\n\tFirst knowing that the truth was by my side. I did not approve or have any knowledge of any bribes paid by anyone. I was never accused of bribing people or directing any bribes, and I knew that when time went by, the truth eventually will come out and we will get to the right outcome. But it was really that connection with perspective and my own center of gravity, and knowing that the people who know me would never believe this about me. Those are the things that really kept me centered throughout these six difficult years.\n\n\tYou were not accused of paying a bribe personally. You were basically accused of being the boss, and therefore you, you should have known.\n\t\n\n\tI was not accused of taking a bribe, and I was also not accused of paying or directing any bribes. What the prosecutors instead alleged was that I acquiesced into a scheme organized by a former joint venture partner who himself was the one paying bribes and siphoning money away for his own benefit, and he was doing it behind my back and the backs of everybody at Fox.\n\n\tDid you go into it thinking, I will be dropped at some point?\n\n\tI thought this will be solved in just a matter of days. When the indictment first came in, I was shocked and I was confused. Because I did not fully appreciate how our federal criminal system works, I felt that when [prosecutors] talk to my lawyers, they will understand that this has no basis in truth, and therefore they will drop the case. Little did I know that it would take them six years to finally realize how their case was based not only on false facts, but also on faulty law.\n\n\tYou never engaged in any kind of settlement discussions?\n\n\tIt was never even a consideration. I knew I was going to fight it. And it was fortunate that my former employer had the obligation to cover the legal bills. That gave me a luxury that many people in my situation don’t often have.\n\n\tWhen was the first time that you were informed that you were facing legal jeopardy as part of the larger federal probe? Was it in an email? Was it a phone call? \n\n\tIt was the day that my lawyer called me on the first Sunday in April of 2020, and told me, unfortunately, ‘I have bad news. There’s an indictment against you. It will become public tomorrow.’ Before that, I knew that my lawyers and Fox’s lawyers had been talking to the government. I had never been told that I was being targeted. It was not even a consideration in my mind.\n\n\tWere you at home?\n\n\tI was. I was home. Remember, this was when we had been ordered to go home for the pandemic. And this being a Sunday, we had just finished watching a movie, and my world dropped. I did not fully appreciate what it means to be the target of a federal indictment until it happened to me.\n\n\tWhat was the first step you took? You were running Wondery at that time.\n\n\tSo I had to tell people in order. So that Sunday night, obviously my husband was with me. He was equally shocked, probably more shocked even than I was. I told my board members at Wondery — all of them were in complete shock. The next morning, I told my executive team in a meeting — again, the same reaction. And I only had a few more hours before I could tell my parents, so that they wouldn’t hear it from the press before they heard it from me. I told everybody to stay calm, because I believed that this was a mistake that was going to be corrected. I did not appreciate it would take so long for it to be corrected.\n\t\n\n\tThat must have been incredibly emotional.\n\n\tIt was tough. It was in some respects easier because people who knew me knew that this was so out of character for me that they did not believe it for a second.\n\n\tSo you went through a jury trial and you were convicted in 2023, which was destined to be overturned, then reinstated and now on track for dismissal. Was the conviction by a jury your lowest point?\n\n\tThat was the low point to hear that word from the foreman and know that after four days of deliberation, which is an unusually long amount of time, that they had reached the wrong conclusion was devastating. One thing that gave me comfort was that the judge [Chen] went and talked to the jury and stayed with them for what my lawyers tell me was an unusually long amount of time. And she came back and she did not agree with the government’s motion to remand me. Instead, I was able to go back home. As the jurors said at the time, they found me guilty because as the CEO, I should have known. That is not the basis to convict somebody of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. And at the time my lawyers saw it, I saw it and and I knew that that was not the end.\n\n\tWere you ever held in federal custody?\n\n\tBecause it was in the pandemic, they did not. They did arraignments by video conference. Fortunately, I was never in custody.\n\n\tSo as all this is happening, you’re going on five years into Wondery, and in fact you will sell the company by the end of the year to Amazon. Was that influenced by your legal predicament?\n\n\tI decided to sell Wondery in 2020 given a number of considerations, most importantly, the changing landscape of the potential companies that could buy it. I cannot tell you that the indictment didn’t have anything at all to do with my decision. Yes, it did weigh on my decision, but it wasn’t the primary factor.\n\n\tDo you have any regrets about that?\n\n\tI don’t have regrets in general. If there’s one regret I have is that I should have taken this investigation more proactively when I heard that this cooperator was talking to the government, instead of assuming, of course, the prosecutors will understand. I should have at that moment been more proactive, and instructed my lawyers to be proactive to prevent an indictment from happening.\n\t\n\n\tHow did this affect your family? You have two teenage children.\n\n\tI kept it from them. They were 10 and nine when this happened, and I did not tell them at all until I was ready to go to trial. Because I wanted them to understand why my husband and I were going to be gone  for so long. We came back and forth over the weekends, but I wanted them to take it as a lesson that accused doesn’t mean guilty. The presumption of innocence means we do not prejudge. And when we know the truth, the truth ultimately comes out.\n\n\tHow has this ordeal changed you?\n\n\tIn one positive way, which is that I used to assume too quickly that accusations were made because where there’s smoke there’s fire. It might be a function of how I grew up. I grew up under a military dictatorship in Argentina and even though jurors are told to presume innocence, most people unfortunately assume that the person who’s indicted must have done something to be there, and that’s one of the reasons why federal prosecutors get 90-plus percent conviction rates. And this changed me very much in the way that I don’t assume quickly, I don’t prejudge. I think that is, in many respects, the biggest positive that has come out of this experience.\n\n\tWhat are you looking to do now that the legal jeopardy is over? You launched a research firm, Owl & Co., in early 2024.\n\n\tYes, I started a research and consulting company. This is what I’m doing now.\n",

He gushed over his time in the show, penning ... \"I loved working at SNL, and most of all i loved the people. i was there at a time when many things in the world started to seem futile, but working at 30 rock taught me the value in showing up anyway when people make it worthwhile.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Bowen goes on to reflect on how much he has learned about himself and others during his 7-year run on the show. He then personally thanks all the friends and coworkers who have contributed to his successful run -- and even \"ari\" -- who we assume is Ariana Grande, considering she's pictured in his post -- \"for sending [him] off in the dreamiest way [he] could imagine.\"\n      \n\n          He concludes his lengthy note by saying he hopes he's prepared for his next journey ... though what's in store for him remains unclear. The reason for his seemingly sudden departure is also unknown.\n      \n    \n          The \"Wicked\" star's last episode of 'SNL' will air live Saturday evening, with Ariana as host.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Bowen was hired by 'SNL' as a writer in 2018 before joining the cast the following year. During his impressive run, he's earned 5 Primetime Emmy nominations -- 1 for writing and 4 for Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.\n      \n    \n          He's one of many cast members who exited the series this year -- Ego Nwodim, John Higgins, Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim all left. Heidi Gardner also departed, which was a shock to fans.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Bowen Yang\n              \n                          \n                Ariana Grande\n              \n                          \n                Social Media\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                SNL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

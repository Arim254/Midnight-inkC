    "body": "\n\tDisney plans to hold three different events as part of its upfront sales process, guiding advertisers through its ad-tech, sports offerings and overall content slate as the company gears up to sell advertising for its first Super Bowl in more than two decades.\n\n\tThe media giant will hold an event on January 7 to showcase its technology and data capabilities, with a sports-focused showcase on March 24. The company plans its usual late Tuesday afternoon event during the industry’s annual “Upfront Week,” with an event that will take place May 12 at New York’s Javits Center. All three events were revealed in a memo to clients sent Wednesday by Rita Ferro, president of Disney’s ad-sales operations.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve officially kicked off our roadmap, designed to showcase the full breadth of Disney’s capabilities — from content and franchises to data and technology,” Ferro said in a statement.\n\n\n\tThe company’s next upfront will kick off the process for sales tied to Super Bowl LXI, scheduled to  be played February 14, 2027, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Disney’s ABC has not telecast the gridiron classic since 2006, but regained a place in the usual rotation among Fox, NBC and CBS in its most recent deal with the NFL.\n\n\tThe Super Bowl could play a big role in Disney’s upfront sales progress. NBC was able to declare sell out of its looming 2026 broadcast in September, but dispensed with a significant chunk of its inventory ahead of its upfront presentation earlier this year. Even as streaming has eroded the ranks of linear viewers in primetime, sports has built new bulwarks. \n\t\n\n\tAdvertisers still crave the broad, simultaneous viewership such extravaganzas generate, and marketers that in the past might not have spent heavily on sports now see new reasons to do so. Meanwhile, scripted programming, viewed at times of the audience’s own choosing, is less powerful than a key NFL or NBA game, which demands to be watched live.\n\n\tNBCU had been seeking $7 million for a 30-second Super Bowl spot earlier in the year, according to media buyers. Super Bowl LIX, played on Fox earlier this year, came to around $800 million, the company revealed in May.\n\n\tDisney has contemplated some intriguing twists for the NFL extravaganza. ESPN Chairman Jimmy PItaro said in 2012 that the company could try to mount a Super Bowl “mega-cast” across its media portfolio that could create different broadcasts of the gridiron classic tailored to specific types of audiences. The technique is something Disney has been experimenting with frequently in recent years.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat’s the going rate for James Bond‘s license to kill? Well, Amazon MGM paid $20 million for creative control of the 007 franchise.\n\n\tEarlier this year, Bond’s long-time producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli stepped back and ceded creative control to Amazon MGM. The three entities, Wilson, Broccoli and Amazon MGM, formed a joint venture to house the intellectual property rights while allowing all three to remain co-owners of the property. \n\t\n\n\tA recent earnings report for Wilson and Broccoli’s company Eon Productions revealed the cost of doing business — and it’s way less than the $1 billion that had initially been reported. “On 20 February 2025, the company entered into an agreement for the sale of its interest in the Bond franchise, all associated assets as well as its subsidiary companies, B24 Limited and B25 Limited. The total consideration for the sale amounted to $20 million (USD),” the report says. However, the deal’s exact structure isn’t clear and could include stock options or profit sharing that would substantially increase the Broccoli family’s payout.\n\n\n\tAfter Amazon purchased MGM for $8.5 billion in 2021, the company acquired the rights to distribute all James Bond films. However the tech company only owned 50% of the franchise and was relegated to being a passive partner in terms of artistic choices. Shortly after the joint venture was announced, Amy Pascal and David Heyman were tapped to produce the next Bond installment. More recently, “Dune” filmmaker Denis Villeneuve was hired to direct while “Peaky Blinders” creator Steven Knight was appointed to write the screenplay. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s still unclear, however, who will play the tuxedo-wearing, martini-drinking secret spy after Daniel Craig’s wildly successful tenure ended with 2021’s “No Time to Die.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery is officially on the block, disclosing that it has received interest from “multiple parties” to acquire all or part of the company and that its board is reviewing various options. WBD didn’t say so, but David Ellison’s freshly merged Paramount Skydance is one of the bidders making a serious play for the media conglomerate.\n\n\tNeedless to say, such a deal would represent major consolidation in the industry. It would pool Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures, two of Hollywood’s most storied studios, along with their large content libraries. On the TV side, it would bring Paramount’s CBS broadcast, MTV, Comedy Central and BET together with HBO, TNT, TBS, Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network and more from WBD — with CNN and CBS News likely under one umbrella. And a merged Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery would be expected to fuse HBO Max and Paramount+ into a supercharged streaming service.\n\t\n\n\tOf course, a Paramount-WBD merger would undoubtedly include a massive tranche of layoffs, as a union of the two conglomerates would reduce corporate overhead and would consolidate functions across studios, TV and streaming operations. Note that Ellison and his team are expected to begin mass layoffs at Paramount Skydance the week of Oct. 27, eliminating around 2,000 jobs in the U.S. with additional cuts internationally. As of the end of 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery had approximately 35,000 employees, including full- and part-time workers; Paramount Global had 18,600 at the end of last year but has made additional layoffs since then.\n\n\n\tThere’s no guarantee Ellison and his financial partners (which include his mega-billionaire dad, Larry Ellison) will clinch a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD has rejected three offers from the Paramount team, including the latest one for nearly $24/share that comprised 80% cash, CNBC reported Wednesday.\n\t\n\n\tWBD is in the midst of splitting itself into two companies: Warner Bros., housing its streaming and studios businesses, and Discovery Global, with most of WBD’s TV business, a deal projected to be completed by April 2026. Other companies rumored to be interested in Warner Bros. Discovery assets — most likely the Warner Bros. entity with HBO Max and without the rest of the TV networks — include Comcast (which itself is unloading the bulk of NBCUniversal’s TV biz into a new company, Versant), as well as Amazon and Netflix. On Netflix’s earnings interview Tuesday, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” indicating a Netflix bid for WBD in its entirety is off the table; he also said Netflix can be “choosy” with M&A and said it evaluates all potential deals “relative to the price, relative to the opportunity cost, and relative to other alternatives.”\n\n\tAmong the options it is evaluating, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would consider a deal structure under which it would sell Warner Bros. (streaming and studios) alongside a spin-off of Discovery Global to shareholders. “It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,” David Zaslav, Warner Bros. Discovery’s CEO, said in a prepared statement Tuesday. “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.”\n\n\tIt’s a bit of déjà vu: WBD’s Zaslav and Paramount Global’s then-CEO Bob Bakish had met to discuss the possibility of a merger in late 2023 (before the Skydance takeover). But those talks didn’t progress, and Skydance ended up closing on the deal for Paramount.\n\n\tThe future of Warner Bros. Discovery is currently up in the air. But given that Ellison and his financial partners might be able to put together an offer WBD can’t refuse, here’s what a combined Paramount Skydance-WBD would look like.\n\t\n\t\tStudios\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. is home to the DC Universe and Harry Potter film franchises, while Paramount’s portfolio includes Star Trek, Mission: Impossible and Top Gun.\n\n\tWBD’s Studios business includes the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group (comprising Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures Animation), DC Studios and DC Comics Publishing, Warner Bros. Television Group, as well as consumer products, themed entertainment and brand licensing, home entertainment and interactive gaming. Hits in 2025 for the studios biz, in a rebound from recent years, have included James Gunn’s “Superman,” “A Minecraft Movie,” Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan’s “Sinners,” “Final Destination Bloodlines,” Brad Pitt’s “F1: The Movie,” and “Weapons.” In 2024, the studios segment’s highlights were “Dune: Part Two,” “Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice” and “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” on the film side, and “Abbott Elementary,” “Shrinking” and “The Voice” on the TV side.\n\t\n\n\tParamount Pictures’ results for the second quarter of 2025 were lifted by Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” which set a franchise record for the biggest global opening in theaters and grossed nearly $600 million at the global box office. The studio’s franchises include “The Godfather” trilogy, “Indiana Jones,” “Titanic,” “Forrest Gump,” “Top Gun,” “Iron Man,” “Love Story,” “Beverly Hills Cop” and “Saving Private Ryan.” In addition, the company’s filmed entertainment segment includes the Paramount Pictures Studio lot in L.A., spanning roughly 62 acres of land. Paramount Skydance also includes Skydance’s animation, film, TV, games and sports divisions.\n\t\n\t\tStreaming\t\n\n\tWBD’s streaming businesses include HBO Max, which just announced price increases of $1-$2 per month effective Oct. 21, as well as Discovery+ and sports streaming packages. As of the end of June, the services had 57.8 million domestic and 67.9 million international streaming subs, for 125.7 million total. HBO Max includes all current and classic HBO original series including “The Sopranos,” “Game of Thrones,” “Succession,” “The Pitt,” “The Penguin,” “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us,” “Peacemaker,” “Hacks” and “Task” along with shows like “Friends,” “Abbott Elementary,” “Rick and Morty” and “The Big Bang Theory.”\n\n\tParamount+ had 77.7 million subscribers as of the end of June. Paramount also operates the free, ad-supported Pluto TV service and the BET+ subscription service. Paramount+ features original series, shows and movies from brands and studios including BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Pictures and the Smithsonian Channel. Paramount+ Premium is also home to Showtime content, including original scripted series and nonfiction projects and films. The premium plan includes live sports programming through local live CBS streams, and all Paramount+ subscribers have streaming access to CBS News Network and CBS Sports HQ.\n\t\n\t\tTV Networks\t\n\n\tWBD’s linear networks in the U.S. include CNN, TNT, TBS, Turner Classic Movies, OWN, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channel and Adult Swim. In 2024, the company launched CNN International in Europe on Max.\n\t\n\n\tParamount’s TV business comprises CBS – which the company touts as “America’s most‑watched broadcast network” — CBS News, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Smithsonian Channel and TV Land.\n\n\tThe potential combination of CBS News and CNN raises the prospect that Bari Weiss, who was appointed editor-in-chief of CBS News after Paramount Skydance’s $150 million acquisition of her outlet the Free Press, would have some part in the editorial operations of CNN.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tAlthough he calls himself an “Image Architect,” titles don’t matter much to Law Roach. As one of the most influential stylists in Hollywood, his work centers on storytelling.\n\n\t“I use the clothes as my words,” Roach tells Variety. “I think it’s about the narrative. It’s all about why.”\n\n\tWe’ve seen these sartorial stories play out on dozens of his clients over the years — from Celíne Dion and Ariana Grande to Kerry Washington and, of course, Zendaya, who, with alongside Roach, has embodied everybody from the Joan of Arc in custom Versace armor to a metal-constructed cyborg in Thierry Mugler.\n\n\n\tWhile he can be credited with largely catalyzing the surge in method dressing on red carpets, he doesn’t care about taking credit for the burgeoning trend — which doesn’t have signs of going anywhere. \n\n\t“I love it, and I love that other people are adopting it because it’s fun for me to watch.” he says. “We are all entertainers at the end of the day, right? And it’s a part of our job to entertain people – people that go to the office every day or stay at home, moms who have the hardest jobs of anyone. And it gives you five or 10 minutes a day to look at something and enjoy it.”\n\n\tAlthough he announced his retirement in 2023, citing “burn-out,” he’s continued styling Zendaya and  selective clients, and stepped away from the typical schedule of red carpet tours and editing work. Instead, he’s taking on new ventures within the fashion world, most recently as a judge and executive producer on “Project Runway,” which was renewed for a 22nd season this week. \n\n\tThis month, Roach has also taken on a new title: Global Tastemaker for Chase Travel — a strategic move from the credit card company to “position itself at the intersection of travel, culture and lifestyle,” according to the brand. In a press release, Chase Travel says its “leaning into cultural storytelling to drive relevance.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoao Canziani\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoao Canziani\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor Roach, the title was a form of validation more than anything: “For the years of hard work that I worked building my craft and building my clients and myself,” he says. “It’s just a compliment, really.”\n\n\tAs part of the campaign, Roach and Chase launched “The Art of Travel” series, which follows the stylist on a “creative journey” through Istanbul, where he explored fashion, food and design as part of a curated itinerary, which included a stay at the Four Seasons Hotel Istanbul at The Bosphorus to shopping for fragrant spices and vivid textiles at the Grand Bazaar.\n\n\tIn celebration of his new role as Chase Travel’s Global Tastemaker, Variety caught up with Roach to talk about red carpet trends, his favorite Fashion Week this season and being a harsh critic on “Project Runway”:\n\t\n\t\tMuch of this campaign is about advocating for travel. What are the top places you’d recommend people to travel to?\t\n\n\tWell, it depends on what you want to do. If you want to shop, then I definitely think that Tokyo and Japan is one of those places. But if you want to go on a food experience, it’s Asian countries. For me, I’m obsessed with Thailand. Thailand has become my sanctuary for my birthday for the last three years, and it’s just a journey through food for me there. If you want to go party within a culture then I always think South America and Brazil and Carnival and Rio. Which is kind of like a buzzy place as well, but, you know, and also a place where I’ve been that I found very welcoming and full of culture. And I’ve been able to visit Saudi a few times. I think that’s a little bit off the grid for people but I do encourage people to see Saudi. \n\t\n\t\tThere were so many designer shake-ups at designer houses during this past fashion season. What was the best fashion week this year, in your opinion?\t\n\n\tThat is such a shady question. I want to say New York because I’m actually in New York right now and New York is what what trained  me and help me grow my skills as a stylist. But I think Paris had to have the most exciting Fashion Week this season, with all the new appointments — Jonathan Anderson at Dior and Matthieu Blazy at Chanel. So I have to say Paris. \n\t\n\t\tYou’re the king of media-trained answers. It reminds me of the other night when you were asked about Kim Kardashian’s bush thong…\t\n\n\tIt wasn’t shady. I was really just giving an honest answer. Because I have this persona and my  television work has casted some shady moments. So I think that anytime I’m just trying to answer a question honestly, people just…but I love the debate, though. Because there are all these debates on Tiktok, ‘Was I being shady that night? I’m like, ‘As long as people are talking and having fun with this back and forth, then whatever.’ But the people who know me know that there was no shade there at all. \n\n\t\n\t\tYou really helped catalyze the trend of red carpet method dressing, which really hit a fever pitch during the past year. How do you feel about it as we enter another awards season?\t\n\n\tI think it’s fun. I think it’s fun for the people at home to watch. Again, I’m a storyteller, and the clothes are my words. And I think for me, and for Zendaya in particular, and I just actually did it with Jody Turner Smith for the Tron press tour. People just really enjoy it. And we are all entertainers, right? And it’s a part of our job to entertain people – people that go to office every day or stay at home, moms who have the hardest jobs of anyone. And it gives you five or 10 minutes a day to look at something and enjoy it.\n\n\tFor me in my work, I think I leave some Easter eggs where people have to kind of dig a little bit to find a reference and I think that’s just what I’ve learned and what I’ve been told that is just fun. I just want to be an entertainer at the end of the day, and I just want to make people happy through my work. Since my retirement, I really found  that brings me the most joy. And so fine. I love it, and I love that other people are adapting it because it’s fun for me to watch. \n\n\tI thought that Jenna Ortega’s press tour for ‘Wednesday’ was really beautiful and really well crafted, and it was cool. And so I like that people are doing it, whether they give me credit for it or not. Who cares? But it’s fun for me, as a fan of fashion, to watch it as well. \n\t\n\t\tYou are now a judge on ‘Project Runway’ which was just renewed for Season 22, for which you’re also an executive producer. What has been the biggest challenge in terms of balancing being encouraging with contestants and giving them honest feedback?\t\n\n\tI don’t think anything was challenging because that’s what I do. I think I would be giving these kids a disservice to not be honest. Everybody doesn’t get a trophy in the real world. There’s one winner and everybody else is a loser. And it is what it is. And I just think that for me in my career people were like ‘That’s bad.’ And I grew from that and it helps you. And I think I also earned the right.\n\n\tFor a long time in reality TV, there’s been this political correctness and it’s like ‘A for effort.’ And I don’t think that’s the real world and it’s definitely not fashion. If a designer puts out a bad collection, people are gonna let them know they put out a bad collection. And what you do is you take that and you take the critiques that make sense to you and you use that to help you grow. \n\n\n\tIf you’re a fan of the show, you notice that when they went back to that room and I was tough, they were like, ‘Okay, I’m gonna come out and I’m gonna prove him wrong next week.’ And a lot of them did that. And I think if I hadn’t given those critiques, then the work would have been stagnant and they wouldn’t have grown. And some people that were in the bottom ended up being really successful in the show. Plus, it’s just my personality and I’m just not a liar. I don’t lie in real life and I’m damn sure not gonna lie on television. So it is what it is. Love it or hate it. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Cabin at the End of the World and “Horror Movie” author is back with another dark vision — and this time it’s tech-focused.\n\n\t“Dead But Dreaming of Electric Sheep” was just announced as the upcoming novel from horror writer Paul Tremblay, and is set to be on sale June 30, 2026 from William Morrow.\n\n\tHere is the novel’s wild premise, per the press release: “Meet Julia Flang, a twenty-something former semi-professional gamer, living with her retired uncle, and working two jobs she doesn’t like. Out of the blue, her estranged mother, a CFO for one of the world’s largest tech companies, offers her a temp job with a payday Julia can’t refuse. One sham interview later, she’s offered the job: to chaperone a man in a vegetative state—one with proprietary AI implanted in his head—from California to the East Coast.\n\t\n\n\t“To sum up in Julia’s own words: ‘You want me to remote control this dead dude across the country.’ In a word, yes. But he’s not dead dead.\n\n\n\t“Meet a middle-aged man who wakes within a disorienting hellscape filled with monstrous grotesqueries. Worse than the fluid, morphing reality in which he’s trapped, he has no memory of who he is. He certainly doesn’t remember getting the rabbit tattoo on his arm. He only knows that he must find a certain person. Who? He can’t remember.\n\n\t“Using a cell phone modeled after a video game controller, Julia fumblingly navigates the man she calls “Bernie’ from the company campus and onto planes and through one of the largest airports in America. All the while, the man endures an ever-changing and worsening nightmare that offers clues as to who he was—and who he must track down. And as their two lives intertwine, Julia and Bernie become unlikely allies and fugitives on a collision course with reality.”\n\t\n\n\t“Dead But Dreaming of Electric Sheep” is now available for preorder. The novel’s first excerpt is below.\n\n\n\t“So, you know when you use jumpers to start your car, your car isn’t fixed. You don’t just start driving around and go on with your day. You jump start the car so that it can travel a relatively short distance to where it can be fixed.”\n\n\t“So, we’re trying to fix him.”\n\n\t“No, we’re not.”\n\n\t“And didn’t you say you were transporting him to the east coast? That’s hardly a short distance.”\n\n\t“I acknowledge the metaphor falls apart at the end, which is a shame. Anyway, the implanted tech will enable and facilitate electric communication between the man’s remaining healthy brain cells. Again, the man will not be conscious or aware of any of this. The man is gone. There is no him left of him. Only the machine of his body. And the tech allows a remote user—” Brady points at Julia and her insides turns to liquid “—to regulate and control his large muscle groups.” Brady smiles, chuckles softly to himself, and relaxes his posture. “We have achieved context.”\n\n\t“Wait. No, we haven’t.” Julia stands and paces the length of the stale bagel couch, places both hands atop her head. She’s both excited and absolutely terrified, and she wants to laugh a manic, we-are-fucking-doomed kind of laugh. “I get it. But. What?”\n\n\tBrady says, “With the tech, we can get his body—a body, remember, no longer a him—to move, to wave an arm, to walk and turn and stop and sit via a digital command panel, an interface no more complex than a video game controller or a smart phone app. Given your gaming prowess—and assuming you pass a virtual run-through we have set up for you—we are asking you to pilot this the man safely across the country in accordance with his wishes and permissions, and—” he turns, pantomimes that a secret is forthcoming by placing a hand on one side of his mouth while talking out of the other “—as the tech’s maiden voyage and proof-of-concept for our investors who very much want us to be first with this technology.”\n\n\tJulia continues pacing the length of the bagel couch as though her own body is moving at the behest of another mind. She knows the answer to her next question but she asks it anyway. “How remote can the remote user be?”\n\n\t“In terms of distance, the user needs to be within thirty feet of our man to ensure the wireless connection remains uninterrupted.”\n\t\n\n\t“You want me to remote control this dead dude across the country.”\n\n\t“Technically, as you pointed out, he’s not dead. Yet. But in a word, yes.”\n\n\t“Like a more fucked-up version of the movie Weekend at Bernie’s.”\n\n\t“I don’t know that movie.”\n\n\t“Seriously? Two, young insurance bros present evidence of fraud to the big boss—Bernie—and he invites them to his beach house that weekend as, like, a reward. Bernie really invites them over to have them killed because he’s the one behind the whole fraud scheme. Then, the mob kills Bernie with an injection of heroin before the insurance bros show up. When the bros find his dead body, they decide to pretend Bernie is still alive, mainly by putting sunglasses on Bernie’s face, but also, they drag Bernie around the beach and town, their arms and legs tied together so when they move Bernie moves, yeah? They throw a big party at his house, and things get so weird and wacky and, um—” Here, Julia stammers for the right word while sinking toward sitting on the couch and while also sinking toward feeling ridiculous because of her compulsion to compare real life to films, usually older films no one in the vicinity of her age bracket has seen. “—and icky. Definitely icky. I mean, it’s a classic movie. Not really a classic classic, but you should be culturally aware of it.”\n\n\tBrady nods, narrows his eyes, deeply considering the plot of the 1989 farce. “I did see Swiss Army Man,” he says. “It wasn’t my cup of tea. Speaking of hot brewed beverages, how about we go downstairs to the café for your coffee and then we’ll go on over to R and D for the virtual test and training. I thought this interview went swimmingly.”\n\n\t“Did you in fact interview me?”\n\n\t“Our interview process isn’t a static question and answer session and is more like an ongoing, living, breathing process.” Brady says. “I’m not supposed to tell you, but I’m sending along my highest marks and recommendations. Frankly, I wish I’d known about Weekend at Bernie’s and gone with that as the lead comparison instead of the jumper cable metaphor.” Brady claps a hand against his lap and stands ups, slowly, wincing at the knee that clearly still bothers him.\n\n\tJulia distends her cheeks with air then smooshes it all out with her hands. “Hold on. I haven’t said yes to anything yet. Well, other than coffee and maybe a breakfast sandwich. I say yes to that. But I also want to know more about the tech itself and how it works, and the interface, and like why? What’s the point of it? And holy shit, by what mode of transportation would I be getting Bernie across the country?”\n\t\n\n\t“Bernie?”\n\n\t“Well, yeah. That’s what I’m calling him for now.”\n\n\t“First, I acknowledge you haven’t said yes to anything yet. You can say no at any time. We are not the armed forces. You haven’t been conscripted. Second, one of the engineers who is going to run you through the paces,” Brady pantomimes running, “will be better able to answer those bigger questions for you. Okay?”\n\n\t“One last smaller question, then.”\n\n\t“Fire away,” he says, and yes, he shoots a hand pistol at her.\n\n\t“How much did the company pay her?”\n\n\t“Pay who?”\n\n\t“Bernie’s mom.”\n\n\t“Oh, I have no idea. But I bet it was a shit ton.”\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tThe Mitchells and the machines are readying for a rematch.\n\n\tSony Pictures Animation is making a sequel to its 2021 Oscar-nominated feature “The Mitchells vs. the Machines,” with Guillermo Martinez (head of story for the first “Mitchells” film) and JP Sans (co-director of “The Bad Guys 2”) signing on to direct, marking Martinez’s directorial debut. Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin (“The Great North”), known professionally as the Molyneux sisters, are writing the screenplay. Production is expected to begin in early 2026.\n\n\n\tAs with the original, Netflix will distribute the “Mitchells” sequel as part of a licensing agreement with Sony. The first film was initially slated to be released by Sony Pictures in 2020 after the title was changed to “Connected,” but following delays due to the COVID pandemic, Netflix picked up the film (under its original title) for reportedly more than $100 million. The studios are planning a more collaborative partnership on the second “Mitchells” movie. (Sony’s recent animated feature “KPop Demon Hunters” landed at Netflix under a separate output deal with the streamer; it’s now Netflix’s most-watched movie ever and the companies are in talks for a sequel.)\n\n\t“The Mitchells vs. the Machines” follows the titular family as they drive their eldest daughter, Katie (Abbi Jacobson), across the country to film school in California. While en route, a rogue AI called PAL (Olivia Colman) commanders an army of robots to launch a worldwide rebellion against humanity. It’s up to the Mitchells — including Katie’s technophobic father, Rick (Danny McBride), overly sweet mother, Linda (Maya Rudolph) and hyperactive younger brother, Aaron (Mike Rianda) — to save the day. The film won wide praise for its hand-painted animation style, won eight Annie Awards, including for animated feature, and was nominated for best animated feature at the Oscars.\n\n\n\tPhil Lord and Christopher Miller are producing through their company Lord Miller, and Kurt Albrecht is producing for Sony Pictures Animation. Rianda, who co-wrote and directed the original, is an executive producer, along with Lord Miller’s Aditya Sood.\n\t\n\n\tMartinez started out on the 2019 Laika production “Missing Link”; after serving as head of story on the first “Mitchells vs. Machines” film, he worked on 2023’s “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” and on “KPop Demon Hunters.”\n\n\tPrior to co-directing 2025’s “The Bad Guys 2” with Pierre Perifel, Sans worked as an animator on several DreamWorks Animation films, including “Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken,” “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” and “Trolls World Tour.”\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Jay Kelly,” a dramedy about a movie star looking back on his life on- and off-screen, is also a celebration of cinema magic. To play into the Noah Baumbach film’s themes, Netflix will offer “Jay Kelly” in specialty screenings in historic movie palaces around the world.\n\n\tLike many of Netflix’s fall awards contenders, “Jay Kelly” will get an exclusive theatrical release before debuting on the streaming service. However, the company is tailoring the venues so that they can serve as “an homage to cinema’s golden age, mirroring the atmosphere and themes of the film.” Shot and printed on 35mm Kodak film stock, “Jay Kelly” will screen in 35mm in select locations. Screening attendees will receive limited-edition film programs.\n\t\n\n\t“It is incredibly meaningful to have ‘Jay Kelly’ screened in so many historic movie palaces around the world,” Baumbach said in a statement. “Going to the movies in one of these theaters is a singular moviegoing experience and is to be treasured and supported. ‘Jay Kelly’ is in part a celebration of the medium and this theatrical run feels like a further celebration.”\n\n\n\tIn addition to Netflix’s own historic theaters, the Egyptian and the Paris, others participating include the Vista (Los Angeles), Nitehawk Cinema (Brooklyn), the Music Box (Chicago), River Oaks Theater (Houston), Smith Rafael Film Center (San Rafael, CA), State Theater (Traverse City, MI), Michigan Theater (Ann Arbor), Mayan Theater (Denver), Hollywood Theater (Portland), Coolidge Corner (Boston), Grand Lake Theater (Oakland), Tower Theater (Sacramento), Plaza Theater (Atlanta), Cineteca Nacional de Mexico (Mexico City), Victoria Eugenia Theatre (San Sebastian), Picturehouse Central (London), Stella Cinema Rathmines (Dublin), Delphi Filmpalast (Berlin), Cinerama Empire (Geneva), Ritz Cinemas (Sydney) and Shin Bugeiza (Tokyo). Netflix notes that many of these cinemas have been restored to their former glory.\n\t\n\n\t“Jay Kelly” stars George Clooney, Adam Sandler, Billy Crudup and Laura Dern. Since debuting at the Venice Film Festival, the film has been tapped as a major Oscar contender. Other Netflix releases that will be getting an exclusive theatrical release this fall before debuting on the service include Kathryn Bigelow’s “A House of Dynamite” and Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein.”\n\n\t“Jay Kelly” will open in theaters on Nov. 14 before launching on Netflix on Dec. 5. \n",

    "body": "\n\tA Broadway opening often marks the culmination of a years-long journey for the collaborators who have created a show, whether they’re working on a new musical or a revival of a familiar play. On the final, supersized episode of Variety’s theater podcast, “Stagecraft,” the stars behind some of the buzziest titles of the 2025-26 season shared some of their backstage secrets now that their own shows have opened on Broadway after years of development.\n\t\n\n\tListen to this week’s “Stagecraft” podcast below:\n\n\n\tSpeaking earlier this month at the Variety Business of Broadway 2025 breakfast presented by City National Bank, notable names including Keanu Reeves, Kristin Chenoweth, Stephen Schwartz, Lea Michele and more brought listeners behind the scenes of four productions now turned heads in the theater district: “Chess,” “Ragtime,” “The Queen of Versailles” and “Waiting for Godot.”\n\n\n\tThe morning’s discussions and panel conversations are presented in full in the latest episode of “Stagecraft.” Among the tidbits dropped along the way:\n\n\nDuring three years of prep for the revival of “Waiting for Godot,” now raking in big bucks at the box office each week, headliners (and “Bill and Ted” stars) Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter studied clowning and butoh, the Japanese dance-performance form, in order to bring physical life to the two tramps they portray in the show.\nThat production’s striking, funnel-like set has spawned a host of nicknames, including “the eye,” “the sewer,” “the portal,” “the Habitrail” and “the subwoofer.”\nIn the rehearsal room for “Chess,” there was an ongoing, open chess game available for the actors and creatives to play. (Stars Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher may portray rival chess prodigies in the show, but they’ve never faced off across a chess board in real life. At least not yet.)\nBrandon Uranowitz, now starring as Tateh in “Ragtime” on Broadway, appeared as a young boy in the musical’s 1996 world premiere in Toronto before the musical moved to Broadway in 1998. “They brought everyone in that cast to Broadway except for me,” Uranowitz laughed.\nChenoweth is not only the star of “Queen of Versailles” — she’s also a first-time Broadway producer on the show. “Still learning. Love it,” she said. “I really do enjoy the process and I hope to do more, not just for myself but for other actors that I believe in.”\n\n\n\n\tAlso during their conversations, both Michele and Chenoweth said their latest roles gave them a chance to try something new. For Michele (“Spring Awakening”), it was the opportunity to portray a full-grown woman: “It’s the first time that I’m really playing an adult on Broadway,” she said. “Every show that I’ve ever done — I literally played the Little Girl in ‘Ragtime’ [in 1998], and even in ‘Funny Girl,’ she starts off at 16 before she ages up,” the actor said.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Chenoweth said she relishes the opportunity to play a real person in “The Queen of Versailles,” which is based on a 2012 documentary. “I won a Tony for playing a cartoon [in ‘You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown’], and I played a girl from Oz [in ‘Wicked’],” she joked. “‘Queen of Versailles’ just seemed like the right move.”\n\t\n\n\tThe day’s Business of Broadway panels also revealed the secret origins of some of the season’s big shows — including the moment of divine inspiration that led to the new “Godot.” As Reeves recalled: “I was in a hotel room around 1:00 am with jet lag in London, and I was in a fugue state, and then something came from the universe and said: Do ‘Waiting for Godot’ with Alex.'”\n\n\tTo hear the entire conversation, listen at the link above or download on podcast platforms including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and the Broadway Podcast Network. “Stagecraft” will be ending with this episode, but listen for more theater talk in upcoming episodes of the “Daily Variety” podcast.\n",

They brought the price down to the eventual sale price in July ... so, it looks like they'll make a tidy profit on the property.\n      \n    \n          As you know, the two announced they separated earlier this month ... and, our sources told us the two were living in separate houses -- Lori in L.A. and Mossimo up in Sun Valley, Idaho. It's unclear if Lori was living in this particular property or somewhere else.\n      \n    \n          BTW ... the house is one less asset to worry about for the estranged couple -- but, this is still shaping up to be a messy divorce, 'cause we're told an original prenuptial agreement may prevent LL from getting anything in the split. Our sources say Lori doesn't see herself as single yet ... and, the prenup may explain why.\n      \n    \n          Looks like Lori's will be starring in \"Empty House\" ...

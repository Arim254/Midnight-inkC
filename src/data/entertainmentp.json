    "body": "\n\tTwo years after he explored how former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein evaded capture following his ousting from power in the 2023 documentary “Hiding Saddam Hussein,” Kurdish/Norwegian filmmaker Halkawt Mustafa is delving back into Iraq’s recent history. \n\n\t“No Paradise if You Are Killed by a Woman,” now in post-production, leaps forward a decade from the fall of Saddam and to the rise of the Islamic State. This time a drama, the feature follows a Kurdish-Norwegian female sniper who returns to the battlefield she once escaped, driven by vengeance and by the desperate hope of rescuing her younger sister, still imprisoned by ISIS in Mosul. Rising Kurdish star Avan Jamal (“The Exam”) plays the lead, while Norwegian actor Thorbjørn Harr (“The Tunnel,” “22 July”) also stars. \n\t\n\n\t“This is a poetic portrait of a woman warrior who refused to bow to darkness,” Mustafa told Variety.\n\n\n\tThe story is rooted in the filmmaker’s own encounters with several women who fought against ISIS, and was inspired by the courage of Nobel Peace Prize laureate and human rights activist Nadia Murad, who was abducted by the terrorist group during the Yazidi genocide of 2014. “Her courage in sharing her story with the world has been a guiding force for this project,” he said.\n\n\tMustafa wrote and directed “No Paradise if You Are Killed by a Woman” and also produces through his Norway-based Hene Films AS banner, alongside Janne Hjeltnes, John M. Jacobsen. Conversations are currently underway with international sales agents and distributors. \n\n\t“Hiding Saddam Hussein,” which bowed at the 2023 Red Sea Film Festival, saw Mustafa speak to Alaa Namiq, the Iraqi farmer who hid Hussein from the U.S. army for 235 days, with the toppled dictator famously spending much of that time in a specially-dug spider hole. The film would up becoming one of the highest-grossing documentary films in the Arab box office. \n",

A remake of Majid Majidi’s iconic Iranian classic, the Indonesian version retains the emotional core of siblings sharing a single pair of shoes in shifts to avoid disappointing their parents, while a third-place prize in a local race becomes the boy’s desperate hope of making things right.

After collapsing during a confrontation on the pitch, he awakens in another realm and meets Gaga — a glowing Garuda spirit who gifts him a mystical jersey that grants supernatural speed and skill. On a magical field, he even duels national team captain Bayu before being pulled back and warned that the jersey’s power belongs only to those worthy of it. Balancing magic with determination, Putra must now rise on his own merit. The animated–live-action hybrid is positioned as a major family franchise starter.\n\t\n\t\tGhost in the Cell\t\n\n\tDirector: Joko AnwarProducer: Tia HasibuanProduction Companies: Come and See Pictures, Rapi Films, Barunson E&A (Korea), Legacy PicturesCast: Abimana Aryasatya, Bront Palarae, Danang Suryonegoro, Endy Arfian, Lukman Sardi, Mike Lucock, Yoga Pratama, Morgan Oey, Aming, Kiki Narendra, Rio Dewanto, Tora Sudiro, Almanzo Konoralma, Haydar Salishz, Arswendy Bening Swara, Dewa Dayana, Faiz Vishal, Jaisal Tanjung, Ho Yuhang, Magistus Miftah\n\t\n\n\tSet inside Labuan Angsana — one of Indonesia’s most notorious prisons — Joko Anwar’s latest is a horror-comedy. Rival gangs and abusive guards already make survival a waking nightmare, but when an unseen force begins slaughtering inmates one by one, the prison spirals into chaos. Killers, thieves and conmen must do the unthinkable: work together to stay alive. The film aims to blend claustrophobic tension with dark humor. Backed by Barunson E&A, the Korean studio behind “Parasite,” the project marks one of the most significant Indonesia–Korea collaborations to date.\n\t\n\t\tThe Last Flight (Penerbangan Terakhir)\t\n\n\tDirector: Benni SetiawanProducer: Tony RameshProduction Company: Visual Media StudioCast: Jerome Kurnia, Nadya Arina, Aghniny Haque\n\n\tThe glossy aviation thriller centers on a charismatic pilot whose manipulative relationships with multiple flight attendants unravel into a scandal at 30,000 feet.

Anggi Noen blends poetry, memory and political grief in a story that confronts a pivotal chapter of Indonesian history still reverberating today. The director, whose films have been recognized at Locarno, adapts one of Indonesia’s most beloved literary works into what aims to be a sweeping, politically resonant screen drama.\n\t\n\t\tSleep No More (Monster Pabrik Rambut)\t\n\n\tDirector: EdwinProducers: Meiske Taurisia, Muhammad ZaidyProduction Companies: Palari Films, Beacon Film, Giraffe Pictures (Singapore), Hassaku Labs, In Good Company, Apsara FilmsCast: Rachel Amanda, Lutesha, Iqbaal Ramadhan, Sal Priadi, Luqman Kev, Didik Nini Thowok\n\n\tA surreal parable about a world so obsessed with productivity that humans surrender even their sleep, allowing a shadowy, hair-covered entity to take over their exhausted bodies.

    "description": "\n\tSky has released a trailer for “Gomorrah – The Series. The Origins,” the hotly anticipated prequel show to gritty Neapolitan mob series “Gomorrah,” ",
    "body": "\n\tSky has released a trailer for “Gomorrah – The Series. The Origins,” the hotly anticipated prequel show to gritty Neapolitan mob series “Gomorrah,” which is Italy’s biggest TV export.\n\n\tThe Comcast-owned pay-TV service, as previously announced, has set a still-unspecified January release in Italy for the six-part limited series. Set in the 1970s, it traces the rise of mobster Pietro Savastano, who in “Gomorrah” is the head of the drug-dealing clan that bears his name. Savastano is played in the prequel by 16-year-old Naples native Luca Lubrano.\n\t\n\n\tThe show will roll out in the five other European counties where Sky is active, including the U.K. and Germany, in early 2026.As the trailer shows, the origins story starts in 1977 with a very young Savastano, who grows up as an adoptive child in a dirt poor family in the Naples slum of Secondigliano. He’s a street kid who hustles and dreams of raising his economic status just as he loses his innocence along with his brothers and lifelong friends and experiences a first great love “which, like for every teenager, will be crazy and passionate,” according to the provided synopsis. His meeting with Angelo, known as ‘A Sirena,’ the mob boss of Secondigliano, then marks his entry into the world of crime. “Amid violence, alliances and betrayals, Pietro discovers at his own expense the price that that this life entails,” the synopsis says.\n\n\tThe prequel series is lead-directed by Marco D’Amore, who starred as ruthless central character Ciro Di Marzio in the “Gomorrah” original series.\n\n\tDuring a recent press presentation, the show’s lead producer Riccardo Tozzi said D’Amore drew inspiration for the tone of “Gomorrah — The Origins” from Sergio Leone’s epic “Once Upon a Time in America,” about two childhood friends from New York’s Lower East Side who become powerful gangsters during the 1920s.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s ‘Gomorrah’ because we have the show’s key characters, but it’s also something different,” Tozzi said. “It’s another narrative, another world.” Unlike the hyper-realistic contemporary Naples depicted in “Gomorrah” that brought audiences inside the belly of the real Neapolitan criminal underworld, the “Gomorrah” origins show portrays “a very beautiful Naples that is almost a fantasy,” the producer added.\n\n\tJust like the original, “Gomorrah – The Series. The Origins” is being produced by Sky Studios and Cattleya, which is part of ITV Studios, and will be sold internationally by Beta Film. \n\n\t“Gomorrah” ran for five seasons between 2014 and 2021 The gritty show traveled to 190 countries, including the U.S., where it played on HBO Max.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesia’s screen industry is entering what a new JAFF Market–Cinepoint study calls a “decisive new phase,” with local films driving attendance, investor confidence rising, and the market outperforming its Southeast Asian peers. \n\n\tThe Film Industry Report 2025 positions the country as both the region’s fastest-growing theatrical market and one of the most dynamic globally.\n\n\n\tAccording to the report, admissions for Indonesian films hit 82 million in 2024 and are projected to surpass 100 million within five years, while annual output is on track to reach 200 theatrical titles by 2028. Local productions commanded 65% of the national box office in 2024, with the top 10 Indonesian titles attracting 33.5 million admissions — far ahead of imported films’ 20.1 million.\n\t\n\n\tThe study notes that Indonesia’s box office rebounded faster than most international markets after the pandemic: receipts surged from below $75 million in 2020 to $392 million in 2024, overtaking Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand. Globally, Indonesia ranked ninth in both cinema admissions (127 million) and film production (241 features) in 2024 — despite major markets registering only modest growth or declines.\n\n\n\tYet the report highlights a paradox. Indonesia remains profoundly underscreened, with just 7.7 screens per million people — far below South Korea, Japan, China and Malaysia — even though the country had 6,600 screens during its 1980s peak, compared to only 2,354 today. Most screens are concentrated in Java, and Cinema XXI alone controls about 60% of the national total, one of the most dominant single-operator positions in the world.\n\t\n\n\tThis structural concentration has intensified another issue: the absence of a distributor layer. The report calls this Indonesia’s “missing link.” Producers must negotiate directly with exhibitors, carry all marketing and commercial risk, and rely on first-day performance to secure screen time — a system that disadvantages films that build slowly on word of mouth.\n\n\tProduction, meanwhile, is undergoing a generational shift. While long-dominant studios such as MD Pictures, Starvision Plus and Falcon continue to anchor the market, the report shows a new set of leaders emerging. The Top 10 production houses by number of releases in 2022–2025 listed in the report are: Legacy Pictures, Falcon, MVP Pictures, Starvision Plus, RAPI Films, Pichouse Films, MD Pictures, Visinema 786 Productions and IDN Media.\n\n\tMany of these companies, the report notes, are scaling rapidly through co-production and co-financing models. Hits such as “Agak Laen,” “Sore,” “Siksa Kubur” and “Pengepungan di Bukit Duri” illustrate rising creative confidence and audience appetite for hybridised genres.\n\n\tHorror now leads the Indonesian box office outright. Half of the top 10 Indonesian films by admissions since 2011 are horror titles, and recent successes blend horror with comedy or drama, mirroring global trends and widening the genre’s commercial reach.\n\n\tThe report also stresses that filmgoing remains cultural bedrock. Indonesia’s cinema culture dates back to 1900, and moviegoing habits historically rose and fell with the industry’s creative cycles. But affordability remains a major barrier: when measured against GDP per capita, Indonesia ranks as the least affordable cinema market among those compared — even though the average ticket price is only around $3.\n\n\tEconomically, the screen sector’s impact is considerable. It contributes $5.1 billion to GDP and supports nearly 400,000 jobs. Every trillion rupiah in new investment can produce almost $900 million in economic output and create close to 4,000 skilled jobs — positioning film as not just a cultural force but a powerful economic multiplier.\n\n\tTo convert momentum into long-term stability, the report outlines three priority reforms: modernising film policy (including replacing censorship with classification and enforcing data transparency), expanding market access through fairer screen allocation and regional film commissions, and attracting “smart capital” supported by tax rebates and production-based incentives.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEddie Cahyono, whose 2014 drama “Siti” won the Piala Citra for best film at the Indonesian Film Festival, has his latest work “My Mother” selected for the JAFF Future Project as a work-in-progress, about a widow who wants to meet her daughter sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia for murdering her employer.\n\n\tThe Indonesia production, directed by Cahyono and produced by Tika Bravani, Eddie Cahyono and Isabelle Glachant through production companies ANP Talenta Media, Memorieslight Pictures, Yasa Buana Film, Knockonwood.inc and Sasha & Co Production, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\t“My Mother” follows a widow attempting to reunite with her daughter who has been sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia for murdering her employer. However, the daughter refuses to see her mother, having never forgiven her for past betrayals.\n\n\n\tThe project stems from a deeply personal memory for Cahyono. “‘My mother once told me that she left the village to go to the city for a better life. And that touched my heart,'” the director says. “That memory prompted me to research migrant workers. They dream that working abroad will be a solution to their families’ financial problems.”\n\n\tWhat surprised the director during his research were the domestic problems faced by those who worked abroad. “What surprised me was that those who worked abroad had problems with their families in Indonesia,” he says. “Domestic violence or even those who were forced into marriage by their parents to cover debts.”\n\n\tThis led Cahyono to shift his focus to the families in Indonesia. “I then became interested in the families they left behind,” he says. “Parents, mothers, and fathers, what happened to them, how did they feel after their children left? This story contains questions about separation, loss, and how to let go.”\n\t\n\n\tThe director emphasizes the broader significance of the story beyond individual characters. “This film is about a mother’s impossible choice, the strength of the human spirit, and the desperate realities faced by women migrant workers,” Cahyono says. \n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the production team seeks crucial industry partnerships. “The film market is crucial to the film industry,” the filmmakers say. “The JAFF Market aims to gain exposure and collaborate with co-funding, distribution, and festivals. And, of course, how the ‘My Mother’ film project will be recognized by the wider public.”\n\n\tJAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe makers of upcoming biographical drama “V. Shantaram” have unveiled the first look of Siddhant Chaturvedi as the legendary Indian filmmaker.\n\n\tThe announcement poster introduces Chaturvedi in the title role of V. Shantaram, the auteur long celebrated as a visionary of Indian cinema. The film chronicles Shantaram’s remarkable journey from the silent era through the advent of sound and color, showcasing his evolution as one of India’s most influential filmmakers.\n\t\n\n\tV. Shantaram, born Shantaram Rajaram Vankudre in 1901, was a pioneering force in Indian cinema whose career spanned nearly seven decades. He founded two major film studios — Prabhat Film Company in 1929 and Rajkamal Kalamandir in 1942 — and directed the first Marathi-language talkie, “Ayodhyecha Raja,” in 1932. His films, including classics like “Duniya Na Mane” (1937), “Do Aankhen Barah Haath” (1957), “Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje” (1955) and “Navrang” (1959) were celebrated for their technical innovations and progressive social themes addressing issues like communal harmony, dowry, and prisoner rehabilitation. Known for his signature style of lavish sets, unique song picturizations, and visual symbolism — he used cinema as an instrument for social change throughout his career. He received India’s highest film honor, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, in 1985. \n\n\n\tWritten and directed by Abhijeet Shirish Deshpande, the project is presented by Rajkamal Enterttainment, Camera Take Films and Roaring Rivers Productions. Rahul Kiran Shantaram, Subhash Kale and Sarita Ashwin Varde serve as producers.\n\n\t“Portraying V. Shantaram-ji is one of the greatest honors of my life,” Chaturvedi said. “The more I read about his journey, the more humbled I felt. He wasn’t just a pioneer of Indian and global cinema, he was a visionary who kept pushing forward no matter the obstacles. Stepping into his world has been my most transformative experience as an actor. His life moved me deeply and reminded me of the power of perseverance. It’s a lesson I hope to hold close, both in my work and in every moment of my life.”\n\t\n\n\tDirector Deshpande said, “V. Shantaram has been a huge source of inspiration for me as a filmmaker. His courage to experiment and his vision shaped so much of the cinema we know today. Telling his story is an honour and I hope we do justice to the man behind the legend. With this first poster, we are sharing a glimpse of that journey, with Siddhant Chaturvedi stepping into a role we always believed he was meant to play.”\n\n\tProducer Kale added, “V. Shantaram-ji’s legacy is one of the strongest pillars of Indian cinema. His vision, his struggles and his innovations continue to inspire all of us who work in this industry. With this film, we hope to honour his journey in the most sincere way possible. As we unveil the first poster today, we are proud to have Siddhant Chaturvedi step into his shoes. His sincerity and commitment make him a fitting face to carry forward Shantaram ji’s legacy.”\n\n\tProducer Varde added, “V. Shantaram isn’t just one of the greatest architects of Indian cinema, he is its heartbeat. Yet his extraordinary vision and contributions have often remained under celebrated. With this film, we hope to bring his legacy into the spotlight. Siddhant Chaturvedi was our first and only choice for the part. His passion and sincerity made him the natural choice to portray Shantaram-ji on screen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tT-Series and JP Films have unveiled the first look of Diljit Dosanjh from “Border 2,” revealing the film will expand its scope to include the Indian Air Force alongside ground forces.\n\n\tThe poster shows Dosanjh in a fighter jet cockpit, portraying an Indian Air Force officer. The image marks a significant expansion of the franchise’s narrative scope, signaling that aerial combat will feature prominently alongside traditional battlefield sequences.\n\t\n\n\tSet in 1971, the original “Border” (1997) was headlined by Sunny Deol, and took place along the border region of Longewala, where a small battalion of Indian soldiers fought a large Pakistani strike force. It is considered a landmark Indian war film. \n\n\n\t“Border 2” is directed by Anurag Singh who previously helmed Akshay Kumar-starring “Kesari” (2019), based on the Battle of Saragarhi in which an army of 21 Sikhs fought against 10,000 Afghans in 1897.\n\n\tThe film reunites Dosanjh with Singh, with whom he has collaborated on multiple successful Punjabi-language films including “Jatt & Juliet” (2012), “Jatt & Juliet 2” (2013), “Disco Singh” (2014), “Punjab 1984” (2014), and “Super Singh” (2017). The film stars Sunny Deol, Varun Dhawan, Dosanjh, Ahan Shetty, Medha Rana, Mona Singh and Sonam Bajwa.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Bhushan Kumar, JP Dutta and Nidhi Dutta under the T-Series and JP Films banners. Presented by Gulshan Kumar and T-Series in association with J.P. Dutta’s J.P. Films, the production team includes Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar, J.P. Dutta and Nidhi Dutta.\n\n\tThe release is strategically scheduled for Jan. 23, 2026, positioning the patriotic actioner for the Republic Day weekend in India, a prime slot for films celebrating national themes.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” stormed the China box office over the Nov. 28–30 frame, opening to RMB1.538 billion ($216.6 million) across its first two days and reaching RMB1.922 billion ($270.7 million) through Sunday, according to Artisan Gateway. \n\n\tWith previews included, the Walt Disney sequel has amassed an estimated $272 million — one of the most explosive launches in the market’s history.\n\n\n\tThe debut ranks as the sixth-highest opening of all time in China among all films, and the second-biggest for a non-local title behind “Avengers: Endgame.” It is also the highest animated opening ever in China for a non-local release. After just five days, “Zootopia 2” has become the highest-grossing non-local animated film of all time in the market, and the highest-grossing imported film since “Avengers: Endgame” (2019). It is already the fourth-highest animated film ever released in China, local or foreign, and has overtaken the lifetime $236 million total of the original “Zootopia.” The first film was beloved in China, but the property has exploded in popularity ever since a Zootopia Land opened at the Shanghai Disneyland theme park.\n\t\n\n\tThe film also delivered China’s ninth-highest single-day gross on Day 4, which additionally became the biggest single-day gross ever for an MPA title, surpassing “Avengers: Endgame.” It now stands as the highest MPA opening of 2025.\n\n\n\tAniplex’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle” placed second with $5.7 million, lifting its cumulative total to $88 million. Directed by Sotozaki Haruo and produced by ufotable, the film adapts the climactic final arc of Gotouge Koyoharu’s blockbuster manga. Returning voice cast members include Hanae Natsuki, Kitō Akari, Shimono Hiro, and Matsuoka Yoshitsugu. The film follows the Demon Slayer Corps’ all-out assault on Kibutsuji Muzan’s stronghold in a bid to end the war between humans and demons.\n\t\n\n\tLast weekend’s champion, Bi Gan’s “Resurrection,” from Huace Pictures, slipped to third under the weight of the Disney launch, earning $3.4 million across its second weekend. The Nov. 22 release now stands at $25.1 million. In “Resurrection,” starring Jackson Yee, Shu Qi, Mark Chao, Li Gengxi, Huang Jue and Chen Yongzhong, humanity has lost the ability to dream, with only one creature still entranced by fading illusions of the dreamworld. When a woman with the rare power to perceive these illusions appears, she chooses to enter the monster’s dreams, determined to uncover hidden truths within.\n\n\tLionsgate’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” added $1.3 million for a $37 million total.\n\n\tQiangdian Media’s “My World Without Me” is a drama where a woman’s struggle and confusion ultimately lead to her transformation and rebirth, directed by Tian Hairong and executive produced by Zhang Hanyu, starring Tian alongside Tan Kai, Tian Haiyan, Shao Bing and Tong Ruixin. The film rounded out the top five with a two-day debut of $1 million after opening on Nov. 27, beginning its run with a $1.4 million cumulative total.\n\n\tChina’s weekend box office reached $229.7 million – a massive uptick from last weekend’s $44 million – lifting the 2025 year-to-date total to $6.777 billion, up 19.8% from the same point in 2024.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The New Yorker at 100” is a nimble and infectious documentary, one that brings off a trick more challenging than it looks. (In that way, it’s a lot like the magazine.) In just 96 minutes, the film, directed by Marshall Curry and narrated by Julianne Moore, lays out the fabled history of The New Yorker. It colors in the magazine’s larger cultural significance. It gives us a close-up, between-the-lines portrait of how The New Yorker gets put together each week, presenting us with the creation of its 100th anniversary issue (which came out this past February) as a template for what happens on a more regular basis.\n\t\n\n\tAnd it folds all of this into the enticing story of the magazine’s vibe and aesthetic: the way its commitment to truth and beauty are flip sides of the same coin, and how its manner of looking at the world, while up-to-the-minute and fully alive, is slyly rooted in the analog sanity of an earlier time. The New Yorker loves and fetishizes its traditions (the monocled fop Eustace Tilley, that stately but sensual Adobe Caslon font), but the magazine’s ultimate tradition is cutting through the scrim of contemporary noise to look reality in the eye, presenting it to the reader with a no-fuss vibrance.\n\n\n\tIf you’re a fan of The New Yorker and want a backstage tour of how the supremely refined sausage gets made, “The New Yorker at 100” draws back the curtain in an enchanting way. Here’s the fateful weekly cartoon meeting, where the final 60 contenders (out of 1,000 weekly submissions) get sorted into yes, no, or maybe baskets. Here’s the writer Nick Paumgarten trying to drum up a Talk of the Town piece by wandering through the East Village and questioning random New Yorkers about what’s on their minds, a catch-as-catch-can method that, in its way, reflects the magazine’s democratic openness.\n\t\n\n\tAnd here’s David Remnick, The New Yorker’s editor since 1998, doing his daily two-step of menschy straightforwardness and Machiavellian demand — a mystique that brings out the best in his writers, because they know just how tough he is in pursuit of the Platonic ideal of quality. For Remnick, The New Yorker is a holy mission that delights and consumes him. He says that he feels like Fred Astaire when his feet hit the pavement each morning, and he’s such a compulsive scheduler that his idea of relaxation is a Sunday guitar lesson. He also describes, with cutting candor, how having a profoundly autistic daughter heightened his humanity as a journalist.\n\n\tIn the 1960s and ’70s, I was one of countless middle-class kids who grew up with The New Yorker because my parents subscribed to it. It arrived each week looking less like a magazine than a plumply beautiful objet d’art (the painted covers, the cartoons and illustrations placed just so, the pages so voluminous they threatened to burst out of their stapled binding).\n\n\tIn that era, The New Yorker occupied a weirdly contradictory place in the new American nexus of highbrow and lowbrow, tradition and counterculture. The magazine still looked the way it did when Harold Ross created it in the 1920s, yet its airy elegance had a timelessness about it. Its articles were written in rigorous prose — yet they had a lightness, an accessibility that invited you in. The writing was pure, yet every column was lined with flamboyantly tasteful advertisements; the magazine was a kind of literary cash cow. The editor starting in 1952, William Shawn, was a famously shy and soft-spoken man, yet in the photographs we see of him in the documentary he has the gaze of a killer.\n\n\tAnd, crucially, the magazine set itself apart from the tumultuous vulgarity of American pop culture, yet by the ’70s the hippies and game-changing boomers had evolved into what was called “the film generation” (this meant that they were the first generation that liked to watch rather than read), and no writer of the 20th century had her finger on the pulse of movies as electrifyingly as the New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael. Kael was, and remains, the magazine’s grandest contradiction. She was the rock-star writer who helped to keep The New Yorker relevant, even as her heady stream-of-consciousness prose undercut the magazine’s Zen stateliness.\n\t\n\n\tKael is mentioned in the documentary’s opening fanfare, and never again after that: a crucial omission. I say that not just because, as a critic who grew up with her, Kael looms large for me, but because she was the magazine’s most popular and important writer for 25 years. (What, you’re going to say it was John McPhee?)\n\n\tMysterious Kael snub aside, “The New Yorker at 100” spotlights those moments when the magazine shifted the culture and altered the essence of journalism. John Hersey’s “Hiroshima,” the revelatory 30,000-word report on the aftermath of the dropping of the nuclear bomb (it took up an entire issue in 1946), was devoured the world over. It was, in effect, the documentary that the U.S. government wouldn’t allow to be made. Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring,” written in installments for The New Yorker as she was dying of cancer, was the book that launched the environmental movement. In 1962, Shawn recruited an unknown writer named James Baldwin to write a piece about the Black experience of racism that became the eye-opening template for “The Fire Next Time.” And Truman’s Capote’s “In Cold Blood,” serialized in The New Yorker, birthed not only the true-crime genre but the non-fiction novel. It proved highly controversial, because Capote made up certain conversations, and Shawn ultimately said that he regretted publishing it. But its influence was immeasurable.\n\n\tIt’s easy to make a case for The New Yorker’s singularity based on seismic works of journalism like these. Yet “The New Yorker at 100” gets into how The New Yorker has long been a magazine devoted not just to seriousness but delight, and how those two qualities are symbiotic. Everything in the magazine is aesthetic — the covers, the perfectly placed doodles, the way the words on the page, and even the punctuation marks, have the feel of physical objects. Jon Hamm, Molly Ringwald, Ronny Chieng, and Jesse Eisenberg (who became a contributor of humor pieces) each sit for an interview in one of the magazine’s original wooden office chairs, testifying to the effect The New Yorker had on them. Yet the documentary also references the nearly iconic joke about how issues of the magazine would pile up in people’s living rooms, like the ultimate unread homework assignment. Was — is — The New Yorker too precious for its own good? Occasionally, yes. Mostly, no.\n\t\n\n\tAnd 100 years on, what I continue to find extraordinary about The New Yorker — I think this is key to what Remnick, in the film, calls “miraculous” about it — is that the magazine was founded, in the Algonquin Roundtable ’20s, as a way of looking at the world that in its casual American insouciance would remain above the fray. And it stayed above the fray, even as it revealed the perils of the real world (nuclear disaster, the murder of the environment by chemicals, the violence that began to tear through Middle America) more than any other journalistic institution did. Now, decades later, as the proliferation of shabby kaleidoscopic media threatens to tear our very perception of reality apart, The New Yorker is still above the fray. We might need it now more than ever, even as it undergoes the ultimate stress test: Is there a place in our fractious civilization for a publication this civilized?\n",

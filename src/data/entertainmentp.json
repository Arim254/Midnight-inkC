    "body": "\n\tIt’s a sad day in Hollywood — an unthinkable, upsetting and all-around shocking day — when filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle could have been stabbed to death in their own home, allegedly by someone so close.\n\n\tThe particulars are hazy, the initial reports nearly impossible to wrap one’s head around. It’s clear that in the days ahead, the scandal will likely overshadow the career of one of the industry’s most beloved directors, a man widely admired for his work, his activism and his contagiously optimistic spirit. In the “100 Best Comedy Movies of All Time” list recently published by Variety, Reiner was responsible for no fewer than three of the entries.\n\t\n\n\tI’m not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that among American studio talents, I consider Rob Reiner the best director never to have been nominated for Best Director. Just look at his credits. The guy was the Billy Wilder of our generation: a filmmaker with an instinct for comedy who could operate across genres, making films with big, larger-than-life characters you recognized instantly and felt you’d known your whole life.\n\n\n\tReiner wasn’t a stylist like Martin Scorsese — the filmmaking idol on whom “This Is Spinal Tap” “director” Marty DiBergi was based (and for whom he finally got to act in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” playing Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad). He wasn’t a visionary technological innovator like Robert Zemeckis — the performance-capture pioneer who took “The Polar Express,” a project Reiner had initiated with Tom Hanks, and made motion-picture history with it.\n\t\n\n\tBut he made at least six hall-of-fame films, practically one after another over the course of an 11-year run (a number forever associated with him). Reiner kicked off his directorial career with the endlessly quotable, mock rock doc “This Is Spinal Tap,” hitting new comedic heights straight out of the gate in 1984 by poking fun at an absurd (yet plausible) heavy metal band. Two years later, he delivered that greatest of coming-of-age films, “Stand by Me” — a movie featuring kids who really act like kids, facing the notion of mortality for the first time.\n\n\tThen came what I’ve long considered to be my desert-island movie — as in, the one film I’d save if I was banished somewhere with a projector, a screen and a single print I’m certain I’d never get tired of watching: “The Princess Bride.” More on that in a minute. I was exactly the right age when that head-in-the-clouds, heart-on-the-sleeve postmodern fairy tale was released, but grown-ups at the time went crazy for his down-to-earth follow-up, “When Harry Met Sally…,” which almost singlehandedly revived the romantic comedy genre.\n\n\tRight there, you’ve got four movies that defined the ’80s, and we haven’t even gotten to his two most acclaimed credits: “A Few Good Men,” the decade’s most-quoted (and surely also its most-rewatched) courtroom drama, in which Jack Nicholson bellows, “You can’t handle the truth!” at Tom Cruise’s self-righteous military lawyer. Reiner reteamed with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin three years later on “The American President,” another irresistible Hollywood romance, this one with a backbone idealistic enough to inspire “The West Wing.”\n\n\tI know I’m not alone in adoring all six of those movies, though it’s telling that none are the type where one immediately thinks of the man calling “action!” Sorkin’s fingerprints are all over the latter two. “This Is Spinal Tap” is commonly associated with Christopher Guest, who went on to make several more improv-driven mockumentaries in the same mold. Nora Ephron often gets credit for “When Harry Met Sally…,” though the script was informed by where both she and Reiner were in their respective romantic lives at the time.\n\n\tIf Reiner gets too little credit, it’s because he had the wisdom and grace to subtract himself from the equation — by which I mean, when watching a Rob Reiner movie, audiences were never thinking about the director: how this shot was brilliant or that cut was clever. He wanted our attention to be focused on the characters, taking great care to cast each and every role with the absolute right actor, then trusting those performers to bring more than the script dictated to their parts.\n\t\n\n\tThere must be a case somewhere in Reiner’s filmography of someone being wrong for the role, but I can’t think of an example (then again, I never saw “North”). Instead, my mind goes to a dozen uncannily inspired choices in “The Princess Bride”: From Andre the Giant to Mandy Patinkin to Wallace Shawn, those actors fit their characters like a six-fingered glove (in Guest’s case, at least).\n\n\tWith “The Princess Bride,” Reiner accomplished the tricky task of blending several classic Hollywood genres — fairy tale romance, fantasy adventure, swashbuckling action and kid-friendly comedy — though the studio wasn’t sure what to make of it at the time. Like “This Is Spinal Tap” before it, it took time for audiences to embrace the film. Rest assured, those two cult favorites eventually found their following, to the extent that Reiner broke one of his own rules and finally made a sequel (“Spinal Tap II: The End Continues”) this year.\n\n\tYou can’t look at a Rob Reiner movie and reverse-engineer the man’s genius the way you can a film by Spielberg or Kubrick (though I’d argue “Stand by Me” is a better Stephen King adaptation than “The Shining”). The way I see it, there are three subtle but vital qualities that made Reiner’s movies so appealing.\n\n\tFirst, there’s the way he worked with actors, inviting them to improvise. That was the basis of “Spinal Tap”’s success, and proved to be an asset throughout his career.\n\n\tSecond, as the son of Carl Reiner — and star of the incredibly successful ’70s sitcom “All in the Family” — Rob had either inherited or absorbed the principles of comedy, incorporating humor into all his films (it’s my opinion that all Hollywood movies are comedies, to some degree at least, and that this running sense of humor is what sets American cinema apart).\n\n\tAnd third, he worked carefully on the scripts with his writers. Some projects he originated, via his Castle Rock shingle, and others he refined over rigorous brainstorming sessions. Sorkin has often credited Reiner’s process with making “A Few Good Men” into the rock-solid film it is. These days, too few studio directors polish their scripts to the same degree, worrying not just about dialogue, but structure, stakes and what makes a character feel real.\n\t\n\n\tIt makes sense that Reiner would be strong on those fronts. He met Mel Brooks when he was just four years old. Little Rob grew up at the feet of showbiz legends (his father, Carl, wrote for Sid Caesar’s “Your Show of Shows”), and he paid his dues, studying theater at UCLA, observing and learning from Norman Lear and directing TV movies before crossing over to film.\n\n\tReiner’s career stagnated somewhat in the 21st century, though he made a very funny, disarmingly intimate portrait of best friend Albert Brooks (no relation to Mel) for HBO two years ago, “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.” And of course, there was this year’s “Spinal Tap” sequel, which features more than a few sidesplitting moments — and a few epic cameos from the likes of Paul McCartney and Elton John.\n\n\tCan a filmmaker be both beloved and underappreciated at the same time? Rob Reiner was. Thinking of what happened to the 78-year-old mensch and his wife this weekend, one word comes to mind: inconceivable.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner, who segued from starring in  “All in the Family” to directing movies including “This Is Spinal Tap,” “A Few Good Men” and “When Harry Met Sally…” was found dead Sunday afternoon in his Brentwood home alongside his wife Michele Singer. He was 78. \n\n\tThe deaths are being investigated as a homicide, according to the LAPD. The couple was reported to have been stabbed to death.\n\n\n\t“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,” his family said in a statement. \n\t\n\n\tReiner’s most recent film was “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,” the sequel to the 1984 classic “This Is Spinal Tap.” \n\n\tThe son of the noted writer, director and comedian Carl Reiner, he first attracted attention as Michael “Meathead” Stivic, hippie son-in-law of Carroll O’Connor’s bigoted, blustering blue-collar worker Archie Bunker, during nine seasons of CBS’s topical sitcom. He collected Emmys as best supporting actor in a comedy in 1974 and 1978.\n\n\tWith credits as a writer on “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,” “Happy Days” and “All in the Family” and a pair of TV movies under his belt, Reiner moved into big screen work as a director, writer and co-star in 1984’s “This is Spinal Tap,” the cherished, improvisational mockumentary about a thick-headed heavy metal band.\n\n\tThat project was succeeded during the next decade by a run of box office hits and popular favorites, which demonstrated his uncommon assurance working in a variety of genres. These included “Stand By Me” (1986), a coming-of-age drama with a youthful cast, adapted from a Stephen King short story; the fantasy “The Princess Bride” (1987); the new-look romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally…” (1989); another King adaptation, the thriller “Misery” (1990); and the Tom Cruise-Jack Nicholson court martial drama “A Few Good Men” (1992).\n\t\n\n\tReiner served as producer of most of his films from 1987 on. That year, he co-founded the production company Castle Rock Entertainment, which released several of his films and such hits as “In the Line of Fire,” “Needful Things” and “Malice.” The company was acquired by Turner Broadcasting in 1993.\n\n\tSave for the occasional hit like the bittersweet 2007 comedy-drama “The Bucket List” with Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, Reiner’s latter-day directorial projects – which included “Being Charlie,” a family drama, rooted in autobiography — though eclectic as ever, seldom met with commercial favor.\n\n\t“I’m making the movies I want to make,” he told the Guardian in 2008. “Studios are looking for hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in profit and you’re not going to get it with a little movie…But I came into this business to express myself and tell stories, not just churn out a product.”\n\n\tA prominent progressive voice in the Hollywood community, Reiner was active in several California ballot initiatives. He was an ardent supporter of Democratic candidates and a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump. In 2006, after contemplating a run against California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, he decided to step away from the race.\n\n\tHe was born March 6, 1947, in the New York borough of the Bronx. His father became one of the most prominent comedy writers and stars of the so-called “Golden Age of Television,” acting and writing on Sid Caesar’s top-rated “Your Show of Shows”; he went on to create “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and direct a number of successful comedy features.\n\n\tThe apple did not fall far from the tree. Raised in Hollywood, the younger Reiner attended UCLA Film School and began taking small roles in such TV shows as “Batman,” “That Girl,” “The Beverly Hillbillies” and “The Partridge Family.” He also appeared in his father’s autobiographical feature “Enter Laughing” (1967).\n\n\tIn 1971, Reiner was chosen, over such actors as Richard Dreyfuss and Harrison Ford, to play Archie Bunker’s put-upon son-in-law, opposite Sally Struthers as his wife Gloria, “All in the Family,” creator Norman Lear’s Americanized version of the British sitcom “‘Til Death Do Us Part.” The show’s frank exploration of topical material previously considered too hot for TV and the great chemistry of the cast (which also included Jean Stapleton as Bunker’s wife Edith) made it a pivotal series in small-screen history.\n\t\n\n\tIt took a few years for Reiner to find his footing after parting company with “All in the Family” in 1978, but with his first major feature in 1984 he created an iconic musical comedy. Built on a roughly sketched treatment and essentially improvised in front of the camera, “This is Spinal Tap” introduced Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer as the dim-witted members of the titular band, with Reiner portraying earnest doc director Marty DiBergi.\n\n\tBetween 1986 and 1992, Reiner proved his versatility in a succession of films featuring strong performances. His work with the adolescent cast of “Stand By Me” earned him Golden Globe, Independent Spirit and DGA Award nominations. The offbeat “The Princess Bride” acquired a devoted cult following.\n\n\tHis most assured directorial performance may have been “When Harry Met Sally…,” which perfectly paired Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as close friends who end up entering a romantic relationship. Written by Nora Ephron, the hit comedy featured an indelible sequence in which Ryan loudly demonstrates a fake orgasm for Crystal in a crowded restaurant; the scene’s unforgettable punchline, “I’ll have what she’s having,” was delivered by the director’s mother Estelle.\n\n\tReiner’s box office track record began to cool in the late ‘90s, as the writer-director increasingly pursued less commercial, more political subject matter, from the ‘60s civil rights movement (“Ghosts of Mississippi,” 1996) to the political career of Lyndon Johnson (“LBJ,” 2016) and the Gulf War of 2003 (“Shock and Awe,” 2017).\n\n\tIn 2023, he directed the documentary “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.”\n\n\tOne of the most outspoken of Hollywood political activists, Reiner eschewed office seeking in favor of work for his preferred causes, which encompassed gay rights advocacy and a protracted battle with the tobacco lobby.\n\n\t“No, I don’t want to be an elected official,” he said. “I want to get things done.”\n\n\tReiner and his wife are survived by children, Jake, Nick and Romy. He was the adoptive father of actress Tracy Reiner, the daughter of his first wife, the late actress and director Penny Marshall.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAcross Hollywood and beyond, celebrities and fans are paying tribute to director and actor Rob Reiner, who was found dead along with his wife Michele on Sunday in their home. \n\n\tThe son of writer Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner first became known for his role as Meathead in the influential sitcom “All in the Family.” He went on to direct classic films including “Stand by Me,” “This Is Spinal Tap,” “When Harry Met Sally…” and “A Few Good Men.”\n\t\n\n\tChristopher Guest, who starred in “This Is Spinal Tap,” and his wife Jamie Lee Curtis said in a statement, “Christopher and I are numb and sad and shocked about the violent, tragic deaths of our dear friends Rob and Michelle Singer Reiner and our ONLY focus and care right now is for their children and immediate families and we will offer all support possible to help them. There will be plenty of time later to discuss the creative lives we shared and the great political and social impact they both had on the entertainment industry, early childhood development, the fight for gay marriage and their global care for a world in crisis. We have lost great friends. Please give us time to grieve.”\n\n\n\tThe late Norman Lear’s family wrote in a statement, “The Lear Family is devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner. Norman often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary, to us and the world. Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends.  Lyn Lear had remained very close with them and said, ‘The world is unmistakably darker tonight, and we are left bereft.'”\n\t\n\n\tJohn Cusack, who starring in Reiner’s film “The Sure Thing,” wrote on Twitter “Shocked by the death of Rob Reiner – a great man.”\n\n\tBarack Obama wrote, “Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.”\n\nMichelle and I are heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele. Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of…— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 15, 2025\n\n\n\tGovernor Gavin Newsom and his wife Jennifer Seibel Newsom said in a statement, “That empathy extended well beyond his films. Rob was a passionate advocate for children and for civil rights — from taking on Big Tobacco to fighting for marriage equality to serving as a powerful voice in early education. He made California a better place through his good works.”\n\n\tDirector Paul Feig wrote, “Rob was my true hero.”\n\nOne of my most cherished pictures. Rob was my true hero. A true visionary titan and a lovely lovely person. One never knows if it’s proper to post during something as tragic as this. But I just want the world to know what so many of us know in the industry. Rob was the best. 💔 pic.twitter.com/oDn1FW1vqb— Paul Feig (@paulfeig) December 15, 2025\n\n\n\tSean Astin, president of SAG-AFTRA, saluted Reiner as a union member and pillar of the creative community for more than a half century.\n\n\t“Rob Reiner is one of the most significant figures in the history of film and television. The impact he made on American culture simply can’t be overstated. Tributes will pour in and the impossibly long list of genre defining films and indelible performances will play in our minds and hearts. Rob Reiner was a member of our union for nearly 60 years,” Astin said in a statement. “We send love and warmth to Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner’s families, friends and colleagues. Our entertainment community and audiences around the world will mourn deeply. On a personal note, so many of Mr. Reiner’s films and performances made me think, made me emotional and especially they made me laugh really hard. That’s how I will remember him.”\n\n\tReiner was a beloved figure in comedy circles, given his proud lineage and his indelible contributions to the form via such influential smashes as 1984’s “This Is Spinal Tap” and 1989’s “When Harry Met Sally.” Reiner was the son of Carl Reiner, who worked alongside Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks in the 1950s and ’60s and went on to create “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and many other comedy projects. Rob Reiner proved his chops as an actor with the success of “All in the Family,” which captured America’s generation gap as the turbulent late 1960s gave way to the Me decade.\n\t\n\n\t“Rob Reiner consistently worked from a place of conviction and integrity. Together, he and Michele were a force — combining comedy, creativity, and public engagement into their shared endeavors. They were as committed to making a difference as they were to their careers, a rare combination that makes this loss feel all the more profound,” said Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, N.Y.  “When visiting us to pay tribute to his father, Rob did so with reverence, humility, kindness and a steadfast, enthusiastic intellect in matters of comedy and humanity. We are grateful to have known them both and for the impact they had on all of us.”\n\n\tReiner’s hot streak as a helmer from the mid-1980s through mid-1990s is hard to top for movies that defined their eras. Fellow actors, writers and directors were quick to cite his films as seminal influences.\n\n\tPaul Walter Hauser wrote, “Grieving the loss of my favorite director of all-time. A Few Good Men is THE reason I became an actor, and Rob’s filmography behind the camera is THE reason I wanted to direct and still do.” The actor went on to share a story about the time he met Reiner.\n\n\n\t“Horrible. I didn’t think today could get worse,” wrote Jon Cryer on Threads.\n\n\tJosh Gad wrote “Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle were two of the most kind and caring souls you could ever imagine. He cared so much for those who had no voices.”\n\n\n\tActress Virginia Madsen wrote on Instagram “Thank you Rob for giving us so much joy to hold on to. Life and talent always turned up to 11.”\n\n\n\tFilmmaker Joe Russo wrote, “We lost one of the few good men.”\n\n\n\tNancy Pelosi said, “Rob was creative, funny, and beloved. And in all of their endeavors, Michelle was his indispensable partner, intellectual resource, and a loving wife.”\n\nThe news of a deadly assault on Rob and Michelle Reiner in their home is devastating. It’s hard to think of anyone more remarkable and excellent in every field and endeavor they pursued. Rob was creative, funny, and beloved. And in all of their endeavors, Michelle was his…— Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) December 15, 2025\n\n\nThis is a devastating loss for our city and our country.

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 1 finale of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tThe first season of “It:",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Season 1 finale of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tThe first season of “It: Welcome to Derry” concluded in a way that was truly thrilling and chilling, with the show’s full ensemble taking on Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård) as he covered the titular town in an icy, supernatural fog. While series creators Barbara and Andy Muschietti insist that the climax’s liminal environment was not an intentional nod to Stephen King’s “The Mist,” they acknowledge the overlap in the universe, which is full of references to other King works such as “The Shining” and “The Shawshank Redemption.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the spirit of the author’s expansive source material, the brother-sister director-producer duo also note that Pennywise’s story is not over. Even though “Welcome to Derry” is a prequel to their 2017 and 2019 films, it’s already been established that the evil spirit possessing Pennywise arrived in Derry several generations ago, and the finale alludes to the antagonistic clown’s atemporal reality. Though they couldn’t give much away, the Muschiettis confirmed that they intend for a Season 2 to take place in 1935, chronicling the previous cycle of Pennywise’s awakening in the town. (HBO has not yet officially renewed “Welcome to Derry.”)\n\n\n\tThe overlapping timelines were made evident in the finale’s post-credit scene, which flash-forwards to 1988, showing Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis) briefly before the events of the first “It” film, previewing the tragedy that would set her own battle with Pennywise in motion. The scene features an elderly version of Madeleine Stowe’s character, Ingrid Kersh, revealing her to actually be the same old woman that It manifests as in “It: Chapter 2” to haunt the grown-up Marsh (Jessica Chastain). 91 year-old-actress Joan Gregson reprised her role as the elderly Mrs. Kersh for the scene. \n\t\n\n\tVariety spoke with Andy and Barbara Muschietti — and emailed with co-showrunner, executive producer and co-creator Jason Fuchs — to talk about the season’s climactic finale, the series’ future and the post-credit scene that tied it all together.\n\t\n\t\tGoing into the finale, what questions did you know you wanted to answer to conclude Season 1?\t\n\n\tJason Fuchs: There were certain mysteries that had to be answered. Why does It remain in Derry? Well, now we know: he is trapped there within the cage assembled by the Children of Maturin centuries ago. Why does It choose the form of Pennywise? We know that now, too: it’s a real-life clown that the entity encountered in 1908. He saw the way children reacted to Bob Gray’s on-stage persona, almost like a hypnotic Pied Piper effect and decided, “Wait, this is a manifestation I can use to lure kids in.” And I also think it was important to understand the story of Ingrid Kersh. We have a fairly complete understanding of how Bob Gray’s daughter, after losing her father as a child, encounters this manifestation of him in 1935 and has been, in essence, operating as It’s “familiar” ever since to keep seeing what she thinks is a form of her father. \n\t\n\t\tWas it always the plan to have the season end with this climactic battle in the fog?\t\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: No. I think we were in production already and we decided that the Dagger would be a more prominent element in the story. This ending was molded and shaped along the way, but once we decided the episode’s big story would be about returning the Dagger to the dead pine, we had an idea. We really wanted a photo-finish moment, though, because there is so much anxiety in the sequence. That’s when I thought of bringing back Richie [Arian S. Cartaya]. Because we are in a world where people can see dead people, we thought it would be perfect for him to come back and help the other kids put the dagger back into the ground.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWas the idea of the fog over Derry taken from the novel?\t\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: No, not at all. There’s a lot of stuff that we invented for the show, but from our first conversations with Stephen King, he was on board with us creating a lot.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI thought it might be an allusion to his novella, “The Mist”?\t\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: It’s not, but of course, in “The Mist,” they say that the mist comes from the Todash Field, the same interdimensional plane that It is from. So it’s unrelated, but it’s also related. I wanted to use the fog to visually illustrate the expansion of the clouds that surround the Dead Lights. When we see the meteor crash into Derry in Episode 4, we see the three Dead Lights dancing around this cloud of fog. The physical element is established there, and for this story, I wanted to show that it is an expansive force.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you create that environment from a physical production standpoint?\t\n\n\tBarbara Muschietti: Part of why we had to transition to this frozen world was because of the strikes. Filming went from Fall to Winter, so the setting had to match that. We thought of going to a real location in Ontario, but that thought lasted about a second and a half. We did a lot of November nights in Ontario on our first film, “Mama,” and that is not something we wanted to repeat or put our actors through again. So we made a conscious decision to go on a stage. Andy then gave it a real magical feel, working with our production designer Paul Austerberry and our DP Danny Vilar and our special effects crew to mist the whole stage for days and days.\n\t\n\t\tHow many days did it take to shoot?\t\n\n\tBarbara Muschietti: We went back and forth. We were trying to keep some days as weather cover, but it was weeks.\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: It was a mess, but it was brought into shape by our first AD, Joanna Moore, who is an absolute genius. The challenge was shooting on a stage and making it look like an outdoor space of undetermined size. We were doing all kinds of cheating, expanding distances, shooting on one corner of the set to get more distance from the other corner. VFX did a great job to make cohesion of all those different fragments.\n\t\n\t\tDid you have just one unit, or did you use a second unit?\t\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: We had a second unit for specific shots that didn’t require cast performances and some fights that required stunts. There were times where we were splitting the shoot with other scenes. It was a mess, but it was a lot of fun.\n\n\tBarbara Muschietti: It was the end of Andy’s block, which meant he wouldn’t be shooting anymore afterwards. When Andy knows the end is coming, his brain goes into overdrive and he starts thinking of new stuff and the pressure is on. That’s the way Andy and I work. Sometimes we have four cameras on set shooting completely different set-ups. It’s chaotic, but we have a great team who welcomes this and everything ends up getting done.\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: Yeah, in spite of having been there for months, the crew was really engaged with the story. That’s not a given. These guys were phenomenal.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe climax was also the first scene with the entire cast together, including Bill Skarsgård’s Pennywise. What was it like directing everyone together?\t\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: It was challenging because of the geography. There are three or four different groups of people in the scene. The challenge was establishing the geography at every turn of the story so people would understand what’s going on, and where people are in relation to things and each other, all in an environment where the characters can’t see each other. There was a lot of preparation. We drew a lot of little maps.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto: Brooke Palmer\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe finale also makes some allusions to things to come. Pennywise talks about the future and the past and Margy suggests that he may be able to travel through time. You’ve mentioned that you’re going to make two more seasons that go in the reverse chronology of Pennywise’s 27-year cycles. Is this still the plan?\t\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: Yeah, that was always the plan from the beginning. Our first pitch to Stephen King was to tell the story backwards. I can’t say too much about the logic behind it, because I don’t want to spoil it, but it has to do with how Pennywise experiences time in a non-linear way. We sort of hinted at it at the end of the season.\n\t\n\t\tHave you already started writing it?\t\n\n\tBarbara Muschietti: We can’t talk about it.\n\t\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: We can only say the stuff that’s already known, like it’s in 1935, 27 years before Season 1 and it involves the massacre of the Bradley Gang from the books. It takes place during the Depression in Derry, and there are some new characters and some characters from this season as well, but younger versions of them.\n\t\n\t\tViewers know that Pennywise lives into the future, though, since we’ve seen him in the “It” movies. Did that present a unique challenge, since we know that Pennywise doesn’t die in this finale?\t\n\n\tJaon Fuchs: Prequels always present a unique challenge in terms of stakes, in that the audience already knows the fate of key characters. In this case, we know It survives our show because It is still around eating kids in 1989 and beyond. So, it was an early conversation with Andy about, okay, well how do we create real stakes? Yes, we are going to create stakes in the context of “We care about these characters and what happens to them,” but how do we elevate the stakes of this beyond your traditional prequel? And the answer to that is not fully explained within the season, but there is certainly a hint of it in our finale. When It reveals the missing poster of Richie Tozier, from “Chapter 1,” and has this admission that the past, present and future are all a bit jumbled, that moment is establishing a new mystery and that mystery is directly linked to raising the stakes of the series. Because if It has this, let’s say, unique relationship with or to the perception of time, that suggests that the restrictions on what can happen in a prequel may or may not apply in the context of our particular story. Maybe It, in this show, is more dangerous we understood.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of overlapping timelines, Season 1 ends with a post-credits flash-forward where we see Sophia Lillis reprising her role as Beverly Marsh from the films and encountering an elderly Mrs. Kersh, who is the old lady from “Chapter 2.” Did you always expect to have this scene at the end of Season 1?\t\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: No, we didn’t think of it until we were doing reshoots and pick-ups before the edit.\n\n\tBarbara Muschietti: This was April of this year, so not long ago at all.\n\t\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: I had a notion of what the show was going to look like, but I still wanted a visual connection to the characters from the movies. I had an idea for a four-scene epilogue, but it was a little too ambitious, so we condensed it to one scene with just one of the Losers. We always joke that Sophia Lillis always looks the same. She looked 14 when she was 14 and now that she’s 24, she still looks 14, so we could bring her back without having to de-age her. We also brought back the actress who plays the elderly Ingrid Kersh, Joan Gregson, in “It: Chapter 2.” We wanted to show that those characters had met before, so in the flash-forward, we have Kersh still committed at Juniper Hill, the same place where Beverly’s mom was committed. It seemed like the perfect connection.\n\n\tJason Fuchs: What I love about that scene is that it does change your understanding of Beverly’s encounter with It’s manifestation of Mrs. Kersh in “It: Chapter 2.” I was lucky enough to work on that scene and, at the time, I imagined that It was taking the guise of Pennywise’s daughter in order to prey on Beverly’s traumatic relationship with her own father. It did not, then, occur to me that Beverly Marsh had ever met the real Mrs. Kersh. But now, you go back and rewatch that scene and you realize It was up to something else. It knows that Beverly actually met Mrs. Kersh at least once and it was on the worst day of her life, the day her mother committed suicide. So, when It takes that form, it’s also a way of tapping into a long buried memory that’s intertwined with the most horrific moment, to that point, of Beverly’s young life. And that’s the day, the moment, we get to see at the end of our season. \n\n\tBarbara Muschietti: What sparked it was our cameraman mentioning that he recently worked with Joan. When Joan played Mrs. Kersh in 2018, she was 85 years old, so now she was 91.\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: And she did everything at 85. She did nudity, full frontal, and was phenomenal, but we didn’t know if she was still acting or anything.\n\n\tBarbara Muschietti: But when we heard that she was, the idea for the scene came to Andy. We didn’t have any money left, but it was so important to Andy that we sat down with the budget and cut some VFX from the show so we could shoot the scene. Then we called Sophia, who is an absolute queen. She got on a plane right away, and we got to shoot this incredible scene that connects the show and the movies.\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: I really want to thank Barbara publicly now, because I remember that moment when I wanted to shoot the scene and Barbara bent the iron bar in a way that normally would have been impossible to do with the budget and time we had. Thank you.\n\n\tBarbara Muschietti: You’re welcome! I enjoyed it very much and we had to shoot very fast. Joan was having so much fun, just laughing, smiling, crying in all the different takes. She left us two months later.\n\n\tAndy Muschietti: Yeah, this was her last role.\n\n\tBarbara Muschietti: She was a revered Canadian actress who did theater all her life, so we feel very blessed. It gave everything a bit of closure.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGeorge Clooney is no longer interested in romance on the big screen.\n\n\tDuring a recent interview with the Daily Mail, Clooney said that after having a discussion with his wife, Amal Clooney, about his age, he will no longer be “kissing girls” in movies.\n\n\t“I’ve been trying to go the route Paul Newman did — ‘Okay, well, I’m not kissing a girl anymore,’” Clooney said.\n\n\n\tHe added, “When I turned 60, I had a conversation with my wife. I said, ‘Look, I can still play basketball with the boys. I play with 25-year-old guys. I can still hang, I’m in shape. But in 25 years, I’m 85 years old. It doesn’t matter how many granola bars you eat, that’s a real number.'”\n\t\n\n\tClooney made his career as one of Hollywood’s most popular romantic leads. Some of his credits include romance films like “One Fine Day” with Michelle Pfeiffer, “Out of Sight” with Jennifer Lopez, “Up in the Air” with Vera Farmiga and “Ticket to Paradise” with Julia Roberts.\n\n\tThe “Ocean’s Eleven” star may have been hinting at this decision for a while. He told “60 Minutes” back in March that he was stepping away from “romantic films” entirely to make room for Hollywood’s new crop of leading men.\n\n\t“Look, I’m 63 years old. I’m not trying to compete with 25-year-old leading men,” he said. “That’s not my job. I’m not doing romantic films anymore.”\n\n\tIn a 2022 sitdown with the New York Times, Clooney recalled that even early in his career, he had trouble with a director who criticized his on-screen kissing technique.\n\n\tClooney said, “I remember early on in my career, I had to do a kissing scene with this girl and the director goes, ‘Not like that.’ And I was like, ‘Dude, that’s my move! That’s what I do in real life!’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead at their Brentwood home on Sunday in an apparent homicide, Variety has confirmed.\n\n\t“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,” a family spokesman said in a statement. “We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”\n\n\tThe LAPD responded to the home at 3:40 p.m. and discovered two deceased victims. The LAPD described the deaths as “an apparent homicide,” but did not confirm the victims’ identities. ABC7 reported that the victims appeared to have been stabbed.\n\t\n\n\tA family member close to the Reiners was being questioned by authorities, law enforcement sources told the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\t“We have not identified a suspect at this time,” said Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton at a press conference Sunday night. “No one has been detained.”\n\n\tHamilton also said the detectives had canvassed the neighborhood, but “are not looking for anyone” in Brentwood.\n\n\tDetectives from the LAPD Robbery Homicide Division responded to the home to conduct the investigation. Hamilton said the detectives would have to obtain a search warrant before going inside.\n\n\tKaren Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, mourned Reiner’s death in a statement, calling it “a devastating loss for our city and our country.”\n\n\t“The investigation is ongoing,” she said. “I’m holding all who loved Rob and Michele in my heart.”\n\n\tHamilton said police expected to update the press again on Monday morning.\n\n\tReiner is a major filmmaker who comes from a storied Hollywood family. His father is comedian and director Carl Reiner. Reiner’s films include such classics as “This Is Spinal Tap,” “The Princess Bride,” “Stand By Me,” “Misery,” “When Harry Met Sally…” and “The American President.” A prominent progressive voice in the Hollywood community, Reiner is active in several California ballot initiatives, as well as acts as a major fundraiser for the Democratic Party. He has been a major critic of President Donald Trump.\n\t\n\n\tBefore moving behind the camera, Reiner also starred as Michael “Meathead” Stivic, hippie son-in-law of Carroll O’Connor’s bigoted, blustering blue-collar worker Archie Bunker, during nine seasons of “All in the Family.” Reiner co-founded Castle Rock, the production company behind hits such as “In the Line of Fire” and “City Slickers,” the critically acclaimed drama “The Shawshank Redemption,” and “Seinfeld.”\n\n\tSinger was at one time a photographer who shot Donald Trump’s photo for the cover of “The Art of the Deal.” The couple have three children — Jake, Nick and Romy. He is the adoptive father of actress Tracy Reiner, the daughter of his first wife, the late actress and director Penny Marshall.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRian Johnson‘s “Wake Up Dead Man,” the third film in the Daniel Craig-starring “Knives Out” murder mystery series, just arrived on Netflix on Dec. 12. However, the director already has thoughts about the next installment in the franchise. Johnson told Entertainment Weekly, “I have some basic, elemental, conceptual ideas. Like, ‘Okay, it’d be interesting if it were this kind of thing’ kernels.”\n\n\tThe director continued, “I don’t have actual concrete ideas. I don’t have a theme yet. I don’t have a location. It’s really pretty vague, and I feel like it’s good to kinda keep it vague until I’m ready to actually sit down and write it.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the meantime, Johnson hopes to direct at least one original film before returning to “Knives Out” for another story of Craig’s stately southern detective Benoit Blanc. He says that the “Knives Out” movies are all meant to be products of their time, and therefore, the intricate plots and their surrounding themes cannot be rushed.\n\n\t“Part of making these movies, for me, is reacting to the present moment, not necessarily with current events or politics or culture specifically, but in terms of what we’re all feeling in the world at that moment,” Johnson said. “I like that these movies are not timeless, per se, and that they all have one foot in something that is common to all of us in our present moment. So, yeah, I don’t know. I have a vague notion, but trying to keep it vague until it’s time to actually do it.”\n\n\tJohnson began the “Knives Out” series in 2019, with Lionsgate’s release of the first film in theaters. Netflix subsequently acquired the rights for two sequels to the original and released the second installment, “Glass Onion” in 2022. “Wake Up Dead Man” had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and was released in select theaters on Nov. 26. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains light spoilers from Season 2, Episode 5 of “Landman,” “The Pirate Dinner,” which premiered Sunday, Dec. 14, on Paramount+.\n\n\tActing on “Landman” is a dream job for Jacob Lofland, but there was one unique challenge for him as an artist. He plays Cooper Norris, the son of Tommy, who is the center of the series’ universe. But while everyone else in his onscreen family is always dressed in their southern best, it is often remarked that Cooper — who is frequently toiling at the oil fields — smells bad or needs a shower and deodorant. It eventually made Lofland paranoid that show co-creator Taylor Sheridan, who also writes every episode, might be trying to say something about his hygiene.\n\t\n\n\t“I got self-conscious of that at some point,” Lofland says, laughing. “I would walk around after about three times last season of hearing that, going, ‘You know, I don’t think I’m that bad. Have I just been around Taylor and something’s not smelling good?’ But I think it goes back to the character, and he just spends so much time out in the patch, and it’s 100 degrees out there at all times. There’s not enough deodorant in the world to keep these guys from smelling like they’re going to smell. Not to mention it, oil and gas don’t smell amazing anyway, so there’s always sulfur in the air. I’m really hoping that’s where it’s coming from.”\n\n\n\tThis season, Cooper is getting more scrutiny for his life choices than his scent. The ambitious young man is taking some big swings, perhaps without giving them enough thought. In this episode, Cooper and Tommy have a lunch filled with straight talk. By the end, Cooper is selling his lucky-strike oil sites to his father’s company, after Tommy makes it clear that his son’s new business partner, Gallino (Andy Garcia), will bleed him dry. Luckily, Tommy rewards his son’s instincts by also offering him a job at M-Tex.\n\t\n\n\tUnfortunately, Tommy doesn’t have as much luck talking Cooper out of quickly marrying Ariana (Paulina Chavez), despite their fraught relationship.\n\n\tLofland says that while Cooper’s decisions might frustrate the audience, his impulsiveness is an important part of what makes the character tick.\n\n\t“The reason I really fell in love with this character is that it is relatable for the age and for what he’s going through at that time,” he says. “I’m a little older than Cooper; I’m 29 now, so I would make a few different decisions. But I’ve also made those mistakes when I was younger. Different businesses, different things, but definitely jumped off in stuff when I didn’t know what I was doing. So I’ve learned that lesson over the years, and I think it’s important for him to go through that time in life, make these decisions, screw up, learn from the mistakes, don’t do it again.”\n\n\tIn terms of Lofland’s personal growth, he says working opposite Thornton shows him what it means to be a leader on a production.\n\n\t“It’s so fun — he makes it easy,” Lofland says. “He shows up every day, and Billy is our Number One. So on any set, your Number One sets the pace and the attitude for everybody else. Billy shows up every day ready to work and excited about the job, which in turn makes everyone else excited. It just trickles down.”\n\n\tThis season also introduces Sam Elliott as Cooper’s grandfather, and gives Lofland another veteran actor he’s happy to model his on-set conduct after.\n\n\t“The one thing I’ve learned is it’s never a conversation that you learn from,” he says. “It’s just being able to be around these men and women that have done this for so long, and watch the way they carry themselves, the way they work, their ethic and their attitude. I think that teaches more and speaks more than any piece of advice they could ever give. Sam and Billy, they’re so prepared, so professional. You never wait on them. They’re never the reason that we’re running three minutes behind. Everyone’s ready to go, and they’re so polite and humble, willing to work through and take the time. If there are questions or a scene’s not going the way we feel it should, let’s sit down and talk about it. It’s a team effort. Those guys are so good at that, that’s probably the most impactful thing for me.”\n\t\n\n\tAs for the rest of the season, Lofland encourages fans to expect the unexpected in Cooper’s storyline.\n\n\t“There’s definitely going to be some growth, but I’ll tell you, there are a few things coming up that no one sees,” he says. “There are some twists and turns and surprises that I don’t think anyone’s predicted yet. I can’t wait for the world to see it.”\n",

It makes sense! His son Cooper (Jacob Lofland) is making some really reckless decisions in both his personal and professional life; his father, T.L. (Sam Elliott), is moving in; he is being left out of business decisions by his team; and Angela (Ali Larter) is planning another themed dinner. Will Tommy be able to help keep his family and business in order? Find out with this week’s recap.\n\t\n\n\nOops, already crying at happy T.L., looking at the sunset at Tommy’s nice house by the pool.\n“‘Til he dies.” Oh, Tommy, such a way with words.\nNate (Colm Feore), stop trying to throw T.L. out of the house! No one asked you!\nAngela just wants to have a good time and throw parties! Let her live.\nOoh, what does barbecued blue crab taste like? It sounds delicious.\nWhy does Tommy suddenly know the etymology of “buccaneers”?\n“Gulf of America now, baby.” “I don’t give a fuck what they call it.” Will MAGA viewers get rocked by WOKE TOMMY?\nUh oh, Cooper acting rich before he gets a check is a big red flag.\nWhy can’t Ariana (Paulina Chavez) give Cooper her dad’s address? Is a scavenger hunt part of a Catholic proposal?\nOh my gosh, Cooper is so screwed. I’m stressed.\nTommy is being mighty generous to Cooper by bringing him on board. Will his instincts prove to be just blind luck?\n“If she swallowed a lump of coal, she’d make a diamond in three days” is a great folksy description of a wound-up person.\nYou know Tommy’s frustrated when he repeatedly assaults his dependable truck.\nLove these always-rowdy elders at the retirement home. They’re really concerned about Angela’s sex life!\nPhew, MAGA folks will feel welcome again now that Tommy described “The View” as “A bunch of pissed-off millionaires bitching about how much they hate millionaires and Trump and men and you and me and everybody else they got a bee up their ass about.”\nIt’d be kind of great to see T.L. kick Tommy’s ass. I could definitely see it happening!\n“You got a cool voice.” Love the respect for Elliott.\nDamn, is T.L. flirting with Shelby (Audrey McGraw)? They should hook up!\nWow, Rebecca (Kayla Wallace) and M-Tex just got screwed so quickly in that meeting. Their lenders aren’t fucking around anymore!\n“Well, that’s not what your boss says. She says you need a partner pretty bad.” Oof, Gallino (Andy Garcia) knows just how to twist the knife in Tommy.\nWho knew that Gallino was a putting phenom?\nAww, it’s so nice to see T.L. getting a kick out of Angela and Ainsley (Michelle Randolph). They’re fun!\nThe bandage on Alan (Jim Meskimen) is a great callback to Episode 3’s incident at the Cattlemen’s Club.\n“I’ll win this, too.” Uh oh, Cami (Demi Moore)…you’re being a bit cavalier about a cartel.\nWow, it was tough to see Cami check Tommy so deliberately. “Don’t ever summon me to a meeting again.” To be fair, Tommy did tell her to toughen up when taking over the company!\nOh, OK: I guess Cooper getting permission to marry Ariana wasn’t that big of a deal. Crisis averted!\nDamn, Tommy lost both his sense of smell and taste when he was 30? No wonder he’s a grump!\nAngela killed it with the Pirate Dinner. No notes.\nBig laugh with Rebecca’s pirate outfit.\nEven Tommy’s laughing and having fun. Great end to the episode!\n\n\n\n\tUntil next week, describe what you’d wear to Angela’s Pirate Dinner in the comments.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRob Reiner, Legendary Director and Actor, and Wife Found Dead in Apparent Homicide\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInside a Modern Swiss Chalet That Takes Design Cues From Old-World Architecture\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCollege Cup Cash Cow?

Ritter also called out, \"Are you okay?,\" checking on her from the stage.\n      \n\n          Once the woman was safely removed from the crowd and the situation settled, Ritter jumped back into the chorus and finished the song.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The emergency became one of the night's unexpected highlights at the annual holiday concert, which delivered a stacked lineup featuring Third Eye Blind, Evanescence, Papa Roach, Yellowcard, Social Distortion, and Rise Against.\n      \n    \n          And in classic Almost Acoustic fashion, the crowd got one last gift ... a surprise performance from 4 Non Blondes.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                Concerts and Tours\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tAaron Wilson, whose debut feature “Canopy” premiered at Toronto, has a new project selected for the JAFF Future Project with “Under the Banyan Moon,” a cross-cultural romance set between Australia and Indonesia.\n\n\tThe Australia-Indonesia co-production, directed and produced by Wilson alongside Michael McMahon through production company Left-Handed Productions, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\t“Under the Banyan Moon” follows Stella, a 33-year-old schoolteacher from Adelaide, who is blindsided when her fiancé confesses something that completely unravels the future she thought they were building together. Shaken, she ends their four-year relationship and her best friend does what best friends do and takes her on an impulsive escape to Bali.\n\n\n\tA chance reconnection with her old university love, Elang, soon draws her onward to Yogyakarta — but instead of rekindling the past, Stella finds herself unexpectedly drawn to Aditya, Elang’s grounded and enigmatic best friend. As the two drift through the layered, vibrant world of Jogja, their quiet but undeniable connection forces them both to confront the difference between the comfort they’ve clung to and the courage to imagine a new kind of future.\n\n\t“This story comes from a deeply personal place, and has been quietly brewing since my first feature, ‘Canopy,'” Wilson says. “The idea of a romance that bridges Australia and Indonesia, one as close neighbours, has grown out of my decades moving between Australia and Southeast Asia, shaped by the people I’ve met and the cultural textures and relationships that have stayed with me.”\n\t\n\n\tAs a director and writer, Wilson is drawn to the small human moments that reveal who people really are. “This film is about celebrating that connection, leaning into the differences that make us intriguing and the quiet threads that bind us in ways we don’t always realise,” he says.\n\n\tWilson wants to convey the universality of connection through a vibrant cross-cultural romance. “It’s essential that we see the story from two distinct points of view, two people from completely different worlds who change each other in ways they never expected,” he says. “We don’t fall in love because life is perfect, we fall in love because something breaks, and someone sees us clearly in the vulnerable space that opens up.”\n\n\tWilson also wants audiences to feel the color, rhythm, energy and majesty of Adelaide and Yogyakarta, not just as exquisite settings but as two layered emotional characters that have never truly been brought together on screen. “The film is grounded in quiet human moments, but it’s designed as a grand, global love story,” he says. “It should be one that speaks to the heart, celebrates cultural exchange, and reminds us that love, in all its forms, remains one of cinema’s most universal languages.”\n\n\tProducer McMahon adds, “I was immediately struck by the work he had done in crafting a script that intimately explores the connections between Australia and Indonesia — and by his clear intention to partner with the right Indonesian creative collaborators for us to shape it further.” \n\n\tMcMahon emphasized the need for stronger cinematic collaboration between the two countries. “We are neighbours, yet our cinematic storytelling collaboration has remained limited,” he says. “It’s time for that to shift, and this cross-cultural love story between Stella and Aditya offers a genuine and compelling way forward.”\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the filmmakers hope to connect with an Indonesian production company that’s excited to join them on the journey and help shape a film they believe will resonate with Indonesian, Australian and international audiences alike. “Attending JAFF Market to pitch ‘Under The Banyan Moon’ gives us a rare and valuable opportunity to engage with a wide cross-section of the Asian screen industry, but especially in Indonesia, where so much of the film is set and where its emotional heart lies,” the filmmakers say.\n\t\n\n\tWith sales agents, financiers and creative collaborators present, JAFF Market offers an ideal environment to build the partnerships that will carry the project forward. “It’s also exciting to be part of an initiative supported by key organisations in South Australia and Indonesia, that reflects a genuine commitment to strengthening creative ties between our two countries and the region,” they say.\n\n\tThe project is currently in development. JAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n\n\tWilson’s “Canopy” is a nearly wordless World War II survival drama set in the jungles of Singapore. The film competed at the Shanghai International Film Festival and screened at major festivals including Toronto, Busan, Rotterdam and Taipei. His second feature “Little Tornadoes,” co-written with acclaimed Australian author Christos Tsiolkas, won the ADG Award for Best Direction in a Narrative Feature Film (Budget Under $1 Million) in 2022.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPaul Tazewell, the Oscar-winning costume designer behind “Wicked,” has joined the creative team of “Rose Pandanwangi,” an Indonesia-Philippines co-production about celebrated seriosa singer Rose Pandanwangi, the filmmakers revealed to Variety.\n\n\tThe project, directed by Razka Robby Ertanto (“Yohanna”) and produced by Chelsea Islan, Ertanto and Kristine de Leon through production company Summerland, was selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\tTazewell’s involvement marks a significant coup for the biographical drama, bringing his award-winning expertise to a story that spans post-war Indonesia and the Netherlands. The designer won the Academy Award for best costume design for his work on “Wicked.” \n\n\n\tSet in post-war Indonesia, “Rose Pandanwangi” follows the eponymous seriosa singer whose life mirrored the turbulent birth of a nation. Born in wartime Makassar with a voice powerful enough to move soldiers to tears, Rose navigated shifting empires, identities and expectations. After years of exile in Rotterdam, she returned to Jakarta determined to pursue her dream, rising from factory worker to national icon while balancing motherhood and ambition.\n\n\tThe film chronicles Rose’s career as it flourished even as her marriage quietly unraveled, the gap between domestic life and artistic calling widening beyond repair. In Jakarta’s postwar art circles, she found kinship with painter Sudjojono, whose fierce devotion to truth and freedom reignited her own. When political darkness descended and Sudjojono vanished during the anti-communist purge, Rose faced a world where voices like hers were forced into silence.\n\t\n\n\tFor Ertanto, the project represents a deeply personal artistic mission. “Her voice pierced through time, but her story was left behind in history,” the director says. Seriosa music, Indonesia’s unique adaptation of the Western art song, profoundly shaped his artistic identity.\n\n\tBrought to the archipelago by the Dutch through German Lieder as early as the 16th century, seriosa evolved into a refined and expressive form that fused Western vocal techniques with Indonesian languages, values and nationalistic themes. In the 1940s, Rose Pandanwangi emerged as a leading figure in the genre, embodying technical excellence as well as deep cultural pride and resilience.\n\n\tErtanto’s journey toward the film began with a visit to an exhibition of paintings by Sudjojono, a pioneer of Indonesian modern art. Known for his evocative portrayals of women, the painter’s works drew Ertanto in, but it was the quiet presence of Sudjojono’s wife, Rose Pandanwangi, who appeared again and again on his canvases, that sparked the director’s interest.\n\n\t“In her gaze, I sensed a story waiting to be told,” Ertanto says. “That was the moment I knew I had to make this film.”\n\n\tProducer de Leon (“Agapito”), who met Ertanto at Cannes, was immediately drawn to his passion and precision. “He is a meticulous director with a deep love for Southeast Asian history and a genuine commitment to telling women’s stories with nuance and care,” de Leon says.\n\n\tAs a Filipina producer and mother, de Leon felt a profound connection not only to the story but also to Rose herself as a woman, artist and mother navigating the balance between creative ambition and personal responsibility.\n\n\t“‘Rose Pandanwangi’ is more than a biopic of an iconic Indonesian seriosa singer; it is an intimate and layered portrait of a woman who refused to be silenced by war, patriarchy, displacement or politics,” de Leon says. The film follows Rose across continents and decades, from Japanese-occupied Indonesia to post-war Europe to her eventual return home where she became a national icon.\n\n\tThe project is currently in development. JAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "description": "\n\tLoeloe Hendra, whose feature debut “Tale of the Land” won the Fipresci Award at the Busan International Film Festival and screened at the Jogja-Netp",
    "body": "\n\tLoeloe Hendra, whose feature debut “Tale of the Land” won the Fipresci Award at the Busan International Film Festival and screened at the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival, has a new project selected for the JAFF Future Project with “A Life Full of Holes,” a drama about Indonesian migrant workers.\n\n\tThe Indonesia production, directed by Hendra and produced by Indra Yudhitya, Dewi Umaya and Hendra through production company Onomastika Films, is among 10 Asia-Pacific titles selected for the JAFF Future Project at this year’s JAFF Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\t\n\n\t“A Life Full of Holes” follows 17-year-old Sula, who carries the weight of a fractured family after her mother, Lastri, leaves to work as a migrant worker in Taiwan and her father abandons them for another woman. While dreaming of becoming a famous content creator, Sula works in a small shop and cares for her two younger siblings with almost no financial support.\n\n\n\tFear rises when an ambulance returns the body of a migrant worker and Lastri cannot be reached. After being evicted due to her father’s debts, Sula and her siblings move in with an uncaring uncle. Determined to find her mother, she seeks help from her boyfriend, Agus, and contacts Sri, a senior migrant worker, eventually securing a chance to go to Taiwan with Cak Nan, a musician invited to perform there.\n\n\tIn Taiwan, Sula discovers her mother is frail and hiding a painful secret: Lastri lives with an abusive migrant partner and has a child with him. After Lastri dies in a work accident, Sula returns home with grief and a new sibling. Though she rises to become a famous content creator, she can never restore her family’s lost unity.\n\t\n\n\tFor Hendra, the project represents deeply personal territory. “I grew up without parents. Since childhood, both my parents worked as migrant workers abroad,” the director says. “Behind the phrase ‘for a better future,’ lies an invisible wound — children who grew up without love and parental figures. This film is a voice for those who have long been silent, facing stigma and being labeled abandoned.”\n\n\tAs the child of migrant workers, Hendra knows what it feels like to be considered a burden and endure ridicule. “This story reflects me, and millions of other migrant children,” he says. “This film highlights that the struggle of migrant children is not only about waiting for their parents to return home, but also about surviving emotionally.”\n\n\tThe title serves as an analogy for the lives of migrant workers trapped in a cycle of hope and harsh reality: divorce, abandoned children, violence. “This film is important as a bridge to collective awareness, a tribute to those who survive, and an encouragement to create a more caring environment,” Hendra says.\n\n\tThe producers emphasized the urgency of the subject matter, noting that the film is rooted in the anxiety surrounding the realities of Indonesian migrant workers, which touch millions of families. Of the 9.2 million migrant workers, nearly half are illegal, facing the risk of abuse, exploitation and the loss of their human rights.\n\n\t“Behind these numbers are rarely heard stories: children deprived of parental love, families torn apart, and women struggling alone in a foreign land,” the producers say. “For Loeloe, this story is deeply personal — he is the son of migrant worker parents. This authentic perspective strengthens the story.”\n\n\tThrough an intimate and realistic approach, the film depicts the love, pain and longing within a migrant family — a universal issue. Production will take place in Java and Taiwan, involving local talent to maintain cultural authenticity.\n\n\tAt JAFF Market, the filmmakers aim to connect with local investors and prospective international co-production partners who can support and collaborate in bringing the project to fruition. The film is planned to be shot in Indonesia as well as abroad, specifically in countries with the largest number of Indonesian migrant workers, with Taiwan as one of the key locations.\n\t\n\n\t“We hope this film opens important conversations about migration and becomes a voice for Indonesia on the international stage,” the producers say.\n\n\tThe project is currently in development. JAFF Future Project functions as both a development platform and co-production hub, designed to advance independent works toward completion and distribution. The initiative runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta as part of the broader 20th-anniversary celebration of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade was no turkey for NBC. In fact, the broadcaster’s 2025 airing of the annual event is poised to record its biggest combined audience ever.  \n\n\tPer early Nielsen data, the 99th annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade pulled in 34.3 million viewers across NBC and Peacock, with 25.4 million viewers tuning in for the NBC telecast beginning at 8:30amET on Nov. 27. It should be noted that this Nielsen data is preliminary and will change when it becomes official in the coming days.\n\t\n\n\tStill, as it stands, this year’s parade is up 8% in total viewers over 2024, which managed to bring in 31.3 million combined viewers, which was itself a 10% increase over 2023’s 28 million viewers. Per NBC, the 2025 parade was also up 13% in the adults 18-49 demographic from 2024. NBC also claims that numbers were up across all demos, including a 20% increase in viewers under 25. \n\n\n\t“These record-breaking numbers signify how beloved this parade is to our audience and we couldn’t be more thrilled to begin the holiday season on such a wonderful note,” said Jen Neal, executive vice president of live events and specials for NBCUniversal Entertainment. “A profound thank you to Macy’s for their partnership in producing such an iconic event.”\n\n\tElsewhere on the day, the National Dog Show drew 12.8 million viewers, an increase of 4% over 2024. \n\n\t“This year’s record-breaking ratings are a powerful testament to the creative mastery, technical precision and storytelling ambition Macy’s offers,” said Sharon Otterman, chief marketing officer of Macy’s. “We are deeply proud to create entertainment that showcases today’s top talent and captures the cultural zeitgeist to connect with our audiences and consistently redefine the benchmark for televised and streaming programming. As we look toward the 100th Macy’s Parade, we remain dedicated to leveraging our unique capabilities to inspire wonder and joy for millions nationwide, ensuring our programs exceed expectations year after year.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tRenate Reinsve almost didn’t make it to Los Angeles for our interview. \n\n\tThree years ago, while traveling for Oscar campaigning after her breakout ",
    "body": "\n\tRenate Reinsve almost didn’t make it to Los Angeles for our interview. \n\n\tThree years ago, while traveling for Oscar campaigning after her breakout role in “The Worst Person in the World,” she accidentally canceled her ESTA visa application on the plane. “I managed to cancel it somehow. I didn’t notice that I did it,” she recalls with characteristic self-deprecation. Five police officers interviewed her in a back room at customs, debating whether to send her home. It’s the kind of absurd, almost-tragic mishap that seems to follow Reinsve — a woman who describes herself as an “involuntary rebel” who has been kindly asked to leave nearly every job she’s ever had, that wasn’t acting. They’ve included the Girl Scouts and grocery store clerk.\n\t\n\n\tBut when it comes to acting, there’s nothing accidental about Reinsve’s work. In Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” she delivers what may be her most devastating performance yet, playing a woman grappling with her complicated feelings about her late filmmaker father. The role was written specifically for her, building on the deep creative partnership she’s developed with Trier since “Oslo, August 31st” and solidifying their status as one of modern cinema’s most compelling actor-director collaborations.\n\n\n\t“I was very connected to the role,” Reinsve explains during the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast. “It’s not like specifically the story, or like detailed —it’s not my story, but it is kind of. We share that perspective of how complex things are, and how subtle you can say something very dramatic about everyday life and what small moments contain of drama.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s emotional centerpiece — a scene in which Reinsve’s character finally breaks down in bed with her sister, played by Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas — required a delicate balance between preparation and spontaneity. “You can’t really get to somewhere in rehearsal, because then you won’t have the event occur when you’re on set,” she says. \n\n\tWhat made it onto screen includes profound moments not in the script, born from instinct and trust. When her co-star climbed into bed and whispered “I love you” authentically from the character, Reinsve’s character could only respond as honestly, with difficulty saying it back.\n\n\tGrowing up in Norway, surrounded by forests, Reinsve started in the Girl Scouts and was promptly asked to leave after two weeks. “I was just trying to do everything a little bit differently, or I just didn’t get why we had to do it that specific way. Why can’t a birdhouse have five windows?”\n\n\tThe Scout leaders suggested she try theater instead, inadvertently launching a career. That connection to nature remains central to who she is. During the overwhelming whirlwind of her first Oscar campaign, she found solace by taking her tent into the forest. “If I just take my tent, go into the forest, I’ll just wind down,” she says. “When you’re on the [Oscar predictions] lists, there are these forces pulling you towards — should I really work for it? What do I do now? Do I have to change now? You just have to go back to the forest and be like, wait, this is enough.”\n\n\tThat authenticity — that refusal to perform as anything other than herself — is precisely what makes Reinsve so compelling on screen and off. She admits she’s “not very good at networking,” preferring to build relationships slowly with collaborators she trusts. \n\n\tAs awards season conversation builds around “Sentimental Value,” Reinsve remains grounded in gratitude rather than expectation. “Just being on those lists and someone thinking that your performance is something so important to them — it is enough for me, because it’s so insane,” she says. “Whatever happens from now, I am very, very happy.”\n\n\tIt’s a refreshing perspective in an industry often consumed by ambition and calculation. On this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, Reinsve discusses the movies that influenced her, her ambitions as an actor and possible director, and her connection to Mother Earth. \n\t\n\n\tListen below!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRenate Reinsve, Jonas Jacobsen, “Sentimental Value.” (Neon / Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts from her interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you end up with the acting bug?\t\n\n\tI just remembered from another interview today that I grew up — it was a house, a road with some houses. Very few people lived there, and it was surrounded by the forest. So we were in the forest. Since I went to school in the forest, I naturally joined the Girl Scouts. And then I was asked to leave two weeks after. I was just trying to do everything a little bit differently, or I just didn’t get why we had to do it that specific way. Why can’t a birdhouse have five windows?\n\n\tThey came to me one day and said, “You should do something else.” They kindly asked me to leave, but they suggested that I start in the theater. And then I got a really good teacher when I was young because he lived in a town next to where I lived, and he just put so much joy into that for me. That joy has just been driving me, and I’ve tried to have other jobs, but I have been asked to leave all of them. All of them. It’s very sad.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the last job you got fired from?\t\n\n\tWell, I think I moved to Oslo to try to get into theater school, and then I worked in a grocery store, and they asked me to leave there, too. I was organizing the stuff on the shelves, and also working as a cashier. They were like, “Don’t do it like that. They have to be in that order.” And then I don’t have a lot of talent for structure.\n\t\n\t\tSo you’re a rebel?\t\n\n\tInvoluntary rebel. I’ve always tried to be a good girl, but then that stuff just keeps happening.\n\t\n\t\tWhat were some of the early movies that deeply touched you?\t\n\n\tI think the first one that really got to me was David Lynch’s “Mulholland Drive.” It was just so mysterious, and it hit me in places I didn’t know that I had. I think I watched it also too early, but I read about it onlin,e and I saw some people had gone crazy trying to understand it, and then I was even more intrigued — like the power that is in a movie. And then I went down that path of seeing dark, strange movies, and I was so into that kind of perspective for a long time.\n\t\n\t\tIn “Sentimental Value,” you deliver such a deeply emotional performance. The film explores feelings about a complicated father. Did you find any personal connection to the character?\t\n\n\tActually, after “The Worst Person in the World,” Joachim and I started talking about different themes and other character traits we wanted to explore. He’d gotten to know me a lot better, both as an actor and as a person. So he wrote that role for me, and I was very connected to it. “The Worst Person” was also written for me because we got to know each other a little through “Oslo, August 31st,” but very little. We saw each other here and there, and then he wrote that based on what he saw and the little he knew about me. But then this was an even deeper dive into something we had already discussed.\n\t\n\n\tThe sister relationship in “Sentimental Value” is so great because they’re not having an ongoing fight or a big conflict. They see their own lacks through each other. I really love the subtlety of Joachim’s movies and the way we really explore those details together with the actors when we get on set, but also from the stage, where you read the script all the way through.\n\t\n\t\tThat final scene in bed with your sister is devastating. How much did you rehearse that, and how many takes did it take to nail it?\t\n\n\tThat was the question—rehearsing it. Because you can’t really get to somewhere in rehearsal, because then you won’t have the event occur when you’re on set. So we did talk about it, and we actually did it in the audition with Inga, who plays Agnes, but we never got to a place where we kind of landed it.\n\n\tWhen we were on set, everyone was nervous because we knew it was a pivotal scene in the movie and that we needed it to convey a lot of complexity and nuance. It is very sentimental and emotional, and you really need to feel the balance of how far you can go and how much you hold back in those situations. You need to leave space for the audience, too, so they can feel what they’re feeling and have their story in there with the movie. \n\n\tEverything that happened that day is in the script, but it also includes some very profound moments that aren’t. Joachim is a director — he sits by the camera. He’s never behind the monitor, especially not in those big emotional scenes. Inga had this instinct, but she was so scared of ruining the scene that she wanted to climb into bed, but she didn’t. Joachim could feel that she had that instinct, and he said, “Do it,” whispering. Then she climbed up, and she said — and Joachim could never write this — “I love you.” She says it from her authenticity in the scene and from the character. Then, in the moment, my character answers like she can, which is very hard to say back. That became the moment. We probably did it more times, but I think we all knew that was the moment it came together.\n\t\n\t\tYou and Joachim Trier have developed this incredible partnership. Do you feel that same kinship when he calls you and says, “I have a role for you?”\t\n\n\tWell, I didn’t know how, because it’s hard to explain that collaboration, because it’s very intimate in a way when you find someone that you can express something through both of you together. You have the same taste. You understand something about the other person and what they want to express, and you know how to do it because you’re kind of the same.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDo you have a directing bug? Do you feel like you’ll be directing one day?\t\n\n\tI have a lot of curiosity about it. But also editing and the camera. I like all of it. I do. I did direct some things in the theater when I was a teenager, and then I kept getting really good roles. So I haven’t gotten to it. And now I haven’t had any time since I did it back then, and it was a very teenager-like way of doing it.\n\t\n\t\tYou might get an Academy Award nomination. What could something like that mean to you?\t\n\n\tIt’s so far away from the forest in Norway. It’s so shocking to me to be on those lists, and then I’m trying to stay calm and keep my cool because it’s so insane. I’m so grateful now — being on those lists and someone thinking that your performance is something being so important to them — it is enough for me because it’s so insane. So whatever happens from now on, I am very happy.\n\t\n\t\tAre you getting mainstream offers these days? Has Marvel called?\t\n\n\tI, of course, respect it a lot, and I really enjoy it for what it is. But I just don’t think I could do it really well. I admire it. I would be fired. I think I’m so interested in these kinds of stories and personal movies — personal stories in movies and directors that have a vision that everyone follows. You can either work with it or against it — not against it, but there’s a dynamic where you can have your autonomy in that structure.\n\n\tI really love that way of working, and to go into a character in the way that I’ve been able to the last few years has been. I want to keep doing that. I just worked with Sebastian [Stan] again in Christian Mungiu’s next movie. Working with the same people, to have that trust and to go even deeper into collaborating and really building relationships — I’m not very good at networking and stuff, so building relationships slowly.\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s next for you?\t\n\n\tThe next thing I’m doing is Alexander Payne. He’s a really good person. So maybe he has the answers to what we can do to fix everything.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tLast year’s inaugural JAFF Market served as an experiment – Indonesia’s first-ever film market testing whether the local industry was ready for such a platform. The answer, according to organizers, was an overwhelming yes.\n\n\t“We were humbled and grateful for the overwhelming response and engagement by so many different stakeholders in the film industry and realized that JAFF Market is indeed a much-needed platform for the industry to come together, share information and gain new insights, conduct business and expand the dialogue on the future of film in Indonesia and beyond,” says Linda Gozali, JAFF Market director.\n\t\n\n\tFor year two, organizers brought on Amar Bank as a sponsor. “We worked to streamline some of the shortcomings from year one, worked to get a sponsor from the finance sector, Amar Bank, to join us in the journey to enable the market to provide better infrastructure and maintained the elements of welcoming warmth of the Indonesian film industry and community,” Gozali says.\n\n\n\tThe JAFF Market isn’t positioning itself as a rival to established regional platforms like Busan’s Asian Project Market, Hong Kong’s FilMart, the Singapore International Film Festival’s market initiatives, QCinema’s project labs in the Philippines or Taiwan’s TCCF.\n\n\t“JAFF Market does not aim to compete but to work alongside each other’s initiatives,” says Yulia Evina Bhara, JAFF Market advisor. “We are partnering with Busan’s ACFM, Adelaide Film Festival, Tokyo’s TIFFCOM, Korea’s KOFIC, Malaysia’s FINAS, Asian Film Alliance Network, France’s CNC and more to build more bridges and ties to complement and learn from them.”\n\t\n\n\t“JAFF Market is the new kid on the block but we have a very strong local market that is still growing rapidly and have an appetite for connection, collaboration and new talents so we believe that JAFF Market can be the gateway for Indonesia to work closer within the local ecosystem and connect the international interest in the local markets,” Bhara adds. “As Busan grew alongside with the rise of Korean cinema, JAFF Market wants to be a part of the growth of Indonesian cinema to the world.”\n\n\tLorna Tee, JAFF Market advisor, identifies systemic challenges across the region. “Southeast Asia is such a vibrant and diverse geographical and cultural arena, filled with exciting talent in all departments but there are still fundamental gaps in knowledge, the ecosystem and the industry as a whole where areas of talent development, financing, legal, marketing and distribution, audience development, critical film discourse and policy to safeguard and enhance the film industry may be lacking,” Tee says.\n\n\t“Institutional support is inconsistent as the government in the region has varied interests and agenda but we hope to engage the stakeholders in the region to come together during JAFF Market to work on being collaborative instead of competitive within the region as the market is home to more than 700 million people, a sizeable market filled with a large proportion of young people, and the efforts to connect will enlarge the footprint of the films and filmmakers,” Tee adds.\n\n\tGozali notes changing patterns in this year’s submissions. “We are seeing a trend toward more family films, animation, thrillers and new directors infusing more humor and comedy into films as the industry finds ways to attract new audiences and engage on relevant subjects that are hot socio-political themes in the region and possibly globally too,” she says. “Producers understand the need to be ahead of the game and be the ones to shape the appetite of the audience instead of catering the same tired troupes but there is work to be done to pave the way for new genres and voices – convincing the investors, exhibitors and talents – and JAFF Market would also like to enable more programs and events that would enable the producers in that direction.”\n\n\tThe second edition has refined its approach to deal-making. “We are inviting and engaging in a more diverse group of international players that are interested in Indonesia so there are many more new international presence as it is important to not just reach new audiences, but new possibilities in partnerships and deal making,” Bhara says. \n\t\n\n\t“We curated more personalized meetings for our participants, guests and exhibitors. Our content market, project market, talent labs, market conferences, and plaza stage are all structured to cater to different segments of the film industry and we brought on new partnerships to present awards and additional opportunities to engage with local and international partners while utilizing JAFF Market both as a platform for dealmaking but also for promotion and greater engagement with the media and industry as a whole,” she adds.\n\n\tTee emphasizes that producers need to arrive properly prepared. “Many producers who are less experienced in the markets arrive expecting deals to be done with just a premise or a proposal but without a clear understanding of the value of the projects in the market, be it for the financing, sales and distribution or festivals, it would be a waste of time,” she says. “Producers need to understand the package that the market requires and not just how they envision the film to be.”\n\n\tOn navigating budget pressures and financing volatility, Gozali sees the market as a connector. “JAFF Market moves alongside all the changes in the global industry by connecting the vibrant Indonesia film industry with each other and with the world,” she says. “There is enough resources in the market but for the right projects and talents and the programs at JAFF Market aims to help shape the right projects with the right target audience.”\n\n\t“JAFF Market is working closely with all the different government agencies from Indonesia and abroad, to enhance the understanding by the agencies and organizations tasked to support the film industry but ultimately, the policy must look at long term and sustainable infrastructure for all programs and not be ad hoc on the support mechanism,” Gozali adds. “We are also engaging with the corporate, finance and high net worth individuals to bring in new perspectives on financing. And we are focused on pushing further beyond just producing films, but how can the films reach an audience, locally and globally, onto as many distribution channels as possible.”\n\n\tBhara credits Yogyakarta’s atmosphere as an asset. “Jogja provides a casual and artistic landscape that allows for business to happen in a less frantic manner,” she says. “JAFF Festival also has built a strong following over the past 20 years and the attraction of being at the festival is an appeal we will continue to cherish.”\n\t\n\n\tGozali sees year two’s attendance increases as a vote of confidence. “Year two has seen increases in both the number of exhibitors, accreditation, media attendance, and more enquiries by different sectors to be involved in the JAFF Market – and we are excited to not just see the numbers increase, but the trust and faith placed by the film industry with their enthusiasm, participation and contribution,” she says. “We can only project long term vision if we have a long term support by the industry and the authorities where we can connect the national and international, corporate and community and filling in the gaps that are present in the industry so that JAFF Market becomes a solid platform for business of films and more.”\n\n\tBhara outlines the obstacles ahead. “The biggest challenges of the market stem from the lack of long term institutional support, a year round dedicated experienced and enabled team, and the ability to engage with all the different stakeholders locally and internationally to encapsulate as many aspects of the film ecosystem as possible,” she says. “The JAFF Market management is aware of areas where we can further develop and enhance the effectiveness to be a practical, rewarding and fun platform for all our partners, sponsors, exhibitors, filmmakers, producers, talent and the media to enable everyone to benefit fully in their time here – we are working round the clock with a dedicated team to ensure the best experience for all.”\n\n\tTee acknowledges geographical constraints while emphasizing steady development. “As a film market, we can only develop alongside the growth and potential of what the industry, and the city of where it is located,” she says. “Yogyakarta is not easily accessible to international flights and connections so it remains a hurdle to attract the international industry – as we are still taking baby steps to fine tune the role and positioning of JAFF Market, we are more focused on building a strong foundation for JAFF Market alongside the festival.”\n\n\tFor now, the market remains film-focused. “We must admit that we have yet to explore much beyond films but it is something we would definitely welcome for the future programs of JAFF Market,” Tee says.\n\n\tThe JAFF Market takes place alongside the 20th Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival (JAFF). \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival (JAFF) launched in 2006 during Yogyakarta’s 250th anniversary celebration, it was a modest communal experiment driven by young filmmakers and volunteers. A major earthquake nearly cancelled the first edition, but the community’s insistence on continuing established a resilience that has become core to the festival’s identity.\n\n\tTwo decades later, JAFF has transformed from a local cultural gathering into a regional platform with national and global attention, screening 227 films from 47 Asia-Pacific countries at its 20th edition.\n\t\n\n\t“When we started, JAFF was essentially a group of filmmakers, volunteers, and audiences in Yogyakarta trying to build a space where Asian independent cinema could meet their audiences,” festival director Ifa Isfansyah tells Variety. “The biggest shift today is scale. But at its core, the identity hasn’t changed. We are still driven by community, conversation, and films that speak honestly to the region’s realities.”\n\n\n\tThe festival’s early years were defined by visibility battles and infrastructure challenges. Volunteers hand-carried film prints, arranged makeshift subtitles with PowerPoint presentations, and created stages from borrowed materials. The first edition was held not in proper cinemas but in a stage performance building, featuring films the organizers felt they could relate to and potentially make themselves.\n\n\t“Southeast Asian cinema wasn’t yet on the radar of major institutions,” Isfansyah recalls. “We had to convince partners and audiences that these films mattered, even without big names or marketing machines. JAFF had to function almost like an ecosystem builder, not just a festival.”\n\t\n\n\tThat advocacy-driven approach proved transformative for Indonesian independent cinema. The festival grew in parallel with the country’s cinema resurgence after 2000, becoming a home for early shorts, debut features, and experimental films.\n\n\t“Indonesian independent cinema has moved from the margins to becoming a vital narrative force,” says Isfansyah. “The biggest change is confidence. Filmmakers now know their stories deserve the international stage.”\n\n\tThe festival’s impact on exhibition infrastructure has been substantial. Commercial cinema chains have recognized that independent films have an audience, with recent successes including Reza Rahadian’s “Pangku” achieving strong box office performance. Local digital platforms like KlikFilm have found their niche and audience after partnering with JAFF.\n\n\tWhile festivals like Busan, Singapore, Tokyo, and Hanoi provide industry-driven platforms, JAFF has cultivated a more intimate, grassroots approach. The festival positions itself as a space where filmmakers generate new language, new collaborations, and new courage.\n\n\t“Our mission has evolved to bridge the creative and the communal,” Isfansyah explains. “We want to be a place where filmmakers don’t just showcase work but feel supported. Everyone comes to JAFF with one reason: love of watching film.”\n\n\tThe festival’s curatorial approach has evolved from necessity-driven risk-taking to intentional experimentation. Today’s programming challenges formats, platforms hybrid works, and opens conversations intersecting cinema with activism, memory, and indigenous knowledge.\n\n\tHowever, creative freedom has faced new constraints. While early editions screened films without censorship, all films at current editions must pass the censorship board.\n\n\t“In the early years, we had more freedom that we don’t have now,” Isfansyah acknowledges. “But today we can platform films that are politically delicate or structurally radical because we’ve earned the trust of the community and the region.”\n\n\tJAFF’s sustainability model combines government grants, national and local sponsorships, cultural institutions, box office revenue, Sahabat Hanoman memberships, and program-based partnerships with platforms including Netflix, Vidio, and KlikFilm.\n\n\tThe festival has expanded beyond its annual event into a year-round cultural engine, with industry platform JAFF Market, JAFF Community Forum, and educational programs ensuring continuity. Partnerships with Netpac have been particularly significant, bringing networks of mentors, jury members, and collaborators while strengthening regional solidarity.\n\t\n\n\t“Netpac has been a cornerstone for us,” says Isfansyah, noting that the partnership was especially valuable in early editions when organizers were filmmakers without festival experience.\n\n\tThis year’s 20th anniversary lineup prioritizes films carrying sincerity, urgency, and cultural resonance, addressing displacement, ecological trauma, youth identity, and artistic rebellion. The programming balances premieres with local spotlights, including a closing film representing the first feature from a filmmaker who grew with JAFF.\n\n\tSections include Main Competition, Light of Asia, Emerging, Panorama, Asian Perspective Features and Shorts, Indonesian Screen Awards, Community Forum, Rewind, masterclasses, public lectures, workshops, and special screenings.\n\n\tYogyakarta’s audience has become more visually literate, global in perspective, and vocal, with younger viewers embracing hybrid and experimental works. However, the warmth and curiosity that defined early editions remains.\n\n\t“They still watch with their whole heart, and that energy continues to define JAFF,” Isfansyah says. “Sometimes I feel they know more about JAFF itself, since the energy of the festival is getting younger and I’m getting old.”\n\n\tTo ensure standout titles don’t get lost in platform saturation, JAFF focuses on meaningful visibility through contextual programming. Public lectures, workshops, and screenings frame films to stand out through conversation rather than algorithms. The festival also builds bridges between filmmakers and regional festivals, critics, curators, platforms, and labs.\n\n\t“In an oversaturated world, curation and community are more powerful than ever,” Isfansyah notes.\n\n\tReflecting on two decades, Isfansyah identifies early organizational chaos as something he’d change, noting that earlier investment in infrastructure, archives, workflows, and dedicated year-round teams would have accelerated growth. The decision to focus on one festival center helped consolidate energy around what he considers the core of the festival: meeting people.\n\n\tHowever, the sense of family from early editions remains non-negotiable. The open, spontaneous energy where filmmakers, students, professionals, and audiences gathered together represents a spirit of belonging the festival is determined to protect as it scales.\n\t\n\n\t“Success is when a filmmaker tells us that JAFF made them feel braver to tell their own story,” Isfansyah says. “When audiences, filmmakers, students, volunteers, professionals, and communities feel a sense of ownership of the festival, then we’ve succeeded.”\n\n\tAs JAFF enters its third decade, the festival continues balancing local community service with international relevance by staying grounded in Yogyakarta.\n\n\t“We always begin with the local. Yogyakarta is the soul of JAFF,” Isfansyah emphasizes. “Every festival must have responsibility with their territory. When our programming is honest to that community, the international relevance follows naturally.”\n",

Tim Walz didn’t waste a second clapping back after Donald Trump hurled an ugly slur his way -- firing off a simple, deadly one-liner that landed hard.\n      \n    \n          In an X post Friday, Walz fired back with, \"Release the MRI results\" -- a shot aimed at Trump, who’d just hopped on Truth Social late Thanksgiving night to unload a marathon immigration rant ... taking swipes at Minnesota’s Somali community and tossing the nasty r-slur at Walz.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Walz hit back by poking at Trump’s own health mystery -- that hush-hush MRI he reportedly got during an October stop at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n      \n\n          The White House claimed he underwent \"advanced imaging\" and some \"preventive assessments,\" bragged his labs were \"exceptional,\" and even said his \"cardiac age\" was 14 years younger ... but never actually explained what any of those scans were for.\n      \n    \n          Trump’s late-night screed was also packed with racist jabs at Rep. Ilhan Omar and claims that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Somali refugees were overrunning Minnesota.\n      \n    \n          For the record ... Census data puts the state’s Somali population somewhere roughly between 61K and 80K -- nowhere near the numbers Trump claims.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                Tim Walz\n              \n                          \n                Social Media\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "description": "\n\tProduction designer Nathan Crowley found ways to expand the world of “Wicked” in its conclusion, “For Good.”\n\n\tThe story of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) ",
    "body": "\n\tProduction designer Nathan Crowley found ways to expand the world of “Wicked” in its conclusion, “For Good.”\n\n\tThe story of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande) continues, following the choices and consequences the witches made in the first “Wicked.” In “Wicked: For Good,” Elphaba has been declared the “Wicked Witch,” thus determining her destiny.\n\n\tAs a result, she’s forced to hide in the forest.\n\t\n\n\t“In the stage show, that’s written as a grotto. It’s a hiding place,” Crowley explains. In his designs, Crowley notes the forests were “full of circular, rotating trees. They formed fluid shapes.” One idea he had was to put Elphaba in a canopy. It wasn’t in the script, but he had the idea that the forest of Oz would have a mother tree, and that’s where she would create a nest.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCynthia Erivo is Elphaba in WICKED FOR GOOD, directed by Jon M. Chu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversal Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“She has to make a western journey. She has to become the Wicked Witch of the West,” he says. So the forest was to the West.\n\n\tTo build it, Crowley consulted with his greens department to see if they could collect wood from the local forests and weave the nest together with it. “We gave them a big stack of wood from greens, and then we had a platform at the right height, and we had some scaffolding and steel departments to help with the structure,” he says, adding, “It was a very organic set. They went about twisting and weaving all these beautiful shapes.” In total, it took six weeks to assemble the set. “The windows sort of fluidly got woven into that structure.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHe also considered how cinematographer Alice Brooks could light it. “The mold-making department came up a silicone giant leaf mold that we hand-painted leaf veins on; they were transparent, so we could put them on the roof, and then Alice could get light in,” he says. \n\n\tCrowley also had to make a bed within the nest. “It is branches weaving up, creating the bed. I can’t say that we knew what it was when we were making it,” Crowley smiles. “It was a sculptural piece. It’s totally an art installation.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDocumentaries limited by a lack of available video may now have another option: Filmmaker and creative agency vet Daniel Clarke has launched Unfeatured Films, which he boasts will use “cost-effective AI-driven innovation” to take archival photos and footage and turn them into usable video clips.\n\n\tThe company said it plans to “restore and resurrect archival footage in ways never before seen.” \n\n\n\t“We’re building a studio that creates human-centric, cinematic docs that use AI not for shortcuts but for breakthroughs,” Clarke said in a statement. “This allows us to tell the past with the vividness of the present and to do it at a scale and cost that opens new doors for filmmakers and buyers alike. New technology makes the impossible possible, allowing us to film the past. I’m dedicated to using these new tools while preserving the human craft that is imperative to strong storytelling.”\n\t\n\n\tClarke said the documentaries will still rely on a “human-led production process” but incorporate AI techniques for the visuals.\n\n\n\tFirst up: Unfeatured Films has announced its first documentary project, “No Hands: The Wild Ride of the Schwinn Bicycle Company,” which it plans to have ready in time to hit the festival circuit in early 2026. According to Unfeatured, filmmakers working on the project boast credits include the Bill Murray-narrated 2019 film “Loopers: The Caddie’s Long Walk,” and the Jason Bateman-narrated 2014 doc “The Lego Brickumentary.”\n\n\tUnfeatured said it is negotiating with estate and archive owners for footage, and also looking to partner with networks and streaming platforms. Clarke’s credits include working with brands such as Nike and Land O’Lakes, via stints at Grove Labs, Human Design, Escape the Zoo and more.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I have always been a fan of documentary filmmaking and as we enter a new, fast-changing moment for this space, what remains the same is our desire to make emotional connections to timeless subjects,” Clarke (above) said. “Unfeatured was formed to tell stories — rooted in memory, culture and forgotten icons — that have always mattered, but may not have been told in a way that feels fresh and relevant, especially to younger audiences.”\n\n\tHere’s a look at Unfeatured’s sizzle reel from March:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRomanian filmmaker Andreea Cristina Borțun is prepping a feature film to follow on the heels of her anticipated debut, “A River’s Gaze,” a Sebastian Stan-produced drama that’s expected to land a top-shelf festival premiere next year. Borțun is pitching her latest project in the Crossroads Co-Production Forum of the Thessaloniki Film Festival’s industry arm, Agora, which takes place Nov. 2 – 6.\n\n\t“The Life and Times of Ion G.” follows the journey of a man from rural Romania who mysteriously appears one day in an isolated Roma village, searching for the family that abandoned him at birth. Instead he forges an unexpected connection with a strong-willed local woman who offers him a glimpse of the love he never had — and forces him to confront his own inability to open his heart to another soul. \n\t\n\n\tThe film is billed as a “drama with a humorous touch” told from a perspective that is “both tender and comedic,” following the incredible ups and downs of its titular hero — a formerly homeless man who spent nearly three decades drifting on the margins of society in southern Europe, until an improbable twist of fate transformed his life overnight. \n\n\tSpeaking to Variety in Thessaloniki, Borțun said “The Life and Times of Ion G.” explores what it means to love and be loved, examining how emotions are governed not just by personal experience, but by the social and political systems that form us. “How does one develop the ability to love, in the absence of any dynamics or models [that] can help shape it?” the director asked.\n\t\n\n\tAs with her short films “Blue Spring,” which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, and “When Night Meets Dawn,” which debuted in Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight, “Life and Times” employs a filmmaking process that combines traditional scriptwriting with intensive field research. \n\n\tIn each of her films, the director spends extended periods of time immersed in the communities that interest her, “trying to understand how they function and what stories of theirs could be told,” Borțun told Variety. At the heart of every project is a real person who serves as a model for her fictional character, “a sort of ‘living spirit’ that fills the paper-person with life.”\n\n\t“Life and Times” is based on the story of a man whom Borțun refers to as “Jojo.” Raised in rural Romania, he left the country at the age of 30 to pursue better prospects abroad — first in Italy, and then in the south of France, where he eventually spent five years leading a largely peaceful life on the streets of Nice.\n\n\tJojo’s fortunes took an unexpected turn when a devastating 2021 storm swept across the Maritime Alps, the mountain range dividing France and Italy. After making a charitable donation to support the storm’s victims, he became an overnight media sensation — the “homeless migrant” whose generosity so touched the public that the mayor of Nice offered him a job as a street sweeper.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAndreea Cristina Borțun\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sabrina Costinel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBorțun learned of his improbable story several years later. By that point Jojo had a job, an apartment and legal status in France but was now far removed from the public eye. The duo struck up a correspondence on Facebook, with the director quickly warming to Jojo’s humor and charm, as well as his willingness to open up about his vulnerabilities.\n\n\t“He talked to me a lot during that first meeting that we had about loneliness, and the thing that he suffers from most — he calls it the worst illness a human being can have, that solitude,” said Borțun. “To be alone. To not have a partner. To not have a family. The thing he was craving for most of his life was to find somebody that he could be with — a person that he could share his life with.”\n\n\tSince Jojo never had a chance to meet his biological parents, Borțun wondered how the lack of a loving family environment in his childhood might have affected “how his image of love [was] constructed” as an adult. Though he was searching for love, the director asked herself: “What does love mean to him?” \n\t\n\n\tChanneling the work of the German social psychologist and philosopher Erich Fromm, Borțun said she “was interested in how we can transcend this vague sense of what love is, which is for most people a feeling. How can we look at it as a complex process, and as something which is — as Fromm calls it — an art?” she said. \n\n\tThe film explores “the relations between emotions and politics,” and the ways in which Jojo’s inability to express — or perhaps even feel — love as others know it was invariably connected to his lived experience: first, as an orphan in communist Romania, and later as a homeless person largely invisible to both society and the state.\n\n\t“He was deprived of a family. He was deprived of a love environment. You know that him being deprived is inevitably connected to a system,” she said. “How can a system influence the way we feel, and specifically the way one loves?”\n\n\t“The Life and Times of Ion G.” explores such questions through the relationship between the protagonist and Geta, the love interest who follows him from rural Romania to Nice. Utilizing a style that Borțun describes as “transcendental realism,” it incorporates genre elements of romance, dark comedy and Western films to look with “humanity and playfulness at the destinies of the people inhabiting [its] world.” \n\n\tThe film will be the second installment of a planned trilogy about rural Romania that includes “A River’s Gaze” and a third feature, “Egalité.” Borțun, who has already co-directed a short hybrid documentary about Jojo with the filmmaker Philip Cartelli, said she hopes to begin principal photography on “Life and Times” in the autumn of 2026. The film is produced by Gabi Suciu of Bucharest-based Atelier de Film. \n\n\tThe Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCynthia Erivo has swapped the black robes of Elphaba in “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” for the black robes (and grey wig) of a defense attorney in the first look image from “Prima Facie.”\n\n\tThe feature adaptation of Suzie Miller’s award-winning one-woman play — backed by Embankment Films, which launched international sales on the project in Cannes — has now completed principal photography in London. Filming took place at locations including The Old Bailey, Lincoln’s Inn and London’s newest studio complex, The Story Works.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by BAFTA-winning and Emmy-nominated Susanna White (“Woman Walks Ahead,” “Our Kind of Traitor,” “Andor”), “Prima Facie” stars Erivo, an Emmy, Grammy and Tony winner and three-time Oscar nominee, as Tessa Ensler, a brilliant young U.K. attorney. Having risen from working-class roots to become a rising star of the London bar, she’s formidable in her defence of men accused of sexual assault. But just as her career seems to be taking off, she has to make a decision which will put her love of the law in conflict with her personal need to fight for justice.\n\n\n\tThe feature was written for the screen by Miller from her acclaimed play, which was led by Jodie Comer in the West End and Broadway, and won Oliviers for best new play and best actress and the Tony Award for best actress.\n\n\tAlongside a first-look image, the film’s supporting cast has also been revealed, a lineup that includes Daniel Ings (“The Gentlemen,” “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms”), Elizabeth Dulau (“Andor,” “House of Guinness”), Noma Dumezweni (“Murderbot,” “The Undoing”), Toheeb Jimoh (“Ted Lasso, The Power”), Harry Treadaway (“Penny Dreadful, The Crown”), Sarah Junillon (“FBI: International,” “Red Eye”), Elliot Levey (“Bookish,” “Giant”), and Simon Russell Beale (“The Death of Stalin,” “House of the Dragon”).\n\t\n\n\t“Prima Facie” is produced by Greer Simpkin and David Jowsey (“Sweet Country,” “Mystery Road”) for Bunya Productions, and Kevin Loader (“The Choral,” “The Death of Stalin”) for Embankment. Executive producers include Erivo and Solome Williams for their banner Edith’s Daughter (“Drift”), Anita Verma-Lallian for Camelback Productions, Malinda Wink for Minderoo Pictures, Miller and White.\n\n\t“As an actor and executive producer it means so much to be part of the team bringing Suzie Miller’s indelible Prima Facie from stage to screen,” said Erivo. “‘Prima Facie’ is the manifestation of years of dreaming and putting the right pieces together to create that perfect spark. It has been a privilege to work with this crew and creative team whose collective contributions will inevitably affect the larger cultural impact of this film. Tessa Ensler’s story is that of so many and my hope is it reaches the furthest corners and cultivates conversations that help us understand and empathize with one another in ways that are especially needed for these times.” \n\n\tAdded Miller: “Watching the realisation of my one woman play bloom into this multi-dimensional extraordinary film material with all the characters coming to life, has blown my mind. Adding a new layer to the story means ‘Prima Facie’ will speak to all women and ignite even further conversations. Cynthia Erivo has inhabited Tessa and made her completely her own. She is an actress at the pinnacle of her talent, and we look forward to sparking change.”\n\n\tEmbankment has significantly pre-sold the film across key international territories and is handling worldwide sales and distribution, co-representing U.S. rights with UTA Independent Film Group and CAA Media Finance.\n\n\t“I first read Prima Facie while it was a play in Australia and was immediately captivated by Suzie’s blend of mission and fabulous sense of humour,” said White. “The challenge for me was taking a brilliant stage monologue and turning it into a powerful piece of cinema, taking the ideas and exploring the narrative visually. I wanted this important story, which affects one in three women, to spark conversation and stay with audiences long after they leave the cinema.” \n\n\tProducers Simpkin, Loader and Jowsey added: “The producing team hold the highest hopes for the film ‘Prima Facie,’ it will deliver a strong contemporary story and powerful themes. We have captured the cinematic beauty of Autumn in London, with finely nuanced direction by director Susanna White and an astounding lead performance by Cynthia Erivo. We can’t wait to share the film with the world.”\n\t\n\n\t“Prima Facie” is an Australia-U.K. co-production between Bunya Productions and Embankment Films. Major production investment came from Minderoo Pictures, in association with Screen Australia and Camelback Productions. It was financed with support from Screen NSW and Bunya Productions. Post, digital and visual effects were supported by Screen NSW..\n",

    "body": "\n\t“River,” a survival slasher from first-time feature director Joshua Giuliano, is uniting two modern scream queens.\n\n\tThe film, a Shudder Original Production which is in post-production and set for theatrical release through Independent Film Company, stars Jane Levy (“Evil Dead”), Jessica Rothe (“Happy Death Day”), Dane DiLiegro (“Prey”) and Max Mattern (“Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy”).\n\n\n\tInternational rights will be introduced to buyers at the upcoming AFM by Upgrade.\n\t\n\n\tPer a press release, the premise of “River” is “three estranged siblings reunite in their hometown after the death of their father, and they set out to scatter his ashes at his favorite spot on a remote river. But when their boat breaks down, the trip devolves into a waking nightmare. Stranded miles from help with no cell service, they soon realize they’re being stalked by a faceless killer who has emerged from the woods. To survive the night, the siblings must put their long-standing grudges aside and fight together against a ruthless, almost mythic terror.”\n\n\n\tGiuliano is delightfully described as “an L.A.-based horror filmmaker by way of the cornfields of Indiana. Having grown up religious and terrified of everything, horror filmmaking never seemed like a plausible career choice for him, but his childhood constraints and need to explore beyond his boundaries ultimately proved to be the perfect ingredients for crafting viscerally terrifying and deeply personal projects. His short films have won numerous awards at various festivals around the world, including the Fantasia Film Festival, Fantastic Fest and Frightfest.”\n\t\n\n\t“’River’ was six years in the making, a labor of love that culminated in the most rewarding experience of my life,” Giuliano said in a statement. “Working with Shudder has been a thrilling collaboration and knowing ‘River’ will have a theatrical release is a dream come true. I look forward to sharing our terrifying creation with audiences.”\n\n\t“River” is produced by Steven Schneider (“Insidious”) from Spooky Pictures, Nick Antosca and Alex Hedlund (“Chucky”) from Eat the Cat, and is executive produced by Jeffrey Tinnell and Robert Tinnell (“The Hunted”) from Allegheny Image Factory, as well as Matt Brodlie and Jonathan Kier from Upgrade.\n\n\t“Josh is a striking new voice in horror,” Shudder’s vice president of development and production Nicholas Lazo said in a statement. “His simultaneously beautiful and horrifying script captivated us from page one, and it’s our privilege to team up with such an immensely talented group of producers, cast and crew to bring his feature debut to life.”\n\n\tLevy and Rothe are repped by United Talent, Mattern is repped by Buchwald and DiLiegro and Giuliano are repped by CAA.\n",

Live.”\n\n\tUp next, his work will be seen in “Wicked: For Good” out on Nov. 21.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMillie Bobby Brown recently told British Vogue that her biggest issue with the press is the need for journalists to outright slam celebrities in article headlines. The “Stranger Things” star went viral in March when she posted an Instagram video that called out The Daily Mail and other publications for bullying her with headlines that criticized her physical appearance while she was on the press tour for Netflix’s “The Electric State.” Brown told Vogue that she was “crying every day” having to endure these headlines.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Oh my God, what has she done with her face? Why has she gone blonde? She looks 60 years old!’” Brown said, mocking the press headlines. “I respect journalism. I love reading articles on my favorite people and hearing what they’re up to. I understand that there’s paparazzi, even though it’s invasive, even though it feels like shit to me – I know that’s your job… But don’t, in your headline, slam me at the get-go. It is so wrong and it is bullying, especially to young girls who are new to this industry and are already questioning everything about it.”\n\n\n\tThe various headlines written about Brown at the time included the likes of “Why are Gen Zers like Millie Bobby Brown ageing so badly?” and “What has Millie Bobby Brown done to her face?” These articles made Brown “depressed for three, four days,” she told Vogue. The actor even recalled weeping backstage at the BRIT Awards before presenting Sabrina Carpenter with an award.\n\n\t“I was crying while I was getting my hair and make-up done. I was even welling up when I saw [Sabrina] backstage,” Brown remembered. “Her mentality is very much like ‘Fuck ’em’, which I knew inside of me, but when you hear someone else say it, you’re like, ‘Yes! That’s it!’”\n\t\n\n\t“If me being blonde or wearing more make-up really bothers you, I’m going to address it – not just for myself, but for every other girl who wants to try a new hairstyle or wear a red lip,” Brown added about why she posted the Instagram video. “It’s, like, get off my fucking case, you know? I am 21. I am going to have fun and play and be myself.”\n\n\tIn her March video post, Brown said the press “act like I’m supposed to stay frozen in time” when it comes to her physical appearance, and she blasted “the people who are so desperate to tear young women down.”\n\n\t“This isn’t journalism. This is bullying,” Brown said of the press coverage. “The fact that adult writers are spending their time dissecting my face, my body, my choices, it’s disturbing. The fact that some of these articles are written by women? Even worse. We always talk about supporting and uplifting young women, but when the time comes, it seems easier to tear them down for clicks. Disillusioned people can’t handle seeing a girl become a woman on her terms, not theirs. I refuse to apologize for growing up. I refuse to make myself smaller to fit the unrealistic expectations of people who can’t handle seeing a girl become a woman. I will not be shamed for how I look, how I dress, or how I present myself.”\n\n\tBrown is back making the press rounds ahead of the launch of “Stranger Things 5,” which is also the Netflix series’ last. But things are a lot different this time around, as Brown announced in late August that she adopted a baby girl with husband Jake Bongiovi. Brown told Vogue that protecting her daughter from the press is of the utmost importance.\n\n\t“For me, it’s really important to protect her and her story until she’s old enough to potentially one day share it herself,” Brown said. “It’s not my place to purposefully put her in the spotlight unwillingly. If she chooses to share her personality one day with the world, like I did when I was young, that’s something we’d support. But right now, as she’s so little… As her parents, it’s our job to protect her from that.”\n\n\tHead over to British Vogue’s website to read Brown’s cover story in its entirety.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Picnic at Hanging Rock: The Musical,” an adaptation of Joan Lindsay’s eerie novel, will begin performances on Dec. 16 at the Greenwich House Theatre (27 Barrow Street) for a strictly limited engagement. \n\n\tThe show boasts a book and lyrics by Hilary Bell and music and arrangements by Greta Gertler Gold. It is directed by Portia Krieger with choreography by Mayte Natalio. The off-Broadway production will run until Jan. 17, 2026. It’s one of the rare new musicals to hit the theater scene this fall — a collection that also includes “The Queen of Versailles” and “Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York)” on Broadway.\n\t\n\n\t“Picnic at Hanging Rock” is probably best known through Peter Weir’s iconic film, considered to be a classic of Australian cinema. This musical adaptation reimagines the story of a group of teenage schoolgirls who go on a picnic to the foreboding Hanging Rock through a female lens. The mysterious power of the tale comes from its essential puzzle — how did three of the girls vanish without a trace? “Picnic at Hanging Rock” unfolds against the backdrop of Australia’s wild natural beauty, while offering a First Nations perspective on its exploration of innocence and fate. \n\n\n\tBell is the author of such plays as “Summer of Harold,” “Splinter” and “Wolf Lullaby.” Gold co-created the concert production of “Triplight” at Joe’s Pub and is collaborating on new musicals with Susan Bernfield and Stew (“Passing Strange”). Her works include the psychedelic rock musical “The Red Tree” and the touring children’s musical “All Aboard.” Krieger was the associate director for Broadway’s “Seminar,” “Almost Famous,” and “Fun Home.” She has worked at 2ST, Playwrights Horizons, Roundabout and New York Stage & Film.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast features Tatianna Córdoba (“Real Women Have Curves”); Erin Davie (“Grey Gardens”); Sarah Ellis; Carly Rose Gendell (“School of Rock”); Gillian Han; Alexandra Humphreys; Bradley Lewis (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”); Kate Louissant (“A Wonderful World”); Marina Pires (“How to Dance in Ohio”); Maddie Robert (“Gypsy” at Godspeed); Brandon Keith Rogers (“The Heart” at LaJolla); Reese Sebastian Diaz (“Dear Evan Hansen”); Lizzy Tucker (“Boop!”); Kaye Tuckerman (“The Boy from Oz”); Sarah Walsh (“School of Rock”); and Jordan White.\n\n\t“Peter Weir’s stunning film grabbed my imagination as a young person and has always haunted me,” said Gold. “The chance for Hilary Bell, Portia Krieger and me to bring it to life as a musical featuring so many diverse female voices and opening the story up to a crucial First Nations Australian perspective, has been a dream come true.”\n\n\tGold continued, “I’ve always been drawn to darker stories in musicals. It is an exciting challenge to retell this nuanced, female-centered and unresolved tale. It came to Joan Lindsay as a dream when she was 69 years old and has rippled onwards for decades.”\n\n\t“Picnic at Hanging Rock” features scenic design by Daniel Zimmerman; costume design by Ásta Bennie Hostetter; assistant costume design by Jemima Firestone Greville; lighting design by Barbara Samuels; and sound design by Nick Kourtides. Anessa Marie is the music director and conductor and Britt Berke is the associate director. Production stage manager is Kelly Stillwell. First Nations dramaturg is Nick Harvey-Doyle. Rob Jost is the music contractor.\n\n\tThe show is produced by Irma Theatricals. Co-producers are Willette & Manny Klausner, Lara Goodridge, Alec Stais & Elissa Burke, Cordelia Stephens. Associate producers are BJ Jackson, Anna Orszaczky and Karen Robson. Casting is by The TRC Company’s Kevin Metzger-Timson, CSA and Tara Rubin, CSA. General manager and executive producer is Carl D. White (Martian Entertainment).\n",

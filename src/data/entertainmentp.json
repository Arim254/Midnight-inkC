    "body": "\n\tThe Game Awards keeps getting bigger each year.\n\n\tWhen the annual kudofest recognizing the best of the video-game industry kicked off in 2014, it registered 1.9 million livestreams. It has exploded exponentially since then: The 2025 Game Awards show on Dec. 11 broke viewership records with an estimated 171 million global livestreams of the full broadcast, up 11% over the previous record-setting 2024 tally of 154 million livestreams.\n\n\n\tSEE ALSO: The Game Awards 2025 Winners List\n\t\n\n\tThose numbers include only streams of the full broadcast, not counting associated clips or trailers. In addition, viewership from Amazon’s Prime Video — which carried the Game Awards this year, the first time a subscription-streaming service streamed the show — is not included in the 2025 total.\n\n\tThe Game Awards delivered over 171 million livestreams across multiple digital networks, including YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok Live, X, Kick, Facebook and Instagram Live as well as across platforms in China and JioHotstar in India. According to StreamCharts, Twitch, YouTube and other Western platforms had 4.4 million peak concurrent viewers combined, up 9% from last year’s ceremony.\n\n\tOn YouTube, the 4K Game Awards feed delivered a 8% year-over-year jump in peak concurrent streams to nearly 1.4 million. Across all of YouTube (including co-streams), TGA on YouTube was up 9% to over 2.4 million peak concurrent streams. In addition, more than 8,600 channels co-streamed the show on YouTube, a new record.\n\n\tOn Twitch, more than 1.8 million peak concurrent users watched TGA 2025 with total unique viewers increasing 5% year over year, and hours watched increasing 5% from last year. Co-streaming on Twitch saw a record setting 16,500 creators sharing the show with their audiences, up 50% from 11,000 co-streamers a year ago.\n\t\n\n\tOn X, posts about the Game Awards were up 12% year over year to more than 1.79 million between Dec. 10-12. There were over 60 million video views on X, spanning the official broadcast and related videos shared to X. Authenticated viewer voting for The Game Awards increased over 10% from 2024 to more than 123 million, including the Players’ Voice award.\n\n\tGlobally, TGA achieved its biggest ever results with live distribution in China on a record number of platforms including live distribution on Bilbili, Huya, Weibo, WeChat, Douyin, Zhihu, DouYu, Baidu, TapTap, XiaoHongShu, QQ, Kuishou, YouKu, RED, HeyBox; in South Korea or CHZZK and Soop, and NicoNico in Japan.\n\n\tThe Game Awards 2025 were held at the Peacock Theater on Dec. 11 in L.A. This year, Sandfall Interactive and Kepler Interactive’s “Clair Obscur: Expedition 33” received top honors as the 2025 Game of the Year award recipient. The title also won awards for game direction, narrative, art direction, score and music, performance, best independent game, best debut indie game and best RPG.\n\n\tThe show included a special live musical performance by Evanescence, which performed “Afterlife” from Netflix animated series “Devil May Cry,” based on Capcom’s action-adventure video game franchise. Additionally, the cast of Paramount Pictures’ upcoming film “Street Fighter” presented the award for best ongoing game, which was won by Hello Games’ “No Man’s Sky.”\n\n\tThe 2025 Game Awards also featured a host of big names in games and entertainment as presenters, including Dan Houser, David Harbour, Elijah Wright, Felicia Day, Gemma Chan, J.J. Abrams, Jeffrey Wright, Lenny Kravitz, Maggie Robertson, Megan Everett, Mike Booth, Milla Jovovich, Miss Piggy, Neil Newbon, Nicolas Doucet, Rahul Kohli, Rebecca Ford, Rowlf, Todd Howard and Tricia Helfer. The Game Awards Orchestra’s “Game of the Year” medley, composed by Lorne Balfe, featured music from this year’s slate of Game of the Year nominees.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMiss Piggy (left) on stage with Game Awards host and executive producer Geoff Keighley\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPictureGroup\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Game Awards also revealed a first look at upcoming games and entertainment properties including “007 First Light” (IO Interactive), “4:LOOP” (Bad Robot Games and Sony Interactive Entertainment), “Invincible VS” (Skybound Entertainment), “Out of Words” (Kong Orange, WiredFly and Morten Søndergaard in partnership with Epic Games Publishing), “Resident Evil: Requiem” (Capcom), “Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic” (Arcanaut Studios), “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” (Universal Pictures), “Tomb Raider: Catalyst” and “Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis” (Amazon Games and Crystal Dynamics) and “Warlock: Dungeons & Dragons” (Invoke Studios and Wizards of the Coast).\n\t\n\n\tThe Game Awards is executive produced by Geoff Keighley and Kimmie Kim.

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tPresident Donald J. Trump is set to deliver a primetime national address from the White House at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday. \n\n\tThe address, set to focus on Trump’s economic record and his 2026 policy priorities, comes at a critical moment for the Republican leader. The president’s handling of tariff-linked inflation, slowing hiring data, and a looming midterm election cycle has sparked heightened public scrutiny and heated debate across both ends of the political aisle.\n\n\n\tThe address will will broadcast live across major networks — including FOX, NBC, ABC and CBS — alongside respective commentary and post-coverage analysis. Cable-cutters can tune into the address live via live TV streamers such as Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV, FuboTV, Sling TV and Philo through their local broadcast affiliates\n\n\tIn his remarks, Trump is expected to tout administration accomplishments on jobs, border security and manufacturing investment, even as recent polls show eroding public confidence in his economic stewardship. Officials inside the West Wing hope a clear message from the Oval Office will reframe the narrative after Democrats made unexpected gains in recent state elections. \n\n\tOver the past several days, Trump has ignited widespread backlash for inflammatory comments about the death of filmmaker Rob Reiner. The “This Is Spinal Tap” director and longtime Trump critic was tragically found dead with his wife last weekend. Trump went so far as to suggest, without evidence, that Reiner’s outspoken opposition to him had somehow contributed to the filmmaker’s fate, using the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” in posts on Truth Social. \n\n\n\tNetwork bosses have reportedly reshuffled their primetime schedules to accommodate the address, bumping entertainment staples. The series finale to “Survivor,” however, is still set to air at the same time on Wednesday night, available to stream live on Paramount+.\n\n\tStream Trump’s national address on DirecTV below:\n",

    "body": "\n\tJon M. Chu will receive the inaugural Judy Garland Award at the Lumiere Awards.\n\n\tThis newly-established honor celebrates individuals whose artistry, imagination, and cultural influence embody the highest ideals in entertainment.\n\n\tThe award was created to commemorate Judy Garland’s legacy as an actress, singer, and performer, the award recognizes creators whose work elevates storytelling and continues to inspire audiences around the world. Lorna Luft collaborated closely with the Advanced Imaging Society to shape this tribute, which will be presented for the first time on February 9, 2026, at a luncheon at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\t\n\n\tChu’s acclaimed body of work — from “Crazy Rich Asians” and “In the Heights” to “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” — has cemented his place as one of today’s most visionary and emotionally vibrant filmmakers. \n\n\n\tLuft said, “I find Jon to be one of the most important, generous, and brilliantly talented directors within this new generation of filmmakers.” She added, “I am so honored to be the one presenting him with this well-deserved award, as he is probably the only filmmaker who could have beautifully bridged the world of the original Oz film with this exuberant new generation of ‘Wicked’ fans. My deepest thanks and congratulations to Jon for expanding our Oz family.”\n\n\t“Jon’s remarkable talent, vision, and heart make him an especially meaningful choice for this inaugural honor,” said Jim Chabin, President of the Advanced Imaging Society. “In bringing ‘Wicked’ to the screen, he extends Judy Garland’s legacy of emotional honesty, artistic brilliance, and transformative storytelling. His work embodies everything this award seeks to celebrate.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Lumiere Awards brings together leading filmmakers, technologists, and industry innovators to celebrate artistic achievement — and to honor Chu’s extraordinary contributions to cinema alongside Garland’s enduring legacy.\n\n\tThrough the years, AIS honorees have included James Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Ang Lee, Jennifer Lee, James Mangold, Jon Favreau, Christopher McQuarrie, Victoria Alonso and others.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIllinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed SB 1911, which expands and enhances the Prairie State’s film production tax credit. The bill is part of a larger economic development package and aims to make the Land of Lincoln a more film-friendly state with increased tax credits for production expenses on Illinois residents and vendors as well as more flexibility for non-residents working in the state. \n\n\tThe new incentive offers a 35% tax credit for hiring Illinois residents, increased from 30%, and a 35% tax credit for engaging Illinois vendors, also increased from 30%.\n\t\n\n\tMoreover, productions in Illinois may now include up to 13 non-resident crew positions (up from 9), receiving a 30% credit on the first $500,000 of each qualifying salary. Non-resident actors, meanwhile, remain eligible for a 30% credit on the first $500,000, with updated allowable counts based on respective project budgets.\n\n\n\tFour actors are eligible on projects under $20 million, five actors for projects $20 million–$40 million, and six actors for projects over $40 million. For series, these limits apply on a per-episode basis.\n\n\tA 5% stackable tax credit is also available for productions filmed outside of the greater Chicago area of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties. \n\n\tTelevision series relocating in Illinois will also be eligible for a stackable 5% credit for the first season of Illinois production spend, as will any production implementing the state’s certified “green” sustainability plan.\n\n\tThe state’s minimum spend requirement to be eligible for these incentives remains a conservative $100,000 for projects with runtimes of 30 minutes or more, and $50,00 for projects with runtimes under 30 minutes. The credit is fully transferable and the state has no annual cap.\n\t\n\n\tGovernor Pritzker states, “The Film Production Tax Credit continues to fuel an industry that is central to Illinois’ cultural and economic vitality. With this expansion, we are doubling down on our commitment to building a world-class creative workforce and ensuring that productions from around the globe choose Illinois as their home.”\n\n\tThe Illinois Production Alliance announced the update on Dec. 17. All provisions in the Bill take effect immediately, with benefits applying retroactively to qualified applications submitted on or after July 1, 2025. Tax credits can be carried forward 5 years from when they are originally issued by the Illinois Film Office. The Bill also extends the program to 2039.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJake and Romy Reiner, children of Rob and Michele Reiner, have spoken out for the first time after their parents were found murdered at their Brentwood home Sunday. Their brother, 32-year-old Nick Reiner, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder on Tuesday.\n\n\t“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” Jake and Romy said in a statement to People. “The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren’t just our parents; they were our best friends.”\n\t\n\n\tThey added, “We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life. We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave.”\n\n\n\tNick Reiner appeared in court for the first time Wednesday morning after being charged with the murders of his parents on Tuesday. He did not enter a plea and agreed to postpone his arraignment until Jan. 7.\n\n\tRob and Michele Reiner were found dead in their home on Sunday afternoon, and Nick was arrested that night. According to The New York Times, Romy discovered her father’s body after a massage therapist couldn’t reach them. Nick Reiner could face up to as much as life in prison without parole or the death penalty.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJ. Smith Cameron is the latest guest star to join Season 3 of “Elsbeth,” the CBS mystery series that serves as a spinoff to “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight,” and stars Carrie Preston as the de facto detective Elsbeth Tascioni.\n\n\tCameron will play Isadora, aka Izzy, the director of New York’s most prestigious debutante ball. Per the logline, “When the father of a current deb turns out to be the man who humiliated Izzy at her own introduction to society, this Queen Bee of Manhattan society takes her meticulously planned revenge.”\n\t\n\n\tCameron is best known for her role as Gerri Kellman on HBO’s boardroom drama “Succession.” She was nominated for two Emmys, a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice Award for her performance, and she shared in the success of two SAG Awards for outstanding ensemble in a drama series. Cameron’s additional credits include “Murdaugh: A Death in the Family,” “Hacks,” “Search Party,” “Rectify” and the FX pilot “7 Sisters.”\n\n\n\t“Elsbeth” Season 3 premiered on Oct. 12 and runs through December. The majority of the show functions as a “howcatchem” mystery, rather than a “whodunit” — in other words, the audience typically knows who the murderer is at the beginning of each episode. The series premiered in February 2024 and kicked off its second season just months after the first season aired.\n\n\tThe show prides itself on a vibrant roster of guest stars including Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, Alan Ruck, Jane Krakowski, David Alan Grier, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Mary-Louise Parker and Tracy Ullman, among many others. In Season 3, Julia Fox played a New York City “grief influencer” and Stephen Colbert played a late-night host.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCheap Trick has been feeling the heat from some fans since performing at the Donald J. Trump-hosted Kennedy Center Honors, an event that has become a political flashpoint since the president took over as chairman of the board of the Kennedy Center and installed a new board of his supporters. \n\n\tNow, amid an outcry that has had some followers renouncing their fandom of Cheap Trick following the performance — as well as, inevitably, Trump supporters publicly doubling up on their love for the band in response — the group has issued a statement insisting nothing more should be read into their appearance than a kinship with Kiss.\n\t\n\n\t“We were asked to perform at this year’s Kennedy Center Honors ceremony to pay tribute to our lifelong brothers in KISS, and to support artists and the arts,” the band said in a message posted on Cheap Trick’s X and Instagram accounts. “We agreed to do it for those reasons, and no others.”\n\n\n\tThe veteran group performed “Rock ‘N Roll All Nite” in salute to Kiss, which was being inducted as a Kennedy Center honoree along with Sylvester Stallone, George Strait, Gloria Gaynor and Michael Crawford. The show will be broadcast on CBS at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Dec. 23.\n\n\n\tThis year marked a sharp break from the Kennedy Center Honors of the past, with most of the honorees known to be friends or at least friendly with Trump, who has otherwise alienated much of the artistic community. All of the honorees came to the White House the day before the event to receive newly redesigned medallions, with the president remarking on what a good friend Gene Simmons has been to him over the years as he placed a medal around the Kiss guitarist’s neck.\n\t\n\n\tSome fans of Kiss have balked at their favorite band accepting the honor from Trump, as well, although being a Kiss fan generally involves not holding the band to exceptionally high standards of social consciousness — and with Simmons’ past support for Trump, it didn’t come as a major surprise to many when the group accepted his blessing.\n\n\tCheap Trick fans, though, may have had more reason to be surprised, to the extent that they may have believed the performance meant the band was down with the takeover of the Kennedy Center by a figure perceived as a villain and enemy of the arts among much of the rock world.\n\n\tBack in 2016, singer Robin Zander noted that the group had turned down an offer to play the Republican convention that year. “The Republican National Committee called our office and offered us $100,000 to play at their convention in Cleveland [this summer],” he told the Guardian. “We turned it down. Then we had second thoughts. Maybe we should have accepted it – but we would all have got swastika guitars made.” (Tom Petersson was more circumspect, just telling the reporter, “We thought better of it.”)\n\n\tThe responses to Cheap Trick’s new statement on their social accounts were across the spectrum:\n\n\t— “Everyone involved should have told Trump to go fuck himself. Your apology is weak sauce.” (Cheap Trick’s statement is not actually an apology.)\n\n\t— “Thank you so much for posting this. There’s definitely been a divide among the fans, and KISS is having it twice as much with their KISS Army. I’m sure Paul Stanley will have more to say about this after the show airs on television next week. For now, it’s all about the music.”\n\n\t— “A lot of artists put on the spot. I respect your decision as well as that of those who choose not to.”\n\n\t— “The band doesn’t express any political affiliation. But I do!! TRUMP RULES!!”\n\n\t— “I’m sure with a 50 yr career you’ve said no to other gigs. You’ll wear this forever. Such a disappointment.”\n\n\t— “Kiss had your back in the 70’s and gave you a great spot to spring from. You were there to honor them.”\n\n\t— “Hmmm… it’s hard to be neutral with Donald Trump. You’ll catch flack, I hope Kiss is worth the blowback.”\n\n\t— “Sad you even thought this needed posted. People need to grow a pair.”\n\t\n\n\t— “That’s a sorry excuse. You shouldn’t do it. You’re normalizing this madness by being part of it. Not that it should matter to you but because of this I will no longer be a fan.”\n\n\t— “Bun E. must be the only sane one left. And that is saying something!” (Founding member Bun E. Carlos is no longer with the group.)\n",

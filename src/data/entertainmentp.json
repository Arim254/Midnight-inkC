    "body": "\n\tArkansas native John-Michael Powell had something to prove by foregrounding the Ozark mountains in his new crime thriller “Violent Ends,” in theaters now via Independent Film Company.\n\n\t“There’s some great Southern cinema, don’t get me wrong,” Powell says. “But I think oftentimes Southerners, and Arkansans especially, are relegated to redneck yokel stereotypes: The lovable fools, the nitwits and the uneducated. That was true of my experiences growing up. We had family in California, so we’d always visit, and I don’t have an accent, but my mother and my family sound like Southern belles. To see the way people reacted to the accent … their first inclination was, ‘Oh, that’s so cute,’ but really the subtext was, ‘Oh, they’re less intelligent than us, and lesser.’ I do think that has a lot to do with the way cinema portrayed Southerners.”\n\t\n\n\tThe taut, bloody “Violent Ends” follows Lucas Frost (Billy Magnussen), who rebels against his criminal family, and soon wages war against them when a botched robbery turns deadly. Powell, who wrote and directed the film, says that the idea itself is rooted in the traditions and legacies of the South.\n\n\n\t“I grew up in this very specific slice of Americana in Arkansas,” he says. “I wanted to write a story about the place I came from, a smart genre picture through the lens of the world I grew up in, and that could only come from my voice. That started with family; I’m always drawn to stories about families and the conflicts within families. ‘Violent Ends’ is very much about one family: It’s the Hatfields and McCoys if the McCoys weren’t even in the story. It’s just the Hatfields going at each other. In the South, there’s a long history of these families that have been around for generations. My movie is very much about the cyclical nature of violence and how that violence, anger and hatred can get passed down from one generation and spiral out of control.”\n\t\n\n\tPowell has a love of stylish crime thrillers, namechecking filmmakers like the Coen brothers and Jeremy Saulnier, as well as works like Jeff Nichols’ “Shotgun Stories” and David Cronenberg’s “A History of Violence,” as inspirations. One Coen brothers specialty in particular that the director tried to match was having even minor characters carry a scene to make the South feel lived-in.\n\n\t“I wanted to create a world that not only had Billy Magnussen and the leads carrying the story, but had little pockets of side characters that were interesting,” Powell says, “One of the things that stands apart in this movie is that even the little characters who only show up for a scene or two make their mark and are memorable. It was always about trying to bring people to Arkansas into a world that they never knew and show them that they were regular people that were both black and white, flawed, gray and everything in between. It was just trying to show a really nuanced portrayal of the Southern American.”\n\n\tDespite his strong vision, Powell’s road to making “Violent Ends” was a complex journey. In addition to a day job as an editor, he finished the script in 2013, and was almost able to make the film in 2017 (“We were a few weeks away from shooting, and it fell apart, like a lot of indie movies do”). He took a step back during the pandemic and shot a microbudget feature called “The Send-Off” that effectively served as a film school education. Powell admits that while waiting to make “Violent Ends” was difficult, the roundabout path of getting it made allowed him to sharpen his skills and assemble a cast filled with strong character actors that he was proud of.\n\n\t“It’s a brutal process of constantly getting rejected,” he says. “And obviously, when the house of cards fell apart in 2017, that was gut-wrenching. But it’s so easy for me to be excited about the process because I can just go back to the page and write. I can go back, and I can be the little only child who’s getting excited about the movie in my head. I have a tireless, unrelenting desire to make things, and I hope ‘Violent Ends’ comes out and people are really excited about it. But should it not? That’s okay. I’ll continue making movies. If I have to go make a movie on my iPhone for $15 with my friends, I’ll go do it. I’m in love with the process of making movies.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the “Violent Ends” trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOver a decade ago Amber Rasmussen met Brandon Johnson on Tinder and was smitten. Johnson’s “crazy” ex-wife, Athena Klingerman, was annoying and constantly texting Johnson about their young daughter, but Rasmussen overlooked any red flags and eventually married Johnson in 2017. Soon after, things quickly began to fall apart. It turned out that Klingerman wasn’t the problem. It was Johnson.\n\n\t“Don’t Date Brandon,” Paramount’s latest true-crime docuseries explores how Jonhson lied and almost got away with everything but murder. The docuseries reveals that while married to Rasmussen, Johnson lied about working for Nike, faked cancer, and continuously cheated on his wife. He also set up a fake coparenting app and pretended to contentiously communicate with Klingerman about their daughter. \n\t\n\n\tThe three-part docuseries that premiered this week chronicles how Rasmussen discovered Johnson’s deceptions and finally left him, only to be harassed by her ex after their divorce. After years of alleged  suicide threats and stalking — including break-ins and GPS tracking — Rasmussen secured a protective order against Johnson. The series also traces how Rasmussen and Klingerman, who were enemies for years, eventually connected to discuss the warning signs they missed about their mutual ex- husband. Rasmussen discovered that Klingerman also secured protective orders against Johnson, who led police on a high-speed chase with their daughter in the car and somehow got away\n\n\n\tIn 2020, Rasmussen and Klingerman launched the podcast “Ex-Wives Undercover” to warn others about Johnson. The podcast led to more victims coming forward, and new details and stories emerging about Johnson’s sordid past. Three years into the podcast, in 2023, Johnson was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for assault and attempted kidnapping with intent to sexually assault . He also admitted to 10 counts of attempted first-degree theft in a separate fraud case.\n\t\n\n\tVariety spoke to Rasmussen and Klingerman about why they wanted to make the docuseries and how they feel about their ex-husband being released from prison. \n\t\n\t\tBrandon is eligible for parole in May 2027. Was there any hesitation about turning your podcast into a docuseries that will reach a global audience and, I’m assuming, infuriate him?\t\n\n\tKlingerman: Yes. We thought long and hard about it because you’re right: This story is reaching an even broader audience now, but we needed to get the word out, so it was worth any consequences we could face. At this point it’s like let’s keep moving forward. Let’s expose who Brandon is because Brandon represents so many other Brandons out there. It’s worth the risk of backlash to reach a larger audience and let other people know who might be going through this that they are not alone.\n\t\n\t\tIn addition to both of you, several other women who Brandon allegedly abused are featured in the docuseries, including Rachel, the woman who is responsible for his arrest. Were you the reason why these women decided to participate in the series?\t\n\n\tRasmussen: We, of course, put them in contact (with producers), but it had to be their personal decision to participate. One of the women, one of his first girlfriends, was very scared (to be part of the series). She’s still scared of Brandon. She actually reached out to us after the podcast came out on TikTok, and she was very reluctant because she was so scared. But after speaking (to production) she felt comfortable and just felt that this is a really important thing to share.\n\t\n\t\tAre you afraid that Brandon will be released in 2027?\t\n\n\tKlingerman: Absolutely. We have heard rumblings that he has plans. He is thinking about what his next steps will be, already from jail. It’s not surprising he believes his own lies. He doesn’t believe what he did was wrong. In my opinion he believes that his ex-wives drove him crazy. He will make an excuse to not take any accountability for what he has done. So, yes. It is very scary to think about him getting out.\n\t\n\t\tAre you hopeful that this docuseries might help to prolong his sentence?\t\n\n\tKlingerman: I don’t think that that is a possibility legally, but I know that in the past, when I’ve seen other docuseries do something similar – it lights a fire under the judicial system’s butt a bit. The only thing I can hope for is that (law enforcement) will take any other criminal activity he might have (in the future) much more seriously. Other than that, all we can do is take it day by day. We just need to stay in the moment. Keep fighting and just be very present and very aware when he’s out.\n\t\n\n\tRasmussen: We have really fulfilled our purpose. We wanted to get out there to don’t date Brandon. So, even if he gets out, changes his name, whatever, his face is out there. So any woman who is ever going to get involved (with him) in the future, she hopefully will get led back to the docuseries or the podcast, and get that knowledge that we didn’t have collectively. Knowledge is power.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrincipal photography has begun on director Elize Finnerty’s horror feature “White Sands” in the Hamptons.\n\n\tThe film, which is shooting in Amagansett, N.Y., stars Rebecca Knox (“Orange Is the New Black”), Kaley Ronayne (“The Resident,” “The Right Stuff”), Marta Pozzan (“Fior,” “di Latte,” “Jacob the Baker”), Jessica Sula (“Split,” “Skins”), Roby Attal (“Dexter: Original Sin, Hell Fest”), Tyler Alvarez (“American Vandal,” “Never Have I Ever”), David H. Holmes (“High Fidelity,” “The Penguin”) and Jean Louisa Kelly (“Top Gun: Maverick,” “Uncle Buck”).\n\t\n\n\tThe official summary of the movie reads, “’White Sands’ follows Cora (Knox), an aspiring food blogger who joins her boyfriend Josh (Holmes) for a beachside birthday weekend hosted by influencer Alex (Ronayne) at her family’s boutique seaside motel.\n\n\n\t“When Josh is called away, Cora stays behind, growing dangerously obsessed with Alex and her exclusive circle — a glamorous but fractured group that includes Ella (Pozzan), Carlos (Alvarez), Robbie (Attal), and Lily (Sula). As the weekend unfolds, a sinister force tied to the motel’s occult history begins to surface, and Cora’s fixation takes a terrifying turn.”\n\n\tFinnerty directs from a script by Michael Harker and Knox. The film is produced by Ian Adelson and RJ Brown of Floor 1 Productions, alongside Lucy Loewenberg, Michael Harker and Knox.\n\n\tFinnerty made her feature debut with 2022’s “The Ones You Didn’t Burn,” which she wrote, directed and starred in and premiered at London’s FrightFest.

    "body": "\n\tFive filmmakers experimented with AI tooks to take part in a series of short films commissioned by Adobe to show off the capabilities of its Firefly AI platform.\n\n\tThe shorts screened on Oct. 28 at the three-day Adobe Max user convention held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. \n\n\tThe tools enabled by Firefly helped streamline productions that would have otherwise taken months down to weeks or days. But other aspects of the creative process were no different than any film project. It all starts with a strong script, although the mind-blowing material that can be crafted from a range of AI models (even non-Adobe services) can certainly influence the storytelling, the filmmakers said during a panel conversation that followed the screening of six shorts commissioned by Adobe.\n\t\n\n\tThe session, titled “Showtime! Generative A.I. Shorts Screening & Filmmaker Discussion,” moderated by Variety‘s Cynthia Littleton in partnership with Adobe.\n\n\tThe creatives present on stage were Grail director Ryan Patterson, Native Foreign chief creative officer Nik Kleverov, Promise Studios co-founder and chief creative officer Dave Clark, Promise Studios director and head of genre MetaPuppet and A.I. filmmaker and comedian King Willonius. Respectively, their films were titled “Dreamer,” “Beta Earth,” “My Friend Zeph,” “Kyra” and “Into the BBL Drizzyverse.” Each was commissioned by Adobe to showcase Adobe Firefly‘s latest A.I. capabilities.\n\n\tIn sum, the filmmakers agreed that they had fun using the tools on a tight deadline to produce 2-5 minute stories and that there is great potential for innovation in content creation with AI. But the human touch of steering the vision and maintaining quality control is paramount for the quality of the final product. \n\t\n\n\tAll of the filmmakers expressed positive experiences working with Firefly to bring their visions to life. “We used Adobe Firefly for the imagery,” said Clark, “We were taking AI generated imagery and compositing that with live action on a blue screen and it just really allowed us to iterate. Shoutout to Firefly Boards because if you’re going to use visual effects and compositing, you really have to map out and plan out your shots and make sure they’re in sequential order or else the whole show could fall apart.”\n\n\tMany of the creatives shared Clark’s enthusiasm for the Firefly Boards feature, where images can be uploaded, edited, or generated with AI to help create shots and storyboards. “The boards that we use made it very enjoyable to work with my editor,” reflected Willonius, “I like creative challenges, so anytime I do a project, I want to try to push myself. I felt, this whole experience, I did that and we were able to make something super dope.”\n\n\tThe core value of Boards is its variety, as it provides filmmakers an extensive pallet of tools to pick from and play with. “A lot of people ask what is the best tool for AI filmmaking,” said Patterson, “What’s great about Firefly Boards is having options. There’s no answer to that question because every tool has its superpower.”\n\n\tKleverov credited Firefly, but was quick to also applaud writer Ryan Walls, a “Modern Family” alum who came up with the story that they were able to generate using the tools. “It wouldn’t have been possible to do for a small studio like ours before AI and before using Firefly,” he admitted, “Brand storytelling is great and I love my brand partnerships, but I want to tell more original stories.”\n\n\tThe panel concurred with Kleverov’s persistent appreciation for his story’s human origins, but also his acknowledgment that AI made bringing that story to life achievable. Many talked about the tools as means for greater efficiency and collaboration, but they also stressed the beauty of discovery. “Even after you storyboard, it can sometimes generate something that you can’t unsee and it can take you in a completely different direction,” said MetaPuppet, “And I think you have to be open to shifting. Storyboards can change, and that happens on every short film that I make with AI.”\n\t\n\n\tThe process has led to a fusion between pre-production, production and post-production, what MetaPuppet calls “one big loop. Right at the beginning of the project, you’re already in post, and then towards the end of the project, you’re back in pre.” While this may disrupt conventional workflows, it also allows for a more equitable participation in the different phases of a project.\n\n\tFinally, panelists concluded by talking about the importance of guardrails that protect creators and their intellectual property. Kleverov used Native Foreign’s AI short film “Critters” as an example, which is now being adapted into a feature. He said, “We were keeping track of the human authorship that went into it at every stage, the hundreds of decisions that were made, and that is what helped us actually get copyright on that AI native IP”\n\n\tClark concurred, “When you’re starting to think about distributing your films and creating IP, or if you’re partnering with studios and you’re partnering on IP, all that stuff needs to be heavily guarded. It’s very important to do that.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tThis week, Dropout gave fans what they asked for: a chance to pay more for the comedy streaming service.\n\n\tBack in April, Dropout CEO Sam Reich anno",
    "body": "\n\tThis week, Dropout gave fans what they asked for: a chance to pay more for the comedy streaming service.\n\n\tBack in April, Dropout CEO Sam Reich announced that the streaming service born out of CollegeHumor would increase its price by $1 — going from a $5.99-per-month to $6.99-per-month offering. While the majority of streaming service price increases go over poorly with customers, this one had a surprising effect. There were many, many Dropout fans offering to pay the platform even more money for no additional return, just because they want to see Dropout continue to thrive.\n\t\n\n\tLast week, Reich and co. said, “your wish is our command,” with announcement of a higher-priced “Superfan” tier on Dropout. It costs $129.99 annually (reduced to $97.49 for your first year) compared to the $69.99 annual price of a Dropout subscription.\n\n\n\tWhile Reich tells Variety the internal plan at Dropout is to try not to raise the base price of the streaming service by more than $1 each year, the extra funds that could come from these self-proclaimed superfans who seemingly just want to give Dropout more of their money will help fuel continued growth at no additional cost to the average Dropout customer. And that growth is still small, but mighty.\n\n\tTo date, Dropout says it boasts more than one million subscribers. From 2024 to 2025, subscribers rose by 31%. And the most recent season of “Game Changer” saw Dropout’s most-watched episode ever with the Season 7 premiere, “One Year Later,” reaching one million views over its first two weeks of release in April.\n\n\tCurrently, Dropout has a staff of approximately 40 employees and counting compared to the more than 100 staffers that worked at CollegeHumor before it was shuttered (and then quickly revived by CollegeHumor survivor Reich.) \n\t\n\n\tHere, Reich speaks with Variety (with a “super gravely” voice because he had been “shooting ‘Game Changer’ for six out of the last eight days”) about the launch of the “Superfan” tier and the future of Dropout.\n\t\n\t\tWhen did you start talking about the idea of a “Superfan” tier? How did it relate to the price increase you announced for the main Dropout subscription in April?\t\n\n\tConversations about this began eight or nine months before that original price change [announcement] video, because that drum beat of fans saying, “We’d like to pay you more money,” was something that we wanted to start paying attention to. \n\n\tAs I’m running a business, I’m not in that rapid growth mindset all the time. But over time, you do have to pay people more every year. I suppose you don’t have to. I think if you’re a good business, you do. I think people expect to be treated a little better over time. And we are getting more ambitious with what Dropout content is. Both the shows themselves are becoming more ambitious and we’re wanting to venture into more ambitious types of programming. So at the same time as we’ve almost deliberately hamstrung the cost of subscription. Now, the conversation we’re having internally is, let’s really try not to raise it by more than a buck a year, if we can. \n\n\tWe are sort of an odd duck in the sense that we are one part subscription platform, like Netflix — if I’m flattering us, but maybe we’re more like Shudder or Crunchyroll; a niche subscription. And on the other hand, we’re also kind of Patreon, because we’re a group of personalities that people love. And this idea of a higher-tier subscription was something that we were eager to try, if we could, but it wasn’t clear that Vimeo, who’s our tech partner, could support it. So we started talking to Vimeo, we started building out the feature, we started imagining what the “Superfan” experience would be like, and then we released the price hike video. And that was overwhelmingly the response we got to it. And then the fire really kicked in. So we had something in development, and then we’re like, now we really need to see this thing through.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you decide what the “Superfan” tier subscribers will receive vs. the regular tier of Dropout customers?\t\n\n\tThere’s a bit of a sliding scale. On one side of that scale would be stuff like exclusive video content; that would arguably be the biggest lure of all. The other side would be absolutely nothing. We’ve probably landed like two-thirds of the way toward nothing. \n\t\n\n\tWhat people are getting is exclusive merch, merch related discounts. They are getting early access to live-show ticket sales, and they’re getting access to this behind-the-scenes experience, which we’ve undersold a little bit, but is actually pretty cool and interesting. And we have new editorial support that’s full time at the company to help us fulfill upon that. And we’re excited about what that can become.\n\n\tWhat’s tricky about this kind of thing is it is most important for us to communicate to fans that they don’t need to do this. In fact, even if they consider themselves “superfans,” they don’t need to do it. They’re not going to miss out on video content. And video content in the sense of, the core promise we’ve made to Dropout fans, which is, you pay X number of dollars and you get back our video content in return, we are still fulfilling on that promise. So no video FOMO. But at the same time, we don’t want the experience to be devoid of value and merely a flex for those with disposable income. It can be that, too (laughs). But we want to give them something that in return for their hard-earned dollars. And so we’ve settled upon this for the time being. \n\n\tAnd, have we gotten the mix exactly right? I imagine we’ll experiment a little bit more and find exactly what the right mix of value is in order to attract people to this tier without feeling like we’re alienating the core subscribers. But I think it was the right way to launch.\n\t\n\t\tIn the “Superfan” announcement video, you hinted that this additional revenue stream will in part go towards Dropout’s plans to expand into scripted and animated content. Where are you on those kinds of projects right now?\t\n\n\tThings are in the works, things are in the works. I would say, regardless of the format, regardless of if you call it scripted or animation, or what you call it, we are just getting a little bit more ambitious with our new programming in general. And that also applies to the quote, unquote unscripted category. \n\n\tCan you really call “Game Changer” and “Dimension 20” unscripted shows? They’re sort of semi-scripted shows. I think the thing that we do best, arguably, as Dropout is we sort of format break. We do things that are really non-traditional. So I’m not sure that there’s a world where we even do scripted or animation, and they’re fully that. But the the ambition of Dropout shows is increasing as we have a little bit more budget to flex. It allows us to do some things that we think are even more novel, and that’s really exciting. Forever and ever, our budgets essentially stipulated that we batch shoot unscripted in a studio space, and now we can start coloring outside the lines a little bit. The “Fool’s Gold” episode of “Game Changer” was almost an example of this. It just means that we can do more outside the studio.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou announced both the “Superfan” tier and, earlier this year, the general price increase yourself via social media, rather than through a press release or telling media outlets in advance. How did you make that choice and how are you balancing Dropout’s direct communication with fans vs. press as the company grows?\t\n\n\tThe direct line to fans is important, and it’s partially to do with being creatures of the internet and respecting that we’re creatures of the internet. We have a pulpit from which to broadcast from, but genuinely, genuinely, press is now increasingly important, too. Press is important first and foremost, as it relates to legitimacy, but then legitimacy sort of connects to this idea of scale. When we ask ourselves, what is the ceiling for Dropout and who are Dropout’s customers? I’m convinced that the audience for comedy is massive, even in just the United States alone, and that our cap as a company is greater than 5x away or 10x away. I think we could grow to 5 million subscribers or 10 million subscribers. But those are people who, right now, do not see us as very legitimate, who don’t see the offering as legitimate. So how do you convince those people to subscribe? And I think press is a big part of how.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRafael Cobos, whose “The Left-Handed Son” won Canneseries short form top prize in 2022, has just world premiered “Golpes,” his feature film debut which looks likely to consecrate him as one of Spain’s major new directorial voices. \n\n\tBest-known as the co-scribe of Alberto Rodríguez – co-penning 2014 Goya best picture winner “Marshland” and 2017’s “The Plague,” Movistar Plus’ first big series, both set in or near Cobos’ native Seville – Cobos returns to the city again in “Golpes.” It stars three-time Goya winner Luis Tosar (“Mondays in the Sun,” “Take My Eyes” and “Cell 211”), and produced by Borja Pena and Emma Lustres at Vaca Films (“Cell 211, “Gangs of Galicia”) with France’s Playtime, part of the Vuelta Group, which also handles worldwide sales.\n\t\n\n\t“Golpes” is set in the summer of 1982, as Spain gallops, it seems, to a modern, democratic future, seven years after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.\n\n\n\tMigueli leaves jail to get together his old crew for a series of bold heists. Closing in on him is his own brother, who’s become a cop, throwing in his lot with the winners of Spain’s Civil War.\n\n\tWritten by Cobos and Fernando Navarro (“Saturn Return,” “Veronica”), “Golpes” builds on a notable, home-grown Spanish sub-genre, the so-called “quinqui” cinema – think Carlos Saura’s 1981 Berlin Golden Bear winner “Deprisa, Deprisa” or Eloy de la Iglesia’s 1980 “Navajeros” – which featured marginalized working class criminals, heists, police brutality, racy diction, heroin abuse and vague sense of desire for freedom and visceral contempt for authority and middle-class convention.\n\t\n\n\tMusic plays a prominent role in “Deprisa, Deprisa,” such as in gutsy flamenco pop anthem “Me Quedo Contigo.”  “Golpes,” in this and other directions, however, goes its own way. It “gives everything ‘qujnqui’ a heart and dignity,” wrote Luis Martínez at Spanish newspaper El Mundo this week.  \n\n\tWhen the four young delinquent friends in “Desprisa, Deprisa” visit Madrid’s Cerro de los Ángeles monument, they haven’t got a clue how the Spanish Civil War bullet holes got there. \n\n\tMigueli, (Jesús Carroza, “7 Virgins,” “Offworld”) in contrast, walks out of prison with unfinished business buried deep in the past, “Golpes’” synopsis notes. He commits the robberies not for riches or revenge but to reclaim the land where his father, a Republican outlaw after the Civil War, lies in an unmarked grave, soon to be erased by developers. The film’s beating heart is how Sabino reacts to that prompted by his rencounter with Migueli, with a new girlfriend, the only family he’s got. \n\n\tVariety talked to Cobos just after the world premiere of “Golpes” at Valladolid. \n\n\tMigueli and his gang share with the the heroes of “quinqui” cinema a visceral hate for Spain’s establishment. Migueli stands apart, however, by his memory of the past.\n\n\tI completely agree. Though we could say that enough time has passed for us to be able to say that these “quinquis,” young rebels which went against the system, could respond to an evident political reason which had its origins in the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\t“Golpes” gives a sense of a Spain on the cusp of modernity, with part of the country, however, being left behind. This is captured in an early scene when Miguelí walks to his pension and you cut to contemporary archive footage…\n\n\tYes. Migueli returns to a humble poor part of Seville, which you can see in the dirt on the walls.  The archive footage captures ragged children who look like orphans, street kids. We were in the summer of 1982, on the cusp of Spain’s having its first left wing government in many decades, and yet here there’s a sense of a near post-War very marginal Seville.\n\n\tYou’ve talked about “Golpes“ as a “subtle fable that attempts to depict a country in the midst of transition – a contradictory, disorientated country unable to settle the score with its past.” That can be seen in your direction which very often mixes old and new, such as the pension, with modern drawers but an old gas-burner….\n\t\n\n\tThe pension, Antúnez’s home, is like a kind of casa de vecino, a traditional Sevillian community dwelling which is now disappearing. When we were shooting interiors, there was sounds of construction coming from outside. Her house has the latest records from the ‘70s, early ‘80s, and more folkloric, traditionalist facets…. \n\n\tThe film is also highly emotional, lyrical….\n\n\tYes, that was my intention. I wanted a highly emotional, moving film which was also very lyrical, with an important poetic edge. And I think it’s there.\n\n\tOne way to create emotion is music, such as in the soundtrack playing when Miguelí returns home….\n\n\tThe hero’s return, right? The music is crucial. As you’ve said, the film is a reply, or reimagining of Spain’s “cinema quinqui.”\n\n\tBut I wanted to go against everything. The quinqui cinema we remember was much rawer, rougher, immediate and direct. Its music was flamenco, mixed with other genres, the Los Chunguitos, Los Chichos, the Catalan rumba, I wanted something that was more sophisticated. At the beginning of the film one of the songs has a strictly flamenco seguidilla base, used in many songs but I wanted to take it to a much more poetic, disruptive level.\n\n\tAnother route to emotion are the film’s actors, here Jesús Carroza y Luis Tosar….    \n\n\tYes, they’re both spectacular. Jesús, from a sense of honesty, truth, authenticity and Luis has that and incredible actor’s technique. \n\n\tAnd aid what I think is your goal – a cross between socio-political issues and entertainment. \n\n\t“Golpes” has a vocation of entertainment and to move audiences, but at the same time that’s a pretext for buried socio-political questions, so that  at the end, having experienced the story’s journey in the film, there’s a critique, or at least an intention to raise questions. Cinema’s vocation it to be seen, move and if possible raise questions, a lot of them.\n\n\tYou say that at a time that even in 2025 Spain, the issue of Spain’s historical memory has not been totally resolved.\n\n\tExactly, not as an issue nor, I’d say, as an almost problem. Time passes and we don’t get to any kind of consensus, and it’s still bones buried under dark earth in God-forsaken ditches. That’s terrible.\n\t\n\n\tAnd how do you want to move forward? \n\n\tI’d love to go on writing with Alberto. Writing is my drive. But I want to go on directing, if I can as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGolpes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Julio Vergne\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrandi Carlile‘s “Returning to Myself” album, her first solo release in four years, is likely to debut in the top 10 when album chart results come in this weekend. Her appearance on “Saturday Night Live” will likely draw even more listeners to the well-reviewed album. As her fans already know, the material runs a little deeper than some of the pop company it’s keeping, and there are fascinating insights to be gleaned from or about every song on the project, which is why (as a bonus to our already-published interview with Carlile) we’re offering this track-by-track guide that has the singer-songwriter talking about each of its 10 tunes.\n\t\n\n\tIn this detailed commentary, Carlile talks about working with fellow writer-producers Andrew Watt, Aaron Dessner, Justin Vernon and the Hanseroth twins, with detours to explore pertinent interactions with Joni Mitchell (subject of the song “Joni”) and Elton John (who released a separate duo project with Carlile earlier this year). She goes further into the album’s themes of how we keep sight of love, mortality and the bigger picture amid the temptation to just doomscroll through troubled times. She zeroes in on, among other songs, the explosive rocker “Church & State,” which is sure to be an “SNL” highlight this weekend. (The following commentary was collated from Variety‘s interviews with Carlile about the project as well as song introductions she gave during an album listening event in Nashville.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\t1. “Returning to Myself”\n\n\tThe title song, though not the first complete number written for the album, has the first lyric Carlile wrote for it. The day after doing the second of two shows with Joni Mitchell at the Hollywood Bowl in October 2024, she flew to Aaron Dessner’s home back east for a co-writing session that had been suggested by Jody Gerson. After she arrived that night and found herself alone in a bedroom in his barn, she wrote these lyrics as a poem, reflecting on her intention to separate herself from Mitchell professionally for a while and spend time on her own.\n\t\n\n\tCarlile: “This was my North Star for what became this album in a really transitional period in a 40-something-year-old woman’s life… I got to Aaron’s place and he was there with this amazing girl, Bella, an engineer that he works with, and I sat down on the couch and told ’em what I had done the day before. I started to feel really emotional about it. Then he was like, ‘Well, it’s getting late. I’m gonna head off to bed. There’s a blueberry muffin in the kitchen.’ Then he left, and I was just alone in this barn. I went upstairs and I picked a bedroom in the loft to sleep in, and I sat down on the bed. I still had a literal hangover, and was having an existential crisis when I wrote the lyrics to ‘Returning to Myself’ as a poem.\n\n\t“It’s like [in the opening lines], first of all, who is God? Is God this reckless, leather-jacket-wearing, menacing, James Dean-looking guy just sitting there holding your life between their fingers on fire, and watching it burn down like a matchstick, watching you squirm? Or, are we universally and unconditionally loved? And then, what are we here to learn? Are we really here with all these other people to learn how to exist in solitude and be alone? Is that what it means to be evolved? Is that the point?\n\n\t“I’m in a generation that is fixated on self — self-preservation, self-care, self-exploration. And I’m antithetical to that, I think to a fault, a bit. That’s not to say that I’m not selfish in my own ways, or at least misguidedly self-important at times. But I don’t know if the journey inward is really the point. I don’t know if that’s really the way to self-discovery. I think who you are in the context of who you love is probably the journey. And that’s kind of what I’m asking myself — because I don’t want to have a made-up mind. I don’t want to be atrophied in my thinking at 45; I want to still be growing and evolving. So, is it necessary for me to take the journey inward? And I think that’s what I did when I made this album. I got it out of my system… I did it, and yeah, and I think I still stand by a preference for connection.”\n\n\n\n\n\t2. “Human”\n\n\tThe second song on the album was written the night before the 2024 election, focusing on the values that are most important to keep in mind in troubled times, in a short lifetime on earth — versus doomscrolling. Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon is among the contributors.\n\t\n\n\tCarlile: “I had this Emmylou Harris ‘Wrecking Ball’ thing in my mind the whole time I’m making the album — not to be derivative of it, just to keep it as a spiritual North Star in my soul. Justin Vernon gets invited by Aaron to the studio. I absolutely idolize Justin Vernon. He doesn’t know anything about this, because a lot of this I’ve kept to myself and/or the twins now. And Justin turns up with a six-pack of beer wearing an Emmylou Harris ‘Wrecking Ball’ T-shirt. And we made this song, co-produced by Justin Vernonwith a lot of musical touches from him too.\n\n\t“Phil came up with the melody to the chorus of ‘Human.’ Phil wrote ‘The Story.’ We call him ‘Bitch Lips’ because he’s got beautiful lips and he’s always carrying around a stick of Chapstick. But also, he writes girl melodies. Sometimes he doesn’t even do lyrics. He just sends me a little demo and that’s how he presents melody to me. They don’t always settle in right away, but eventually when I figure out what it is that I want to say, I find that girl melody that Phil sent me and it becomes a power ballad, and that’s what ‘Human’ was.\n\n\t“’Human’ is about striking a really difficult balance, first recognizing that we’re here for a very short period of time, like the blink of an eye, and that we have got to find a way to be happy in the chaos. We have to find a way for all to be well with our soul while we’re here in this split second. And then we also have to find a way to not be apathetic, inactive, passive and neoliberal about the things that are happening in our world. That is a really difficult balance to strike because one could accidentally block out the things that need work and the things that need activism in order to make themselves happy. Or one could accidentally block out the need to be human, while they are virtue-signaling and running as fast as they can on a treadmill that’s outpacing them. And that balance is the challenge that I’m putting forward with this.”\n\n\n\n\n\t3. “A Woman Oversees”\n\n\tOne of the most personal and unresolved songs on the album, about a relationship that, in the moment at least, has Carlile oversharing and the other person undersharing. It’s also one of the most Joni-esque songs on the album.\n\t\n\n\tCarlile: “It is a freak moment that I don’t think ever would’ve made it on any of our other albums because somebody happened to hit record while I was writing something along the road. I sat down and I wrote this song stream-of-consciousness, didn’t even know if it would rhyme, and it’s one of my favorite songs on the record. … I think it’s crazy to put it up in the front five songs. But I can’t wait to do it live with SistaStrings.\n\n\t“Communication could accidentally be a one-way thing, because interested is interesting, and people love being asked about themselves. I read recently that a human being’s favorite sound is the sound of their name. And we can’t even help that. That’s just the case, which means that we love to be asked about ourselves, and if we’re not careful, we may be looking back on two hours and realizing that we didn’t ask any questions back. That could either be because we’re being a narcissist in that moment, or it could be because we’re being sort of mined, or being asked to carry the interaction because there’s something about the other person in the actual interaction where they won’t show up and reveal themselves.\n\n\t“There’s a nobility in (asking prying questions), because it’s a beautiful thing to ask people questions and be interested in who they are and what they think, but then you have to give something of yourself so that that person doesn’t leave that interaction and spiral, you know? That’s what happens when you’ve been asked questions all night and you’ve gone there and you’re talking about your divorce and you’re having to cry, and then you’re in the the cab on the way home and you’re like, ‘I just cried for two hours, and did I say too much? Did I overshare?’ That other person owes it to you to show up in the conversation with themselves a little bit too. That’s why it’s spelled ‘overSEES,’ because it is pretty dominant, to not be vulnerable when you’re asking someone else to.”\n\n\n\n\n\t4. “A War With Time”\n\n\tThis is the collaboration with Aaron Dessner on the album that comes closest to echoing the kinds of collabs he has had with artists like Taylor Swift, where virtually everything about the music bed is his, even if nothing above it is.\n\t\n\n\tCarlile: “After I located the blueberry muffin (the first night at his compound) and I went to bed and wrote the poem ‘Returning to Myself,’ I woke up the next morning and came downstairs and learned what it is to write with Aaron Dessner… Aaron’s a man of few words, and he doesn’t take up any emotional space (in the song), which means that uncomfortably, the artist has a lot of room to have a lot of big feelings because his aren’t really there in a intentional way.\n\n\t“I didn’t know what Long Pond was, either. I thought Long Pond was the name of the town. Everybody kept asking me where I was, and I was like, ‘I was upstate in New York in a town called Long Pond.” I didn’t know! And so when I got up there, he was like, ‘Well, the way I do it is, I’ve got these pieces, and it’s not to say they’re finished — like, you could add to ’em if you want, or take away from ’em — but really they’re kind of a piece. And then if you can and it inspires you, you’ll sing over it.’\n\n\t“It’s a cool way to co-write, and I’d never heard of it before because I haven’t done any co-writes in my life. It’s just kind of been me and the twins, and a couple of random things here and there for a project, but for the most part, no. ,,, And I’m a producer and I’m a very controlling person; ask my wife — a self-controlling person. At first, I was taken aback about not being able to change anything in the song — you know, chord structures or textures I may not like, or a guitar tone that I think should be different. But he’s kind of unapologetic about the fact that it’s just done. It inspires you and you’ll write to it or you won’t. So if you do, you’re not just writing, but you’re committing to Aaron Dessner as a producer, which is pretty fucking cool and confident. And it freed me up. It just blew my chest open because I was like: I don’t have to think about this. I’m either gonna be inspired by this piece of music or I’m not.\n\n\t“And this piece that he played me was incredibly inspiring. When I heard it. I heard Bruce Hornsby, ‘That’s Just the Way It Is.’ I heard Mike and the Mechanics, ‘The Living Years.’ I heard Marc Cohn’s ‘Walking in Memphis.’ I heard my younger years, the years where I wasn’t thinking about verse/chorus structure, where I wasn’t thinking about what was cool. I was just thinking about what made me cry.\n\t\n\n\t“It was so strange to not worry about production and to not worry about creation — that it was either gonna come or it wasn’t. And then when it’s done, it’s kind of done. And ‘A War With Time’ and ‘No One Knows Us’ were both really like that.”\n\n\n\n\n\t5. “Anniversary”\n\n\tOne of the album’s more enigmatic songs explores the idea of some sort of anniversary date looming as important every year — for better or, seemingly, for worse — and then moving past the commemoration of that date carrying any undue weight.\n\n\t“I was alone up there (at Dessner’s Long Pond complex). This was a strange idea that came to me in the middle of the night… When I played the idea for this for Aaron, he declined to help me with it. He just said, ‘How about I just play guitar and let’s just see how you feel when you sing it.’ And I haven’t really experienced that before. And I wound up feeling really subconscious singing a song in front of a guy I didn’t really know. But I thought of my love of Elliott Smith, and I thought, ‘Well, I’m embarrassed, so I’m gonna double my vocal.’ Well, it turns out you can’t hide even then.”\n\n\n\n\n\t6. “Church & State”\n\n\tBy far the most out-and-out rocker on the album, with a decided U2 influence. It’s also easily the most topical song, as the title would indicate — a statement of anger amid a record that otherwise tends toward making peace, with oneself if not the world.\n\n\t“I’m glad that song’s on there. We had a playback recently, and right before that song — I don’t know how to feel about this — I heard a lady lean over and say to her neighbor, ‘She’s not wailing.’ I don’t know if she was complaining or if it was a compliment, but I was like, wait till we get to ‘Church & State.’\n\n\t“One of my top five favorite albums of all time growing up was ‘The Joshua Tree.’ … I even entered a contest one time as Bono when I was 15 to win a singing competition, singing ‘Running to Stand Still.’ I wore sunglasses and shit and I fell on my knees at the end of it. I already had the lesbian haircut that he has, so it wasn’t much of a stretch. … So Daniel Lanois [who co-produced ‘Joshua Tree’ as well as ‘Wrecking Ball’] was on my mind a lot.\n\t\n\n\t“I got a song from Tim a couple of years ago, this beautiful concept and riff and this drop-D and all of this cognitive dissonance in the song, and I sunk my teeth into it then. And I said, whatever that is, that’s a direction for where I feel like we could go musically. And then I tucked it away in the back of my mind and forgot about it until Nov. 5 [the night of the 2024 presidential election]. We were in the studio as a band, and it wasn’t an introspective night. It was a night where I couldn’t stay off my phone because I was watching myself wake up to a realization about the country that I lived in. And I was listening to ‘Bullet the Blue Sky,’ and I was leaning into my early years and just kind of collecting rage. And we made a burning, searing song that night.\n\n\t“I was reading a conversation on the First Amendment instead of a guitar solo. I love Andrew Watt so much. Every time we talk on the phone, he’s like, ‘I fucking love “Church & State,” because I love when you read the Declaration of Independence.’… I love Andrew Watt, man. It doesn’t matter where he thought it came from. He agreed with it, he believed in it and it really excited him. He loved that part of the song and he was so encouraging, and he was in the exact same place that we were. He’s a special spirit and he just kind of like morphed into our band in a way that changed everything.\n\n\t“When the lyrics were coming together for that song, I just couldn’t stop thinking of the wisdom of Thomas Jefferson’s address to the Danbury Baptists. There’s so much wisdom in the Constitution, and even the notations on the Constitution are full of wisdom — the footnotes, if you will. What he said to the Baptist was intended to reassure them that they would be allowed to practice their faith, spirituality, religion, however you wanna refer to it, freely under the Constitution. But he also makes a really important distinction that we aren’t an autocracy. We’re not a theocracy. We can’t rule over people with our interpretation of an extremely opaque scripture and religion as it pertains particularly to the Christian religion. Bow that we’ve seen over time, um, the integration of so many beautiful cultures and faiths in the United States, it’s, it’s a connotation that’s safekeeping for all people, because it allows for law to be secular as it should be. So I find that to be essential and a life-giving part of that text.\n\t\n\n\t“And in my faith, even Jesus was clear about not ruling a people based on an interpretation of religion. Even Jesus said, ‘Give unto Caesar what’s Caesar’s.’ So I can’t get behind rules and laws that I know are secretly based on an interpretation of a religion that I can’t get behind. Even if I agree with the religion.\n\n\t“When we made that song, all of us together, that bass line, that guitar riff, so many parts of that song as they came together as these individual little parts… We don’t do that on our own. We just see each other. We just play together. There’s no such thing as Phil going, ‘Here’s my part,’ and Tim going, ‘Here’s my part.’ … It kind of sometimes winds up being a little bit of a sonic tornado, but Andrew had this idea for this separate guitar line, this separate bass line, and I think that’s where it kind of hit the U2 button for me. And Matt Chamberlain just endured with that crazy drum riff. That was an aerobic workout.”\n\n\n\n\n\t7. “Joni”\n\n\tA tribute to Joni Mitchell, in both lyrics and in the distinctly nontraditional but familiar-seeming music approach. It presents Mitchell not as someone who has been a shoulder for Carlile to cry on, necessarily, but a healing force with her steady companionship, nonetheless.\n\n\tCarlile: “Oh my God. If I turned up there crying, she would look at me like I had two heads. There’s no world where I’m gonna go cry on Joni’s shoulder. But I have gone out there very, very stressed and sat across from her while she plays solitaire, and just listened to the stories. Because she tells stories, and the stories have decompressed my mind in times that have been really stressful and upsetting times for me, whether I was sharing that or not. And I imagine that that’s what people have been doing in their bedrooms with Joni’s stories since the early ‘70s, and before. I just got to be a little closer up. But, you know, there’s healing there and there’s soothing there. It’s just not in traditional sense that one would expect from a woman.\n\n\t“This song is so sacred because my good five or six years with Joni are just so formative to who I’ve become. I just will never be the same person or songwriter because of my time with her. And I won’t even write a song anymore if I can’t drive up to that gate and walk in that kitchen and play it for Joni — I won’t do it. Which means I write very few songs. But she’s just such a singular and powerful woman, and she’s been such a force in my life without imposing anything on me or asking for anything.\n\t\n\n\t“I wrote this song from such a pure place. I played her ‘Returning to Myself’ and played her ‘A Woman Oversees,’ which she loved. And then I played her ‘Joni,’ and I worked up to it because I was so nervous about it. … There’s a couple little references that I thought she’d like, but I didn’t know. Nobody knows with Joni. So I played this song and she was just listening to it with like a furrowed brow, and she was putting clips in her hair and just sort of like staring ahead and listening. And she wasn’t smiling for quite a long time. There’s that whole first verse about ‘laughing at the pop stars,’ and she doesn’t even crack a smile or make eye contact or say anything. Then it gets to that chorus where it says: ‘When I tell you “I love you,” and you tell me, “Okay.”’ And she just started to laugh — like, just straight out of nowhere, she full-on laughed — and then she goes, ‘You asshole!’ And I loved it, because I knew that she got all of those references, and it was just a really, really great moment. Then she asked at the end of the song, ‘Why do you think I’m a wild woman?’ And I got to explain it to her. It’s not very often that she’ll sit there and let you really give her a compliment, but she asked, so I got to tell her why I think she’s so wild.\n\n\t“The first line of the song says, ‘I knew a wild woman who threw a party on her grave. She went there tapping her cane and sipping champagne’ — that’s some literal shit… She has a grave in Hollywood at that famous cemetery, and her grave is just sitting there with a blank headstone, and she goes there frequently with champagne and she has these little parties, just her and a couple of friends, eating sandwiches and just chilling out on her grave and making jokes… One day they just sent me a picture and I just thought, ‘What a cool fucking woman. She just laughs at mortality in every way.’\n\n\t“Actually watching everybody try to play to that guitar part was just hilarious, especially Chad Smith — I mean, it’s nowhere near strapped to time. It’s in total outer space because I sang it and played at the same time, and they couldn’t be separated. I was hanging on for dear life because I knew I couldn’t make a song called ‘Joni’ that had typical chord progressions in it. So I had to take my time, and at times I rushed, out of the anxiousness of getting to the next chord. and so you just wind up with this song that’s in total free time. That was based on my ability, not based on any musical decision. And then everybody else having to feel that free time and figure out where I was gonna land was just kind of one of those beautiful things that can happen only in a studio.\n\t\n\n\t“That’s Blake Mills playing fretless guitar and Mark Isham playing the tenor sax, which was part of the core of the Joni Jam band. … Those guys coming in and playing on that song feels more like something they did for her than something they did for me. I think that was them signing off on that song as a worthy tribute for Joni and joining it, I bet if I had sent them that song and they didn’t like it, they wouldn’t have played on it. They have such discernment and taste, just like Joni has.”\n\n\n\n\n\t8. “You Without Me”\n\n\tA tender song about detaching a little from children as they inevitably find their own identity. It first appeared, in identical form, on the Elton John/Carlile collaborative album “Who Believes in Angels?,” which was recorded in late 2023 and released in early 2025.\n\n\tCarlile: “This is a song for anybody that has kids or nieces and nephews. There’s this moment this transition period. I think we try not to be narcissists. We try not to project ourselves onto our children. We tell ourselves that we know we’re not raising a Mini-Me, and that that’s not what’s important. But on some level, I think we do think we are raising a Mini-Me until the moment we know we’re not. And that moment is because they did something that went against your beliefs. Maybe they just broke a tiny rule. Maybe they took a stand. Maybe they wouldn’t come with you somewhere that you used to love to spend time at. And they stand on their own two feet and they use a different voice and they make a different face. Maybe it’s something you witnessed from far away, that it happens with one of their friends. But that moment of realizing that your child has departed you and become their own person is simultaneously devastating and also makes you so proud at the same time. And it’s such a fucking twisted feeling that I, of course, being the sick lesbian I am, could not help but write a sad song about it.\n\n\t“I wrote this song about my daughter the first time I saw that happen. And it’s on the album that I did with Elton, but Elton doesn’t believe it belongs there, and/or he believes it belongs somewhere else too. So he expressed a really strong opinion and told me that it belonged on this album, that it is actually part of this body. I think the exact thing he said was, ‘I will spank you if you don’t put it on.’ So I decided to honor his request because I don’t want to get spanked by Elton John.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t9. “No One Knows Us”\n\n\tThe singer reaches out to a friend who may be depressed, emphasizing the ongoing importance of their relationship, a bond unique among all the billions of other bonds in the universe.\n\n\tCarlile: “It’s the second-to-last song and should be track three. But I wanted to put it near the end of the record because it should be track three, but I love that it’s second-to-last. I’ve never loved an album in the way I love this one, and the sequence is so important to me. This is one of maybe only three or four songs on this album that are a jam.\n\n\t“It started with a Brandi-and-Aaron moment up at Long Pond, upstate of New York, and I called Aaron a couple weeks after we’d written it and I said, ‘You know what? I’m so sorry, but it’s a band song. Can we change it?’ And he says, ‘Uh, uh, okay.’ ‘Can we fly to L.A. and play on it and then co-produce it with Andrew Watt and all get in the same room at Henson and totally change your piece of art?’ And the man was so generous that he got on an airplane and came to Los Angeles and he brought Justin Vernon and him, and they, Andrew and we and the band all got together like a band and we played this song the way that I was feeling it. I think it’s a banger.\n\n\t“In all honesty, if Aaron had his way, he would strip the band off that song right now, and it would just be the the initial thing that he and I wrote. And in fact, it’s so fucking cool, the initial thing, that I will eventually release, because I want people to hear that too. It was really, really special. But at the end of the day, the way I feel that song and the way I want to do that song out in life is how it sounds on the record. It’s kind of like, in my shows, ‘Pride and Joy’ or ‘Give Up the Ghost.’ You know how ‘Pride and Joy’ is an acoustic song on the album, but then live, it’s like a huge Radiohead song?, I don’t regret the way I recorded ‘Pride and Joy’ on the album. But I knew that I was gonna turn around and make ‘No One Knows Us’ and do a massive rock ‘n’ roll moment in my show, so I really wanted it to be that way on the album. But yeah, Aaron, I think if he had his way, je would have it back down in the Long Pond world. So one day that will come out just like that. But Andrew’s contribution to that was bombastic and fucking rad.\n\t\n\n\t“For reasons that are important to me, this song is about the keepers. This song is about the people in your life that are there forever. … It is one of those connections that the world would think is dysfunctional because you’re communicating through a shared experience and you’re saying ‘No one knows us but us.’ And it doesn’t matter if the world thinks that that’s dysfunctional or we’re too close or that we need fucking boundaries. It’s like: ‘Hey — can you get out of bed today, or do you need me?’ And I think really what matters is that the world is full of people that have that someone that sometimes it’s their job to get them out of bed. And there’s nothing wrong with that. There’s no lack of boundaries in being that connected to someone that you are their person, sometimes.”\n\n\n\n\n\t10. “A Long Goodbye”\n\n\tShe bookends this album-closer with some obviously autobiographical material — referencing at the start her first plane trip with a girlfriend from Seattle to Idaho, as a young adult. But in-between come mentions of how easy it is to slip off this mortal coil, context that brings more poignance to the embrace of mortality in the coda. Fans will notice that an Indigo Girls reference slips in as the song is reaching its touching end.\n\n\tCarlile: “No one returns to themselves alone. It’s not possible. And the last song could have been the first song, and the first song could have been the last song, but I just couldn’t bear letting go of the beauty of an album that ends on the word goodbye — it’s on the nose. But if you could write a memoir in three and a half or four and a half minutes, it’d be this song.\n\n\t“At the end, swirling moment that is a lightening up of my soul, and hopefully the person’s soul who’s listening to it. We talked about some heavy shit, but then you just sort of feel this lift come up: Let it go, keep it light, let it snow, let the wind blow. It’s only life after all, you know — it’s a long goodbye. It is supposed to just be that: lightening up.”\n\n\n\n",

We do not know who specifically, but we're told it's definitely more than one.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          It's interesting ... because new CBS News Editor-In-Chief Bari Weiss leans to the right of her predecessors, so it makes sense. Also, FNC is a ratings juggernaut, beating all of its cable competition by a landslide. The CBS morning show, by contrast, is a distant 3rd to its competitors.\n      \n\n          As for Gayle King's future at CBS, we're told the issue is not whether she's taken off the morning show ... it all comes down to money. Gayle pulls somewhere north of $10 million a year, and we're told the brass thinks it's way too much in today's media climate. So the issue comes down to $$$ ... which she addressed when she talked to us Friday after her show.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n    \n          Gayle has a very active social life, attending numerous evening events in NYC, and the early AM schedule is hard on her. So, we're told, it may be Gayle's decision whether to take a financial haircut and still maintain a pretty grueling schedule.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Gayle King\n              \n                          \n                CBS\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Sia and her estranged husband Daniel Bernad have been ordered to enter a mediation session to try to hammer out the custody issues in their contentious divorce.\n      \n    \n          We broke the news earlier this week -- Daniel's emergency request for full custody was shot down by a judge ... but now, the judge is ordering them to get together for a mediation session over the custody and visitation issues for their 1-year-old, Somersault Wonder Bernad.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          In court docs obtained by TMZ, the former couple is being required to at least attempt to work through the issues before the next scheduled hearing. They've got 2 options -- handle things through a video conference with a mediator ... or use the Los Angeles court system's online program meant to help parents formulate a parenting plan.\n      \n\n          However, if they choose the second option and aren't able to reach an agreement, they're required to meet online with a mediator.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          You heard it here first -- Sia filed for divorce in March after about 2 years of marriage, and the breakup has been anything but smooth.\n      \n    \n          Sia currently has primary custody of their son, with limited visitation rights for Daniel, in the arrangement between them, but Daniel tried winning Somersault back by accusing Sia of being a \"danger\" to their son, accusing her of struggling with substance abuse issues. Sia's celeb-trusted attorney Laura Wasser argued she's been sober for 6 months and has no issue being drug-tested.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          The musician also claimed Daniel was the one reluctant to submit to drug tests, and reminded the court she has custody because he was recently the subject of an investigation by the LAPD and DCFS over alleged child pornography -- which is currently closed after he vehemently denied the allegations and suggested any evidence had been planted.\n      \n    \n          It looks like the pair now have to team up again and try to figure something out about all the custody stuff before they next see the judge.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Sia\n              \n                          \n                Daniel Bernad\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Custody Battles\n              \n                          \n                celebrity kids\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Divorce\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

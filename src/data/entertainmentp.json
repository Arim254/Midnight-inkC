    "body": "\n\tJim Carrey is in talks to lead a “Jetsons” movie at Warner Bros. Pictures with Colin Trevorrow in talks to direct, Variety has confirmed. \n\n\tTrevorrow, who last helmed “Jurassic World Dominion,” and Joe Epstein are in talks to write the screenplay. No information on the storyline was immediately available.\n\n\tThe last “Jetsons” feature film was the 1990 animated “Jetsons: The Movie.” A live-action version of the familiar family animated property, which first aired in 1962, has been attempted numerous times over the years. The series was revived several times in the 1970s and ’80s, making the typical nuclear family that happens to live in outer space familiar to several generations of viewers.\n\t\n\n\tThe story revolved around George and Jane Jetson, their children Judy and Elroy and dog Astro. The family lives in the space-age styled Orbit City and enjoys innovations that were considered wildly futuristic at the time, such as video chat, domestic robots and even flying cars are part of or about to be part of daily life 60 years later.\n\n\n\tAmong the unfulfilled attempts to bring “The Jetsons” to screen were a 2003 version directed by Adam Shankman, a 2007 CGI version directed by Robert Rodriguez and a 2017 animated version.\n\n\tCarrey most recently has appeared in “Sonic the Hedgehog” and its two follow-up installments. He has a long history of taking on iconic characters such as the Grinch in “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” but has been seen less frequently onscreen in recent years.\n\n\tBefore “Jurassic World Dominion,” Trevorrow directed “The Book of Henry,” “Jurassic World” and the indie “Safety Not Guaranteed.”\n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. had no comment. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Splinter Cell: Deathwatch” has officially been renewed for a second season at Netflix. \n\n\tThe news comes one day after the series premiere on Oct. 14. Variety first reported that a “Splinter Cell” animated series was in the works back in 2020, at which time it was reported that Netflix had given the show a two-season order. \n\n\tBased on the “Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell” video game franchise, the animated series stars Liev Schreiber as Sam Fisher, with Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Zinnia Mckenna. Additional voice cast members include Janet Varney, Helen Hong, Kari Wahlgren, Joel Oulette, Aleks Le, Kiff VandenHeuvel, Bella Dayne, and Navid Negahban. \n\t\n\n\tThe official logline for the series states, “Legendary agent Sam Fisher is drawn back into the field when a wounded young operative seeks out his help.”\n\n\tDerek Kolstad developed the series for television and serves as executive producer. Guillaume Dousse directs with Félicien Colmet-Daage as co-director. Helene Juguet, Hugo Revon and Gerard Guillemot executive produce for Ubisoft Film & Television. Sun Creature and Fost provides the animation. \n\n\tThe first “Splinter Cell” game was released in 2002 to near universal acclaim from critics and massive sales. The game follows former U.S. Navy SEAL Fisher after he is recruited by the NSA to work for the mysterious Third Echelon division within the agency. The game sees Fisher engage in a number of black ops missions, employing stealth and military tactics.\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tArtificial-intelligence tech giant OpenAI has announced plans to introduce sexually explicit material for its ChatGPT AI-based chatbot later this year — a move that a conservative advocacy group says risks introducing “real mental health harms from synthetic intimacy” without appropriate safeguards.\n\n\tThe National Center on Sexual Exploitation issued a statement calling on OpenAI to reverse its plan to allow “erotica” on ChatGPT. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X Tuesday that in December, “as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more [kinds of content], like erotica for verified adults” on ChatGPT. \n\t\n\n\tAccording to Altman, the company originally made ChatGPT “pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.” \n\n\n\tAltman continued, “Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.” The change will mean that ChatGPT will be able “to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend” — or, evidently, talk dirty to you.\n\n\tNCOSE, formerly known as Morality in Media, argues that OpenAI is adding sexual content to the AI chatbot “without credible safeguards.”\n\n\t“Sexualized AI chatbots are inherently risky, generating real mental health harms from synthetic intimacy; all in the context of poorly defined industry safety standards,” said Haley McNamara, executive director and chief strategy Officer at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. “While [OpenAI’s] age verification is a good step to try preventing childhood exposure to explicit content, the reality is these tools have documented harms to adults as well. We’ve already seen other chatbots emboldened to engage in sexual conversation simulate themes of child abuse or push sexually violent written content on users who asked them to stop.” \n\t\n\n\tMcNamara concluded, “If OpenAI truly cares about user well-being, it should pause any plans to integrate this so-called ‘erotica’ into ChatGPT and focus on building something positive for humanity.”\n\n\tReps for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\tWashington, D.C.-based NCOSE calls itself “the leading national non-profit organization exposing the links between all forms of sexual exploitation such as child sexual abuse, prostitution, sex trafficking and the public health harms of pornography.”\n\n\tSeparately, OpenAI has come under fire from the entertainment industry for its Sora 2 video-generation system, which is able to produce recognizable movie and TV characters. Amid the backlash, the Motion Picture Association called on OpenAI to take “immediate action” to fix its copyright opt-out system to shoulder the burden of policing copyright infringement.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmerican stage and screen actress Penelope Milford, who was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1979 for her role in Hal Ashby’s “Coming Home,” died Tuesday in Saugerties, N.Y. She was 77.\n\n\tHer death was confirmed by her brother Doug Milford. A cause was not immediately available.\n\n\tMilford’s professional career on the New York stage began in 1971 where she co-starred opposite Richard Gere in an Off-Broadway production of “Long Time Coming and a Long Time Gone,” based upon the life of musician-novelist Richard Farina.\n\t\n\n\tIn 1972 Milford made her Broadway debut in Julian Barry’s Tony Award-winning play “Lenny.” Three years later Milford received a Drama Desk Featured Actress in a Musical nomination for “Shenandoah.”\n\n\n\tIn that same period, Milford began appearing in films, first playing a role in Norman Mailer’s notorious, edgy, indie film “Maidstone” (1970) and she played a silent-film star in Ken Russell’s 1977 biopic “Valentino.” \n\n\tBut it was her turn as Vi Munson in the Oscar-nominated Best Picture “Coming Home” that placed her in the top ranks of Hollywood performers. Nominated for nine Oscars, including her supporting actress nomination, the film won three Oscars, including Best Actress for Jane Fonda and Best Actor for Jon Voight. In 1981 she also appeared in Franco Zeffirelli’s “Endless Love.”\n\n\tIn the ’80s, Milford also played several notable roles on television, co-starring with Henry Fonda, Cloris Leachman and Timothy Hutton in the Emmy-winning TV play, “The Oldest Living Graduate” (1980), starring with Leonard Nimoy in the television movie “Seizure: The Story of Kathy Morris” (1980), as well as taking a key role in the landmark TV film about spousal abuse, “The Burning Bed” (1984) which starred Farrah Fawcett and garnered numerous accolades, including a WGA award and a Golden Globe.\n\t\n\n\tReportedly dissatisfied with the entertainment industry, Milford played a few more key roles in acclaimed films such as “Heathers” (1988) and John McNaughton’s gritty 1996 crime shocker “Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,” which starred Michael Rooker and garnered several international film festival awards.\n\n\tIn the 1990s, Milford taught film acting in Chicago and Minneapolis, and in 2003 moved to the Hudson Valley village of Saugerties, where she was an ardent preservationist, restoring a historic residence and serving her local community’s efforts to maintain its storied commercial district and homes. She also performed in local theater, sang in the Bard Symphonic Chorus, and was active in the Woodstock Christian Science church. \n\n\tShe is pre-deceased by her brother, actor/singer Richard Kim Milford, and is survived by her sister Candace Saint and her brother Doug Milford.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVice Studios (“Gangs of London”) and V10 Entertainment, which owns “America’s Funniest Home Videos” producer Vin DiBona Prods., have come up with a new twist to the age-old TV video clip format. V10 and Vice are behind a new hybrid clip/competition series dubbed “Clip Bait.” The show pits online videos opposite each other in a tournament, as each clip is judged by a panel of content creators. The “ultimate viral champion” will then be chosen in a “live, interactive finale.”\n\t\n\n\t“‘Clip Bait’ is what happens when viral videos stop being watched and start getting judged,” said Vice Studios head of non-scripted development Joe Ingham. “This big, beautiful, bonkers format is part banter, part treasure hunt, and totally participatory. We’ve turned the infinite scroll into a full contact sport, and we cannot wait to unleash it onto a screen near you very soon.”\n\n\n\tIngham will exec produce the series for Vice Studios, while John Stevens and Rick de Oliveira are exec pdoducers for V10 Entertainment. Global rights to the series are currently being shopped at the Mipcom international television market.\n\n\t“’Clip Bait’ reimagines the clip series and reality competition formats with immediacy and energy to reflect today’s viral video audiences,” said de Oliveira said. “Our partnership with Vice will deliver a high-stakes competition that seamlessly taps into the way audiences watch, share, and connect.”\n\n\tV10 knows a thing or two about video clips. The Clarion Capital-backed media company acquired “America’s Funniest Home Videos” creator Vin Di Bona Productions, Venture 10 Studio Group,  and Fishbowl Worldwide Media in 2023. That gave V10 a library of more than 2.8 million videos, with an output of 250 hours of original content annually.\n\t\n\n\tV10’s library includes 44 owned digital and FAST channels with more than 1600 hours of owned content including “America’s Funniest Home Videos” (36 seasons on ABC), “Follow Me” (Amazon Prime), “Blue Collar Auction” (Peacock), “Totally Funny Kids” and “Totally Funny Animals” (The CW) and “World’s Funniest Videos” (Fox). The company also has “America’s Funniest People” on ABC, Discovery’s “Wild & Weird” and Roku’s “Visionaries with Keanu Reeves & Gard Hollinger.”\n\n\tAs for Vice Studio, which is a division of Vice Media, the company’s output includes Sky’s “Gangs of London,” which was recently renewed for a fourth season, a well as another series for Sky, “Atomic.” Vice is also behind the satirical Saoirse Ronan feature “Bad Apples,” which premiered this year at TIFF and was selected for San Sebastián, BFI London and AFI Film Festival. Vice Studios also owns and operates Cuba Pictures, which is behind Channel 5’s “The Rumour” and RTE’s “The Walsh Sisters.” In unscripted, Vice has “Into the Void” (Hulu), “Hollywood Hustler: Glitz, Glam, Scam” (Prime Video), “Pavements” (Mubi), “Bama Rush” (HBO Max), and “Lewis Capaldi: How I’m Feeling Now” (Netflix). \n",

It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do. It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity. It’s been inspiring to see how far you’ve come. You took the feedback to heart and reimagined Project ETHOS with a renewed vision – one that’s poised to deliver on its promise to our players. Our confidence in Project ETHOS grows every day. To further the incredible progress you’ve made, I’m excited to welcome Ben Brinkman as the new Studio Head of 31st Union. After several months of conversations, Ben officially joins us on Monday, October 20.”\n\t\n\n\tBrinkman comes to 2K’s 31st Union from Electronic Arts’ Respawn Entertainment, where he served as head of production for “Apex Legends.” \n\n\n\tSee Ismailer’s full note announcing Brinkman’s hire below.\n\n\tTeam –\n\n\tI know you all just wrapped up your town hall – I hope you’re as excited as I am with the good news. Last time I sent you all a note, I shared the following statement: “I believe in this team. You all are some of the most driven and creative developers we have had the chance to partner with – and we’re excited for that partnership to continue.”\n\t\n\n\tWith your dedication and flexibility, especially over the last year, you continue to prove that.\n\n\tThe community feedback from last fall’s Project ETHOS playtest was enlightening. It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do. It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity.\n\n\tIt’s been inspiring to see how far you’ve come. You took the feedback to heart and reimagined Project ETHOS with a renewed vision – one that’s poised to deliver on its promise to our players\n\n\tOur confidence in Project ETHOS grows every day. To further the incredible progress you’ve made, I’m excited to welcome Ben Brinkman as the new Studio Head of 31st Union. After several months of conversations, Ben officially joins us on Monday, October 20.\n\n\tBen’s leadership and experience in the PVP shooter space is extensive, having spent the last 15 years developing and leading some of the most recognizable franchises in gaming, including Call of Duty: Black Ops, and most recently, Apex Legends.\n\n\tPlease join me in welcoming Ben next week. We are all excited to continue to see the evolution of Project ETHOS in the months to come.\n\n\tDavid\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter announcing their residency at Las Vegas’ Sphere earlier this month, No Doubt is plotting six additional dates for their 2026 stint in Sin City.\n\n\tThe group, consisting of Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont and Adrian Young, will head over to Sin City for what was initially billed as a six-night limited engagement on May 6, 8, 9, 13, 15 and 16. The new dates are set for May 21, 23, 24, 27, 29 and 30. Presale tickets are now live on Ticketmaster.\n\t\n\n\t“The opportunity to create a show at Sphere excites me in a new way,” says Stefani in a statement. “The venue is unique and modern and it opens up a whole new visual palette for us to be creative. Doing it with No Doubt feels like going back in time to relive our history, while also creating something new in a way we never could have imagined.”\n\n\n\t“When we are on stage together playing these songs we feel the magic,” says Dumont. “We are stoked to play together again for our fans, to celebrate their years of love and support.” Young adds, “For anyone who has ever cared or is curious about a No Doubt live concert, this is a special opportunity for that electric band/fan energy exchange in a very unique venue!” Kanal also notes, “There is a beautiful energy that happens when we play together, an electricity I have felt through all of our years. To be able to leave it all on the table each night and take our fans on the insane journey that is Sphere is beyond our wildest dreams.”\n\n\tNo Doubt was one of the headline-grabbing performances from Coachella 2024 across both weekends, marking the first time the group performed together since 2015. The quartet followed the Coachella bookings with a performance at the FireAid benefit concert at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum earlier this January.\n\t\n\n\tThe Sphere residency also marks the first time that a female-fronted act will headline the venue, as previous performers have included Dead & Co., U2, Eagles, Anyma and Backstreet Boys. It would be a return to the Strip for Stefani, who staged her own “Just a Girl: Las Vegas” residency at the Zappos Theater in 2018. Those shows were set to conclude in May 2020, but eight were postponed due to the pandemic and rescheduled for the following year.\n\n\tAs for any indication of new No Doubt music, the band hasn’t signaled that they’ll head back to the studio to record the follow-up to their last album, 2012’s “Push and Shove.” During an interview with Nylon following their Coachella performances, Stefani said that she’s “open to anything.” “Well, I don’t have a crystal ball,” she said. “Most things have surprised me in life. One of the things I’ve learned is to be present in the moment and try to absorb what’s happening around me instead of looking ahead.”\n\n\tFans who previously registered for tickets have access to the new dates starting at 12 p.m. PT today. General tickets will be available starting on Oct. 17 at 10 a.m. PT on Ticketmaster.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn launching the Vision Pro headset last year, Apple touted it as the “ultimate entertainment device,” essentially providing an immersive high-end home theater you wear on your face. But at a list price of $3,500, the AR/VR “spatial computing” product by all accounts has failed to live up the hype and hasn’t sold a significant number of units.\n\n\tUndeterred, Apple has stuck to its road map — for now, at least. On Wednesday, it announced an upgraded version of the Vision Pro with its M5 processor, which “delivers a leap forward in performance, improved display rendering, faster AI-powered workflows and extended battery life,” the company said. The headset still costs $3,499, which is significantly more than the $500 Meta Quest 3 mixed-reality headset.\n\t\n\n\tThe Vision Pro M5 upgrade could be the last major rev on the headset for several years. Apple has postponed plans to make a lighter and less expensive version of Vision Pro, originally targeted for 2027 release, in favor of focusing on AI-enabled smart glasses to compete with Meta, according to a Bloomberg report earlier this month, citing an internal announcement. (Apple declined to comment on the report.)\n\n\tWith the Vision Pro product upgrade, the tech giant is still hoping to make AR/VR experiences a bigger thing — and, Apple claims, the headset “remains the ultimate entertainment device” with a screen “that appears up to 100 feet wide.” \n\n\tWith the new model, users can experience immersive concerts with Amplium, and Vision Pro features natively developed apps for streaming services including HBO Max, Disney+ and Paramount+ (but not for Netflix or YouTube). The Apple TV app provides a large selection of 3D movies available to buy and view in Vision Pro, including recent hits like “Superman,” “Jurassic World Rebirth,” “How to Train Your Dragon” and “Wicked.” New series and films on the Apple TV app available on Vision Pro include “Metallica,” “Submerged,” “The Weeknd: Open Hearts” and “VIP: Yankee Stadium.”\n\t\n\n\tLater this NBA season, users in the L.A. Lakers’ broadcast territory will be able to watch select live games in Apple Immersive format on the Vision Pro, the company announced. Additionally, new titles from CNN, the Audi F1 Project, the BBC, HYBE and Red Bull will launch for the headset over the next few months. \n\n\tThanks to the M5 chip, Vision Pro can increase the video refresh rate up to 120Hz for “reduced motion blur” when users look at their physical surroundings. In addition, according to Apple, the 16-core Neural Engine makes AI-powered features run up to 50% for system experiences (like transforming photos into spatial scenes) and up to twice as fast for third-party apps compared with the previous generation.\n\n\tVision Pro — which is outfitted with 12 cameras, five sensors and six microphones — is able to stream new images to the displays within 12 milliseconds “to create a real-time view of the world.” The new battery now supports up to 2.5 hours of general use and up to 3 hours of video playback on a single charge.\n\n\tOther enhancements to the upgraded Vision Pro include a new dual-knit band (for “an even more comfortable fit”) and visionOS 26, which “unlocks innovative spatial experiences, including widgets, new Personas, an interactive Jupiter Environment, and new Apple Intelligence features with support for additional languages.”\n\n\tFor all Apple’s efforts to try to make Vision Pro appealing to consumers, the product may ultimately see its most traction for business applications.\n\n\tIn its announcement Wednesday, Apple called out CAE, which specializes in simulation and instruction solutions, as using Vision Pro to help pilots complete training activities outside of traditional flight-training centers. The company said Porsche is using the headsets to let drivers visualize and personalize new vehicles in select showrooms before taking delivery. Apple also cited Visage Imaging’s 3D medical imaging app for Vision Pro, which is being used at hospitals like UC San Diego Health.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA documentary about the aftermath of this year’s devastating L.A. wildfires — executive produced by Mark Hamill and Ricki Lake — has launched as the film hit Vimeo on Wednesday.\n\n\tDirected by David Goldblum, a local to Big Rock who lost his home in the fire, “Big Rock Burning” is a 30-minute film that tells the stories of residents impacted by the Pacific Palisades blazes and captures their process of rebuilding destroyed neighborhoods.\n\t\n\n\tFollowing the reported arrest of suspected arsonist Jonathan Rinderknecht, who authorities have accused of intentionally setting the spark, the filmmakers chose to bypass traditional distribution to release the film directly to audiences.\n\n\n\t“Although we were in ongoing conversations with various distributors, the timeline wasn’t aligning with our hopes to make the film available as soon as possible,” Goldblum said in a statement. “We never made the film to sit on it. People need closure, and we hope this release helps communities begin to heal. We are using this film to call for change.”\n\n\t“Big Rock Burning” has premiered at Malibu City Hall. Its festival run includes screenings at Mill Valley Film Festival, Santa Fe International Film Festival, Newport Beach Film Festival and SCAD Savannah Film Festival. \n\n\tAs part of the film’s ongoing impact campaign, Goldblum will be a part of a special session with the Council of Global Change at the United Nations Headquarters on Oct. 22 to use the film as a call to action. \n\n\tThe session, which includes the World Bank and Malala Fund, will be live on United Nations Web TV. \n\t\n\n\tThe filmmakers are dedicated to advocating for legislative reform around land management at the local and state levels.\n\n\tTen percent of all proceeds from the film release will benefit the Boys & Girls Club of Malibu’s Disaster Recovery Services, which is providing long-term, whole-person, trauma-informed care coordination and resources to Pacific Palisades fire survivors. \n\n\t“Big Rock Burning” is produced by Julie Parker Benello (“American Factory,” “Athlete A”) of Secret Sauce Media and James Costa (“The Dating Game,” “Welcome to Chechnya”) of Bird Street Productions, alongside Goldblum.\n\n\tOscar-winning director Bryan Fogel also serve as executive producers alongside Marilou Hamill, Trevor Burgess, Judith Helfand, Oliver Blank and Meadow Fund.\n\n\tCheck out the “Big Rock Burn” trailer below:\n\n\n\n",

Prosecutors said several of the weapons had scratched-off serial numbers.\n      \n    \n          As you know ... Judge Arun Subramanian sentenced Diddy to 4 years and change in a federal prison after his conviction on two counts of violating the Mann Act. He was acquitted on the sex trafficking and racketeering charges.\n      \n    \n          Diddy still hasn't been assigned to a prison ... though Judge Subramanian did say he thinks the mogul should serve his time as close as possible to the New York City Metropolitan area. Diddy's attorneys asked the court to recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that Diddy be shipped off to the low-security federal correctional institution FCI Fort Dix, in New Jersey.\n      \n    \n          And, now at least Diddy knows what his life will look like when he gets out of the joint.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Diddy\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Hip Hop\n              \n                          \n                Diddy Trial\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

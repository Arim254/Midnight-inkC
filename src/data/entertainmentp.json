    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Wednesday, December 17 finale of “Survivor” Season 49.\n\n\tIt’s officially “Survivor” 50 season! ",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Wednesday, December 17 finale of “Survivor” Season 49.\n\n\tIt’s officially “Survivor” 50 season! The first trailer for “In the Hands of the Fans,” the upcoming season featuring some of the best to ever play the game, debuted on Wednesday night following the end of Season 49.\n\n\tThe trailer begins in slow motion, showing some of the best players of all time from “Survivor” boarding a private plane for the epic 50th season. Some are quite recognizable even without showing their faces — like Ozzy Lusth and Jonathan Young. The first face shown is Colby Donaldson.\n\t\n\n\tProbst tells the former players, “We chose you to represent 25 years of the greatest adventure on televison. It’s a big honor, and the only thing we want in exchange for giving you the spot… is everything.”\n\n\n\tMike White has the best teaser (of course!), adding, “It feels a little like a high school reunion meets massacre.”\n\n\tThere’s also some surprise guests — Zac Brown and Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson pop up in the trailer, with Beast carrying his famous briefcase. Plus, his coin, encrusted with “Beast Games” and “Survivor,” can be seen earlier in the video. There’s also “a Billie Eilish boomerang idol” mixed in, Rick Devens reveals, and Christian Hubicki adds, “Jimmy Fallon may decide my fate in this game.” The two Season 49 players are revealed to be finalists Savannah Louie and Rizo Velovic. \n\n\tAlthough the most exciting part may be the fact that Probst is shown seemingly competing in the trailer.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBefore the trailer aired, Season 49 came to a dramatic end; first Savannah became the fifth woman to win four individual immunity challenges in one season, beating the finalists Sage Ahrens-Nichols, Sophi Balerdi, Kristina Mills and Rizo in the second-to-last immunity challenge. She chose to bring Sophi with her to the sanctuary.\n\t\n\n\tSophi took home the last (and her first!) necklace next and, despite having a final three deal with Rizo and Savannah, she didn’t want to have any discussions with anyone and told everyone to practice fire. Savannah was upset; and Rizo said he wanted Savannah if he was making fire. Ultimately, Sophi chose to bring Sage to the end. Ultimately, Savannah beat Rizo in the fire-making challenge, then beat both Sophi and Sage and was awarded the $1 million prize.\n\n\tIt’s important to note that this marked only the third time the show has had a final three made up of only women — and it’s been 20 seasons since it last happened. \n\n\t“Survivor” 50 debuts on CBS Wednesday, Feb. 25, at 8 p.m. ET. To celebrate the season, CBS will air past epsiodes from across the series’ history, Monday through Friday, beginning Feb. 9.\n\n\tWatch the trailer below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs the future of the studio hangs in the balance, Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix leaders put on a show of force Wednesday afternoon when Netflix brass paid a visit to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, where WBD chief executive David Zaslav gave them a guided tour.\n\n\tWBD released photos to media outlets late Wednesday that show Zaslav strolling the famed studio lot with Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, who are co-CEOs of the streaming giant. \n\t\n\n\t“Today, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav welcomed Netflix Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters to the historic Warner Bros. Studio lot in Burbank to meet with leaders across the company,” according to the caption that accompanied the photos. A rep for the studio did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. A source close to the situation confirmed the veracity of the photos.\n\n\n\tSarandos and Peters met with a handful of Warner Bros. employees and even took some questions. \n\n\tSarandos and Peters’ trek to Burbank came on the same day that the WBD board reaffirmed its decision to sell Warner Bros. and HBO to Netflix and once again rejected the latest offer from Paramount Skydance. The fight over the fate of Warner Bros. blew wide open earlier this month when Paramount went public with its effort to amass control of the company through a tender offer to shareholders. WBD, meanwhile, clinched an agreement with Netflix that values the company’s key assets — Warner Bros. and HBO — at $82.7 billion.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNetflix’s Ted Sarandos, center, and Greg Peters, second from right, meet with Warner Bros. employees at the studio’s Steven J. Ross Theater.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tParamount’s aggressive overtures in September and October put Warner Bros. Discovery in play. Netflix swooped in with a cash-and-stock bid that has won over the WBD board of directors. Paramount is offering all cash for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including the company’s linear cable channels, while Netflix is only buying WB and HBO. Paramount asserts that its offer is better for WBD shareholders because it is for the entire company, and Paramount has warned that Netflix will struggle to secure regulatory approval for such a big deal because of its dominant position in subscription streaming.\n\t\n\n\tWBD has countered that it has concerns about the source of the funds behind Paramount’s bid. It also makes the case that Netflix is in a better financial position to support Warner Bros. and HBO operations.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Reiner has been showered with accolades for his work in film and TV in the days since he and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found brutally slain in their Brentwood home.\n\n\tRob Reiner had a knack for intersecting with cutting-edge comedy forces just as they were on the cusp of breaking big. Reiner was born into a pedigreed showbiz family as the son of Carl Reiner, a pioneering star of “Your Show of Shows,” and singer Estelle Reiner. Rob Reiner grew up around Mel Brooks, Sid Caesar, Neil Simon and a slew of comedy legends who were close to his father.\n\t\n\n\tBut as he came of age in the late 1960s, Rob Reiner also had a good eye for talent and collaborators. He became involved with the out-there San Francisco improv troupe the Committee, whose members  included future “The Bob Newhart Show” co-star Peter Bonerz and “Jaws” screenwriter Carl Gottlieb. Reiner and friends that included Richard Dreyfuss, writer Larry Bishop and writer-actor David Arkin would often drive up to San Francisco from Los Angeles to catch the Committee’s Sunday night shows.\n\n\n\tReiner and a handful of others eventually created an Los Angeles-based offshoot troupe that was dubbed the Session. The Committee had a residency in 1968 at the Tiffany Theater on the Sunset Strip that was a formative experience for all involved.\n\n\tAs an actor in improv, Reiner was “fearless,” Gottlieb recalls. “He would attempt any sketch. It didn’t matter what the content was. If it had the potential for humor, he’d try it.”\n\n\tEven as a young man, Reiner had a presence and a charisma that drew people to him. “Rob was always kind of a spark plug. He’d do everything bigger and louder than everybody else. Not in furtherance of his ego. Always for the material, which made all the difference,” Gottlieb recalls. In those days, the Committee members were committed to social justice and anti-war protests. “For us it was an opportunity to find some deeper meaning in the improv work,” he says. \n\t\n\n\t“We’d do a couple of anti-war pieces to provoke the audience. We had some arguments a couple of times. In San Francisco after we’d provoked the audience we’d bring the house lights up and have a teach-in session,” Gottlieb says.\n\n\tAfter his time with the Committee and the Session, Reiner eventually found his way onto the writing staff of “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.” That show became the stuff of TV legend as the stars famously battled CBS over content and censorship concerns. Reiner joined a murderer’s row of comedy talent in the “Smothers Brothers” writers room, which included Steve Martin, Mason Williams, Pat Paulson, Bob Einstein (aka Super Dave Osborne) and musician John Hartford. \n\n\t“Smothers Brothers” was famously canceled in 1969 — and it went on to win the Emmy for best variety series two months later. The show was so respected in the creative community that all the writers went on to promising new projects. Within months of “Smothers Brothers” demise, Reiner had been cast as an actor on another edgy CBS series, Norman Lear’s “All in the Family.” That series made Reiner a household name — even if that name was “Meathead.”\n\n\tReiner was squarely at the center of Lear universe of shows. And through his marriage in the 1970s to Penny Marshall, Reiner was adjacent to the Garry Marshall universe of shows that included ABC’s “Happy Days” and “Laverne & Shirley” (which starred Penny Marshall). All of those connections would come into play in Reiner’s post-“All in the Family” years as he pursued his desire to make his mark as a writer and director. His first effort was a film that remains a landmark, oft-quoted comedy, 1984’s “This is Spinal Tap.” And that was followed by smashes that include 1986’s “Stand by Me,” 1987’s “The Princess Bride” and 1989’s “When Harry Met Sally.”\n\n\tReiner’s close friends often marveled at how well he wore his success, especially when he made such a triumphant segue into helming.\n\n\t“He was very cool about it. Having grown up as Carl Reiner’s son, he was no stranger to celebrity. His extended family was the ‘Laughter on the 23rd Floor’ crowd,” Gottlieb says, referring to Neil Simon’s play about his time writing for “Your Show of Shows.”\n\n\tGottlieb believes the spartan ethos of improv made a big mark on his former housemate.\n\t\n\n\t“One of the key lessons of improvisation is that you never said ‘No but’ you always said ‘Yes and.’ Rob was really good at that. When he doing a sketch, he would always stay in character. He took the work very seriously,” Gottlieb says. “And then he applied all the lessons he learned on stage and at his father’s knee to practical every day use.”\n\n\t(Pictured: Mason Williams, Rob Reiner, Bob Einstein, Steve Martin, Glen Campbell and John Hartford at the 1988 “Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” reunion.)\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has released the first teaser trailer for “Can This Love Be Translated?,” a Korean romantic comedy series starring Kim Seon-ho and Go Youn-jung, set to premiere Jan. 16.\n\n\tThe series marks the latest project from the Hong Sisters — Hong Jung-eun and Hong Mi-ran — the acclaimed writing duo whose credits include “Alchemy of Souls,” “Hotel Del Luna” and “The Master’s Sun.” Yoo Young-eun, who helmed “Bloody Heart,” directs the production, which was shot on location across Japan, Canada, Italy and additional international territories.\n\t\n\n\tThe globe-trotting production represents an ambitious scale for the romantic comedy genre, providing a cross-border setting that expands beyond the typical parameters of K-drama rom-coms.\n\n\n\tThe series centers on the relationship between Joo Ho-jin, a multilingual interpreter, and Cha Mu-hee, a world-famous celebrity. Their contrasting personalities create an initially mismatched pairing that evolves as the two characters grow closer, with the teaser offering an initial glimpse at their on-screen chemistry.\n\n\tKim Seon-ho, known for his roles in “When Life Gives You Tangerines,” “Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha” and “Start-Up,” portrays Ho-jin. Go Youn-jung, whose credits include “Sweet Home,” “Alchemy of Souls: Light and Shadow” and “Resident Playbook,” plays Mu-hee.\n\n\tThe cast also includes Fukushi Sota as Hiro, a charismatic figure dubbed “Japan’s Romance Prince,” whose presence introduces additional romantic complications that explore themes of jealousy and miscommunication across language barriers.\n\n\tKorean romantic comedies have demonstrated consistent popularity on Netflix’s platform, with recent titles “Dynamite Kiss” and “Bon Appétit, Your Majesty” both appearing on the streamer’s Global Top 10 non-English TV list following their respective debuts.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump used his Wednesday night address to largely blame former President Joe Biden for most of the Nation’s shortcomings while attempting to highlight his accomplishments through the first 11 months of his second term in office.\n\n\tTrump’s address opened with a direct attack on his predecessor, saying he “inherited a mess” before sounding off on several political hot points like border control, inflation, transgender athletes and crime. Trump then attempted to contrast the perceived failures of the former administration with the success of his own. This was a recurring tactic throughout the roughly 19-minute speech.\n\t\n\n\t“Our country was laughed at from all over the world, but they’re not laughing anymore,” Trump said. “Over the past 11 months, we have brought more positive change to Washington than any administration in American history. There has never been anything like it, and I think most would agree.”\n\n\n\tDespite Trump’s claims about widespread enthusiasm for his second term, he currently sits at a 39% approval rating, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. The most contentious issues for Trump are the economy, which he ran strongly on in the 2024 election, and healthcare, which has remained a sticking point for lawmakers as premiums for millions of Americans threaten to spike if the subsidies from the Affordable Care Act are allowed to expire.\n\n\tTrump promised that positive change is coming to Americans’ “wallets and bank accounts in the New Year.” He said much of the coming economic growth is thanks to “tariffs, his “favorite word.” In the last legs of his speech, he claimed, “Inflation has stopped, wages are up, prices are down.”\n\t\n\n\tInflation is currently around 3%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While lower than peaks during the Biden era, inflation is higher than the tail end of 2024. Trump reassured Americans that “prices on electricity and everything else will fall dramatically.”\n\n\tOn the topic of insurance, Trump pushed all the blame on the Left. He claimed that Democrats are “controlled by the health care companies” and have “demanded” increases in premiums. On the contrary, Democrats have been trying for months to renew the Affordable Care Act subsidies and stop premiums from rising.\n\n\tTrump was light on actual news, outside of a promise to give 1,450,000 military service members a “warrior dividend” of $1,776 in honor of America’s founding year. The president said these will be granted before Christmas.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNick Reiner has long been open about his struggles with drug abuse and mental health. But legal experts say it would still be very difficult for his defense lawyers to argue that he is not responsible for the deaths of his parents.\n\n\tReiner, 32, has been charged with two counts of murder after allegedly killing his parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, at their Brentwood home on Sunday. His mental state seems likely to be a major theme of the case.\n\t\n\n\t“When these kinds of things happen, there’s almost inevitably a mental health issue at the forefront,” said defense attorney Michael Artan.\n\n\n\tBut drug abuse alone is not enough to make a claim of insanity. Reiner’s lawyers would have to show he suffered from a separate psychiatric disorder that prevented him from telling right from wrong.\n\n\t“The law doesn’t want to excuse drug-induced criminal conduct,” said Dmitry Gorin, a criminal defense lawyer who has worked on insanity cases. Gorin said that an insanity plea is “an uphill battle for most defendants.”\n\n\t“In my experience, jurors come in prejudiced against the defendant,” he said. “They believe the insanity defense is used as an excuse. It’s rarely used successfully.”\n\n\tReiner made a brief appearance in court on Wednesday, agreeing to postpone his arraignment to Jan. 7. Outside court, his defense attorney Alan Jackson declined to comment on his client’s mental health.\n\n\tReiner was initially expected to go before a judge on Tuesday, but was not medically cleared to be transported from the jail. Defense lawyer Mark Geragos said he took that as a sign that Jackson may argue that his client is not competent to stand trial — a separate issue from an insanity plea.\n\t\n\n\t“To me that’s a red flag that it’s a competency issue,” Geragos said, noting that issue often arises in parricide cases.\n\n\tTo make that argument, Reiner’s lawyers would have to show that he does not understand the proceedings and is incapable of participating in his defense. He would then be sent for treatment at a state facility until he is well enough to be tried.\n\n\tAn insanity defense, by contrast, pertains to the defendant’s mental state at the time of the crime. It would be raised during an insanity phase of the trial. If successful, Reiner would be sent to a psychiatric institution instead of prison.\n\n\t“The defense of insanity is actually really tough to win,” said Laurie Levenson, a professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School. “It depends on what experts have to say. Does he have a mental disease or defect? Is it such that he didn’t know what he was doing or he didn’t know it was wrong?”\n\n\tDrug use would only be helpful to the defense if it had done permanent and verifiable brain damage, Levenson said. A drug-induced episode would not qualify.\n\n\tNick Reiner discussed his drug addiction several times on podcasts and in interviews during promotion of “Being Charlie,” the 2015 film he co-wrote about his experiences. On the Dopey Podcast in 2018, he described destroying his parents’ guest house while high on cocaine and other drugs.\n\n\t“Everything in the guest house got wrecked,” he said, saying he went “crazy” after his parents told him to leave.\n\n\tOn a 2016 podcast hosted by recovery writer Anna David, he said he been in 18 rehabs between the ages of 15 and 19. He said that at one facility, he threw a rock through a window in an effort to prove he needed medication.\n\n\t“I was insane,” he said. “And I said, ‘I’m insane.’ And they said, ‘No, you’re not.’ I was like, ‘Well, they’re not taking my word for it. I might as well demonstrate what crazy is.'”\n\n\tThe defense team will likely comb through Reiner’s treatment records for evidence of delusional behavior or psychotic episodes.\n\n\t“Often drug-addicted people are mentally challenged before they start taking drugs,” said attorney Stuart Goldfarb, who represented the porn star Ron Jeremy. “There’s going to be an enormous amount of discovery of his medical history before the defense attorneys decide exactly which way they’re going to go.”\n\t\n\n\tReiner’s mental health could also come up early in the proceedings if his lawyers seek bail. They could ask that he be ordered to a psychiatric facility, where he would get better care than he would in county jail.\n\n\tEven if Reiner’s defense team does not pursue an insanity defense, his mental health could be used to argue for conviction on a lesser offense, like second-degree murder or manslaughter.\n\n\t“We don’t know if he was thinking clearly enough to be guilty of the intent you need for first-degree murder,” Levenson said.\n",

    "description": "\n\tPam Bondi, Trump’s U.S. Attorney General, may have conflicts of interest in overseeing a review of a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery — and she shoul",
    "body": "\n\tPam Bondi, Trump’s U.S. Attorney General, may have conflicts of interest in overseeing a review of a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery — and she should recuse herself from a review of any such transaction, two prominent Democratic senators said. \n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery has entered into an $83 billion agreement with Netflix, which would acquire Warner Bros.’ studios and HBO Max. David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance has mounted a hostile takeover bid, with what it claims are deal terms more favorable to shareholders. On Wednesday, WBD rejected Paramount’s $30/share bid as “inferior” to the Netflix deal and recommended that shareholders reject the Paramount offer. Paramount is sticking with its offer in appealing directly to WBD shareholders.\n\t\n\n\tAs the future of WBD’s assets hang in the balance, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called for Bondi to recuse herself from the DOJ’s review of any deal involving WBD because of “potential conflicts of interest related to her former employer, lobbying firm Ballard Partners.” Prior to Trump appointing her attorney general, Bondi spent six years as a lobbyist at Ballard Partners, “a favorite firm among companies with business before the Trump administration.” Since Bondi’s nomination as attorney general, Ballard has taken on both Netflix and Paramount Skydance as clients. According to the senators, Ballard was reportedly involved in the Paramount-Skydance merger earlier this year.\n\n\n\t“In line with our anti-corruption oversight and legislative priorities, and given the cloud of corruption surrounding this merger and your former employer Ballard’s potential role in this merger, we ask that you recuse yourself from the review of this purchase,” Warren and Blumenthal wrote in a Sept. 17 letter send to Bondi. The full text of the letter is at this link.\n\t\n\n\tA DOJ rep declined to comment.\n\n\tAccording to the senators, the DOJ has “indicated that Bondi will lead the Trump administration’s review of the merger, alongside DOJ Antitrust head Gail Slater.”\n\n\tThe two Democratic senators alleged that “Ballard is already enmeshed in the cloud of corruption surrounding the White House.” They claim that reports “revealed that Ballard lobbyists were instrumental in connecting their corporate clients with fundraisers for President Donald Trump’s ballroom, and nearly half of the corporations known to be funding the ballroom — 11 out of 26 publicly reported corporate donors — are Ballard’s clients.”\n\n\tIn addition, Warren and Blumenthal alleged, Ballard’s involvement has previously raised “questions of improper influence in DOJ deal reviews.” In July, the Justice Department dropped its challenge to the $570 million merger between American Express Global Business Travel and CWT Holdings “after Amex GBT paid Ballard Partners to lobby the DOJ on antitrust matters,” according to the senators.\n\n\tBondi signed an ethics agreement pledging not to participate “in any particular matter involving specific parties” in which she knows Ballard Partners “is a party or represents a party” for one year after confirmation, until Feb. 4, 2026. But after the February deadline, “Bondi’s involvement in the Netflix-Paramount matter would raise the appearance of serious impropriety and threaten to violate her obligations as a public servant,” according to Warren and Blumenthal.\n\n\t“DOJ must guarantee that any review of a potential Warner Bros. transaction is decided based upon the law, not perverted by political favoritism and cronyism — particularly given the stakes of this case for consumers. Regardless of which of these two giant media conglomerates wins the bid for Warner Bros., a takeover will further consolidate the media market — risking higher prices and less variety for consumers,” the senators wrote in the letter.\n\n\tPresident Donald Trump last week said he would be “involved” in a review of a Warner Bros. deal. He also opined that CNN should be sold as part of any deal for WBD because “I don’t think the people that are running that company right now and running CNN, which is a very dishonest group of people, I don’t think that should be allowed to continue,” Trump said. “I think CNN should be sold along with everything else.” Those comments “[raise] the specter of the President leveraging a possible merger to censor a prominent news network that he has openly criticized,” according to the two senators.\n",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          According to court documents, obtained by TMZ, John had his first felony appearance before the judge in Utah on Wednesday after he allegedly harassed Britani.\n      \n    \n          Prosecutors say he's been harassing his ex ever since the protective order was put in place in 2023 -- staring at her from the distance allowed under the order, re-routing her mail, and even going as far as tampering with her electrical box at her home to interrupt her power.\n      \n\n          Fans will know Britani as the quirky housewife who is currently in an on-again-off-again relationship with Donny Osmond's nephew, Jared Osmond. John is Britani's second ex-husband, but she divorced him in 2023. Her first husband was J. Michael Bateman. It's not clear when Britani and J. Michael split.\n      \n    \n          The new legal documents also state John essentially doxed Britani earlier this month by posting her cell phone number on TikTok with the comment, \"There ya go. Give her a call.\"\n      \n    \n          According to the papers, Britani received \"unpleasant\" text messages from strangers as a result and even had \"unknown people coming to her house.\"\n      \n    \n          The docs explain that part of the protective order restricts John from all direct or indirect contact or communication with Britani, which prosecutors say he violated by posting comments on her social media posts.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Britani's reps for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Real Housewives\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tThe highly-anticipated sequel to Searchlight’s 2019 horror-comedy flick “Ready or Not” will be here sooner than expected. Walt Disney Studios will now release “Ready or Not: Here I Come” on March 20, , a week before its original release date of March 27.\n\n\tThe upcoming film stars Samara Weaving, reprising her role as Grace MacCaullay, along with Kathryn Newton, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Shawn Hatosy, Néstor Carbonell, Kevin Durand, Olivia Cheng, Nadeem Umar-Khitab, David Cronenberg, and Elijah Wood.\n\t\n\n\tThe original movie followed MacCaullay as a young bride hunted by her spouse’s wealthy family on her wedding night as part of a Devil-worshipping ritual. The sequel is set immediately after her fight for survival, with the film’s official logline reading, “Moments after surviving an all-out attack from the Le Domas family, Grace discovers she’s reached the next level of the nightmarish game — and this time with her estranged sister Faith (Newton) at her side. Grace has one chance to survive, keep her sister alive, and claim the High Seat of the Council that controls the world. Four rival families are hunting her for the throne, and whoever wins rules it all.”\n\n\n\t“Ready or Not 2: Here I Come” is directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett and written by Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy. Tripp Vinson, James Vanderbilt, William Sherak, and Bradley J. Fischer serve as producers. \n\n\t“Ready or Not,” which also starred Adam Brody, Andie MacDowell, and Henry Czerny, cost $6 million to make and earned $28 million domestically, becoming Searchlight’s biggest release of 2019. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tMonday, January 26\t\n\n\tAmelia Dimoldenberg Returns as Oscars Social Media Ambassador for Third Year\n\n\tBritish comedian and “Chicken Shop Date” creator Amelia Dimoldenberg will serve as the Academy’s social media ambassador and red carpet correspondent for the 98th Oscars, marking her third consecutive year in the role.\n\n\tDimoldenberg will participate in multiple awards season events and conduct interviews with nominees and talent on the Oscars red carpet. The ceremony will air live March 15 at 7 p.m. ET on ABC and Hulu, with red carpet coverage beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\n\t“We are delighted to welcome Amelia back as our social media ambassador and red carpet correspondent, offering viewers worldwide an exclusive glimpse into the Oscars,” said Academy Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Jennifer Davidson. “Amelia’s vibrant personality and engaging interviews continue to resonate with audiences.”\n\n\tDimoldenberg rose to prominence with her YouTube series “Chicken Shop Date,” which she created in 2014. The show features interviews with actors, musicians, athletes and pop culture figures conducted in casual chicken shop settings. Her YouTube channel has amassed 3.3 million subscribers and 981 million views, with a combined following of 16 million across all platforms.\n",

Her considered approach, coupled with her deep understanding of how artists and fans connect across platforms and how AI can amplify music experience, makes her uniquely equipped to drive BMG’s next chapter forward.”\n\n\tPrior to joining BMG in 2024, Joshua served as Executive Vice President of Commercial Innovation & Artist Strategy at Universal Music Group, where she worked across the company’s global recorded music business to develop artist experiences, brand extensions, and new commercial pathways.\n\n\t+ Primary Wave Music, in conjunction with South American partner Nas Nuvens Music Group, has announced a partnership with the legendary Brazilian composer, singer and guitarist Gilberto Gil.\n\n\tTerms of the deal will see Primary Wave and Nas Nuvens work alongside Gil on his celebrated catalog of music.

This deal is a joint venture with Norwegian producer Peder Losnegård, better known as Lido. \n\t\n\n\tAt the age of just 23, Arvid executive-produced PinkPantheress’ critically revered “Fancy That” album, which landed him two 2026 Grammy nominations. He has also worked extensively with Jack Harlow and others.\n\n\t“Aksel is a special young talent with a creative vision that feels like it blends the spirit of the old school with the techniques of the new. We couldn’t be more excited to partner with Concord to help foster his vision,” says Jonathan Tanners, Manager at Blood Company.\n\n\tJeremy Yohai, SVP A&R at Concord Music Publishing added, “Aksel is an amazing talent that possesses an extraordinary work ethic and distinct point of view. We are thrilled to be working with him alongside Lido.”\n\n\t+ Capitol Music Group has announced the promotion of Walter Thomas to Executive Vice President, Motown Gospel / Tamla. In his expanded role, Thomas will oversee the creative, marketing, and strategic direction for Motown Gospel and Tamla, strengthening partnerships and continuing to champion world-class talent across Gospel, Christian, R&B, and positive music, according to the announcement.\n\n\t“Walter is an exceptional leader with a strong work ethic and clear vision. Working alongside him over the past few years, I’ve seen firsthand his passion for artist development and the role faith plays in his leadership. Motown Gospel and TAMLA are entering a new era of growth and impact under his leadership,” said Brad O’Donnell, president of Capitol Christian Music Group.\n\n\t+ Pulse Music Group has announced the promotion of Saul Fitton to senior VP/ head of creative, U.K. His responsibilities will include signing, developing, and implementing creative strategy for the company’s roster of songwriters and producers.

Smith. \n\n\tScott Cutler, Josh Abraham, and Ashley Calhoun commented: “Saul has a proven track record of discovering, signing, and developing internationally successful songwriting, production, and artistic talent. What truly sets him apart is his ability to create innovative opportunities and to stand up for the commercial and artistic needs of his writers. We know that our writers will benefit from his exceptional dedication to their careers.”\n\t\n\n\t+ Secretly Distribution has announced a worldwide distribution deal with Ipecac Recordings, “the independent record label that has been making people sick since 1999,” as the announcement puts it. Founded by musician Mike Patton — vocalist with Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Fantômas, Tomahawk and more — and artist/label manager Greg Werckman (of Alternative Tentacles and Mercury Records and Pick-A-Winner Management), Ipecac has released music across rock, country, hip-hop, electronic, comedy, classical, soundtracks and more.\n\n\t“One needs to evaluate constantly with the ever-shifting music industry landscape. Where do we fit? Who understands us? Who are our people? Partnering with Secretly at this time makes perfect sense,” says Werckman. “From the people that work at Secretly to the eclectic collection of labels and artists they work with, it feels like joining a commune of like-minded, fairly well groomed, independent music lovers. We are honored to be asked to join the ‘club’ and look forward to much more shared mayhem.”\n\n\t“Take a look at the Ipecac roster and you’ll see a rundown of artists who have consistently pushed at boundaries, challenged preconceptions, thrown curveballs and made us all wince, gasp, laugh and, frankly, rock in various measures,” adds Tom Davies, Director of Global Marketing & Campaigns at Secretly Distribution. “It’s been a pleasure to listen to their output for 25 years, and everyone at Secretly Distribution is beyond excited to get to work with a label whose commitment to supporting groundbreaking music matches our own. We are thrilled to collaborate with Greg, Marc and Mike to support their amazing catalog and new releases.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLondon’s National Theatre has unveiled a packed 2026 program featuring a constellation of international stars including Cate Blanchett, Sandra Oh, Lesley Manville, Letitia Wright, and Nina Hoss, as the venerable institution expands its reach across U.K. and global stages.\n\n\tThe slate represents the vision of co-chief executives Indhu Rubasingham and Kate Varah to bring global talent to both reimagined classics and ambitious new work while extending the theater’s footprint through tours, Broadway transfers, and digital distribution.\n\t\n\n\tTwo-time Oscar winner Blanchett reunites with “Tár” co-star Hoss and rising talent Ella Lily Hyland in Benedict Andrews’ “Electra/Persona,” fusing Sophocles’ ancient myth with Ingmar Bergman’s 1966 film. The production features music by Oscar-winning composer Hildur Guðnadóttir and examines how grief transforms identity. It plays the Lyttelton in autumn 2026.\n\n\n\tOh makes her National Theatre debut alongside Paul Chahidi and Abigail Cruttenden in Martin Crimp’s contemporary adaptation of Molière’s “The Misanthrope,” directed by Rubasingham. The production reimagines the titular character as Alice, a novelist who despises hollow contemporary mantras and faces backlash for speaking her mind. The show runs June 16-Aug. 1 in the Lyttelton Theatre.\n\n\tWright makes her National Theatre bow in Tracey Scott Wilson’s newsroom thriller “The Story,” directed by associate artist Clint Dyer. The British premiere also stars Aliyah Odoffin, Wilf Scolding, Ashley Thomas, and Lorraine Toussaint, examining an ambitious Black reporter who defies her editor to pursue an incendiary lead. Performances run Aug. 27-Oct. 24 on the Olivier stage.\n\t\n\n\tManville joins Monica Barbaro, Gabrielle Drake and Aidan Turner in Marianne Elliott’s revival of Christopher Hampton’s “Les Liaisons Dangereuses,” returning to the National Theatre after nine years. The production marks the first staging of Hampton’s acclaimed adaptation of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’ epistolary novel at the National Theatre. It plays the Lyttelton March 21-June 6.\n\n\tThe global phenomenon “War Horse,” based on Michael Morpurgo’s novel and adapted by Nick Stafford, returns to its original Olivier Theatre home ahead of its 20th anniversary in 2027. The production, featuring ground-breaking puppetry by South Africa’s Handspring Puppet Company, has been seen by over 8.8 million people worldwide and won more than 25 major awards including the Tony for best play. It runs May 16-July 30.\n\n\tThe season opens with Terence Rattigan’s “Man and Boy,” directed by Anthony Lau in his National Theatre debut, starring Ben Daniels and Laurie Kynaston. The drama about power, deception, and the complex bond between father and son is set in 1930s New York as international financier Gregor Antonescu’s empire faces collapse. It plays the Dorfman Jan. 30-March 14 and will be released on National Theatre at Home.\n\n\tWinsome Pinnock reunites with director Miranda Cromwell for “The Authenticator,” a gothic psychological thriller starring Rakie Ayola, Sylvestra Le Touzel, and Cherelle Skeete. After inheriting her family’s stately home, eccentric artist Fenella Harford discovers hidden diaries and enlists two academics to uncover dark secrets at Harford Hall. It runs in the Dorfman March 26-May 9 and will also stream on National Theatre at Home.\n\n\tProducers P&P Productions bring “Pride,” a new musical based on the award-winning film, reuniting director Matthew Warchus and writer Stephen Beresford. The show tells the inspiring true story of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners during the 1984 miners’ strike, with original music by Christopher Nightingale, Josh Cohen, and DJ Walde. The cast includes Samuel Barnett, Matthew Durkan, Gillian Elisa, and Caroline Sheen. Following previews at Sherman Theatre in Cardiff March 31-April 18, it plays the Dorfman June 11-Sept. 12.\n\n\tPortuguese playwright and Avignon Festival director Tiago Rodrigues brings his critically acclaimed “Catarina and the Beauty of Killing Fascists” to the Dorfman for a limited one-week run in September, performed in Portuguese with English surtitles.\n\t\n\n\tMulti-award-winning playwright Caryl Churchill returns to the National Theatre for the first time since 2019 with her landmark play “Cloud 9,” exploring sexual politics, colonialism, and gender roles. Dominic Cooke reunites with Churchill to direct the production in the Lyttelton in autumn/winter 2026.\n\n\tFrancesca Mills stars in a new production of Jim Cartwright’s “The Rise and Fall of Little Voice,” directed by Robert Hastie, marking the start of a new commitment to tour work directly following mainstage runs. The production plays the Dorfman Theatre in December 2026 before embarking on a nationwide tour.\n\n\tBritish playwright Helen Edmundson returns with “Some Woman,” her first original play since “Queen Anne” in 2015. The production will play the Dorfman later in 2026.\n\n\tCarmen Nasr makes her National Theatre debut with “Samira,” directed by Emily Burns. Set at the height of the Arab Spring in 2011, the play examines a Middle Eastern Studies department in London thrown into crisis when a young Syrian blogger vanishes without a trace. The show, inspired by true events, begins rehearsals in late 2026 in the Dorfman.\n\n\tAs the National Theatre prepares to celebrate 60 years of Broadway activity in 2027, two productions transfer to New York in 2026: Hastie’s “Hamlet,” starring Hiran Abeysekera, plays Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Harvey Theatre April 19-May 17, while Alexander Zeldin’s critically acclaimed “The Other Place” runs at The Shed Jan. 30-March 1. Both transfers launch multi-year partnerships with the New York venues.\n\n\tRosamund Pike reprises her critically acclaimed role in the West End transfer of “Inter Alia,” written by Suzie Miller and directed by Justin Martin. The co-production with Playful Productions runs at Wyndham’s Theatre March 19-June 20 following a sold-out run at the National Theatre.\n\n\tThe 2026 season also includes Robert Hastie’s staging of Nina Raine and Moses Raine’s new version of Maxim Gorky’s “Summerfolk” (Olivier, March 6-April 29) and Anupama Chandrasekhar’s new adaptation of “The Jungle Book” as the winter festive offering, directed by Rubasingham with puppetry by Finn Caldwell and Nick Barnes.\n\n\tThe National Theatre is expanding its digital footprint with an ambition for every production to have a life beyond its stages through streaming platform National Theatre at Home or cinema releases via National Theatre Live.\n\t\n\n\tIn a continued push to reach every child in the U.K. before they leave school, the 2025 production of “Bacchae” is being adapted by Nima Taleghani to tour school halls across England for nine weeks this autumn, directed by Hannah Hauer-King. The tour will reach over 10,000 students in secondary schools and colleges.\n\n\tThe Connections Festival will take place at the Lowry in Salford June 25-28, while the New Views Festival returns to the National Theatre July 2-3, platforming new writing from students across the U.K.\n\n\t“I can’t wait to dive into this year with an extraordinary group of emerging and world-renowned artists coming to the National Theatre, many for the first time,” Rubasingham said in a statement. “It’s a privilege to stage work that theatrically explodes, surprises and challenges us to see the world anew.”\n\n\tVarah added: “Our 2026 season is about sharing stories locally, nationally and globally. In this way, along with our growing digital footprint, we are opening doors in the U.K. and around the world like never before.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKristen Stewart revealed in a recent interview with The Times of London that she will “probably not” stay in the U.S., explaining: “Reality is breaking completely under Trump. But we should take a page out of his book and create the reality we want to live in.”\n\n\tWhen asked if she will be in the U.S. as Trump continues to lead, the Oscar nominee responded: “Probably not. I can’t work freely there. But I don’t want to give up completely. I’d like to make movies in Europe and then shove them down the throat of the American people.”\n\t\n\n\tMany celebrities have left the U.S. amid Trump’s second presidency, including Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O’Donnell. While Oscar-winning James Cameron originally moved to New Zealand to work on his “Avatar” film franchise, he recently made headlines for saying he will not likely return to America.\n\n\n\t“After the pandemic hit… [New Zealand] had eliminated the virus completely,” Cameron said on a recent episode of “In Depth with Graham Bensinger” podcast about his reason for getting out of the U.S. “They actually eliminated the virus twice. The third time when it showed up in a mutated form, it broke through. But fortunately, they already had a 98% vaccination rate. This is why I love New Zealand. People there are, for the most part, sane as opposed to the United States where you had a 62% vaccination rate, and that’s going down – going the wrong direction.”\n\n\t“Where would you rather live?” Cameron continued. “A place that actually believes in science and is sane and where people can work together cohesively to a common goal, or a place where everybody’s at each other’s throats, extremely polarized, turning its back on science and basically would be in utter disarray if another pandemic appears… I’m not there for scenery, I’m there for the sanity.”\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety earlier this year, O’Donnell said she currently has no plans to move back to the United States. She explained: “With the current political climate, when would it be safe to come back with my child? I’m not going to push it before this administration is completely finished, and hopefully held accountable for their crimes.”\n\n\tAs for Stewart, she has a history with Trump after he infamously tweeted about her personal life in 2012. Trump encouraged Stewart’s then-boyfriend, Robert Pattinson, to dump her. Stewart reflected on Trump’s messages a few years later during an interview with Variety.\n\n\t“He was mad at me a couple years ago, really obsessed with me a couple years ago, which is fucking crazy,” Stewart said at the time. “I can’t even understand it. I literally cannot even understand it. It’s such far-out concept that I don’t want to believe that actually is happening. It’s insane.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“American Doctor” starts strongly with an emotional argument between filmmaker and protagonist. The latter pushes for showing the bodies of dead Palestinian children on screen, to convey the enormity of the carnage in the war on Gaza. The filmmaker wants to “preserve their dignity” by pixelating the photos. The protagonist wins, and the audience sees the images as they are. \n\n\tThus does this documentary set out its moral purpose. The narrative captures the experiences of doctors trying to save lives during wartime, while ensuring they tell the world the truth about what they are witnessing. The arguments about what to show and not show, and who gets to tell which story, are what distinguish “American Doctor” beyond documenting its protagonists’ trips to Gaza.\n\t\n\n\tPremiering in the U.S. Documentary competition at Sundance, the film follows three American doctors different in temperament, experience, age and background. There is Palestinian American Thaer Ahmad, born and living in the U.S., who feels a huge responsibility to help the people of his ancestral homeland. Yet he understands that his background is both an asset and handicap as he navigates American media and political halls. \n\n\n\tOn the other hand, Jewish doctor Mark Perlmutter is the one who bluntly calls the war “a genocide” and emotionally advocates for his Palestinian patients. In the middle is Feroze Sidwa, neither Jewish nor Muslim but Zoroastrian, who’s pragmatic and honest but measured in his descriptions of what’s happening in Gaza. \n\n\tBeyond following these three through trauma and operating rooms, filmmaker Poh Si Teng captures their many media interviews, conversations with family back home in America, and their calls for an end to the bombing of hospitals and the targeting of medical practitioners. \n\t\n\n\tThe story takes place in two different times and two visits for the doctors into Gaza, before and after the ceasefire. It captures their interplay with patients and Palestinian colleagues, as well as with each other. In the case of Ahmad, the film shows how much harder it is for him to get to Gaza in the first place: Unlike his colleagues who are not of Palestinian origin, he requires many more Israeli security approvals. The difference in how the Israel’s government treats three American doctors supposedly equal in nationality and credentials becomes abundantly clear. \n\n\t“American Doctor’s” thesis is sharpest when depicting Perlmutter. The film shows him to be the only one of the three who talks without thinking of consequences, who shows anger and defiance constantly, who accuses Israel of genocide and the United States of complicity. By documenting not just his actions but showing the privilege his race, religion and background afford him in comparison to his colleagues, the film reveals the inherent inequality in whose stories get told, and who’s allowed to be angry, indignant and morally correct.  \n\n\tNot that Teng doesn’t show the suffering of the Palestinian people who live there and are not just visitors. In the film’s most moving scene, Palestinian anesthesiologist Abd describes being torn between his responsibilities to his patients and his care for his own children. It’s a devastating story, made more so by the camera’s steady gaze at Abd’s face as he tells it. It’s a scene that some might say “humanizes” this war. Yet by including it amidst all the other questions the film raises, Teng seems to be asking why Palestinians still need to be humanized more than two years into this conflict. \n\n\tWorking with cinematographers Ibrahim Al Otla and Christopher Renteria, Teng is alert to the interplay between the protagonists. The camera knows when to linger and when to cut away when showing the carnage and loss of life. Once the filmmakers commit, they never flinch, and “American Doctor” exposes the devastation and the toll of this conflict on people, particularly children. Most importantly, it offers testimony from three witnesses on how hospitals and medical practitioners are deliberately targeted. It is a necessary watch because it dares its audience not to look away, forcing the question not only of whose story is told, but whose deaths matter and make headlines.\n",

    "description": "\n\tTennis icon and legend Billie Jean King has had documentaries, articles and even a movie, “Battle of the Sexes,” tell her story.\n\n\t“Give Me the Ball",
    "body": "\n\tTennis icon and legend Billie Jean King has had documentaries, articles and even a movie, “Battle of the Sexes,” tell her story.\n\n\t“Give Me the Ball,” which premieres Monday at the Sundance Film Festival, might be the quintessential Billie Jean King documentary to date.\n\n\tDirectors Liz Garbus and Elizabeth Wolff tell King’s struggles and victories through candid interviews and archival footage, celebrating King, who fought to make an impact and change not just tennis, but culture.\n\t\n\n\tAhead of its Sundance premiere, King, Garbus and Wolff sat down to talk about getting unlimited access to deliver the ultimate Billie Jean King story.\n\n\n\tThe documentary is an ESPN 30 for 30 doc with a premiere date set to be announced later this year. “Give Me the Ball” is by Ridley Scott Associates and Story Syndicate, in association with Elton John’s Rocket Sports.\n\t\n\t\tBillie, through various ways, your story has been told many times, but “Give Me the Ball” is incredibly honest and raw. What made you say yes when Liz and Elizabeth approached you?\t\n\n\tBillie Jean King: I’ve never had a proper documentary. I thought, “I’ll be gone soon, and this way people can see me, hear me in my own voice,” which I think was really important. Elizabeth thought we should start and have the center of it be 1973 and then go backwards or forwards, or whatever we wanted to do from there. And so it worked out really well. They’re the right ones to do it.\n\t\n\t\tLiz, I know you love tennis, so what was it that made you want to tell the Billie Jean King story?\t\n\n\tLiz Garbus: When we think about storytelling, you’re always looking for something that speaks to our moment. There has to be a why? Why are you making this film now? To think about Billie, who as a human being, her career, the generational change that her career spans and where we are today as a nation and a culture, that kind of work and spirit is what this time is calling for. Telling Billie’s story of a selfless warrior who put everything on the line for her community is an incredible story. Whatever community you are lifting up, you do it, and you do it all in, and that’s what Billie did.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tElizabeth, Billie touched on it, but can you talk about the frame you had in mind, given her career?\t\n\n\tElizabeth Wolff: I knew about Billie’s story, but I knew about it from the lens of having studied the women’s movement, and I knew a little bit about the “Battle of the Sexes.” The first thing I did was I bought “All In,” Billie’s memoir, and read it. As filmmakers, to be able to have somebody do the work and write a memoir, and then be able to use that as a guide for how we want to approach the storytelling, it’s the best research tool. The thing that struck me, both in reading the book and also in just getting to know Billie, was that this lesson that you can change the world by changing your world.\n\n\tThere was also just so much archive of Billie, especially in the late ‘60s and ‘70s.\n\n\tWe thought of 1973, and Billie has won so many titles, and is about to go into the Battle of the Sexes. It is the apex of the women’s movement. There is so much coming together. When you do a little research, you realize she’s on every TV show and in every newspaper. And so it just seemed like that this is the moment.\n\n\tWhen you spend time with Billie, you feel like you are in the presence of the best life coach there is.\n\n\tAfter that first meeting, I remember saying to Liz, “We people need to feel that.” So that was a motivating factor for how we also decided to frame Billie as her main interview, talking to the viewer, so that you could really feel through her story these life lessons.\n\t\n\t\tHow are you finding that balance of “we want you to feel Billie,” but we also need to tell this incredible story of one woman’s fight for equality and change?\t\n\n\tKing: Liz is the one that would come in and ask the questions. She kept asking me good questions. There are a lot of vulnerabilities in there. What do you say? How do you be accurate? How do you reach people? How can you touch their hearts and minds? How can you help them? That’s always been important to me since I was a kid.\n\n\tGarbus: I think that one of the things that made Billie as successful as she was in creating social change, changing her sport, and affecting so many others and society at large is that she is relentlessly optimistic and she moves forward. She is a fighter. She puts one foot in front of another, and it’s that spirit that has made her this incredible warrior. It’s also was a challenge as filmmakers to ask her to stop and think about how did it feel? Billie had to suppress all kinds of inner turmoil because the entire tour was riding on her shoulders. She couldn’t slip; she couldn’t be human. The reason sometimes we would ask her the same question and push was because it’s in Billie’s nature. I think now, having spent time with her, to move forward, focus on the positive, and we know that that came at a personal cost. So it was asking Billie to pause into those moments of what that weight felt like. But it’s exactly Billie’s forward motion, drive and optimism that made her so incredibly powerful and effective.\n\t\n\n\tKing: It’s important to know history. It’s important to know the history of women’s sports. No one really knows about women and women’s sports. There’s a reason these things happened. It was because of Title IX. It was because of what happened in history. And it doesn’t happen overnight. I think sometimes people don’t stop and think about these things. I think they need to understand it’s been a long, hard road. What about the generations before me? I don’t know how they did it, but it took all these different generations for these players to have the dream. A lot of what my generation did was to tee things up, and we had all these dreams, but we knew we weren’t going to be able to do it, but we wanted the future generations to do it. I want players to understand the business, and I hope this will enlighten and help people.\n\n\tGarbus: I will say that you saw more of the Battle of the Sexes in our doc than you had seen before. Isn’t that right?\n\n\tKing: You found out stuff.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re still telling this verite style. Did you know where it was going to end?\t\n\n\tGarbus: I think we started there was this idea of the 1973 frame. When you start making a film that has as many chapters and as much impact as Billie’s, you need a frame. You also need to be flexible when you get to the edit room. The great joy of documentary filmmaking is throwing all spaghetti at the wall, rearranging it.\n\n\tOne of the things that was so important was to make you feel like you knew Billie.\n\n\tWhen you think about your responsibility as a filmmaker and this piece of American history, or this film will be part of her legacy, it is an enormous responsibility, so we worked incredibly hard to get it right and to also let you feel like you got to know this, this person.\n\n\tWolff: We spent a lot of time with Billie in the edit, and we would find ourselves being like, “Wow, this story is so important.” In the documentary space, a lot of the times there are downer stories, and this was an uplifting story and an optimistic story.\n\n\tWhen we were thinking about the 1973 frame originally, it was like, “Okay, the Battle of the Sexes, then she wins.” But almost immediately, we realized that there were these other pieces that needed to be told. Her personal journey of meeting (her wife) Ilana, coming to terms with herself and her needs and her sexuality, through facing her eating disorder. There’s a lot to tell.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGoing back to what you said, what does it mean to bring Billie’s story to the world?\t\n\n\tGarbus: We need heroes. We need people who have fought the hard fights and who have come through the other side, who have made sacrifice but feel enormous pride in that sacrifice. We need people who are going to put the needs of their community before themselves.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMelissa Gilbert shared a statement Monday through her lifestyle company, Modern Prairie, addressing what she described as an “extraordinarily difficult time” amid her husband Timothy Busfield’s child sex abuse charges.\n\n\t“I’m sending you all my love and gratitude during this extraordinarily difficult time. Not only for Tim, me and our family, but in the collective heaviness so many of us seem to be carrying right now. Add an unexpected storm to the mix, and it can all feel like a bit too much,” the “Little House on the Prairie” actor wrote on Instagram. \n\t\n\n\t“This season has reminded me, very clearly, how important it is to slow down, prioritize what truly matters, and allow ourselves moments of rest,” she continued. “Stepping back from the noise, the news, and even our daily responsibilities from time to time gives us space to recharge, reflect, and find our center again.\n\n\n\t“Thank you, truly, for the love, patience, and support you continue to show Tim and me. Thank you for helping me to feel safer, more grounded, and deeply held by this extraordinary community of women here at Modern Prairie. I’ll be easing back into things thoughtfully and with care – moving forward one step at a time. More to come, and so much gratitude always.”\n\n\tBusfield — the actor known for “Thirtysomething,” “The West Wing” and “Field of Dreams” — has been charged with two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. He is accused of groping a 7-year-old boy’s “private areas” while directing episodes of “The Cleaning Lady.” (The boy and his twin brother were actors on the Fox series.) Busfield was released from jail in Albuquerque, N.M., on Jan. 20 and is awaiting trial on these charges.\n\t\n\n\tAt the time of Busfield’s arrest, Gilbert issued a statement through her publicist that read: “Melissa Gilbert is not making public statements at this time. Any purported ‘statements’ circulating online — including AI-generated deepfakes of her ‘breaking her silence’ — should not be treated as coming from her. She is honoring the request of Tim’s lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds. During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.”\n\n",

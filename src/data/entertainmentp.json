    "body": "\n\tIt has always been easy to trivialize Brigitte Bardot. In 1957, starring in the movie that made her a global sensation, “And God Created Woman,” what she did was not widely regarded as accomplished screen acting — or, in a certain way, as acting at all. The movie treated her as a ripe object of erotic fixation, and that’s just what she was called upon to play. She is introduced with shots of her bare feet arched just so, her body lying naked, face down on the ground. “Sex kitten.” “Baby doll.” “Teenage temptress.” At the time, she was branded all those things. Was the movie a sober French drama or soft-core porn? It was marketed as something in between.\n\t\n\n\tYet there was more at stake. And part of it is that Bardot, who died Sunday at 91, made no less a figure than Marilyn Monroe seem a sex symbol from an entirely different era. Monroe, while a huge star, still had one arched foot in the straitlaced past; Bardot was the woman-child of the world to come — the brazen girl who already embodied and anticipated the spirit of the swinging ’60s.  \n\n\n\tIn “And God Created Woman,” she’s frisky, she’s sultry, she’s angry, she’s spectacularly uninhibited, and she signifies a new kind of erotic abandon that is liberated from the old strictures of the femme fatale. Her character, Juliette, is not a gold-digger; she rejects the advances of the rich men who come on to her. She simply does what she wants to do. “All the future does is spoil the present,” she tells a potential new lover. Yet when she learns, a bit later, that his proclamations of love are for the birds — that he doesn’t want a future with her, just a fling ­— the wounded smolder on her face becomes the ripest thing about her. At the climax, doing a dance of abandonment to the music of a hot Caribbean band, you see her literally spinning out of the control of the men around her.\n\t\n\n\tA word about the Bardot pout. It’s sexy as hell, but it’s a pout of steel. It has resolve. Which is why it’s so sexy. There was as much power in that pout as there was in Barbara Stanwyck’s snarl or Rita Hayworth’s come-hither glare. Maybe more. Because it’s as if Bardot had absorbed the temptation vibrations of all the screen goddesses who had come before her and was standing on their shoulders, reaching for something more…real.  \n\n\tTwo years after “And God Created Woman” came out, becoming the top-grossing foreign-language film of all time in the United States, the great French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir wrote of Bardot, “Her clothes are not fetishes, and when she strips she is not unveiling a mystery. She is showing her body, neither more nor less, and that body rarely settles into a state of immobility. She walks, she dances, she moves about. Her eroticism is not magical, but aggressive. In the game of love, she is as much a hunter as she is a prey. The male is an object to her, just as she is to him.”\n\n\tThe title “And God Created Woman” sounds grandiose, but what it meant is: God had now created a new kind of woman. A woman who’s effortlessly confident and coveted, who’s the quintessence (to quote Jim Morrison) of a 20th century fox, and one who will not be the victim of the gazes of the men who surround her. When Juliette, to avoid being sent back to the orphanage she came from, agrees to marry the nice, sweet, dorky Michel (Jean-Louis Trintignant), a priest warns him, “That girl is like an animal. She needs to be tamed.” But actually, there’s no taming what Bardot had: a casual freedom that was there in the way she held her body, and in every glance she gave.\n\n\tIf she was triumphantly brazen in “And God Created Woman,” in Jean-Luc Godard’s “Contempt” (1963) she broke the law of every film ever made about love. In movies, love and romance are the most powerful of religions, and when relationships fall apart it’s for all kinds of reasons. They break down, crack up, go bust. But in “Contempt,” Bardot plays Camille, the wife of a playwright (Michel Piccoli) who’s hired to rewrite the script for a film version of “The Odyssey,” and when the fire goes out of their marriage, it’s not for some tidy dramatic explanation. It’s because…she has decided…that the fire is gone…just because. Because in the newly modern world, where women are no longer under the thumb of men, their feelings might change, and the reasons for that might be…inaccessible to the man left holding the bag of their now-empty union.\n\t\n\n\tThe way Bardot plays this, uttering the word “contempt” (the feeling she now has for her husband) as a wall made of stone, she exudes a tragic matter-of-factness that resides on the other side of cruelty. It is cruel, but not because she’s cruel. It’s that life is cruel. And her beauty, in cinematic terms, is part of the cruelty; it’s part of what she will now withhold. Bardot portrayed all of this, in 1963, with what could be called the consciousness of the new woman. A new awareness of choice, and of how the old rules holding the world together no longer applied.\n\n\tDiscussing “Contempt,” male critics tend to get fixated on the film-industry woes of Piccoli’s screenwriter (a Godard surrogate), and the world-weary travails of the director Fritz Lang (playing himself). But the heart of the movie is the half-hour-long sequence in which Bardot and Piccoli wander around their apartment in Rome, having the kind of fight that sounds less like a movie fight and more like a real fight than almost any scene in movies you could name. The sequence suggests that if Godard hadn’t decided to go the route of being an allusive postmodern brainiac creator of prankster-troll cinematic puzzles-that-never-quite-fit-together, he could have been an extraordinary poet of emotional naturalism. And the coldly beating heart of the film, which is arguably Godard’s greatest, is Brigitte Bardot’s performance.      \n\n\tLooking back and watching Bardot’s movies now, you see hints and echoes of so many of the actresses who would come after her, from Maria Schneider to Nancy Allen to Dominique Sanda to Uma Thurman to Adèle Exarchopoulos to Sydney Sweeney. She was marketed as a pin-up, yet she was a singular presence who forged a path of sensual and spiritual fearlessness. And part of it is that she insisted, just as the Madonna of the ’80s and ’90s did, that for a certain kind of performer (her kind), sexuality was inseparable from artistry. Bardot’s eroticized projection of female identity was itself a transcendent performance. If God created woman, Bardot made you feel like she had created herself. Only time will tell if the future is female. But once she’d made her mark, the future was most definitely Bardot.\n",

This gallery backs up that bold statement by offering an array of amazing movie and movie-related advertisements drawn from Variety’s 120 years of covering entertainment and Hollywood.\nTruly, the pages presented here only scratch the surface of the jewels and historical artifacts in our voluminous archives. This is definitely not an exhaustively researched selection. These are but some of the fantastic finds that we came across while working this year on the 120th anniversary issue, published Dec. 10 in print and online.\nSome of these ads are for long-forgotten obscure titles, some are for classics like “King Kong,” “Casablanca,” “Sunset Boulevard,” “Dr. Strangelove,” “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,” “Chinatown,” “Star Wars,” “Platoon,” “Silence of the Lambs,” “Rushmore,” “The Matrix” and “The Talented Mr. Ripley.” Some are for movies produced far outside of the U.S.; as you’ll see, even the Soviet Union touted its Sovexport Film operation in Variety in the 1960s and ‘70s. Some of the pages presented here simply capture a moment in time.\nWe hope cineastes enjoy this trip through the past century of film as seen through the pages of New York-based Variety, which began publication in December 1905, and Los Angeles-based Daily Variety, which had a proud 80-year run as Hollywood’s hometown paper, published Monday-Friday from 1933 to 2013.\nAnd remember, when you need to know what the O.G. “Star Wars” grossed in its opening weekend in markets like St. Louis, Detroit and “Cincy” – now you know where to find a handy chart.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Wild Party (1929)\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe original “It” girl brought home the box office for Paramount with 1929’s “The Wild Party,” directed by Dorothy Arzner.\nAppropriate for its title, “The Wild Party” was one of the movies that spurred the industry’s adoption of the Hays Code a few years later to tame the debauchery depicted on screen.\nFrom the March 27, 1929, edition of Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKing Kong (1933)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThis ad for 1933’s “King Kong” demonstrates how movie openings were typically platformed region by region.\nFrom the April 4, 1933, edition of Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Kennel Murder Case / Lady Killer (1933)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWarner Bros. found a clever way to tout the high-profile stars in two of its top-tier pictures released in 1933: William Powell in “The Kennel Murder Case” and James Cagney in “Lady Killer.” \nFrom the Nov. 21, 1933, edition of Variety.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJezebel (1938)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t“Jezebel” is one of the reasons Bette Davis is Bette Davis.\nShe earned the second of her two best actress Oscar wins for the film directed by William Wyler.

    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent episode of the “Team Deakins” podcast, Kate Winslet discussed her debut in Peter Jackson’s 1994 drama-thriller “Heavenly Creatures,” which follows the Oscar winner and Melanie Lynskey as two teens who share a dangerously obsessive friendship. When asked how much of herself she brought to the role of Juliet, Winslet shared that her “first intimate experiences” as a teenager were “with girls,” which helped her understand the “really intense connection” at the heart of the film.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ll share something I’ve never shared before. Some of my first intimate experiences as a young teen were actually with girls,” Winslet said. “I’d kissed a few girls, and I’d kissed a few boys, but I wasn’t particularly evolved in either direction.”\n\n\n\tShe added, “At that stage in my life, I certainly was curious, and I think there was something about the really intense connection that those two women had that I profoundly understood. I was so immediately sucked into the vortex of that world they were in that obviously became horrendously damaging to both of them, and they had huge insecurities and vulnerabilities.”\n\n\tWinslet later explained that while she “couldn’t truly understand” the darker elements of the film, she connected with the deep personal connections someone can form when they are young and “vulnerable.”\n\n\t“Heavenly Creatures” was Winslet’s breakout role. She told “Team Deakins” that she “never held a film script” before auditioning for the film. It was also Jackson’s first foray into drama. Before helming “Heavenly Creatures,” his directing credits included horror films like “Bad Taste” and “Dead Alive,” and the dark comedy “Meet the Feebles.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the years after “Heavenly Creatures,” Winslet starred in “Sense and Sensibility,” “Jude” and “Hamlet” before landing “Titanic” in 1997.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” has surpassed $760 million globally after two weekends of release. \n\n\tOver the busy Christmas stretch, James Cameron‘s sci-fi epic collected $181.2 million from 51 overseas markets and $245.2 million globally. Those ticket sales mark a minimal 25% decline from its international opening weekend. So far, the Disney and 20th Century film has grossed $217 million in North America and $542 million at the international box office. Outside of the United States and Canada, top markets are China with $99.6 million, France with $54.4 million, Germany with $43.1 million and Korea with $32.1 million.\n\t\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is already the sixth-highest grossing Hollywood release of the year, and it’ll continue to climb above hits like “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” ($714 million), “Jurassic World: Rebirth ($869 million) and “A Minecraft Movie” ($958 million) in the coming weekends. Soon, “Avatar 3” should become 2025’s third blockbuster to surpass the $1 billion mark, following two other Disney behemoths, May’s “Lilo & Stitch” remake ($1.03 billion) and November’s “Zootopia 2” ($1.3 billion and counting). To underscore Disney’s box office dominance, none of its rival studios has fielded a single billion-dollar film since 2023. \n\n\n\tA key question for box office watchers is where “Avatar: Fire and Ash” will end its theatrical run. The third installment in the otherworldly franchise has a high bar to clear in terms of theatrical expectations because the first two trips to Pandora, 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” stand as two of the biggest movies in history with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. “Avatar 3” doesn’t necessarily need to hit the $2 billion mark to be considered a commercial success, though the mega-budgeted film does need to keep playing in theaters to justify its massive price tag for Disney. That shouldn’t be a problem, since “Avatar” films have become synonymous with box office staying power, meaning the visual spectacles are known to stick around in theaters.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s other juggernaut, “Zootopia 2,” remained a box office force with $67.2 million from 52 overseas territories and $87.9 million globally in its fifth weekend of release. So far, the animated sequel has generated a $321.4 million domestically and a stellar $1.099 billion internationally, bringing its global tally to $1.42 billion.\n\n\tIn other box office milestones, Universal’s big-budget musical “Wicked: For Good” finally crossed the $500 million mark. The film, starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, has earned $172 million overseas and $503.9 million worldwide. “Wicked: For Good” should turn a tidy profit against a $150 million production budget, but the movie has earned far less than its predecessor, 2024’s “Wicked,” with $758 million globally. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet is officially the king of the Christmas box office.\n\n\tIt’s the third consecutive holiday season where the A-list star has dominated at the box office, a reign that began with 2023’s family-friendly musical “Wonka” and continued with 2024’s Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown.” This year’s ping pong adventure, “Marty Supreme,” extended the trend, serving up a stellar $27 million over the four-day frame. And Chalamet’s domination around the merriest of holidays should endure with 2026’s “Dune: Part III,” set for Dec. 18.\n\t\n\n\t“Seemingly every year, Timothée has a major hit during the important holiday moviegoing corridor,” notes Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian. “No matter the genre, whether it’s a musical, biopic, sci-fi or comedy, his choice in the material and collaborators has made him not only a bona fide movie star, but a box-office draw.”\n\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” confirms Chalamet’s status as the kind of actor whose name alone can sell a movie ticket. It’s a rare distinction these days, especially to have a star be synonymous with a season for moviegoing. The most recent example is probably Will Smith, who used to be known as Mr. Fourth of July. Starting with 1996’s “Independence Day,” several of Smith’s biggest blockbusters — 1997’s “Men In Black,” 2002’s “Men In Black II” and 2008’s “Hancock,” among them — were released in theaters around July 4th weekend.\n\n\tWith $17 million over the traditional weekend, “Marty Supreme” debuted at No. 3 in North America behind “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ($64 million) and “Zootopia 2” ($20 million). Those initial ticket sales stand as the second-biggest debut to date for A24 after Alex Garland’s “Civil War” ($25 million over the traditional three-day weekend). “Marty Supreme,” which launched a week earlier in limited release, has generated $28.3 million to date. The movie, which cost $70 million to produce, is expected to remain a box office draw into the new year due to positive reviews (a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes) and great word-of-mouth (a “B+” grade on CinemaScore). Staying power will be important, however, because “Marty Supreme” needs to generate a lot of coinage to justify its price tag, the biggest ever for an A24 film. Josh Safdie directed “Marty Supreme,” a frenetic comedy-of-errors that follows the fictional Marty Mauser as he pursues his dream of becoming a table-tennis champ.\n\t\n\n\t“This was a gutsy, creative risk — a period sports drama — and it’s going to pay off, thanks to Chalamet and great holiday playing time,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research.\n\n\tIn terms of opening weekends, “Marty Supreme” ranks between Chalamet’s other Christmastime releases. “Wonka,” a fantasy musical about a young, aspiring chocolatier, Willy Wonka, opened to $39 million in mid-December and remained a force, eventually earning $218 million domestically and $634 million worldwide. Then “A Complete Unknown,” a drama about the counterculture icon Bob Dylan, bowed to $11.6 million on Christmas Day and, by the end of its run, strung together $75 million in North America and $140 million globally. Those films didn’t have record-breaking debuts, but they all benefited from playing over the lucrative holiday season. This stretch between Christmas and New Year’s is traditionally the busiest week of the year.\n\n\tChalamet, who just turned 30 years old, elevated his profile through blockbusters such as “Dune” and indie favorites such as “Call Me By Your Name,” “Lady Bird” and “Little Women.” The projects that followed were commercial risks, even if they appeared like obvious wins on paper. Although “Wonka” benefitted from brand awareness — it’s a prequel to the beloved “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” — it’s the kind of execution-dependent film that doesn’t work without audiences buying into Chalamet singing and dancing about a world of pure imagination. Ditto “A Complete Unknown,” which, of course, has the advantage of great music from the “Like a Rolling Stone” composer in his earlier years. But name recognition and a passionate fandom aren’t enough to bring audiences to theaters. See: This October’s Jeremy Allen White-led biopic “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” which faltered at the box office after failing to breakout beyond the core fanbase of the Boss.\n\n\tSince “Marty Supreme” is completely original, Chalamet has been relentlessly marketing the film to avoid the fate of too many 2025 indies that collapsed at the box office. He’s captured the attention of the social media masses by gifting his famous friends the viral 1950s-esque windbreaker, flying a Nickelodeon-orange blimp around the country, climbing to the top of the Sphere in Las Vegas and turning the refrain “Marty Supreme. Christmas Day” into a mantra.\n\t\n\n\t“Timothée Chalamet is the ‘it guy’ right now. There’s no denying it,” Exhibitor Relations analyst Jeff Bock told Variety after the film’s limited release. “The promotional work he’s done with this film is high-level genius.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme,” now in theaters, Timothee Chalamet plays an ambitious young man from New York’s Lower East Side convinced that table tennis is the way forward.\n\n\tThe time period is 1952, and Marty is a hustler who works at the family shoe store, pretending not to have a size in stock so he can sell a customer a more expensive pair. On the side, he’s always looking for that next get-rich quick scheme.\n\n\n\tThe film stars Fran Drescher as Marty’s mother, Tyler, the Creator, Odessa A’zion, “Shark Tank” personality Kevin O’Leary and Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\t\n\n\tSafdie spent over six years writing the project. To bring that authenticity to the performance, Safdie didn’t just put Chalamet in prop glasses; he went one step further.\n\n\tSpeaking in front of a packed audience earlier this month at a Hollywood panel, Safdie said, “At the time, we said, we were going to put +10 contact lenses in your eyes, and we’re gonna put -10 prescription lenses in front of them so that when his glasses fall off, he can’t see shit.” When Chalamet tried on that combination, Safdie recalled receiving a call from the actor. “He calls me, and he says, ‘I’ve got the +10s in right now, I’m pretty dizzy.’”\n\n\tAccording to Safdie, Chalamet described it as feeling like “he was in a fishbowl.” But Chalamet was determined. Safdie said Chalamet told him, “I’ll do anything you ask me to do.”\n\n\tProsthetics artist Michael Fontaine applied pockmarks, freckles and nicks to Chalamet’s face. “You felt that with the scars and nicks, he’s been in fights, and he’s from the street,” Safdie said.\n\t\n\n\tThe makeup was so convincing that even co-star Paltrow believed it was real. Paltrow plays faded movie star Kay Stone, who is wooed by Marty. She admitted, “I had no idea.” She went on to say, “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, he’s got little acne scars,’ and was like, ‘I’m so surprised by how you never see that.’”\n\n\tWith Fontaine’s prosthetics and the glasses, and his hair in the 1950s style, Safdie says, “When he had them in, he was Marty.”\n\n\tChalamet also strived for authenticity in his performance and spent years preparing for the role. He took every opportunity to play table tennis because he wanted to appear like a professional player when shooting began. He also trained with table tennis expert Diego Schaaf to help coordinate and choreograph the games.\n\n\tIn the film, Marty faces off against Koto Endo, who is played by real-life table tennis champion Koto Kawaguchi. He loses to him during a tournament in London, then finds himself face-to-face with him during a match in Japan.\n\n\tAsked about playing against Kawaguchi, Chalamet said the pressure was “huge.” But he also needed to get it right and felt “a responsibility to that community and to the aficionados and people that are passionate about that sport.”\n\n\tSafdie added that during filming, Chalamet “would be so in character, he’s like, ‘I want to win the next points. We have to play.'” Kawaguchi was game. “At one point he said to me, it’s like, you know, I’m not an actor, you know, I’m a table tennis player. And you know, I’m doing a lot of acting right now.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron’s sci-fi threequel “Avatar: Fire and Ash” remained comfortably atop the domestic box office over the Christmas stretch. Meanwhile a trio of new holiday releases, A24’s sports dramedy “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical tear-jerker “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s action comedy “Anaconda,” helped keep multiplexes bustling… but they weren’t enough to fend off the Disney animated sequel “Zootopia 2,” which returned to No. 2 in its fifth weekend of release.\n\t\n\n\t“Avatar 3” added a solid $64 million over the traditional weekend and $88 million since the Christmas holiday on Thursday. The three-day figure is a scant 28% decline from its $89 million domestic debut, a stronger hold than its predecessor, 2022’s “The Way of Water,” which dropped by 52% after a larger $134 million debut. So far, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” has generated $217.7 million in North America and $760 million worldwide after two weekends of release. Based on past precedent, “Avatar: Fire and Ash” should stick around at the top of box office charts well into the new year. After all, the first two “Avatar” films were No. 1 for seven consecutive weekends, eventually earning well over $2 billion each.\n\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” enjoyed the best debut among newcomers in third place with $17.4 million from 2,600 theaters over the weekend and $27.1 million through the four-day holiday frame. Domestic ticket sales stand at $28.3 million after a weekend in limited release. The three-day figure marks the second-biggest opening weekend to date for A24, the beloved indie behind “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “Hereditary” and “Lady Bird.” Alex Garland’s “Civil War” remains the studio’s best debut with $25 million over the traditional three-day weekend. \n\t\n\n\tFor “Marty Supreme,” the stellar start can be attributed to director Josh Safdie for making a movie that’s resonating with audiences, as well as star Timothée Chalamet, who plays a fictional tennis table champ and has been a one-man marketing machine, going to great lengths — and heights — to get out the word about the original film. A24 spent roughly $70 million to produce “Marty Supreme,” which is expected to remain a box office draw due to positive reviews and great word-of-mouth. Moviegoers — roughly 65% of whom were 35 or younger — gave the R-rated film a “B+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls. That’s a far better reception than the “C+” grade that was bestowed upon Safdie’s prior film, the deeply unsettling “Uncut Gems.” Staying power will be important, however, because “Marty Supreme” needs to generate a lot of coinage to justify its price tag, the biggest ever for A24. \n\n\t“Sports dramas are not big movies to begin with, but the right cast can elevate them,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. He’s referring to films like “F1: The Movie,” starring Brad Pitt, and “Air,” led by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. “Timothée Chalamet is making that kind of difference.”\n\n\t“Anaconda” landed at No. 5 with $14.6 million over the weekend and $23.7 million since Christmas. The movie also opened internationally with $20 million for a global start of $43.7 million. A $45 million-budgeted meta-reboot, “Anaconda” stars Jack Black and Paul Rudd as best friends who travel to the jungle to pursue their childhood dream of remaking their all-time favorite movie, 1997’s “Anaconda.” The project starts to unravel when life imitates art and a real anaconda begins hunting them down. Critics and audiences were mixed on “Anaconda,” which has a 51% Rotten Tomatoes average and “B” grade on CinemaScore.\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue” opened in eighth place with $7.6 million over the weekend and $12 million through the four-day holiday frame. Craig Brewer directed the $30 million-budgeted movie, featuring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in the true story of two down-on-their luck musicians who form a Neil Diamond tribute band. Opening weekend crowds dug the film, which earned an “A” grade on CinemaScore, the best marks among the new releases. In terms of ticket buyers, 65% were female, while 53% of audiences were above the age of 55.\n\t\n\n\t“This is a crowd-pleaser, and word-of-mouth should build now among older moviegoers, who take their time getting to the cinema,” Gross says.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Disney’s animated juggernaut “Zootopia 2” outpaced the newcomers with $20 million over the weekend and $25.2 million since Christmas on Thursday. Since its debut around Thanksgiving, the PG film has generated $320 million domestically and $1.42 billion globally, making “Zootopia 2” the highest-grossing Hollywood release of the year.\n\n\tAnother holdover, Lionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid,” notched the No. 4 spot with $15.4 million over the weekend and $18.9 million through the four-day holiday period. The film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has earned an impressive $46.6 million domestically and $64.9 million worldwide to date.\n\n\tWith three days left in 2025, the overall domestic box office is sitting at $8.76 billion, just 1.5% ahead of last year and roughly 22% behind 2019, according to Comscore. Annual revenues through Dec. 31 are projected to wind up at $8.87 billion.\n\n\t“‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’ and ‘Zootopia 2’ and the impressive nationwide expansion of ‘Marty Supreme’ helped to power a very strong end of year push,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian.\n\n\tIn the end, though, the elusive $9 billion benchmark remains out of reach for yet another year.\n",

Sure, it ends with a romantic proposal, but was any fan mentally prepared for that first scene? Let’s just say the room service waitress wasn’t the only person who almost ran away screaming! Brace yourself as we walk through this week’s episode.\n\t\n\n\nOh man, it begins with Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) farting and showing an unblurred shot of his, um, lil’ landman? Holy moly!\nWhat a chaotic opening! Tommy didn’t even know he was traumatizing the hotel employee (Ana Ming Bostwick-Singer).\nTommy, could you maybe roll over or cover up more for this conversation? It’s distracting that you’re at full-mast.\n“Don’t you fuck my omelet!” Am I hallucinating this episode?\nThanks for that last shot of a fully erect Tommy.\nOverall, this is a pretty horny episode of “Landman” from the jump!\nRebecca (Kayla Wallace) is so gaga over Charlie (Guy Burnet)! It’s shocking to see her lovey-dovey facial expressions.\n“We’re eating breakfast on the ocean floor.” It’s helpful that he’s a hunk, but Charlie’s monologue about the geology of the area really sings because of Taylor Sheridan’s writing.\n“Wildcatting” seems too stressful as a non-gambler.\nOoh, spotting a metaphor! Just as she’s “wildcatting” finding oil, Rebecca is “wildcatting” by opening up her heart to Charlie!\nSo wait, Tommy did have sex with an omelet to make Angela (Ali Larter) mad? Jeez!\nDamn, who knew that Dale (James Jordan) was such a smooth talker?\nOh, no: Is Boss (Mustafa Speaks) talking about retiring soon foreshadowing that he’s going to die?\nT.L. (Sam Elliott) peeing on a snake? Sure, why not!\nGood advice from T.L. to Tommy over lunch. Tommy is annoyed all the time anyway … why not stop and smell the roses on occasion?\nI’m convinced Angela and Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) are gaslighting Cooper (Jacob Lofland) that he smells, and he actually doesn’t. They say it so often that something strange is at play.\nHow did Nate (Colm Feore) possibly guess that Rebecca and Charlie are hooking up? The name thing is not enough — does he have a miraculous sixth sense?\nNow we’re discussing cock rings? Gah, this episode!\nWas anyone else legitimately scared that T.L. died during the car trip?\nPulling on a man’s mustache is dirty business, Tommy.\nOh, Lord, what is actually happening at these “man camps”?\n“The whole place is a workplace violation.” Good call, Tommy.\n“You can eat it or fuck it, I don’t really care.” Ah, Angela, never change.\nAww, Tommy is taking T.L.’s advice and appreciating his family. Love to see it!\nWhere did Cooper get a zillion candles for this proposal? It’s a fire hazard.\nAll said, the proposal was pretty cute. Good job, Cooper!\n\n\n\n\tUntil next week, please discuss the emotions you felt seeing a full-frontal Tommy in the comments below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow Much Did Bad Bunny’s Residency Actually Generate for Puerto Rico?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaste Test: Michter’s New 20 Year Bourbon Tests the Upper Limits of Aging, But Comes Out On Top\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHeisman Runner-Up Pavia Seeks Court Order to Keep Playing\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDesigners, Dignitaries Remember French Icon Brigitte Bardot\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "Actor, singer, sex symbol and style icon Brigitte Bardot, who retired from acting and became controversial for her right-wing politics in her later years, has died. She was 91. \n\nBardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals, who confirmed the news to The Associated Press. No cause of death was provided, and arrangements for funeral or memorial services have not yet been announced. She had been hospitalized last month.\n\nIn the 1950s Bardot ignited an international zeal for boldly sexual European movies, often directed by her first husband, Roger Vadim, such as “And God Created Woman.” \n\t\nThough Bardot’s reign as a major box office draw was relatively brief, and she retired from films in the early ’70s, her influence was far-reaching: She made youthful, pouty, nubile blondes a staple in cinema, particularly in American movies, as opposed to a more mature, womanly blonde like Marilyn Monroe. Between Bardot and Audrey Hepburn, the rage for youth in female sexuality became entrenched in movies — and all media — and has never subsided.\nBardot (and Vadim) also opened the door on sexuality, for which foreign films became famous in the uptight America of the ’50s. This boldness of approach (if not of substance) would eventually catch on in the U.S. and other countries and signal an end to decades of censorship. By then Bardot had tried to cross over and attain the mantle of a serious actress with such films as Jean-Luc Godard’s “Contempt,” but met with only limited success.\nHer breakthrough came with “And God Created Woman,” written and directed by Vadim and released in late 1956 while her marriage to him was breaking up. The movie was only modestly successful in France but it took off overseas, earning $8.5 million around the world. New and older films by Bardot such as “Mam’zelle Pigalle,” “Please! Mr. Balzac” and “The Girl in the Bikini” (from 1952) all washed up on U.S. shores, solidifying Bardot as a sex goddess. In France she climbed to the top of the box office with films like “The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful,” “La Parisienne,” which brought out her lighter side; “The Night Heaven Fell,” “The Woman and the Puppet” and “In Case of Emergency.” \n\t\nIn 1959, Simone de Beauvoir wrote a treatise called “Brigitte Bardot and the Lolita Syndrome.” But by then, Bardot’s girlish sensuality was so well entrenched in the culture that it was not about to be dislodged by serious studies.\nAlready the country’s highest-paid film performer, Bardot tried to further prove herself an actress in “Babette Goes to War,” as a member of the French Resistance; Louis Malle’s “A Very Private Affair” and Henri-Georges Clouzot’s “La Verite” in 1960. She continued to work for Vadim during this period, long after he’d moved on to other actresses and she to her second husband, actor Jacques Charrier.\nGodard’s “Contempt,” in 1963, exploited her reputation and brilliantly commented on it. She also appeared in American-made films such as “Dear Brigitte” (in a cameo), about an 8-year-old who desperately wants to meet Bardot; and “Viva Maria,” directed by Malle in English and pairing her with Jeanne Moreau (Bardot received a BAFTA Award nomination for best foreign actress). Later in the ’60s she appeared in the Western “Shalako” with Sean Connery.\nBardot’s last two films, both made in 1973, were Nina Companeez’s “The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot” and the sad “Ms. Don Juan,” another pallid Vadim attempt to exploit her sexuality. The latter was released in the U.S. in 1976.\nShe was born to an upper-middle-class Parisian family. Early on she evidenced talent as a dancer, studying ballet and attended the Hattemer’s private school and then the Paris Conservatory. At age 15, at the recommendation of a friend, she modeled for the cover of Elle magazine, where she was seen by director Marc Allegret, who was looking for a new face for his film “The Laurels Are Cut.”\nThough she didn’t get the part, Allegret’s assistant, Vadim, took her under his wing and got her small roles in small films before marrying her in a much publicized 1952 event that helped promote the young would-be actress. More small roles followed in films, the first of which to be released in the U.S. was Anatole Litvak’s “An Act of Love” (1953), which starred Kirk Douglas but was shot in France. She then appeared in Allegret’s film “Future Stars” and got her first lead in a chapter of the English Doctor series, “Doctor at Sea.” She next worked with legendary French director Rene Clair in “The Grand Maneuver” (1956) before starring in “And God Created Woman.”\n\t\nIn addition to her film work, Bardot also recorded some 80 songs, some quite popular, mostly in the 1960s and ’70s.\nShe did not, however, work in movies again, and in 2010 the former actress expressed outrage over rumors that an American-made biopic about her was in the works.\nBardot would nevertheless remain a media star, in part because of her numerous love affairs, advocacy for animals and zeal for right-wing politics. In 1986 she created the Brigitte Bardot Foundation. Her efforts in the service of animal rights brought her the French Legion of Honor (she refused it), and Bardot was not unwilling to protest or even be arrested to protect four-legged creatures. But she also drew fines imposed by French courts for inciting racial hatred after repeatedly making controversial remarks in which she criticized immigration to France and Muslims in particular.\nBardot was married to German playboy Gunter Sachs in the late 1960s, and she married wealthy industrial Bernard d’Ormale, a supporter of the far right in France, in 1993.\nBardot is survived by d’Ormale; a son from her marriage to Charrier; and two granddaughters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMarina Zenovich‘s “I’m Chevy Chase, and You’re Not” is not your average celebrity documentary. From the film’s outset, it is clear that the 82-year-old comedian had zero editorial control over the project.\n\n\tA minute into the CNN doc, Zenovich (“Lance,” “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind”) can be heard off camera saying to Chase, “I’m just trying to figure you out.”\n\n\tHis response: “No shit. It’s not going to be easy for you.”\n\t\n\n\t“Why is it not going to be easy?” Zenovich asks.\n\n\n\t“You’re not bright enough,” Chase deadpans. “How’s that?” Then the comedian grins.\n\n\tZenovich says that while she was taken aback by Chase’s response, she was also relieved.\n\n\t“I’d never done an interview where someone was so rude to me,” Zenovich tells Variety. “But I was so worried going into that first interview with him about how I was going to say to him, like, ‘Everyone thinks you’re an asshole.’ I thought if I did, he would throw me out of his house. So the minute he said that to me, I had a way in.”\n\n\tThe doc, premiering Jan. 1 on CNN, charts Chase’s rise from breakout “Saturday Night Live” to leading man, his three marriages, his addiction to cocaine and alcohol, heart failure that led to a coma, childhood abuse, depression, a failed talk show, and the star’s various on-set disputes with actors like Terry Sweeney and the entire cast of  the NBC comedy “Community.”\n\n\t“I wanted to figure out who was the real person behind the conflicted, guarded and somewhat fragile man we see on camera,” Zenovich says. “What was behind the surface of his slightly intimidating superstar bravado? Was there any self-awareness there? Having interviewed Chevy at length, I have to say that yes, it’s all there – and a whole lot of pain and heartache too.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to Chase and his family, the doc includes revealing interviews with the star’s former collaborators and confidants, including Mike Ovitz, Dan Aykroyd, Beverly D’Angelo, Goldie Hawn, Lorne Michaels, Ryan Reynolds and Martin Short.\n\n\tVariety spoke with Zenovich and her husband, and long-time producing partner P.G. Morgan, about why Chase decided to make the doc and getting someone, anyone, from “Community” to give an interview.\n\n\tYou have worked together on quite a few docs about celebrities, including “Lance,” about Lance Armstrong, “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,” “Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic,” “Jerry Brown: The Disrupter,” and “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired.” Where does Chevy Chase rate on the difficulty meter?\n\n\tZenovich: When I first sat down with Lance Armstrong, he was sitting at the edge of a seat and ready to spar with me. That is exciting because you don’t know what you’re going get. Then I did Jerry Brown, whom I tried to do that wit,h but he had no interest whatsoever. So, each person is different. Chevy was willing to go there, but he would stop himself. He wouldn’t go all the way. The interviews with him were very hard.\n\n\tMorgan: There were a lot of unknowns going into the interviews. Chevy is incredibly quick-witted and always on, so you have to be able to go toe-to-toe with him. He’s a bit intimidating as well, and we had a lot of stuff that we wanted to talk to him about – the good stuff and the touchy stuff.\n\n\tWhen it comes to celebrity documentaries, the celebrity is usually promoting something like a tour, a fashion line or a book. Chase wasn’t promoting anything. Why do you think he wanted to make this film, which isn’t exactly a flattering portrait of him?\n\n\tZenovich:  Someone wrote a book about him, and I don’t think that [Chase’s] family liked it. I think they were trying to right a wrong. I don’t know if they think that they did because it has been hard. [The doc] was a hard watch for him and his family, but I think in the end they appreciate it.\n\n\tMorgan: I’m guessing that they felt as a family that he wasn’t getting his due. That there’s been a whole run of these documentaries about other people from his generation. I think it hurt that he hadn’t had the same recognition.\n\n\tDo you think that the people who said no to interviews, like Steve Martin and Christopher Guest, were really saying, ‘We don’t like the guy’?\n\t\n\n\tZenovich: I can’t answer for them, but I think that the absences speak for themselves. Whether it’s scheduling, personal, or saving it for their own doc. In the end, I think we got the right mix of people. I was initially disappointed that we didn’t get more people from “Community,” but there are things people don’t want to talk about.\n\n\tHow hard was it to get anyone from “Community” to sit down with you?\n\n\tEvery single person said no. I ran into (“Community” creator) Dan Harmon at a screening of “Deaf President Now!” and I got his number. I was so excited. I thought it was going to happen but then he declined. I was so lucky to get Jay Chandrasekhar (“Community” director). He has such an amazing delivery and he was willing to go there. If Jay had said no, I would have been screwed.\n\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase, and You’re Not” premieres Thursday, Jan. 1, on CNN.

The DOJ has already released a slew of photos from the Epstein files, capturing everyone from Bill Clinton to Mick Jagger to Winnie the Pooh, as well as documents that link Epstein to President Trump.\n      \n    \n          As for the slow walking, DOJ officials claim they’re busy making redactions to the massive trove of files, which is why they say the agency has been holding many of them back. But members of Congress have pushed back hard on that narrative, saying the DOJ has failed to show full transparency with all the redactions.\n      \n    \n          So, while we wait for the next batch of Epstein Files to drop, see if you can guess the celebs in the series of already-released photos.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Guess Who\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Photo Galleries\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

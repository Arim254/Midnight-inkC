    "body": "\n\tRian Johnson is “excited to see” what Kathleen Kennedy does next after stepping down as the head of Lucasfilm. Kennedy, who took charge of the “Star Wars” franchise after George Lucas handpicked her to run Lucasfilm 14 years ago, announced her studio exit earlier this month. She is being replaced by Dave Filoni and Lynwen Brennan.\n\n\t“I love Kathy. I am excited now to see what she does next,” Johnson said at the Variety Studio presented by Audible while in Sundance as an executive producer on “The Only Living Pickpocket in New York.” “As a ‘Star Wars’ fan, the most exciting thing for me is always seeing when they bring in fresh voices and fresh filmmakers to come in and tell new stories in that world. That’s what I am looking forward to seeing more happen.”\n\t\n\n\tJohnson directed “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and said of the experience, “I had the time of my life doing it. I am now an even bigger ‘Star Wars’ fan than I was when going into it. I would feel blessed if that were to ever happen [again].”\n\n\tKelly Marie Tran, who played Rose Tico in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and “The Rise of Skywalker,” was also on the ground in Sundance promoting the new movie “Rock Springs.” Asked at the Variety Studio about what Kennedy’s leadership meant to her, Tran said it’s “such a loss” that the “Star Wars” franchise is losing her.\n\n\t“She’s had such an incredible career,” Tran said. “To have someone who is not just a woman but who is so capable in that role for so long, and it’s historic. I think that it’s such a loss, but I am very happy for all the life changes she is making.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter 2017’s “The Last Jedi,” Johnson was set to develop another “Star Wars” trilogy. But the project never got off the ground, and Johnson moved on to writing and directing his “Knives Out” trilogy. In her exit interview with Deadline, Kennedy explained that Johnson never returned to the “Star Wars” franchise because the “Knives Out” movies ate up “a huge amount of his time.” She also claimed he got “a little scared” by the fan backlash to “The Last Jedi,” which is something Johnson then denied on X by posting: “Lol zero spooked, sorry.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tWith Super Bowl LX a few weeks away in early February, the final matchup of the 2025-26 season has to be decided with the winner of the NFC Championship tonight.\n\n\tAs underdogs, you shouldn’t count the Rams out with an impressive season and 12-5 record with veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford at the helm. In fact, it was only a few years ago when L.A. won the NFC Championship and the Super Bowl in 2022. Look for the Rams to stay in the game throughout all four quarters to possibly surprise fans with a victory.\n\n\n\tOn the other hand, the Seahawks enter the game as the favorite with the top of the NFC West and a 14-3 record. Although Seattle hasn’t been to the NFC Championship since 2014 (a year after the Seahawks won the Super Bowl in 2013), the team is primed for a win on Sunday night with starting quarterback Sam Darnold leading the way to complete his redemption story as a journeyman in the NFL.\n\n\tBoth teams are seasoned and elite, while also being fierce and heated division rivals — which should make for a thrilling and exciting NFC Championship game. Throughout the season, the Rams and Seahawks split their division series with one win and one loss each.\n\t\n\t\tWho’s Playing in the 2026 NFC Championship?\t\n\n\tOn Sunday, Jan. 25, with a start time of 6:30 p.m. ET/3:30 p.m. PT, the NFC Championship has the Los Angeles Rams taking on the Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field in Seattle, Washington. The game airs on FOX.\n\n\tYou don’t have to miss any of the action, even without cable. You can access the game on your TV with one of these affordable indoor digital HD TV antennas.

    "body": "\n\tWhile discussing her feature directorial debut, “The Chronology of Water,” with The Times of London, Kristen Stewart said actresses get “treated like shit,” and it wasn’t until she was seen as a director that people started “talking to me like I’m somebody with a brain.”\n\n\t“Actresses get treated like shit, I’ve got to tell you,” Stewart said. “People think anyone could be an actress, but the first time I sat down to talk about my movie as a director, I thought, wow, this is a different experience, they are talking to me like I’m somebody with a brain.”\n\t\n\n\tShe added, “There’s this idea that directors have otherworldly abilities, which is not true. It’s an idea perpetuated by men. Not to sound like I’m complaining all the time, but it’s worse for female actors than male ones — they get treated like puppets, but they are not. Imogen [Poots] put her whole body and soul into this movie.”\n\n\n\tStewart famously got her start headlining the “Twilight” franchise before becoming a force in the arthouse scene, starring in films like “Seberg,” “Underwater,” “Spencer” and “Love Lies Bleeding.” Stewart made the jump to film directing with the release of “The Chronology of Water,” which premiered at Cannes 2025 before going wide in theaters on Jan. 9. The film stars Poots as Lidia, a woman who reconciles with her traumatic past through competitive swimming and the written word. \n\n\tThis is not the first time Stewart has spoken out about the experiences of women in Hollywood. In a recent profile with the New York Times, she said male actors are “aggrandized for retaining self” in their craft, while women don’t get the same treatment.\n\t\n\n\t“There’s a common act that happens before the acting happens on set: If [male actors] can protrude out of the vulnerability and feel like a gorilla pounding their chest before they cry on camera, it’s a little less embarrassing,” she said. “It also makes it seem like a magic trick, like it is so impossible to do what you’re doing that nobody else could do it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tZoey Deutch is at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival with “Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass,” the latest outrageous comedy from “Wet Hot American Summer” and “Wanderlust” filmmaker David Wain. But the actor got serious at the Variety Studio presented by Audible while discussing her decision to wear an “ICE Out” pin during her Sundance press tour. \n\n\t“I just feel like, for me, it’s impossible not to be thinking about the state of our country and the brutality of ICE,” Deutch said. “I feel so proud to be an American, seeing the way communities and people are coming together during this time. But I feel so ashamed at the same time to be an American, seeing how our government is handling things. I just want to stand with the amazing people of Minnesota.”\n\t\n\n\tDeutch was making the press rounds at Sundance just a day after a man was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis. Earlier this month, Renée Good was also killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. Many stars on the ground in Sundance have been wearing “ICE Out” and “Be Good” pins and speaking out against ICE. \n\n\t“We’re at a moment in our country’s history that is quite devastating. It’s really impossible not to talk about what is happening right now and the brutality of ICE and how it has to stop immediately,” Natalie Portman told Variety before the Sundance premiere of “The Gallerist.” “But also, there’s a beautiful community that Americans are showing right now. They’re showing up for each other, protecting each other and fighting for their freedom. It’s a bittersweet moment to celebrate something we’re so proud of on the backdrop of our nation in pain.”\n\t\n\n\tOlivia Wilde told Variety on the Sundance red carpet for her latest directorial effort, “The Invite,” that she is “appalled and sickened” by ICE.\n\n\t“We can’t go another day just sort of accepting this as our new norm. It’s outrageous. People are being murdered,” Wilde said. “And, I don’t want to normalize seeing people being murdered on the internet. On film. It’s hideous. And so if we can do anything out here to support the movement to cast ICE out, to delegitimize this unbelievably criminal organization, then that’s what we should be doing.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAdam Meeks studied film at NYU’s Tisch School for the Arts, where one can imagine the true-to-his-roots filmmaker learning alongside eclectic classmates. Manhattan must have felt like a stark break from the reality of rural Ohio, where Meeks grew up, but instead of abandoning his upbringing, the way so many do after moving to the big city, the writer-director honors what he left behind — and especially those struggling with opioid epidemic back home — in his feature debut, “Union County.” The make-or-break ingredient turns out to be British actor Will Poulter, whose immersive commitment dovetails beautifully with Meeks’ unvarnished sensibility. \n\t\n\n\tExpanded from a 2020 short of the same name, Meeks’ raw, honest movie fits neatly within a tradition of red-state escapees who remain committed to depicting the communities they know best with empathy and compassion (other examples include Nicole Riegel’s slice-of-life indie “Holler” and J.D. Vance’s bestselling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy”). While Hollywood remains disproportionately invested in depicting glamorous coastal lifestyles, Meeks focuses on what’s going on with the other 70% of the country, paying particular attention to a handful of recovering drug addicts.\n\n\n\tCommitted to authenticity, Meeks takes an unconventional approach that can feel almost like social work at times, partnering with the Adult Recovery Court in Bellfontaine, Ohio (pronounced “Bell Fountain”). With the exception of Poulter (who plays Cody Parsons) and Noah Centineo (as his brother Jack), nearly everyone in the film is a nonprofessional actor, tasked with bringing their own truth to the screen. The naturalistic drama opens with a handful of testimonials, as court-supervised addicts step to the lectern and address the judge, sharing their progress and setbacks on the route to sobriety.\n\t\n\n\tAll but unrecognizable behind his scruffy beard, Poulter blends right in with these hard-knock folks, whose homemade tattoos and missing teeth are the real deal. Whether from news reports or personal experience, we know by now what addiction looks like (roughly a third of Americans have a family member with an opioid problem). Too many of those stories turn out tragically. While Meeks’ movie doesn’t ignore that dimension, the filmmaker prefers to emphasize how entire communities have come together to fight back.\n\n\tThe recovering addicts we meet in the opening scene are supported by social workers and sponsors, as well as the legal system (which is so often presented as a kind of punishment, but here seems to prioritize forgiveness and recovery). When Poulter takes the podium, we don’t see an actor, but a good man worn down by bad decisions. This is Clay, who accepts that he’s an addict, but isn’t quite ready to change his life. He sleeps in his car, which affords him a degree of independence (or so he thinks).\n\n\tThe program requires him to get a job and a proper residence, steps that “Union County” chronicles, without turning away from his stumbles. Rehabilitation is rarely a straight line, but there’s something in Clay/Poulter’s face that suggests he could do it — his eyes are clear, his gaze determined — whereas Centineo’s Jack looks like trouble — a bad influence. We ought to know better than to judge a book by its cover, and Meeks reveals in time that it was Clay who got Jack hooked, not the other way around. If anything, Jack is the responsible one, helping Clay find work at the local lumber mill (the car and the job are the same as they were in the short film, though most of the faces are different).\n\n\tInstead of taking comfort in seeing them reunited, we watch warily. Jack brings his brother along to a campfire, where he drinks — enough to fail his next toxicology screening — while Clay chats with Anna (Elise Kibler), a woman who’ll become important later. She’s an ex-addict, too, it turns out, and though we might hope she could steer him in the right direction, we also respect her for refusing to get involved with someone who could jeopardize custody of her child. Life has a way of getting complicated when you introduce temptation, and though “Union County” can be frustratingly simple at times, the stakes are life and death. Not everyone Meeks introduces will make it to the end.\n\t\n\n\tAfter one character relapses, Clay is offered the empty room at a group home. But he’s still susceptible to opioid use as well, and the scene where he shoots up — passing out behind the wheel, as his white car rolls forward into a ditch — says everything about how dangerous addiction can be. No wonder his sister (Emily Meade) freaks out when Clay shows up at her house, calling the cops to come take him away. Clay starts the film with a clean slate (in the audience’s eyes, at least), but he’s been letting others down for more than a decade.\n\n\tWill Clay get it together by the end of the film? “Union County” knows it doesn’t work that way. Success is measured in days of sobriety, as well as the incremental realization that these addicts are not alone (a kindly sponsor played by Annette Deao beautifully embodies the patience it takes to support such cases). If Meeks’ project somehow feels less than the sum of its parts, that’s likely because the filmmaker doesn’t impose a more compelling crime story or romance to hook us. It’s one of those projects that is “about what it is about,” minus subplots or sizzle. There’s integrity in that choice, even if it ultimately costs “Union County” the kind of commercial appeal we expect from Sundance movies. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAt Sundance, it’s a tale of two festivals. There are the films and the parties. And then there is Tao.\n\n\tA pop-up version of the Hollywood-beloved nightclub has been ruling Sundance after dark for over two decades. While wealthy locals relish in drunken nights at ski resorts and cinephiles cram into Main Street’s dive bars, Tao has given coastal industry players a place to call home after endless days promoting movies.\n\n\n\tLeonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Paris Hilton, Jon Hamm, Jason Momoa, Ryan Gosling, C-suite agents from WME and CAA and countless others have danced on those tables and thrown up hands for performances by the likes of Jennifer Lopez, 50 Cent and Diplo.\n\t\n\n\tProperly opened in 2005, Tao Sundance welcomes armies of stars, agents, publicists and media each year. As a private event teeming with liquor sponsors, the booze is free and flows through the early morning. Presently held at Park City’s Utah Film Studios, the cavernous space creates a downtown warehouse vibe decked out in après ski accents. The pop-up is microcosm of Sundance itself: At first an under-the-radar jewel box, soon transformed into a mass commercial endeavor populated by great artists and powerful insiders.\n\n\t“Our premise was to do something really great for the town, for brands, and something to strengthen relationships with key people that support and frequent our places all year round,” said Noah Tepperberg, co-CEO of Tao Hospitality group, reflecting on a 25-year run that will leave Park City this year for good as the festival heads to Colorado.\n\n\tTepperberg recalled the first ever Tao Sundance, which kicked off with a party for the band Good Charlotte’s concert film “Fast Future Generation.” Founders Joel and Benji Madden served as opening night DJs.\n\t\n\n\t“The second night was a party for Diego Luna, Gael Garcia Bernal and Pablo Cruz, who were up-and-coming producers at the time. Our final night was a part for Ryan Gosling’s ‘Half Nelson,’ which was a huge film and huge for us,” he said.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Lopez and DJ Chase B perform at TAO Park City in 2025.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Casamigos\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs a young reporter covering celebrity and events, Tao was the most important invite to land when I started attending Sundance years ago. It was and still is a mix of high and low culture; a place where the Hungarian cinematographer of a war documentary could pound tequila while Lil Jon sang his banner hit “Shots!”  \n\n\tIt’s also been the site of occasional bad behavior. In 2015, actor Emile Hirsch attacked a female executive from Paramount Pictures, an incident that led to charges of aggravated assault and intoxication. He was later sentenced to 15 days of jail time and community service, and has since reflected on the moment as the worst of his life (defined by a pattern of binge drinking).\n\n\tOver the years, Tao grew in size and sponsorships from corporate brands and production labels. There are a staggering seven partners for this final Park City year, including Casamigos, Evian, Moet Hennessy, Jack Daniels, Hendricks, Red Bull and Q Mixers.\n\n\t“We’ve been able to create a nightclub in the mountains of Park City, throwing late night parties in parking garages and film studios that people and brands want to be a part of. But our event has always been about delivering the same level of hospitality our guests are accustomed to any of our venues around the world,” said Gabby Fernando, Tao’s vice president of special projects. “That approach allowed Tao Park City to grow alongside Sundance and continue to be one of the most sought after events of the festival every year, and years to come.”\n\n\tOn Saturday — or “the last dance,” as organizers have been calling it — snug-jeans-wearing pop star Benson Boone set off the party with a backflip and a performance of his song “Beautiful Things.” Patrick Schwarzenegger and Maude Apatow cheered him on, as cast members of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” and “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” circulated. Even revelers chugging cocktails and Whispering Angel rosé got sentimental as hundreds streamed out around 3:30 a.m.\n\t\n\n\tBut the dance will go on. Tepperberg said he and his team will jet to Colorado next week to scout potential venues for Tao Boulder.\n\n\t“It’ll be a different experience because Boulder’s a college town with different energy and a different culture,” said Tepperberg. “But somehow, every year, we get the biggest names and our year-round guests to show up.”\n\n\tSee you there.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Grey’s Anatomy” star Eric Dane dropped out of an awards gala on Saturday due to complications with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.\n\n\tAccording to Entertainment Weekly, Dane was set to receive the Advocate of the Year Award at the ALS Network’s Champions for Cures and Care gala. Hours before the event began, organizers said that Dane could not attend “due to the physical realities of ALS.”\n\t\n\n\t“We remain deeply grateful for his courage, advocacy and continued commitment to the ALS community,” an ALSN rep told EW in a statement. “We honor him fully this evening with our profound respect and support.”\n\n\n\tGrammy-nominated Broadway star Aaron Lazar accepted the award in Dane’s place. While not appearing in person, Dane sent in a pre-recorded message thanking the ALS Network for his honor.\n\n\t“This award is not just for me, it’s for my beautiful loved ones who are fighting with me, and it’s for every person who has faced ALS with courage,” Dane said in the video. “For every caregiver who gives their heart and energy day after day and for every advocate who raises their voice to push for progress.”\n\n\tDane first revealed his ALS diagnosis to People in April of 2025. He told the outlet, “I feel fortunate that I am able to continue working and am looking forward to returning to set of ‘Euphoria’ next week. I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time.”\n\n\tALS is a fatal, degenerative condition that breaks down the nerves in the body. It weakens the muscles and eventually causes paralysis, impacting patients’ ability to breathe, speak and move. There is no known cure.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn Vera Miao’s debut feature “Rock Springs,” there is a wonderfully creepy doll. It’s a nod to classic horror movies that she loves, but in her film, even recognizable elements take on a much deeper meaning.\n\n\t“There’s a lot in the film that is a reflection of me as a fan of horror,” she says. “I love a creepy doll movie. So I do intentionally subvert the horror tropes I include in the film. A creepy doll is not necessarily a creepy doll. You find out instead how it’s connected to this supernatural world. That reveal, I hope, comes back to the real-life horror.”\n\t\n\n\t“Rock Springs” has a premise that builds and blooms over its runtime. After her husband dies, Emily (Kelly Marie Tran) moves to a new house with her daughter (Aria Kim) and mother (Fiona Fu). Yet in addition to catching spectral visions of her husband, Emily and her family realize that their new home sits on the land where Chinese immigrants were massacred in 1885, and there are ancestral spirits with unfinished business.\n\n\tMiao says she wanted to examine real-life dark history in her modern feature.\n\n\t“I knew two things,” she says. “I consider myself a child of the diaspora. I’m a child of immigrants. I knew I wanted to explore what it felt like to be part of diaspora through horror. What was interesting to me was the emotion about loneliness and being haunted. That’s obviously a ghost story, and that’s one of my favorite subgenres of horror. I knew it was going to be a contemporary story, but I did actually want to include some untold history of the first Chinese communities in America.”\n\n\tMiao was excited to have Tran, whom she has known for years, in the central role, as the film shows a different side of her than fans might have seen in high-profile projects like the “Star Wars” series. \n\t\n\n\t“I remember thinking she carries a lot of weight and gravitas inside of her,” Miao says. “There are dimensions to her that perhaps you wouldn’t see. You’d see a fresh-faced, young, innocent, naive woman. But she has a darkness. She has grief. She carries a pain, and she’s so bright and so winning. But that pain that she carries, that grief that she carries inside, is what drew me to her.”\n\n\tTran spoke about the role in the Variety Studio presented by Audible, where she says she was interested in the way that trauma spoke back and forth to her character from generations in the film.\n\n\t“The grief exists not just in her present day, but also the grief of things that happened in the past, and how these things seep into our environments, into our energy. They can very much feel heavy and like a mystery, because we don’t know where it comes from,” Tran says. “I think that’s one of the most beautiful things about the script and the film is how she is working through these past tragedies that have been historically erased.”\n\n\tMiao is acutely aware that “Rock Springs” is debuting at a time when immigrants are under attack in America, but she’s hoping that the work can be something that helps to contextualize their experience.\n\n\t“Storytelling is the way that humans make meaning,” she says. “So there is no such thing for me as a story purely for entertainment purposes. Every time anybody tells a story, including when you tell your kid a story at night, you are making meaning together. I take that responsibility really seriously. As a filmmaker, I want to make meaning with people who watch the film.”\n\n\tShe is also hopeful that America’s violent history doesn’t dictate its future.\n\n\t“I wanted to put forth a different path that could come out of this history where this family, which is really struggling to process death, comes across this history and, in the learning and the acknowledgement and the acceptance of that history, finds healing,” Miao says. “That is my offering, to perhaps what this timeline that we’re in now might yield, perhaps in our generation, perhaps in future generations. What looks horrifying and brutalizing now, and just like the utmost cruelty now, we have to acknowledge it, and we have to do everything that we can to protect its victims for ourselves, as well as for them.”\n\t\n\n\tUltimately, Miao is hopeful that, despite the dark subject matter, “Rock Springs” can be uplifting to audiences.\n\n\t“‘Rock Springs’ can sound like a tragedy-focused story,” she says. “It would be a mistake on my part to pass up the opportunity to say that I think it’s actually a redemption story. I think it’s a story of healing. That was my intention and my purpose, and I don’t want the conversation around the film or the anticipation around it to live and die on tragedy, because that wasn’t the intention. It’s not what these fine actors brought to the film in terms of creating so much dimension to the characters. I want to let folks know that, especially in this moment in time that we’re in, where things can feel really dark, I’m hopeful that ‘Rock Springs’ is one tiny contribution to a little bit of light.”\n\n\tWatch more from the Variety Studio in the video above.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor those of us who saw it when we were still in school ourselves, Alexander Payne’s “Election” was a startling work, and even a perspective-shifting one — a snarlingly funny introduction to the idea that our least favorite teachers might just hate their job as much as we hated their doing it. Making a similar point with similar venom is tyro director Giselle Bonilla‘s unapologetically jaundiced black comedy “The Musical,” though in this case, ambitious students aren’t the enemy. Instead, they’re eagerly complicit allies to one embittered educator looking to burn the whole system down. Or at least to get his girlfriend-stealing boss fired, if he’s being both honest and petty about it.\n\t\n\n\tExpanded from a short film made by Bonilla (and a number of her collaborators here) while studying at the AFI Conservatory, “The Musical” lines up a number of hot-button topics for satire — cancel culture, representation politics, even social anxiety around 9/11 — but resists pressing on them too hard. Instead, this short, nasty film finds much of its sharpest humor in good old-fashioned misanthropy. Specifically, that of nerdy, permanently aggrieved middle-school drama teacher Doug Leibovitz: an inspired comic creation by screenwriter Alexander Heller and character actor Will Brill, who permit him to be both recklessly horrible and strangely, sadly heroic in his determination to stick it to the man, or one man in particular. \n\n\n\tThe result, premiering in competition at Sundance, is an acquired bad taste, but riotously funny at its most daring. Offbeat indie distributors should take in interest in a work that, despite some tonal wobbles of its own, stands out from the festival pack for its brazen anti-earnestness. \n\t\n\n\t“Everybody talks about the power of love,” says Doug to one of his more admiring young charges, “but nobody talks about the power of spite.” In the ranks of inspirational lines spoken in movie classrooms, it’s unlikely to be quoted quite as often as “Carpe diem.” But Doug himself would be the first to admit that he doesn’t have much useful life advice to offer, given the current disparity between his own life and his dreams. Pushing forty and still an aspiring playwright, he takes little delight in directing the annual school musical. Last year’s, however, was less of a chore than usual, thanks to the participation of pretty, enthusiastic art teacher Abigail (Gillian Jacobs), which cued a brief and unlikely romance between them.\n\n\tAt the start of a new school year, Doug finds himself briskly friendzoned by Abigail, and patronized by the school’s glib, smarmy principal Brady (a perfectly cast Rob Lowe) — who, it turns out, has swiftly succeeded him in Abigail’s affections. Brady, the kind of bland whitebread manager given to compensatory assertions of his own political correctness (“You’ve been a mensch — am I saying that right?” he says to Leibovitz), is fixated on getting a coveted blue ribbon from the state education board. Doug’s planned production of “West Side Story” should help in that regard, provided it’s sensitively and diversely cast in all the right places.\n\n\tThat’s music to the ears of keen Latina theater kid Lata (superb first-timer Melanie Herrera), who promptly starts lobbying for the role of Maria. Doug, though, sees an altogether different opportunity — to get his own back on his better-paid, better-looking love rival, and depart the school theater world in a blaze of glory. It would be spoiling a couple of the film’s most dementedly funny comic setpieces to reveal just what alternative plans he has for opening night, though he finds a gaggle of willing, improbable conspirators in his drama students, who are happy to do pretty much anything so long as it’s on center stage.\n\n\tA Tony-winning stage actor who has long been a trusty indie ensemble player, Brill seizes his most substantial film role to date with sneering relish, finding a core of woebegone loneliness in Doug that makes sense of his malevolent excesses — without losing sight of the unremarkable milquetoast figure he cuts to most outsiders. Bonilla’s comic direction isn’t always on quite the same page, sometimes favoring shrill amplification over deadpan understatement, while Mateo Nossa’s stormy, percussive score punctuates turns in Heller’s writing that are already plenty witty or shocking on their own. A climactic needle-drop of Enigma’s kitsch new-age classic “Return to Innocence” over scenes of schoolroom bedlam feels like gilding the lily on an exercise already rich in tonal havoc.\n\t\n\n\tBut no matter: Like its eminently problematic anti-hero, “The Musical” says its piece with conviction to spare, and a welcome streak of cat-among-the-pigeons danger rarely found in contemporary American comedy. Doug may be motivated purely by personal grievance and heartbreak, but he winds up quite pointedly skewering the hypocrisy of systems — educational, social, political, take your pick — where tokenism trumps meaningful change, and where playing nice means the same old guys finish first.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat’s Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s, favorite Girl Scout cookie?\n\n\t“Isn’t everyone’s Thin Mints?” Meghan says over Zoom, her eyes glimmering conspiratorially as she adds: “I prefer them crumbled on top of vanilla ice cream.”\n\n\tIndeed, Thin Mints are regularly among the top-selling flavors of the $800 million worth of cookies that Girl Scouts across America sell annually, followed by Samoas and Tagalongs. Director Alysa Nahmias chronicled the six-week selling spree for the documentary “Cookie Queens,” of which Meghan, a former scout, is an executive producer.\n\t\n\n\t“You know what the sleeper hit was?” Nahmias chimes in from the other corner of the screen. “The Lemonade are amazing. It’s an iced lemon cookie, and it’s a really large cookie. You get your money’s worth with that one.”\n\n\n\tMoney, or rather, economics, is a key theme of “Cookie Queens,” which follows four Girl Scouts between ages 5 and 12 as they work to sell as many cookies as possible in that window. One seller, Olive, a 12-year-old from North Carolina, once moved more than 8,000 boxes in a season. Meanwhile, Ara, a 5-year-old from San Diego, has a more modest goal of 55 boxes. Eight-year-old Shannon Elizabeth of El Paso, TX hopes to sell enough boxes to go to cookie camp — an expense that would otherwise be out of her family’s reach. Nikki, a 9-year-old from Chino, CA is following in her older sisters’ footsteps to be named the “cookie queen,” a colloquial term for the top seller in the area, that season.\n\n\tTo craft the 91-minute observational documentary, Nahmias’ crew crisscrossed the country to shoot some 300 hours of footage of the girls and their families as they canvassed their local neighborhoods to make sales.\n\t\n\n\t“What’s so fantastic about the experience of being a Girl Scout — and my mom was my troop leader as well — is I don’t think you understand just how impactful all of those tools that you’re learning are going to carry through in your life later on outside of the community building,” Meghan says.\n\n\t“What I love about what Alysa did in bringing this film to life is it gives such an objective point of view about girlhood, humanity, but also how they’re leveraging technology, how they’re learning micro-finance, financial independence,” she explains. “All of these elements that are baked in — dare I say — to the tradition of the Girl Scouts’ cookie season.”\n\n\tMeghan and Nahmias chatted with Variety ahead of the documentary’s Sundance premiere on Sunday, where the film’s young stars joined them on the red carpet with Prince Harry.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Alysa Nahmias and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex pose with the cast and crew at the “Cookie Queens” premiere in Park City, Utah.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCindy Ord/Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYour subjects were able to join you for the premiere. Was this the first time they’d seen the film? \t\n\n\tAlysa Nahmias: They’ve seen it and they’re very pleased. One of the wonderful things about having them see it was that they got to see each other’s stories and see themselves reflected in each other, which is such a big part of the experience of watching “Cookie Queens.” People can see themselves reflected in each other and remind ourselves that we do have at least as much in common as we have that makes us different.\n\n\tThat’s something that young people understand, oftentimes so innocently and so powerfully that we somehow sometimes forget, but it’s expressed in the ways that these kids share themselves with the world. I’m really very grateful and honored to be entrusted with that and to have such a marvelous team that understands the responsibility and the honor that that is as storytellers. I hope that people will watch this with multi-generational audiences, where you can tell your mom, your grandma and your kids and watch it together.\n\t\n\t\tAlysa, you’ve said “Cookie Queens” is your most personal project yet. How did you get the idea to make this documentary?\t\n\n\tNahmias: I had just made a film, “Art & Krimes by Krimes,” which was a look at art and artists who make work while incarcerated and the community that they built when they came home, and a film called “Wildcat,” that I produced about mental health and conversation. One night at dinner, my kids, who were 8 and 11 at the time, said, “Mom, can you make a film that we really want to watch and share with our friends?” So, I had that in my heart as an intention for a next project.\n\t\n\n\tI ended up talking with my friends, producers Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw, and Michael brought up that he had been sold an ungodly amount of cookies from a Girl Scout who told him her goals were off the charts. I said, “If you guys want to make that movie, I’m 100% in. I can relate to that girl. I feel like there’s a whole world of girlhood and capitalism and the ways that girls are engaging with the economy at young ages, learning what their value is, and building their identity.” That was a way in that could also become this wonderful, vivid world of primary colors and plucky kids and eccentric customers, and be very observational and immersive. The vision was instantaneous.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you get the idea to reach out to Meghan to join the project as an executive producer?\t\n\n\tNahmias: We looked at who in the world has been a Girl Scout — women we admire, who are doing interesting things and that we respect. Meghan was on that short list early. When we first got to show her footage, the connection was really clear and meaningful. She got that this is about Girl Scout cookies, and it’s about so much more. An observational documentary is not something that everyone is willing to take a risk on — you don’t know how it’s going to end — and I really appreciated that.\n\n\tMeghan: We first saw that footage almost two years ago, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And in really wanting to support independent filmmakers through Archewell Productions, it felt like something where I knew where the hook was. So, as it started to expand and grow, I could see Alysa’s vision really coming to life. I just thought, “Oh my gosh, it would be such a privilege to uplift and support this, so that people, even if they aren’t Girl Scouts and don’t understand the tradition, can have this glimpse into the families and what adolescence looks like for young girls in this day and age.” I just find the messaging that she’s put together to be incredibly inspiring and brave, because it could just be cookie cutter and sweet, and it’s not. It goes a lot deeper than that and that nuance makes it incredibly special.\n\n\tNahmias: One of the first scenes we showed you was of [5-year-old] Ara selling cookies at the waterfront.\n\n\tMeghan: Yes, just the tutorial of what was happening – that you could use Venmo [to pay for cookies]. Obviously, we didn’t have that as young girls. It was such an interesting glimpse. The character-driven storytelling is what makes this film so meaningful.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Cookie Queens”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI didn’t realize how much money these cookie sales produce each year. Alysa, how did you go about finding your subjects?\t\n\n\tNahmias: The numbers are staggering. They outsell Chips Ahoy and Oreo.\n\n\tThere’s 50 million Girl Scouts alive and 20 million current participants or so. I wanted to find girls and families who had both interesting sales goals and prizes that they were looking to go for, and also different motivations, different backgrounds, different geographical contexts and communities. I always knew from the beginning that it would be an ensemble. I worked with a casting producers and we got a lot of interest from the Girl Scout community. We got hundreds of inquiries; I did a lot of Zoom interviews, and when I narrowed it down, I went and spent time getting to know these families without filming. I wanted to know that they understood what it meant to participate and that it would be done with a lot of conscious desire to collaborate, that these kids were going to be willing to take risks, and that we’d be able to see them go through changes and make choices while filming.\n\t\n\t\tWith two of the subjects being from California, Meghan, did watching them make you nostalgic?\t\n\n\tMeghan: Yes, without question. Especially now, as a mother of a daughter, there’s a very different lens that you’re witnessing it through. And, of course, being reminiscent of my own experience of having been a Girl Scout and in California. But I love how varied and diverse the casting is. I love that you see some of these families and what they’re sacrificing to give their daughters these opportunities. And, on the flip side, some daughters were pushing themselves more than their parents would ever push them, and how that’s ingrained so early on.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your go to method for getting that sale? Did you have a good strategy?\t\n\n\tMeghan: In many ways, the cookies can sell themselves, because they’re so good. But back then wasn’t the same. There was no social media to try to sell cookies. So, it was just smiling and being kind and knowing that you had entrepreneurial goals. I think targets and goals and learning metrics like that at a young age are really helpful for young girls who are oftentimes scared to talk about finance, math and economics in that way. The empowerment that happens early on is really key.\n\t\n\n\tNahmias: One of the things that we saw on camera is that it’s about the sales, but it’s also about the interactions they’re having with the adult world and the economy and the things that are said to them, and how they navigate people’s perceptions of them. [Or] how you deal with failure or rejection.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, introduces the premiere screening of “Cookie Queens” at Eccles Center Theater in Park City, Utah. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCindy Ord/Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThis is the next Archewell Productions following your Netflix series “With Love, Meghan.” How does this documentary fit into the vision you have for the company moving forward?\t\n\n\tMeghan: It’s been key to focus on stories that resonate with people; things that are not necessarily the most topical and end up becoming something that is more topical. It’s not dissimilar to saying “Hide the vegetables.” When you see this film, you might not know what you’re going in to find, but, ultimately, you come out of it with so much more to talk about, to dissect and to really better understand each other. Everything, for us, is intertwined with community. So, when I saw the first few cuts of what Alyssa put together, I knew that really hit the nail on the head. This is such a prime example of the direction and the types of projects we want to support on the nonfiction side.\n\t\n\t\tWhat did you learn from producing that series in terms of audiences’ appetite for lifestyle programming?\t\n\n\tMeghan: “Suits” was seven years for me, and then doing “With Love, Meghan” was 17 episodes of television in a year, with pre- and post-production. It is such an undertaking, and it makes me have even more respect for creatives who are throwing themselves into this every single day. From my standpoint, it’s an industry that I grew up in and that I know really well. And at the same time, it is such an exciting opportunity as an adult to find something that piques curiosity at every turn, and to continue to remind each other how we can be creative, how we can work as a team, how dedicated a crew is, building trust with the subjects of the film and their families. It’s multifaceted, but I’m just excited to continue to explore and play and have fun.\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of fun, you just returned to acting with a cameo in the Amazon movie, “Close Personal Friends,” with Lily Collins and Brie Larson. How much fun was that?\t\n\n\tMeghan: It was great! It was a lot of fun. But that’s just the point, right? We continue to explore different ways to uplift and celebrate the entertainment industry and all the incredible pieces of work that are out there that people work so hard on — “Cookie Queens” being one of them. This is such an important piece of cinema to be able to share with people and I just know people are going to love it the same way you and I do.\n",

We're told Quinton was walking up the stairs in his apartment last week when his legs suddenly stopped functioning, causing him to collapse.

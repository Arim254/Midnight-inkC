    "body": "\n\tAlthough Trevor Noah usually keeps his Grammy hosting duties free of political discussion, he used his enthusiastic opening monologue to poke fun at Nicki Minaj’s recent turn to fawning over Donald Trump.\n\n\tAfter lightly joking with scores of superstars in the audience, Noah pointed out that the A-list rapper wasn’t at the award show. “Nicki Minaj is not here,” he said. “She’s still at the White House with Donald Trump, discussing very important issues. ‘Actually Nicki, I have the biggest ass! Everybody’s saying it. I know they say it’s you, but it’s me. WAP, WAP, WAP. Look at it, baby.'”\n\t\n\n\tMinaj has caused debate among her fanbase recently by her very visible support of Donald Trump and the MAGA movement.\n\n\n\tLast year, Noah’s monologue was subdued, given the recency of the devastating Los Angeles wildfires, but he did take aim at the Trump administration’s tariffs.\n\n\tThe Feb. 1 ceremony is the sixth time that Noah has hosted the Grammys. This is set to be his final time as well, which the show’s executive producer, Ben Winston of Fulwell Entertainment, revealed in January.\n\n\t“I am beyond thrilled to welcome Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys for his sixth, and sadly, final time,” Winston said at the time. “He’s been the most phenomenal host of the show. He’s so smart, so funny, and such a true fan of the artists and music. His impact on the show has been truly spectacular, and we can’t wait to do it together one last time.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, criticism of ICE raids has grown even louder in recent weeks, especially following the Jan. 24 shooting death of Alex Pretti. Several Hollywood figures have spoken out against the killing, including Whoopi Goldberg on “The View,” Sundance attendees during a Park City protest, and actors with films at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tThe 68th Annual Grammy Awards are taking place at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Kendrick Lamar has the most nominations of the night with nine, including record of the year, song of the year, and album of the year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSabrina Carpenter took flight at the Grammys on Sunday, transforming Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena into an airport to perform “Manchild” and giving censors a test with a series of F-bombs on the song’s chorus.\n\n\tDescending from a carousel out of an airplane, the singer performed the lead single off last year’s “Man’s Best Friend” alongside workers in the airport. “Hey Grammys, how ya doing? It’s your captain Sabrina speaking,” she told the crowd in a spoken-word moment. “If you came here tonight for a little validation, stand up and I want you to put your hands together!” At the end, she picked up two traffic wands, waving all the imaginary planes by before tossing them towards the audience.\n\t\n\n\n\tThis marks the second consecutive year that Carpenter has performed on the Grammys stage. In 2025, she made her Grammys debut with a cheeky rendition of her smash hits “Espresso” and “Please Please Please,” faking stage errors and pulling performance gags.\n\n\n\tLast year, she was a first-time nominee with nods for album of the year, best new artist, best pop vocal album, song of the year for “Please Please Please” and record of the year for “Espresso.” She walked away with two trophies last year: one for “Espresso,” which won in the best pop solo performance category, and another for “Short n’ Sweet,” which won best pop vocal album.\n\n\tCarpenter was nominated in six categories for this year’s Grammys. “Manchild,” the hit single off her album “Man’s Best Friend,” was honored in record of the year, song of the year, best pop solo performance and best music video. “Man’s Best Friend” was nominated for album of the year and best pop vocal album.\n\t\n\n\tThe pop star has been tirelessly touring the globe since the fall of 2022, when she took her first post-Disney album “Emails I Can’t Send” on the road. Her “Short n’ Sweet” tour kicked off in September 2024 and only recently wrapped with six nights at Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena in November 2025. She is next slated to take the stage as a headliner for both weekends of Coachella 2026, taking place in April.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKendrick Lamar is officially the most-awarded hip-hop artist in Grammys history.\n\n\tThe “Not Like Us” rapper took home the awards for best rap album for “GNX,” best rap song for “TV Off,” melodic rap performance for “Luther” and rap performance for being featured in Clipse’s “Chains & Whips,” bringing his total to 26. He surpassed previous record holder Jay-Z, who has 25 Grammys to his name, and Kanye West, who was in second place with 24 trophies. Lamar can still raise that count, with categories like song of the year, record of the year and album of the year yet to be announced.\n\t\n\n\tLamar went into the night with 22 Grammy wins and 57 nominations. He was nominated for nine Grammys this year, including for album of the year, song of the year and record of the year. He was the third-most awarded rapper prior to Sunday’s 68th annual fete, and he won three awards before the live telecast on CBS.\n\n\n\tLast year, Lamar’s hit single “Not Like Us” — a diss track targeted at Drake — swept its categories, winning five Grammys alone. He has won the award for best rap album three times, for 2016’s “To Pimp a Butterfly,” 2018’s “DAMN.” and 2023’s “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.” His 2012 breakthrough, “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” famously lost to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ “The Heist,” which drew sharp backlash and a text from Macklemore that admitted, “You got robbed.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwenty years after the release of “The Devil Wears Prada,” Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway return to the world of high fashion and workplace politics on May 1. \n\n\t20th Century Studios has released a new trailer for “The Devil Wears Prada 2,” offering a more detailed look at the upcoming sequel. \n\n\n\t“The Devil Wears Prada 2” will follow Streep as Runway magazine’s editor-in-chief, Miranda Priestly, dealing with the decline of print journalism and attempting to find her footing in a dying industry. Priestly finds herself facing off against Emily Blunt’s character, her former assistant who is now a high-powered executive for a luxury group with advertising money that Priestly desperately needs. \n\t\n\n\tThe original “Devil Wears Prada” followed college graduate Andrea Sachs, played by Hathaway, looking for a journalism job in New York City. Sachs begins working as a junior assistant for Priestly and ends up struggling to balance her professional and personal lives, risking her friendships and relationship with her boyfriend. A critical and commercial hit, the movie grossed $326 million worldwide at the box office. \n\n\tStreep, Hathaway, Blunt, Stanley Tucci, Tracie Thoms and Tibor Feldman will reprise their roles in the sequel, with Kenneth Branagh and Patrick Brammall playing Streep and Hathaway’s love interests, respectively. Simone Ashley, Lucy Liu, B.J. Novak, Justin Theroux, Lady Gaga and Pauline Chalamet will be joining as additional cast members. Broadway stars Helen J. Shen and Conrad Ricamora are also set to appear, along with comedian Caleb Hearon. Adrian Grenier, who played Sachs’ boyfriend Nate in the original, will not be returning.\n\t\n\n\tDavid Frankel, who directed the 2006 film, and Aline Brosh McKenna, who wrote the original screenplay, will return for the sequel along with producer Wendy Finerman. Michael Bederman, Karen Rosenfelt and McKenna will executive produce the film, scheduled to be released by 20th Century Studios on May 1, 2026. \n\n\tWatch the trailer below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tKehlani accepted the Grammy for best R&B performance (“Folded”) and said “fuck ICE” in her acceptance speech after encouraging other artists “to speak against all the injustice going on in the world right now.” Kehlani attended the Grammys wearing an “ICE Out” pin, as did many other artists such as Billie Eilish, Justin and Hailey Bieber songwriter Amy Allen, Bon Iver, Jack Antonoff Margo Price, Samara Joy and more.\n\n\tBon Iver founder Justin Vernon told Variety on the Grammys red carpet that he was also wearing a whistle pin “to honor the observers in Minneapolis” who “blow the whistle when they see ICE come in,” adding: “They are there to protect their community and they’ve been doing it for weeks. It’s great to stop here and celebrate music and the power of music, but the real work is in the streets of Minneapolis right now, and I’m here to honor them.”\n\t\n\n\t“A week ago, when Alex Pretti was shot and killed in the manner he was shot and killed, I was pretty sure I didn’t have the strength to come out here to L.A. and be a part of all this,” Vernon continued. “Then I started seeing the people coming together in Minneapolis and organizing without a central government. I saw them being dissident. I just want to honor them and amplify what they’re doing. My hope has been dwindling. I started to see something in the organization in Minneapolis that felt like the first sign of hope in a long time”\n\n\n\tShaboozey, who won his first Grammy award by taking home the prize for best country duo/group performance (“Amen” with Jelly Roll), used his acceptance speech to champion immigrants. \n\t\n\n\t“Immigrants built this country, literally. So this is for them, for all children of immigrants,” he said. “This is also for those who came to this country in search of a better opportunity to be part of a nation that promised freedom for all and equal opportunity to everyone willing to work for it. Thank you for bringing your culture, your music, your stories and your traditions here. You give America color. I love y’all so much.”\n\n\tSamara Joy told Variety on the red carpet that she was wearing an “ICE Out” pin because “now is not the time to get super down or downtrodden about what’s going on, but to speak up and speak out for those who can’t at the moment. It’s the least I could do… I want to stand up. I don’t want to draw attention to myself all the time without recognizing the humanity of all the people experiencing tragedies around the world. I want to speak up for those who can’t.”\n\n\t“ICE Out” pins were previously worn by industry talent at the Golden Globes and the Sundance Film Festival to bring attention to ICE brutality in Minneapolis after the shooting death of Renée Good and then of Alex Pretti.\n\n\tWhen asked by USA Today why it was important to send a political message while attending the Golden Globes, nominee Mark Ruffalo answered: “Listen, I want to pretend like this — I want to be here to celebrate, and I am here to celebrate, and I’m proud to have a Golden Globe nomination. But also, this is not normal anymore, and so I don’t know how I how I could be quiet, and I’m feeling a little sick, so it’s hard to BS right now.”\n\n\tNatalie Portman shared a similar sentiment at Sundance, where she was premiering a new movie (“The Gallerist”) amid the ongoing ICE brutality.\n\n\t“We’re at a moment in our country’s history that is quite devastating. It’s really impossible not to talk about what is happening right now and the brutality of ICE and how it has to stop immediately,” Portman told Variety. “But also, there’s a beautiful community that Americans are showing right now. They’re showing up for each other, protecting each other and fighting for their freedom. It’s a bittersweet moment to celebrate something we’re so proud of on the backdrop of our nation in pain.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSteven Spielberg has joined the illustrious EGOT club.\n\n\tThe filmmaker achieved EGOT status, winning a Grammy Award in the best music film category for the documentary “Music by John Williams,” a tribute to his longtime collaborator and the composer behind some of cinema’s most enduring scores.\n\n\tThe Grammy completes Spielberg’s collection of the entertainment industry’s four major art awards, a feat accomplished by 20 other artists across film, television, music and theater.\n\t\n\n\tThe Grammy-winning “Music by John Williams” from Disney+ chronicles the legendary composer’s career and his decades-long partnership with Spielberg, which began with “The Sugarland Express” and includes classics such as “Jaws,” “Schindler’s List” and “Saving Private Ryan.”\n\n\n\tSpielberg’s Oscar resume alone places him in rare company. He has received nine Oscar nominations for best director, making him the third-most-nominated director in the category’s history, behind Martin Scorsese (10) and William Wyler (12). He won twice: for his Holocaust epic “Schindler’s List” (1993) and the World War II drama “Saving Private Ryan” (1998).\n\n\tAs a producer, Spielberg holds the record for the most Academy Award nominations for best picture, with 14, most recently for Chloé Zhao’s Shakespeare drama “Hamnet,” which netted eight Oscar noms. His others include “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (1982), “The Color Purple” (1985), “Schindler’s List” (1993), “Saving Private Ryan” (1998), “Munich” (2005), “Letters from Iwo Jima” (2006), “War Horse” (2011), “Lincoln” (2012), “Bridge of Spies” (2015), “The Post” (2017), “West Side Story” (2021), “The Fabelmans” (2022) and “Maestro” (2023).\n\t\n\n\tOn television, Spielberg won the Primetime Emmy Award for outstanding animated program for “A Pinky and the Brain Christmas” (1995) and three Primetime Emmys for outstanding limited or anthology series for the HBO war drama “Band of Brothers” (2001), the science-fiction miniseries “Taken” (2003) and the HBO World War II companion series “The Pacific” (2010).\n\n\tSpielberg’s Tony journey began in 2022, when he produced the Tony-winning musical “A Strange Loop” alongside his wife, Kate Capshaw and another EGOT recipient, Jennifer Hudson. While Spielberg is not individually listed on the official Tony Awards website, Variety has confirmed with Tony Awards representatives that he did receive a statuette as part of the production’s credited producer group, listed under the “et al” designation. He also earned noms for best musical for “Water for Elephants” (2024) and “Death Becomes Her” (2025).\n\n\t“Thank you to all the Grammy voters, whose recognition of ‘Music by John Williams’ means the world to me and our Amblin team, Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey, and congratulations to our partners at Imagine and the Walt Disney Company,” Spielberg wrote in a statement. “This acknowledgment is obviously deeply meaningful to me because it validates what I have known for over 50 years: John Williams’ influence on culture and music is immeasurable and his artistry and legacy is unrivaled. I am proud to be associated with Laurent’s beautiful film.”\n\n\tWith Spielberg’s Grammy win, the EGOT club remains one of the smallest and most exclusive honors in entertainment. There are 20 competitive EGOT winners to date: Richard Rodgers, Helen Hayes, Rita Moreno, John Gielgud, Audrey Hepburn, Marvin Hamlisch, Jonathan Tunick, Mel Brooks, Mike Nichols, Whoopi Goldberg, Scott Rudin, Robert Lopez, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Tim Rice, John Legend, Alan Menken, Jennifer Hudson, Viola Davis, Elton John, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.\n\n\tTrevor Noah is hosting the Grammys ceremony for the sixth and final time. The show will air on CBS and Paramount+ with a live broadcast and stream starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 PT.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChappell Roan brought a daring look to the 2026 Grammys red carpet, with a topless outfit that had to be covered up while doing interviews with TV networks.\n\n\tThe “Pink Pony Club” singer, who is nominated for two Grammys this year for her song “The Subway,” and won best new artist last year, showed off the daring and dramatic look for photographers on the red carpet. Yet when she was getting interviewed by E!, she donned a cape so she would be able to appear on television.\n\t\n\n\tOn a 2025 episode of “Call Her Daddy,” Roan discussed the differences between her real-life outfits and on-stage ensembles through the years.\n\n\n\t“I’m very modest when it comes to my day-to-day [dressing],” she said in the interview. “I used to dress fucking crazy. Before all of this happened and I had energy and light in my eyes, I would literally just wear my thong out, mini skirt, bottom ass cheeks out, nipples see through. I dressed really, really, bimbo-y. I would wear silicone breast inserts to make my boobs come up to my fcking clavicle. [But] I just lost my shine because it became a job, and then I was like, ‘I’m fucking tired.’”\n\n\tRoan also caused a stir at last year’s Grammys during her acceptance speech for best new artist, which served as a call to action for the music industry.\n\n\t“I told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,” she said in the speech. “I got signed so young—I got signed as a minor. When I got dropped, I had zero job experience under my belt, and like most people, I had… quite a difficult time finding a job in the pandemic and [could not] afford insurance. It was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized. If my label had prioritized it, I could have been provided care for a company I was giving everything to. Record labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.”\n\t\n\n\tSee Roan’s uncensored Grammy look below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmy Sussman/Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“It’s our moment” for Huntr/x and Netflix’s mega-hit “KPop Demon Hunters.”\n\n\tEJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami, the singers from “KPop Demon Hunters,” can add Grammy winners to their list of accolades. Their song “Golden” won best song written for visual media, presented in the pre-telecast ceremony Sunday afternoon. The song, performed by the three singers and written by EJAE, Mark Sonnenblick, DO, 24 and Teddy, was nominated for four Grammys.\n\t\n\n\tIt marks the first K-pop song to ever win a Grammy. This year, Blackpink singer Rosé earned three nominations for her song “APT” with Bruno Mars, including song and record of the Year and best pop duo or group performance. BTS has earned five nods in the group’s career but has yet to win any awards.\n\n\n\tIn the visual media category, “Golden” beat “As Alive As You Need Me To Be” (Nine Inch Nails), “I Lied to You” (Miles Caton), “Never Too Late” (Elton John, Brandi Carlile), “Pale, Pale Moon” (Jayme Lawson) and “Sinners” (Leonard Denisenko, Rodarius Green, Travis).\n\n\t“Golden” is still up for song of the year, which will be presented on the nighttime telecast. In two other categories it was nominated for, best pop duo/group performance and best remixed recording, it lost out in the pre-telecast.\n\n\tWhile the group didn’t perform at the Grammys, Nuna previously spoke about the importance of the nomination. She said, “You’re going to see three Korean faces. To think about the kids who are going to see that, and hopefully for that to shape their understanding of what they can do in this world, is the stuff that is giving me chills up my spine.”\n\t\n\n\tEJAE made history as the first Korean-American female songwriter to be nominated for song of the year.\n\n\tSince its debut on Netflix in June, “KPop Demon Hunters” viewership went up, up, up. According to end-of-year Nielsen data, the Netflix title was by far the most-streamed movie of 2025 with a whopping 20.5 billion viewing minutes in the U.S. alone. Dividing that by the film’s 99-minute runtime gives the equivalent viewership of 207 million full movie watches.\n\n\tThe film, produced by Sony Pictures Animation, topped the year-end charts despite debuting midway through 2025 in June. Netflix gave it a couple of limited theatrical releases following its surge in popularity on the streaming platform.Meanwhile, three of its original songs — “Golden,” “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop” — have been mainstays on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart.\n\n\t“Golden” is also nominated for an Academy Award for best original song, where it’s considered a frontrunner. Huntr/x will be one of two song performances during the show, in addition to the “Sinners” team for “I Lied to You.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump, after affixing his name to Washington, D.C.’s Kennedy Center and prompting multiple artists to cancel engagements at the famed arts center, said he has decided that the facility must be shut down for two years to undergo a “complete rebuilding.”\n\n\tIn a post Sunday on his Truth Social platform, Trump said the Kennedy Center will close on July 4, 2026, “in honor of the 250th Anniversary of our Country, whereupon we will simultaneously begin Construction of the new and spectacular Entertainment Complex.” \n\t\n\n\tTrump said that financing is “completed, and fully in place!” for the overhaul of the facility.\n\n\n\t“This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center, one that has been in bad condition, both financially and structurally for many years, and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment, far better than it has ever been before,” the U.S. president wrote. “America will be very proud of its new and beautiful Landmark for many generations to come. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\n\tAfter his re-election to a second term as U.S. president, Trump ousted the Kennedy Center’s previous Democratic board members and management team and installed himself as chairman.\n\n\tIn December, the White House said the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees — handpicked by Trump — voted unanimously to rename the facility the “Trump Kennedy Center.” The full new name, which is in dispute, is “The Donald J. Trump and John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Legal experts say the renaming of the center is illegal, because a 1964 federal law established its name as “The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts” and explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from adding any other name to the building.\n\t\n\n\tSince the Trump Kennedy Center renaming was announced, multiple artists have canceled their scheduled performances at the center, including Philip Glass, Renée Fleming, “Wicked” composer Stephen Schwartz, Béla Fleck and a production of “Hamilton.” In another sign of turmoil at the Kennedy Center, live-entertainment veteran exec Kevin Couch resigned as the center’s head of artistic programming less than two weeks after his appointment was announced.\n\n\tAccording to Trump, he made the decision to shut down and rebuild the Kennedy Center after a one-year review of the institution in collaboration with “Contractors, Musical Experts, Art Institutions, and other Advisors and Consultants.” The options were either shutting down the Kennedy Center completely before reopening it, or undertaking partial construction while continuing entertainment operations “through a much longer period of time, working in and around the Performances.”\n\n\t“I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind, anywhere in the World,” Trump said. “In other words, if we don’t close, the quality of Construction will not be nearly as good, and the time to completion, because of interruptions with Audiences from the many Events using the Facility, will be much longer. The temporary closure will produce a much faster and higher quality result!”\n\n\tTrump continued, “Based on these findings, and totally subject to Board approval, I have determined that the fastest way to bring The Trump Kennedy Center to the highest level of Success, Beauty, and Grandeur, is to cease Entertainment Operations for an approximately two year period of time, with a scheduled Grand Reopening that will rival and surpass anything that has taken place with respect to such a Facility before.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWoody, Buzz and the “Toy Story” gang are back in the first teaser trailer for “Toy Story 5,” the fifth film in Pixar‘s iconic series, set to release on June 19, 2026.\n\n\tIn the trailer, the toys meet Lilypad, “a high-tech, frog-shaped smart tablet that makes Buzz, Woody, Jessie and the rest of the gang’s jobs exponentially harder when they go head to head with the all-new threat to playtime,” a press release teases. Greta Lee joins the cast to voice the new high-tech toy.\n\t\n\n\tVoice actors Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return as Woody and Buzz, respectively, alongside Joan Cusack as Jessie, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog and Tony Hale as Forky. Conan O’Brien will join the franchise as Smarty Pants, a new character in the series. Andrew Stanton, who helmed “Finding Nemo,” “Wall-E” and “Finding Dory” will direct the film. Stanton co-wrote all four of the previous “Toy Story” films and is credited as the sole screenwriter on “Toy Story 5.”\n\n\n\tThe first “Toy Story” released in 1995, setting a groundbreaking precedent as the first fully-computer animated feature film. Disney distributed the film and its 1999 sequel before buying Pixar in 2006. The franchise returned 11 years later with “Toy Story 3” in 2010 and then again with “Toy Story 4” in 2019, both of which grossed over $1 billion at the global box office and won Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature in their respective years.\n\n\t“Toy Story 5” will be Pixar’s 31st feature. The studio’s most recent film, “Elio,” released on June 20 and only grossed $152 million at the global box office. However, Pixar’s previous film, “Inside Out 2” grossed over $1.5 billion and was the highest grossing film of 2024. Between now and “Toy Story 5,” Pixar will also release the original film “Hoppers” in March 2026.\n\t\n\n\tOverall, Pixar’s box office success has ebbed and flowed in recent years, but its sequels seem to perform with greater consistency. Considering that “Toy Story” is the company’s longest-running and most lucrative franchise, there may be reason for optimism. \n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Toy Story 5” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 46th Cairo Intl. Film Festival returns to the Cairo Opera House Nov. 12-21, blending global prestige with the pulse of a city that lives and breathes cinema.\n\n\tFor artistic director Mohamed Tarek, the guiding principle behind CIFF is simple: care. “Curate comes from ‘to care,’” he says. “That’s what we try to do: to care for the films, for the audiences, and for the city itself.”\n\n\n\tThat spirit informs decisions large and small. Screenings are scheduled to allow room for Q&As and chance encounters rather than packed timetables. Ticket prices remain well below commercial rates, the cinephile badges foster a sense of community, and outreach programs bring students and young filmgoers from Alexandria, Upper Egypt, and the Nile Delta, expanding the festival’s reach well beyond the capital.\n\t\n\n\t“For us, the audience isn’t an afterthought,” Tarek notes. “We think about how people experience the festival, from the rhythm of their day to the conversations between screenings. The buzz from the crowd is the real measure of success.”\n\n\n\tWorking alongside veteran actor and festival president Hussein Fahmi, Tarek helps shape an event that is both accessible and ambitious. Fahmi calls Cairo Film Festival “a cornerstone of Egypt’s artistic memory, a celebration of our cinematic identity that continues to evolve with each generation.”\n\n\tFounded in 1976, Cairo Film Festival remains the Arab world’s oldest FIAPF-accredited “Category A” festival, a distinction it shares with Cannes, Venice and Berlin, but its focus is resolutely contemporary. This year’s edition emphasizes connection: between Cairo and the region, between established filmmakers and new voices, and between cinema and the audiences who sustain it.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re not here to be gatekeepers,” Tarek stresses. “We’re here to be enablers, to give filmmakers across the region a platform.”\n\n\tThat philosophy extends to programming strategy. This year’s lineup spans world and regional premieres, 22 restored Egyptian classics, and international standouts, with short films, for the first time, taking over the Opera House’s Grand Theatre, a gesture toward younger creators and growing audience demand.\n\n\tAt the center of Cairo Film Festival’s professional ecosystem is the Cairo Film Connection, now recognized as one of the Middle East and North Africa region’s most vital pitching platforms. Held as part of the Cairo Industry Days, it links filmmakers from Egypt, Africa and the Arab world with international producers, funders and festival programmers.\n\n\tThe Cairo Film Market, relaunched in 2024, also grows this year, with 26 exhibitors and multiple new partnerships. The festival also expands its industry arm through a new partnership with the Co-Production Salon, the UAE-based networking hub that brings together more than 200 producers, investors, and content executives from across MENA.\n\n\tOn screen, the 2025 program highlights the vibrancy and range of regional cinema. Tarek points to some standouts in the program like official competition selection “One More Show,” (Mai Saad and Ahmed Al Danaf, Egypt, Palestine), a documentary capturing resilience amid devastation as it follows a Gaza circus troupe performing for children against the backdrop of war. Tarek says other local projects like Horizons of Arab Cinema competitor “Complaint No. 713317” (Yasser Shafiey, Egypt), which heads to Rotterdam after a Cairo premiere, show a shift in the reach of homegrown talent. “This used to be the other way around,” Tarek says with a smile. “Now, festivals take films from us.”\n\n\tThe festival’s final screening underscores that spirit. “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” winner of the Silver Lion in Venice, will close Cairo Film Festival before opening Doha, completing a circuit of regional solidarity that Tarek and his team hope to strengthen. “Creating ties is harder than creating competition,” he adds. “But ties last longer, and they give more back to the region.”\n\n\tAlongside discovery, Cairo Film Festival remains attentive to legacy. This year’s tributes to Egyptian cinema veterans include actor Khaled El Nabawy, filmmaker Mohamed Abdelaziz and cinematographer Mahmoud Abdelsamie. Other honorees, who will also headline masterclasses throughout the festival, include Palestinian actress Hiam Abbas and Hungarian director Ildikó Enyedi. Veteran Turkish director Nuri Bilde Ceylan heads the international competition jury.\n\t\n\n\tFor all its international scope, Cairo Film Festival remains inseparable from Cairo’s urban rhythm. Screenings spill beyond the Opera House into suburban cinemas on both sides of the Nile. The American University in Cairo opens its downtown premises to host events, while student collaborations with design and architecture departments help shape festival spaces. Every year, Tarek says, demand outpaces capacity. “It’s a good problem to have,” Tarek admits. “This is a festival people care about.”\n\n\tThat care defines Cairo Film Festival’s identity as much as its programming. From outreach to industry partnerships, the emphasis is on participation, not exclusivity. “We want people to feel this festival belongs to them.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tWhen Juxtapose Studio founder Luke Anderson consulted a medium on the advice of his assistant, he didn’t expect it to change his career — or his life. At the time, he was newly divorced, chain-smoking indoors, and, by his own admission, “a little lost.” “I was in the middle of a messy corporate entanglement and didn’t really know what to do next,” he recalls. “My assistant told me to call a medium. So, I get on the phone, and she tells me to unmerge two companies and go into business with Patricia Arquette. I said, ‘The medium from television?’ And she said, ‘Yeah, that’s the one.’”  \n\t\n\n\tThankfully, Anderson already had Arquette’s phone number from working together on a campaign for his former company, the weed soda brand Cann, so he called her up. Two years later, that psychic suggestion has materialized into Juxtapose Studio — a creative agency officially launching into the public eye this week with Arquette as a founding advisory partner and director. \n\n\n\tCo-founded by Anderson alongside Amanda Goldfine and Hector Keate, the studio has quietly built a reputation for its offbeat, pop culture-savvy brand campaigns that pair unexpected celebrity talent with humor and social commentary. The creative agency has worked with brands like Dunkin’, DICK’S Sporting Goods, Sonic, Arby’s and Buffalo Wild Wings, and has produced viral campaigns featuring everyone from Will Arnett and Kathryn Hahn to Malin Åkerman and The Jonas Brothers. Most recently, they launched a “Wicked: For Good” Dunkin’ campaign with Jonathan Bailey and Cynthia Erivo. \n\t\n\n\n\tBeyond branded work, Juxtapose is also expanding into original film and television, developing projects like “I’m Gonna Kill You” from Andrew Chappelle and “FLEW” from Jorey Worb, alongside a slate of scripted series and features slated for 2026. \n\n\tAs a partner, Arquette will lend advice and perspective drawn from decades in entertainment. “Sometimes we’ll all pitch commercial ideas or talk about people’s skills and strategies,” she tells Variety. “The team is incredibly funny and sarcastic and very cutting-edge. They have a different relationship with messaging and new technologies, and I think that’s fascinating.” \n\n\tShe adds that Juxtapose stands out because “they’re sardonic, and they have a funny way of looking at the world. They understand the humor of young people, they appreciate the brand but are also willing to kind of turn things on their head a bit. There are moments where you want to celebrate the inside joke with your audience, where you want to grab onto things that matter to your generation.” \n\n\tThe studio, which now counts multiple high-profile directors and brand partners, was founded on the belief that advertising can feel as artful and self-aware as the entertainment it borrows from. “Patricia has been a North Star on that front,” Anderson says, noting Patricia’s outspokenness on the use of AI in the arts. “There’s no substitute for a heart and a soul. AI can do a lot to optimize workflows, but creative that has a pulse, it’s not quite able to do that.” \n\n\tArquette agrees that keeping the human element front and center is essential. “You can’t leave that to AI,” she says. “Half the time it’s lying to you and it’s wrong. You still need people with values, and I think Luke, Hector and Amanda are really committed to that.” \n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Turning Door” is rare: an independent and ambitious animated feature based on an original story and script, with original songs. Nicholas Ashe Bateman (“An Almost Christmas Story”) directs, wrote the script, co-wrote the music and is one of the producers, and hopes that what he’s doing won’t be so unique in the future. Bateman, who, for some 15 years, worked in VFX and animation — a self-described “itinerant” worker who spent a lot of time coach surfing — sees a future where young animators are going to reject the status quo.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve never worked at a company, and I don’t have a concept of it, but yet I have to speak that language,” he says. “I don’t even think [young animators] will have to speak that language. I think they’ll just run directly into it and be like, ‘What do you mean there’s a world where I wouldn’t do this on my laptop?’”\n\n\n\tMister Smith Entertainment is selling Bateman’s “The Turning Door” — which features the voices of Alicia Vikander, Jamie Dornan, Jodie Turner-Smith, Bill Nighy and Gillian Anderson — at AFM. The film follows young Ariadlyn, who discovers an ornate wooden box in her parents’ bedroom that opens a door to a magical world called the Turning. To find her way back home and save her parents — now frozen in the real world — Ariadlyn must seek out a sorceress and her crystal vial. Along the way, she will encounter giants, whales, armies, shapeshifters and acrobatic monkeys as she discovers what it means to grow up.\n\n\tWhy did you want to make this film? \n\n\tI’ve been writing these fantastic places and worlds since I was a kid. And as close to a religious sort of text as I have would probably be Tolkien. Those are my ideal stories — from a place of fantasy and humanism and magic, and the wonder of being a kid.\n\t\n\n\tDid your lack of schooling in VFX and animation free you to be more creative? \n\n\tI haven’t arrived at things through a place of standards. I’ve only really arrived at it through me saying I have these pictures that I want to make, and I’m looking around through all the tools to say, how can I get there? And it’s been helpful for me and advantageous for me in my career, because I have been so obsessed with the pictures that I can get to the answer quicker. And I’m not necessarily beholden to “this is how we do this at this company. This is where the files go. This takes three days.” I just got to get to the picture.\n\n\tThe film is very beautiful but has a very specific look and aesthetic, almost like hand-crafted stop-motion, but you’ve used CGI and motion capture. \n\n\tI really want to make images that are deeply personal to me, that I’m understanding as I’m chasing after them. And I hope if I do that I will be able to make cinematic experiences that people haven’t seen. I just want to make a movie no one’s seen, and I think it’s possible, if we kind of unhook from “This is how it’s always been done.”\n\n\tThe film creates so many different worlds and creatures. What was the concept behind those worlds?\n\n\tIn terms of the backgrounds and the concept of fantasy, I love period. I love painters, and so much of the fantasy of the movie is really in conversation with period of fantasy that you don’t really see anymore, this sort of golden age of illustration. So you have N.C. Wyeth and Maxfield Parrish and Howard Pyle. And then even a little bit before that — I love the Pre-Raphaelites, which is just so beautiful and romantic and colorful, and all of that period of adventure has been somewhat devoured and forgotten by the last 20 years of fantasy films.\n\n\tYou have a great cast.\n\n\t I’m really beside myself about the cast, obviously! I grew up doing theater, so when I’m writing, I can’t not be writing for an actor.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEline Van der Velden, a Dutch comedian, was living in Los Angeles in 2012 and going out for auditions. After being told once too often that she needed to lose weight, she created “Miss Holland,” a buffoonish character meant to mock unattainable beauty standards. \n\n\tConceived as a female version of Borat, the character won her an online comedy award and landed her on BBC Three, where she used her improv training and hidden camera videos to conduct street experiments on unsuspecting Britons in the name of social commentary.\n\t\n\n\t“You learn to just not care too much about what everybody is saying and thinking all the time because you just have to do your job,” she told the Times of London. “You learn to get over a lot of shame.”\n\n\n\tAll of that was mere prelude to Tilly Norwood, the doe-eyed actress introduced by Van der Velden and her team in July. The two-minute intro video poked gentle fun at British TV, gender politics, and artificial intelligence — and was made entirely with AI.\n\n\t“Yes, it’s satire,” Van der Velden wrote on Instagram. “Yes, it’s disturbingly close to reality.”\n\n\tThe backlash didn’t hit until two months later, when Van der Velden suggested on a panel in Zurich that “Tilly” would be signing with an agency. She was not, evidently, joking. Nor, she says, was she trying to whip up controversy to promote her AI company, Particle 6. \n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, she notes that other digital characters have had agents.\n\n\t“I didn’t think it was controversial,” she says.\n\n\tThe performers’ union, SAG-AFTRA, disagreed, denouncing her for “devaluing human artistry” and threatening actors’ jobs. Van der Velden — either sincerely or at a level of satire approaching the Swiftian — countered that no one’s job was impacted and that Tilly Norwood required a lot of human artistry, just of a different kind.\n\t\n\n\t“As a creative, I have really enjoyed creating her,” she says. “It’s been just like a writer creating characters. You fall in love with your characters when you’re writing them. It’s a wonderful process. It wasn’t like I just made her in a second, and that was it. You know, it took a long time.”\n\n\tIn the interview, Van der Velden discusses the furor from her perspective and offers her take on the future of AI filmmaking.\n\t\n\t\tHave you ever experienced anything like this before, in terms of the attention and backlash?\t\n\n\tNo, I would say that’s the first for me. I like to spark a conversation, and I’m not shy of controversy. But this was another level.\n\t\n\t\tIn your statement on Instagram, you said your work has always been about holding up a mirror to society. It seems like often these AI conversations end up being more about the person’s reaction to it than about the thing itself. It’s this X-ray of everyone’s anxieties. Is that what you meant?\t\n\n\tI’m always questioning what should we be doing as a society, right? Miss Holland was definitely that, and my new characters will do the same thing, and even the fact that I’m thinking, “Where is our world gonna go?” I think Tilly did a great thing in sparking that conversation. I very much want this creative renaissance to come from the creative industries. We need to take control of it as opposed to it being imposed by the tech industry. There are going to be AI actresses, right? That’s a given. Tilly’s not the first. Tilly’s not taking anyone’s job. She’s created jobs actually. And there’s a lot of humanity and people behind her that people forget about. It has clearly hit a nerve. This visceral reaction that people have to her is part of why I created her — because that’s where the world’s going, right? That’s why I’m saying it’s a piece of art. It is us at this moment in time — where we are and how people are feeling.\n\t\n\t\tIt feels like there’s a couple of paths on AI. And one is post-production, pre-production, using it for mood boards, that kind of thing. And the other is an AI-generated film. Are you pursuing both of those?\t\n\n\tWe have experimented and learned and become experts at these tools. And we thought, “OK how can people use this? Is it just going to be a little bit of pre-viz or a couple of scenes?” And those are the great baby steps that we tell everyone is the place to start — do a little test scene. But now we’re getting to the point where we can start delivering full AI feature films. So that will be where we’re going next.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn terms of an AI film, the SAG-AFTRA response is that there’s no evidence that people actually want to watch this stuff. And I guess the proof will be in the pudding on that. Somebody’s gonna have to create something that somebody wants to pay money to see, right? And then it will be inarguable.\t\n\n\tI think it will be a slow progression. I’m sure in the coming year, there’ll be plenty of effects that will be made with AI. There’ll be some establishing shots, there’ll be some second-unit shots with AI, and then slowly, we’ll progress to a full AI film. And whether people will pay for an AI film or not — I don’t think they’ll know the difference. It’s good storytelling that will be the reason why people will pay for it or not.\n\t\n\t\tWhere does your revenue come from? Is it commercials?\t\n\n\tParticle 6 is very much about helping traditional filmmakers make stuff for less and make it higher quality for less. So we are doing commercials, absolutely, because there are less boundaries around that. We are allowed to make commercials with AI. We might label them in some instances. This past year, we have been working with lots of studios, production companies, independents. Say they have a great film, but they’ve only raised 60% of the budget, and they’re worried they’re not going to be able to make their film. We go, “Right, well, let’s make a few scenes with AI. Let’s do a test project.” We do that test project with them, which is like a minute or two minutes. And they go, “Oh, wow, this can actually work.” And then we go into full production with them, helping on more scenes. And then there is our own creative pursuits. We’ve been making shows for the BBC, for Sky, all these big channels in the U.K. for the past 10 years now. Some, going forward, we’ll be making with AI. So we’re pitching ideas. For example, Sky History is a great new commission we got. That show will come out in December. That’s a hybrid show with a real presenter and with AI.\n\t\n\t\tThere was something on Channel 4 recently where it was like, “This whole show has been about AI and in fact, I am an AI-generated character.”\t\n\n\tYeah, they did the AI presenter. Now the difference is you can do AI well and you can do AI less well. And that’s really where we want to be the premium brand to make premium AI content with.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn the AI space, and certainly in the marketing of it, there’s sort of a leaning into the backlash. Are you familiar with Friend? It’s a little dongle that is supposed to be your AI friend, and you can talk to it and it talks back to you. And there’s subway ads for it. People are so mad about this. But ultimately it’s effective marketing, because people are at least talking about it.\t\n\n\tI don’t know. I really wasn’t expecting [the backlash]. I’m in a AI bubble, right? I didn’t quite realize how far removed people are from this tech. I am living in a different future. I’m dealing with these tools every day and these people don’t even know that you can do it in the click of a button. In the U.K., the reaction was completely not like it was in the U.S. This backlash thing didn’t exist in the U.K., because people understand that we’re using it as a force for good, and that we’re trying to get more projects, more stories told which otherwise wouldn’t get told in the U.K. We’re an ethical production company. We’re trying to do the right thing with the AI tools.\n\n\tMichelle Waldron, publicist: To your point about putting stuff out for marketing purposes. Even before Tilly, Eline was out there talking to the great and the good who knew what she was doing in AI and wanted to learn. We’ve had a massive influx from very big names, production companies, directors, other creators with projects that they want to work together with Eline and the team on. There’s a big reservoir of projects being discussed in development. None are yet ready to be announced. Eline’s under hundreds of NDAs. But there is genuine business that we will be announcing over the coming months with very high-profile names. So this isn’t a marketing thing. Tilly wasn’t a stunt or an exercise. It’s part of a business strategy that is delivering in spades.\n\n\tVan der Velden: It’s funny how everyone thought it was a stunt at one point.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTilly Norwood, an AI-generated character created by Particle 6.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVia Particle 6\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI think people were reacting to the idea that she’s a person and that she has agency as opposed to being a synthetic character. I think that’s what people were freaking out about — the way it was presented.\t\n\n\tThat is my idea for Tilly, right? It’s not to build a hollow image. Just like any character in a drama or a TV series, you would create their full character, wouldn’t you? You wouldn’t just leave them as an empty shell. So we are building a whole personality and her backstory and her brain. And that’s a creative pursuit. It’s fascinating — to build the full character of her.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI think it was the signing with an agent piece where it’s like — you know it’s not a person, right? It can’t sign a contract.\t\n\n\tIf you’re creating a person and a personality, you would want there to be someone to manage all the influx — we have a lot of projects now, and then branded opportunities. We still are talking to a lot of them. But somebody who really understands that digital space is what we want.\n\t\n\t\tNot to diminish, but anybody can create their own AI characters, right? Any studio that wanted to could do what you’re doing.\t\n\n\tThis is the thing. A lot of people try. But to create someone resonant is a very different thing — and to make them look that good. So I encourage everybody to try all these tools. And then once they start working with these tools, they go, “Oh, this is quite hard.” And then they need an expert team to work on their film or their character. And that’s when they come to us.\n\n\t This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix‘s “KPop Demon Hunters” is a frontrunner at the Oscars, but that won’t be the case for the BAFTAs.\n\n\tThe animated film, produced by Sony Pictures Animation and distributed by Netflix, has been ruled ineligible by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, despite a formal appeal by Netflix, Variety has confirmed.\n\n\tBAFTA eligibility rules require films to have a qualifying theatrical release. However, under “exceptional circumstances,” the Film Committee may allow entries that have been made available to the U.K. public through other distribution models, such as event cinema.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix appealed under this clause, arguing that the film’s event-style theatrical run — though held two months after its streaming debut — warranted consideration. But BAFTA’s Film Committee rejected the appeal, stating that the film did not meet the eligibility criteria. Specifically, the film failed to achieve the minimum requirement of “at least 10 commercial screenings in the U.K. for at least seven days in aggregate.”\n\n\n\tNetflix released the film following its limited theatrical release in 264 U.K. cinemas on Aug. 23 and 24. “KPop Demon Hunters” also played in 528 U.K. theaters over Halloween weekend.\n\n\tDespite the setback, “KPop Demon Hunters” remains a major contender this awards season. Its breakout original song “Golden,” performed by K-pop group Huntr/x, recently earned three Grammy nominations, including song of the year. The soundtrack — which also includes singles “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop” — continues to chart on Billboard’s Hot 100, reinforcing the film’s cultural impact.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix will still seek a nomination in the best animated feature category at the BAFTAs with Alex Woo’s “In Your Dreams,” which was recently released on the platform.\n\n\tThe BAFTAs reintroduced the best animated feature category in 2006. The original version of the award, first presented in 1955 and last awarded in 1982, covered both short and feature-length animated films. Over time, BAFTA split the category based on runtime: the best short animation award was introduced in the 1980s, and in 2007, the best animated film category was re-established as a feature-only award. The Academy Awards, by comparison, have recognized animated features since 2001.\n\n\tSince both BAFTA and the Oscars began honoring animated features, no film has won the Academy Award for best animated feature without first securing at least a BAFTA nod. Could this historical trend pose a hurdle for “KPop Demon Hunters” in its Oscar campaign? It’s too early to say definitively, but the absence from BAFTA consideration could open the door for other contenders to rise, including Disney’s “Zootopia 2,” Neon’s “Arco” or GKids’ “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Netflix and Sony are building on the momentum of “KPop Demon Hunters” with a sequel, currently slated for release in 2029.\n\n\tDirected by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, the original film follows a world-renowned K-pop girl group who secretly lead double lives as demon hunters, juggling fame, fandom and fierce supernatural battles.\n\n\tDeadline was first to report the news.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen it comes to the Grammys and the CMA Awards, the twain used to meet, at least sometimes. As in: Once upon a time, Shania Twain — and others of her ilk — could earn top nominations for both shows. But those days seem to be gone for country music, when it comes to Grammy recognition in the categories that are generally referred to as the Big Four. As a genre, country appears to be getting ghosted by Grammy voters.\n\n\tFor 2025, there are a total of 32 nominations spread across those top four categories. The amount of recognition for country or country-adjacent artists among those 32 nods: zero.\n\t\n\n\tNow, country is not alone in failing to earn a seat at the big kids’ table. Rock could sidle up next to country at the bar, drink sloshing in hand, and slur, “Welcome to the club.” There’s a difference, of course: Not even the most diehard defender would argue that rock ‘n’ roll, however popular its oldies are, has experienced a major commercial renaisance since the turn of the century, whereas both anecdotal evidence and hard data make it clear that country is an already massive genre that is experiencing significant growth spurts every year, thanks to infusions of fresh blood among both the artists and audience.\n\n\n\tSo maybe it’s the quality, then? Grammy voters are just becoming more discerning, in quietly deciding nothing Nashville had to offer met the impossibly high standard of an “Ordinary” or a “Swag”?\n\n\tSome will surely make that argument. But for the sake of arguing, let’s take a look at the field for next week’s CMA Awards. Most country-savvy commentators who’ve looked at the slate of nominees for the CMAs have remarked on the cred factor uniting the top nomineet. Tied for the most nominations with six each are three powerful and almost universally acclaimed young figures — Lainey Wilson, Megan Moroney and Ella Langley — who are together establishing that what women in the genre lack (regrettably) in sheer numbers, they’re making up for in sheer quality. Close behind this mini-murderer’s row of female artists with four nods is Zach Top, a neotraditionalist who’s found favor across basically all country quadrants.\n\t\n\n\tMoroney, Langley and Top were all eligible for best new artist, and even considered frontrunners for some of those eight slots. But, faced with all that critically acclaimed, commercially hot talent, what could the Recording Academy do but take a quick look and conclude: \n\n\t“Nah, thanks… we’re good.”\n\n\tYou might be able to write this shutout off as an aberration. After all, it’s happened twice before, in the 21st century, in 2018 and 2004, that no projects with even a tenuous connection to country got a nomination in the top four. But it would be easier to believe that it’s just a passing, cyclical thing if the representation hadn’t been growing noticeably worse in recent years in key categories.\n\n\tConsider that even Lainey Wilson, who may well stand as country’s greatest ambassador to the world for a generation to come, was never able to land a best new artist nomination, let along album, record or song of the year. She would have first been a contender in 2022, when both the CMAs and ACMs gave her their new artist prize. She was more seriously considered a frontrunner in the years 2023 and 2024, only to again come up MIA in BNA. In 2024, she did win a country Grammy, rendering her ineligible for best new artist after that and sparing us the embarrassment of seeing her passed over for the BNA category for a fourth year.\n\n\tAll the other issues we could raise may have arguments or counterarguments about merit, but if you have several shots at nominating Lainey Wilson for best new artist and whiff at that repeatedly, there may be an institutional problem.\n\n\tAnd best new artist is the category that was most likely to field at least one country candidate among the Big Four, in the last couple of decades, up until this year. The dearth of Nashville has been more noticeable in the other three. In record of the year, for instance, there has only been one country song nominated since Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now” won in 2011, and that was Lil Nas X’s and Billy Ray Cyrus’ rather aberrational “Old Town Road” in 2020.\n\n\tIn album of the year, the pickins have been nearly as slim. Beyonce’s “Cowboy Carter” did win in 2025, if you consider that a country album. (I definitely did, even if she didn’t —having officially declared that it was “a ‘Beyoncé’ album, not a country album,” a statement that probably let the CMAs off the hook for not nominating it, even if that piece of rhetoric shouldn’t have been taken at face value.) Prior to that, we also had a 2019 win for Kacey Musgraves’ “Golden Hour,” which some consider her first post-mainstream-country album, preceded by a 2017 nomination for Sturgill Simpson’s “A Sailor’s Guide to Earth,” his first not-really-country-at-all album. You may notice a pattern there: The last time someone who considers himself a straight-on country artist was nominated for a straight-on country album was 10 years ago, with Chris Stapleton’s “Traveller.” And listen, it’s fine, even commendable, maybe, that the Grammys would favor stuff on the very edges of country rather than conventional radio fare. But, as it turns out, in these top categories it’s just been a very short trip from favoring alt-country to favoring no country.\n\t\n\n\tBut here’s an opposing thought, for a second: Downballot, in the actual country categories and the adjacent ones like American roots, Americana, folk and bluegrass, the Recording Academy tends to do just fine, or close enough to fine. That was true when there were committee picks figuring into the mix, and true since those were done away with. The country Grammy categories have had their own peculiarities — like Willie Nelson’s seeming inability to not get nominated for every semiannual album he puts out — but there’s rarely anything nominated in those divisions that doesn’t represent something close to a standard of excellence.\n\n\tAnd the Academy actually made a great institutional choice this year, by splitting what was previously a single country category in two. Best country album has now been subdivided into best contemporary country album and best traditional country album, which is only catching up with what already exists over in the R&B field. (There were some cynics who believed the Grammys were creating the traditional country category just to have a place where Beyonce couldn’t win, after some upset that she bested country’s in-the-pocket contenders last year. History lends itself to those kinds of suspicions, regardless of what is actually happening in board meetings. In any case, ironically, the lone artist-of-color in either country album division was Charley Crockett… in traditional country.)\n\n\tThat kind of move is an indication that the Nashville wing of the Recording Academy is taken seriously by toppers at the overall org, and that the Grammys’ leaders want to do right by country. No doubt there are conversations going on about how to get at least some token representation in the top categories for one of music’s hottest genres.\n\n\tAre the problems intractible, though? Country is in an odd situation where it can claim the hottest star in music who is not named Taylor Swift, Morgan Wallen, yet he declared this year that he is not submitting himself at all for the Grammys, implicitly suggesting that he believes his brand of country is never going to find the favor of voters he probably considers elitist. So it’s mostly country at the sub-blockbuster level that voters will have to be considering — thus making it theoretically easier for genre acts to slip in to best new artist … although it’s not exactly like Lainey Wilson is too obscure or underperforming to make it in for record or album.\n\t\n\n\tThen there’s the question of how much more voter expansion is possible, if Nashville has already come close to maxing out in its signup efforts. The growth is coming most of all in the outreach to the Latin music world, with everyone who is a voter for the Latin Grammys having been invited to come aboard the mothership as well. That’s been an important development (here’s to Bad Bunny, restored to the Big Four after a couple of years off) and will continue to inspire a lot more passion, understandably, than any notion that the Academy needs to scour the corners of Music City to sign up more of the types of people who were favored by the system when nods were plentiful in past decades. (Which is not to say that country isn’t far more diverse than generally represented, especially in its fan base and in its working population in Nashville, but the demographic perception is not altogether divorced from the reality.)\n\n\tPart of the problem may be a lack of passion about the Grammys in some Music Row circles themselves, because of lingering hurt feelings over past shutouts of established artists in the country categories, or — perhaps more importantly — because of the CMAs and ACMs being their real focus of attention. No other genre has its own awards show with an impact rivaling either of those, so it’s easy to understand why there’s no flood of outrage if country comes up short at the Grammys when that’s not their main yardstick anyway. Pop and R&B stars are just always going to take a Grammy snub more personally than folks in country, who may have been trained to look at the Grammys overlooking them and shrug, “It’s Chinatown, Jake.”\n\n\tSo it may be more important to the Grammys than it is to the country community that country gets a fairer shot, if only to reflect reality in hoping that one of the biggest and fastest-growing genres would get at least one token nomination out of 32. If the average Academy voter is going to be too disinterested in country to even check out some of its brighter stars, as we can guess might be the case, there may still be some room to add to the rolls a few more members who’ve heard and can vouch for a Lainey Wilson, at some point in her career, in the Big Four.\n\n\tAnd there is an important demographic development happening in country that the Grammys should be finding a way to applaud: the reemergence of women as a dominant creative force in the field. If you’ve been to anything like a recent sold-out Megan Moroney concert and seen thousands of women screaming their lungs out, despite having been given every sign over the years that their voices aren’t as important, you’d know this is no small breakthrough, creatively, commercially or culturally. It shouldn’t be the CMAs alone recognizing that Moroney, Langley and Wilson are killing it right now, amid a deck that has been stacked against them. Don’t fence them out.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the 1980s, science-fiction movies reveled in presenting the future as a grand bad dream of where we were headed — movies like “Blade Runner,” “Outland,” “The Terminator,” and “Escape from New York.” One of those films was “The Running Man,” adapted from Stephen King’s 1982 novel (written under the pen name Richard Bach) about a homicidal TV competition show, and a book that now looks like the missing link between “Network” and “The Hunger Games.”\n\t\n\n\tReleased in 1987, “The Running Man” was a lumbering Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. You could say that Edgar Wright, the director of the new version, has made it into a decent Bruce Willis movie. The staging is crisp with sadistic timing, the human element rarely overshadows the rigorously staged mayhem, and Glen Powell, as a family man from the lower depths who becomes the survivor hero of a deadly competition show that’s like “The Most Dangerous Game” updated to the age of reality-TV insanity, uses his small darting eyes and buff bod and quick delivery to conjure the vicious spirit that is sometimes, according to the logic of a film like this one, decency’s only recourse. Powell, born and raised in Texas, knows how to chisel his features into a mean glare of revenge. But there’s still something fundamentally sweet about him; he’s doing an impersonation of ’80s-action-hero heartlessness.\n\n\n\tAnd even that’s the simplistic side of the movie. What it leaves out is that Edgar Wright is a filmmaker who never met a concept he couldn’t overelaborate into something strenuously showy and top-heavy and in-your-face. Wright’s previous film, “Last Night in Soho,” started out as a seductive reverie of Swinging London before descending into a dark-side-of-everything monster bash of such wretched excess it just about gave me PTSD. “The Running Man” is more restrained; it hangs together and mostly obeys the rules of mainstream commercial cinema. Yet it’s clear that what drew Wright to the project was his infatuation with the sci-fi sociology of a retro-future USA in which murder is entertainment, the masses are fed this stuff like a drug to keep them in line, and the only way out of the cycle of violence-as-mind-control is for one man to summon the guts and glory to blast it all apart.\n\t\n\n\tThe weird thing about seeing “The Running Man” today is that in the ’80s (and the ’90s, too), all those dystopian visions were rooted in a feeling of future shock. They were wake-up calls from the fascist beyond. America feels closer to those realities now, yet because of that, and because we’ve seen so many garishly downbeat sci-fi movies, dystopia is now the air that our imaginations breathe. There’s precious little shock value left to the decadent society the new “Running Man” unveils.\n\n\tLook, here’s Bobby T., the show’s dapper ringmaster host, played by Colman Domingo with the big grin and swanning camp relish of a media pied piper of amorality. Here’s the studio audience howling at everything he says like a horde out of “Idiocracy.” Here’s the stacked-deck stakes of the hunt — three contestants, who have to survive for 30 days, heading anywhere they can to stay alive, but hot on their tail are the Hunters, a task force of elite assassins led by Evan McCone (Lee Pace), who wears a creepy invisible-man mask underneath his aviators and will hunt you down before you’ve made it through your first week.\n\n\tAnd here’s the power behind it all: Dan Killian, played by a chomping-grinned Josh Brolin, the corruption coming off him like steam. Killian is the head of the Network (and therefore the most powerful person in the United States — I guess there are some prophecies that don’t come true), who meets with Powell’s Ben Richards and offers him a deal with the devil. He wants Ben to be his star “Running Man” contestant, to draw on his reservoir of anger and elude his captors, all to boost the ratings. And here’s how it works: The audience roots for the Hunters to prevail, but the more a contestant survives, the more he becomes a rebel celebrity, which just feeds the audience’s desire to see him blown away. Because that’s going to be a real entertainment climax.\n\n\tBen, fired from one job after another for the sin of “insubordination,” lives in a prison-like apartment with his wife, Sheila (Jayme Lawson), and young daughter, who in the opening scenes has the flu, which means that she may die. They can’t afford medicine or a doctor (now that’s starting to sound like a true prophecy). For that reason alone, Ben decides to go to the Network and audition for its slate of exploitation game shows, where the payoff exists in direct proportion to the danger. He doesn’t want to end up on “The Running Man,” but that’s what Killian wants. He takes one look look at Ben and sees a born proletarian contestant-as-angry-action-star. The two have struck a deal before Ben even starts running.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s a repetitive monotony to the structure. Ben keeps running into people who assist him, like his old friend Molie (William H. Macy), who sets him up with a fake ID and mustached-geek disguise. (The film draws a bit on Powell’s “Hit Man” persona as an identity chameleon.) There’s a spectacular sequence set in a UVA hotel in Boston, where Ben evades captures by blowing up the entire place from the basement, which is very satisfying in an old-school action-junk way.\n\n\tBut Wright, trying to dig more than Arnold’s movie did into the essence of King’s novel (King is one of the new version’s executive producers), has more on his mind than “explosive” confrontations. He devotes a lot of time to an episode centered on Michael Cera as a jittery writer of zines obsessed with his late policeman’s father’s hot-dog cart (that’s what his dad had to do after he was drummed out of the force for being an honest cop), and to Emilia Jones as a hyperkinetic civilian Ben targets on the road for a quick escape. The climactic sequence set aboard a military aircraft, with Ben facing off against the Hunters, would have been simpler in a Bruce Willis thriller, and more satisfying.\n\n\tAs Ben survives, he becomes an insurrectionary leader, branded with the slogan “Richards lives!” But the reason this seems overblown is that the movie is trying to have it both ways. It wants to portray murderous reality TV as the height of social derangement, a fraud to hook the masses. But it also says that TV, with the right hero, could be a springboard for revolution. In “The Running Man,” that fantasy plays like the pulpiest of dreams.\n",

Diddy is serving a 4-year prison term after his federal conviction for transporting male escorts across state lines for the purpose of prostitution. The music mogul was transferred from Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center to Fort Dix on October. 30.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to the CBS News documents, Diddy has already run afoul of prison rules just a few days into his incarceration at Fort Dix. Diddy reportedly made a three-person call to discuss issuing a statement to The New York Times ... but ended up in violation of the Bureau of Prisons rules. BOP guidelines bar inmates from adding multiple people to phone calls for fear inmates could use them to coordinate criminal activity.\n      \n\n          During the November 3 call, Diddy reportedly spoke with an unnamed woman about getting in touch with \"the digital person\" about blogs. Then Diddy allegedly discussed arranging weekend visits with loved ones, recommending they bring \"200 singles.\" Prison rules prevent visitors from coming into the facility with cash, but coins are allowed for the vending machines.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          After the two were done talking visitation, the woman reportedly added a third party to the call -- an unidentified man -- in violation of prison regulations.\n      \n    \n          According to the docs ... Diddy later told prison officials that he was chatting with his female lawyer, who added his PR guy to the call to draft a statement to be sent to the NYT after he approved it. Diddy denied he was discussing blogs and provided no reason why he would want to issue a statement to the NYT.\n      \n    \n          In addition, Diddy claimed he was uninformed about the third-party phone call regulations ...  but prison officials still recommended he lose 90 days of phone privileges and 90 days of commissary privileges, according to CBS News. Prison officials filed the ruling November 4 -- CBS News says -- but it's unclear what the outcome was.\n      \n    \n          CBS News also reports Diddy is now employed as a chaplain's assistant at Fort Dix, which is considered a much better gig than other prison jobs. Typically, inmates who work in the chapel clean the office, preserve the library, and do record-keeping. It was earlier reported Diddy was working laundry duties at the facility.\n      \n    \n          What's more, CBS News says Diddy is receiving intensive drug treatment through the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP) unit. According to the BOP, inmates who participate in the RDAP program can get their sentences reduced by up to one year.\n      \n      ",

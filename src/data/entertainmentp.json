    "body": "\n\tIliza Shlesinger wrote and stars in “Chasing Summer,” an upcoming romantic dramedy directed by award-winning filmmaker Josephine Decker. The filmmakers say the picture will provide a “contemporary take on the millennial-coming-of-age” tale, but will tell the story through a distinctly female lens.\n\n\tThe film boasts an impressive ensemble that includes Megan Mullally (“Will and Grace”), Garrett Wareing (“The Long Walk”), Lola Tung (“The Summer I Turned Pretty”), Tom Welling (“Smallville”), Aimee Garcia (“Dexter”), Cassidy Freeman (“The Righteous Gemstones”) and Jeff Perry (“Scandal”).\n\t\n\n\tShlesinger is an actor, writer and stand-up comic whose on-screen credits include “Good on Paper” (which she also wrote), “Spenser Confidential,” “Pieces of a Woman,” “The Righteous Gemstones” and “Instant Family.” Her seventh special, “Iliza Shlesinger: A Different Animal,” is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video. She is the author of “All Things Aside: Absolutely Correct Opinions” and “Girl Logic: The Genius and the Absurdity.” Shlesinger hosts the podcast “AIA: Ask Iliza Anything.”\n\n\n\tDecker is best known for her Berlinale and Sundance-selected features “Madeleine’s Madeleine” and “Shirley,” the latter of which won her a Special Jury Award for Auteur Filmmaking at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. \n\n\tIn “Chasing Summer,” Shlesinger stars as Jamie, who, after losing both her job and boyfriend, retreats to her small Texas hometown where friends and flings from a fateful high school summer turn her life upside down. The film was shot this past summer, but never announced.\n\t\n\n\t“This movie is for anyone who’s ever gotten in their own way — it’s a love letter to my generation, my home state, and (Millennial) nostalgia,” said Shlesinger. “Every day of production I was floored by the caliber of cast and crew involved, and I’m so proud of what we created. I’ll carry it with me forever.”\n\n\t“It’s been really exciting to work on a project where fun leads,” said Decker. “Our production was an incredible joy — with a stellar cast and crew — and our story explores a kaleidoscopic misunderstanding about a place, its people, and our main character’s past.”\n\n\t“The alchemy of Iliza’s emotionally resonant story and powerful performance combined with Josephine’s poetic filmmaking is unique,” said producers Rob Guillermo, Nihaar Sinha, Ray Maiello and Sam Pressman. “As producers, we are grateful to champion these remarkable filmmakers and this extraordinary cast as they redefine the boundaries of the genre.”\n\n\tShlesinger is represented by UTA, Avalon Management, 2pm Sharp and Brecheen, Feldman, Breimer, Silver and Thompson. Decker is repped by CAA, Gary Ungar (Exile), Meghan Oliver and Gang Tyre.\n\n\tMullally is repped by UTA. Wareing is repped by WME and 23 Management Group. Tung is repped by CAA and GSA Entertainment. Welling is repped by Innovative Artists and Art International Group. Garcia is repped by Paradigm Talent Agency and Atlas Artists. Freeman is repped by the Kohner Agency and Robyn Bluestone Management. Perry is repped by Innovative Artists and Principal Entertainment LA.\n\n\t“Chasing Summer” was shot by Eric Branco and is also produced by Shlesinger, Houston King, Paula Paizes and Kara Baker. Executive producers are Decker, Louis Krubich, Dan Fried, Christopher Schwarzenegger, Bianca Rusu, Jack Masterson, Andre Eanes and Rhodes McKee.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBen Winston is known for producing live events that deliver great spectacle and surprise. Winston is about to take on the biggest assignment of his career, now that he’s has been tapped to serve as executive producer and creative director of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\tWinston will steer those key TV moments for the Summer Games as well as the Paralympic Games, which will also be held in Los Angeles. He will partner with Olympics veteran Scott Givens, who will serve as executive producer for production on both events. Winston’s Fulwell Entertaiment and Givens FiveCurrents banner have set a joint venture dubbed FulFive that is already working on planning for the events for LA28, the entity tasked with producing the Summer Games and Paralympics.\n\t\n\n\tPeter Rice, the film and TV veteran who was tapped in July as LA28’s head of ceremonies and content, said the combination of Winston and Givens sets the stage for an epic live TV production that will kick off the Summer Games on July 14, 2028. Both Opening Ceremony is a massive four-hour live TV undertaking. Rice acknowledges that the pressure is on for the Los Angeles games to reflect the deep well of creativity and innovation found in Hollywood’s hometown.\n\n\n\t“The Olympics are a unifying force in the world, in which people always come together and they put aside national differences,” Rice told Variety. “And you have these incredible athletes who compete their whole lives, most of whom are competing for very little monetary gain. But the amount of energy and time that they have to train to become Olympians, and then the ceremonies, I just love that unifying sense about the ceremonies.”\n\t\n\n\tRELATED CONTENT: How Ben Winston Kept His ‘Fun Secret Project’ Under Wraps and Started the Countdown for LA 2028\n\n\tLA28 leaders took a long time to consider the best options for tackling production challenge. The bar is high because the Paris Summer Games were so widely praised for the execution of the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\n\t“There is no event of this scale in the world. We also are putting it on in Hollywood, which has a unique opportunity to tap into the entertainment world that no other city anywhere can do,” Rice said. “So we were really looking for, how do we combine those two things? And with Ben and Scott, it really does combine the ability for us to feel really confident about the logistics of the ceremonies, and to imbue it with a uniquely sort of L.A.-based entertainment perspective, which Ben’s going to bring. And they’re both California companies, which is also something we love about this arrangement.”\n\n\tWinston had something of an audition for the job last year when he helped pull off the tricky Paris-to-LA handover during the closing of the 2024 Summer Games in the City of Light. Winston worked with Tom Cruise to pull off an elaborate TV stunt that saw Tom Cruise ride out of the Paris venue on a motorcycle — only to emerge in the Hollywood hills, parachuting out of a plane by the iconic Hollywood sign with the Olympic flag in tow. That telecast also featured musical performances from artists with deep Los Angeles roots: Billie Eilish, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Snoop Dogg.\n\n\t“The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games represent the pinnacle of human achievement, and Los Angeles, the home of storytelling, offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine what these Ceremonies can be,” Winston said. “I couldn’t be more honored, grateful and delighted to take on this role, and to work alongside Peter, Scott and the whole LA28 team, to create unforgettable Ceremoniesthat will truly inspire and entertain, while cerebrating the Olympic and Paralympic spirit and the creative energy of this city.”\n\n\tWinston is known for executive producing numerous Grammy Awards telecasts as well as concert specials such as CBS’ “Adele: One Night Only” and Disney+’s “Elton John: A Farewell From Dodger Stadium.” \n\n\tGivens has produced more than 400 live events and held roles with 15 Olympic Games and produced 63 global ceremonies. He has earned the prestigious Olympic Order, one of the highest kudos bestowed by the International Olympic Committee.\n\t\n\n\t“These Ceremonies represent the ultimate challenge in live production — bringing together global headliners, thousands of performers, best-in-class technologies and split-second timing on the world’sbiggest stage,” Givens said. “I’m thrilled to partner with the incredibly talented LA28 team alongside Ben and Peter to execute a vision that honors the athletes and creates a unifying memory for Los Angeles, California, our nation and a global broadcast audience in the billions.”\n\n\tThe Opening Ceremony of the 2028 Summer Games will be held July 14, 2028, primarily at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and at Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium, which will be dubbed “2028 Stadium” for the Games. The Closing Ceremony will come on July 30. The Paralympic Games will follow on Aug. 15 and close on Aug. 27. Los Angeles previously hosted Olympic Games in 1984 and 1932. \n\n\tRice emphasized that Givens’ deep institutional knowledge of the Olympics and Winston’s entertainment instincts will make for a potent mix. \n\n\t“It feels like a dream team,” Rice said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount TV Studios is reorganizing its leadership team amid the mass layoffs at Paramount following its merger with Skydance.\n\n\tMatt Thunell, head of Paramount TV Studios, announced the news in a memo to staff Thursday, writing: “I know these are a lot of changes, but I am confident this new structure will strengthen collaboration, streamline decision-making, and super-charge our growth. In the coming weeks, we will continue the integration process, spending time on creative and business strategy under our new leadership team —more on that work soon. Finally, I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues who are transitioning out of their roles. They have each contributed enormously to our organization, and we are grateful for their leadership, partnership, and many achievements. Please join me in wishing them the very best.”\n\t\n\n\tSince August, Thunell has been running a merged division comprised of Skydance Television and Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios — effectively making him the replacement for Paramount’s now-ousted Chris McCarthy. The new combined TV operations are called Paramount Television Studios, a revival of the original Paramount TV arm that shuttered in 2024.\n\n\n\tSee below for Thunell’s memo to staff announcing the leadership changes.\n\n\tTeam,\n\n\tOver the last few months, we’ve brought together teams from Skydance, MTV Entertainment Studios, Showtime, Awesomeness, and Nickelodeon into one studio focused on making world-class television series. As we move forward in this new incarnation of Paramount Television Studios, we must make changes to position our business for growth and success. To do that, we’re evolving our organization to better serve creators, audiences, and partners around the world through a new, streamlined structure. \n\t\n\n\tOur studio has an enviable roster of senior executive talent, and after spending time with everyone, I’ve made key leadership decisions to ensure we achieve our ambitious goals. But this means we must also say goodbye to colleagues we deeply admire and respect. In the spirit of transparency, I want to share the following updates on our new leadership structure:\n\n\tProduction\n\n\t· Drew Brown, currently EVP, Physical Production for Skydance, will be the new PTVS Head of Production, reporting to me. Drew is a seasoned executive who has been instrumental in some of Skydance’s biggest shows including Reacher for Prime Video. Prior to Skydance, he led Production at AMC Studios, where he was a driving force on series including The Walking Dead.\n\n\t· With this change, Keri Flint, EVP and Head of Global Production for MTVE/Showtime, will be stepping down. Keri has been with the company for more than two decades, and in that time, she has been an incredibly valued member of our team. Her credits and accomplishments are too numerous to count; we thank her for her lasting impact.\n\n\tCreative\n\n\t· Shelley Zimmerman and Carolyn Harris will continue in their roles as EVP, Head of Development and EVP, Head of Current, respectively, and will continue to report to me.\n\n\t· Keith Cox, currently President of MTVE Studios & Showtime and a champion of Yellowstone since day one, will continue to oversee our expansive lineup of shows from the Taylorverse and will report to me.\n\n\tCorporate Functions\n\n\t· COO Courtney Armstrong, CFO Mark Badagliacca, EVP Human Resources Talia Robinson, and EVP Global Communications & Media Relations Brooke Robertson are expanding their respective purviews to encompass PTVS, in addition to their current roles at Paramount Pictures. A key strategic initiative for our studio is deeper partnership and collaboration with our Features colleagues. Placing these leaders across the entire studio is an important first step in achieving this goal.\n\n\t· Dawn Lach, SVP, Global Communications & Publicity, will transition from Skydance TV to PTVS, reporting to Brooke.\n\n\tBusiness Affairs & Legal Affairs\n\n\t· Moving forward, Business Affairs and Legal Affairs will operate as two distinct groups. Our Head of Business Affairs will be Virginia Lazalde McPherson, who previously served as EVP, Business Affairs at Showtime, and was Global Head of Business Affairs at YouTube Originals prior to that. Bringing a wealth of experience and top-notch relationships, I’m excited to partner with Virginia in this new role.\n\t\n\n\t· Lance McPherson will transition from his role as EVP, Deputy General Counsel and Head of Business & Legal Affairs to EVP, Legal Affairs. He will oversee all legal efforts for our studio going forward.\n\n\t· Jeff Hegedus is stepping down from his role as EVP, TV Business & Legal Affairs for Skydance. Jeff is known as a selfless mentor and a steadfast colleague. I thank him for his leadership and dedication during long tenure at Skydance.\n\n\tFinance\n\n\t· Mel Rauch will be joining the team as Head of Finance. Previously, Mel was at Netflix, where she served as VP of EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) Content Finance & Strategy. I worked closely with Mel at Netflix for many years, where she was beloved as a creative problem solver and trusted business partner.\n\n\t· Reporting into Mel will be Arturo Reyes, who will transition from his current role as EVP and Global Head of Production Finance at Skydance into his new role as Head of Production Finance for PTVS.\n\n\t· Candice Brancazio, CFO, Paramount Media Networks, Showtime & MTVE, and Matt Hengemuhle, SVP, FP&A, will be exiting their respective roles, with Matt taking on a new remit in our Direct to Consumer business. We’re grateful for their leadership and contributions and we will be announcing a new FP&A lead for our studio soon.\n\n\tTalent & Casting\n\n\t· Trevor Rose will depart from his role as EVP, Head of Global Talent and Content Development for Showtime/MTVE and is moving to a leadership role in our TV Media group. With this, Tricia Wood will be expanding her role as EVP, Casting for Paramount Pictures to also oversee casting for PTVS. We believe this structure will encourage on-screen talent to work more seamlessly across our Features and Television Series.\n\n\tNickelodeon Live-Action and Awesomeness\n\n\t· Shauna Phelan, EVP, Head of Live Action Series, Films & Talent, Nickelodeon and Awesomeness TV will be stepping down. Shauna has been a longtime leader of the Nickelodeon and Awesomeness teams and has been pivotal in shaping those brands. Thankfully, Shauna is not going far, as we are in discussions with her about working with us as a producer on some of our most important titles. Going forward, we remain committed to creating high-quality content for kids, teens and families — building on our incredible IP, championing new ideas, and operating as one unified team.\n\t\n\n\tI know these are a lot of changes, but I am confident this new structure will strengthen collaboration, streamline decision-making, and super-charge our growth. In the coming weeks, we will continue the integration process, spending time on creative and business strategy under our new leadership team —more on that work soon. \n\n\tFinally, I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues who are transitioning out of their roles. They have each contributed enormously to our organization, and we are grateful for their leadership, partnership, and many achievements. Please join me in wishing them the very best.\n\n\tThank you, as always, for your passion, resilience, and commitment. I cannot wait for all that we will accomplish together.\n\n\tWith gratitude,\n\n\tMatt\n",

    "body": "\n\tOnly one person can say they’ve got a Stanley Kubick film, “Oppenheimer,” “Stranger Things” and “The Simpsons” on their resume, and now Matthew Modine can check off the iconic animated series off his bucket list. Modine (whose Kubrick film was “Full Metal Jacket”) will appear on Sunday’s episode of “The Simpsons” in a role that’s somewhat reminiscent of his “Stranger Things” scientist.\n\n\t“I would have done anything they asked me to do, but it was a kind of tip of the hat to Dr. Brenner, the ‘Papa’ character on ‘Stranger Things,'” Modine said. “I was just happy to be a part of this historic show. I don’t know how to put into words what an honor it is to be a part of it.”\n\t\n\n\tWritten by Al Jean, “Bad Boys… For Life?” — the fifth episode of “The Simpsons” Season 37 — is mostly a flashback episode as Marge recounts to the family what happened when things got especially out of hand between Bart and Homer. Cut to four years ago, when Homer still had a tuft of hair and a younger Bart was struggling to connect with Homer’s parenting style.\n\n\tEventually when no one, including Dr. Hibbert, can help them, Marge takes Bart to a specialist. Modine plays Dr. Leonard Stern, a state psychologist tasked with investigating Bart’s tumultuous relationship with his father. At first, Dr. Stern is sympathetic: “Bart, you’re a very special boy. And sometimes special boys have to go to special places.” \n\n\tBut after he watches a video of Bart tormenting Homer, Dr. Stern determines Bart is a psycho, and gets a special court order from the state to haul him away. \n\n\t“Al was so fast and efficient,” Modine said. “He knew exactly what he wanted, and he knew when he got it and when he could move on. It was kind of like getting on board a really amazing horse, and just holding on. Because he was galloping right from the from the get go, you know, and I just was everything I could do to just hold on.”\n\t\n\n\tThis is also a landmark episode for Jean, who announced last week that this is the final episode he’ll serve as a showrunner. Jean is a “Simpsons” OG, having been with the show since its 1989 origins. He became co-showrunner with Mike Reiss in Season 3 and later departed to create “The Critic.” He continued occasionally showrunning “The Simpsons,” and became the show’s sole showrunner in Season 13. Matt Selman, who has been a showrunner since Season 23, continues in that role.\n\n\tWrote Jean on X last Sunday: “Thank you for watching @TheSimpsons tonight … next week the last (Simpsons) episode I’ll showrun (at least for now) although as always I’m still thrilled to work on the show. 11/2 an episode by a brilliant new director and a writer I am never satisfied with …”\n\n\tJean said he will continue to serve as a consulting producer on “The Simpsons” while also working on non-“Simpsons” projects — and he says one of those “outside things” involves “The Critic” star Jon Lovitz.\n\n\tHere’s the logline to the episode: “Is Bart Simpson truly a bad seed? Homer and Marge must find out once and for good in the “Bad Boys . . . For Life” episode of ‘The Simpsons’ airing Sunday, Nov. 2 (8-8:30 p.m. ET/PT)\n\n\tAnd here’s a first look at Modine in Sunday’s episode:\n",

    "body": "\n\tJapan Society has revealed that Shinichiro Watanabe, the acclaimed director behind “Cowboy Bebop,” “Samurai Champloo” and Adult Swim’s recent hit “Lazarus,” will headline Foreign Exchange 2025: Cross-Cultural Conversations with Anime Visionaries, a film and discussion series taking place Nov. 17-22 in New York City.\n\n\tFounded and curated by award-nominated creator and director LeSean Thomas (“Yasuke,” “Cannon Busters”), the expanded 2025 edition shifts from last year’s singular creator dialogue to multi-creator conversations exploring how U.S. and Japanese artists collaborate across borders. Watanabe will be joined by Justin Leach, producer of Lucasfilm’s “Star Wars: Visions” and Netflix’s “Leviathan,” with Thomas serving as host.\n\t\n\n\tThe series kicks off Nov. 17-19 with classroom visits by Thomas and Leach to New York University, Pratt Institute, Parsons School of Design, Fordham University and the School of Visual Arts, where they’ll conduct talks with aspiring animators and filmmakers.\n\n\n\tFrom Nov. 20-22, the three will present events at Japan Society’s NYC headquarters. Programming includes a free moderated talk for students and educators on skills needed to work in U.S. and Japanese animation, three public talks about animation production and inspiration, and four public screenings including both “Lazarus” and “Cowboy Bebop: The Movie.”\n\n\tAmong the highlights: “Making of Lazarus: Story, Action, and Global Collaboration” (Nov. 20), featuring Watanabe and Thomas exploring the creative DNA of “Lazarus,” from its action choreography to its score by Kamasi Washington and Bonobo; “Star Wars: Visions & The Future of Global Animation” (Nov. 21), with Leach discussing the anthology series’ global production model; and “Black Musical Traditions and the Anime of Shinichiro Watanabe” (Nov. 22), examining the influence of Black American music across Watanabe’s body of work.\n\t\n\n\tJapan Society will also host a limited-time pop-up exhibit showcasing production art from “Lazarus” personally selected by Watanabe, and will have available for purchase copies of “Foreign Exchange: The TV Anime Creations of LeSean Thomas Vol. 1 – Yasuke,” a 260-plus page companion art book. Rounding out the week, Rough Trade Records will host an autograph signing for Watanabe on Nov. 22.\n\n\tThe series is co-presented by The Japan Foundation, New York and The Imagination Project Inc., a NYC-based nonprofit focused on providing career technical education for underserved marginalized youth.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMubi, the global distributor, streaming service and producer, has acquired Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s romantic drama series “The New Years” (“Los años nuevos”) for distribution in North America, Latin America, U.K., Ireland, the Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, New Zealand and India.\n\n\tThe 10-part “The New Years” is set to launch on Mubi Dec. 3 with a double episode, followed by one episode every week. Mubi has also dropped an official trailer, hot on the heals of the title’s Mubi poster.\n\t\n\n\tStruck with Spain’s Movistar Plus+, the biggest Spanish pay TV/SVOD operator, the deal is a milestone for Mubi – its first Spanish series – and also for Movistar Plus+, marking one of its most significant multi-territory licensing pacts to date. \n\n\n\tCo-created and co-directed by Cesar Award-winning Sorogoyen (“The Beasts”), “The New Years” follows Ana (Iria Del Río,  “Apocalypse Z: The Beginning of the End”) and Óscar (Francesco Carril, “Three Goodbyes”) from their first meeting on the night they both turn 30, through nine subsequent New Year’s Eves. \n\n\t“She lives in a shared flat, dislikes her job, and changes friends frequently. He’s a doctor with a stable career and loyal friends—until they meet and fall in love,” the synopsis says. “10 consecutive years, with each episode capturing a single night that reveals how love evolves, the series is an honest examination of modern commitment and choosing someone, year after year.”\n\n\tCreated by Sorogoyen and Paula Fabra and Sara Cano – Fabra and Cabo having gone on to become lead writers on recent Netflix No. 2 global non-English-language hit “Angela,” – “The New Years” world premiered at the 81st Venice Film Festival in alongside new series from Alfonso Cuarón (“Disclaimer”), Thomas Vinterberg (“Families Like Ours”) and Joe Wright (“Mussolini: Son of the Century”). \n\t\n\n\tBowing on Movistar Plus+, the show was hailed by several Spanish journalists as the best series of the year. Some rave reactions can be read in Mubi’s trailer. \n\n\n\n\n\t“We are very glad that ‘The New Years’ will be the first Spanish TV series on a platform committed to independent cinema. Having the opportunity to reach viewers from so many different territories is a great opportunity for our original content,” said\n\n\tFabrizia Palazzo, distribution manager at Movistar Plus+ International.\n\n\t“The New Years”is produced by Domingo Corral, Fran Araújo of Movistar Plus+, as well as Eduardo Villanueva, Nacho Lavilla and Sorogoyen at Madrid-based Caballo Films (“La Ruta”). The series is also co-produced by Arte France.\n\n\tIt is little surprise that Mubi has moved to acquire much of the world on “The New Years,” having lifted off as a streaming service, now with a community of 20 million cinema-loving registered users, by offering elevated director-driven movies such as Pedro Almodovar’s “Pain and Glory.” This year it brought four films to Cannes main competition including Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” and Kelly Reichardt’s “The Mastermind.” \n\n\tFew directors in Europe have broken out in the last decade with such force as Sorogoyen, who scored a 2019 Oscar nomination for his short “Madre” and won a Best Foreign Film César for “The Beasts” in 2023, beating out four Cannes Festival 2022-23 competition winners. He is currently naked movie “The Beloved,” starring Javier Bardem.\n\n\tMubi’s ‘The New Years’ Trailer \n\n\tA play for a large audience, “The New Years” qualities are often caught, if just glimpsed, in Mubi’s official trailer. Sorogoyen has told Variety that he shot “The New Years” like cinema, structured like “The Best of Youth,” split into two movies, in the case of “The New Years” of 180 and 220 minutes.  \n\n\tSorogoyen also brings a sense of sub-genre with every episode varying in tone. Some of their key beats are caught in the trailer such as the couple’s cute-meet (Ep. 1) to recognition of love (Ep. 2) to family drama (Ep.4) to a horror-tinged confrontation (Ep. 5) at and after a night at a club in Berlin.\n\t\n\n\tAs hinted in the trailer, “The New Years” posits a common relationship paradox: the same divergent qualities which attract Ana and Oscar to one another – her spontaneity, ability to live in the moment, his solid or stolid stability – also threaten to derail their relationship. \n\n\t“The New Years” also charts Ana’s growth. She is still living a disoriented youth in the series’ initial going. “You need to grow up,” Oscar rebukes her in the trailer. “You can do whatever you want,” her mother encourages her later. Gradually, in “The New Years,” Ana finds her place in the world. One large question, playing out to the series’ very end, is whether that is with Oscar. \n\n\t“The New Years” is not just a couple’s movie, however, Sorogoyen argues. It “begins talking about a couple and ends up talking about life, about motherhood and losing loved ones, how friends go away, losing friendships, and how you find your place in the world or believe you do or ask: ‘What am I doing with my life?’ ‘Do I have to do something with my life?’” Sorogoyen told Variety. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The New Years” Poster\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAudiences haven’t seen the last of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who will return in another “Conjuring” movie. \n\n\tA prequel film is in development at Warner Bros. and New Line, with short film director Rodrigue Huart in talks to direct. Franchise veterans Richard Naing and Ian Goldberg, who co-wrote the two prior “Conjuring” films, 2023’s “The Nun II” and this September’s “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” are on board to pen the screenplay. No deals have closed at this time.\n\t\n\n\t“The Conjuring: Last Rites” was billed as the final installment in the paranormal series. However it quickly became clear that wouldn’t be the case after the film became an outsized box office hit, earning a franchise-best $487 million globally.\n\n\n\tIt’s unclear whether Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson will return for the upcoming cinematic entry after “Last Rites” concluded the story of the Warren family. This next chapter is expected to go back to the beginning and focus on the early years of the ghost hunting couple. That likely means that new actors will take over the helm of the “Conjuring” Universe.\n\n\tSeparately, “The Conjuring” is expanding to the small screen with HBO in development on a television series that will continue the story established in the feature films. Plot details have been kept under wraps but Nancy Won was recently hired as the show’s writer, executive producer and showrunner.\n\n\tAcross nine films (spinoffs include “Annabelle” and “The Nun”), the “Conjuring” universe has become the highest-grossing horror franchise in history with a combined $2.7 billion. Plus they’re often low-budget, which makes for bloody-good profit margins. James Wan created the occult-tilted property while Peter Safran has served as a producer on every installment.\n\t\n\n\tHuart doesn’t have any feature credits to his name but has helmed several short films including “Transylvanie,” which won a jury prize at SXSW in 2024, as well as “Trigger” and “Real.” He’s also writing and directing “Suffer Little Children,” a remake of the 1976 Spanish horror film “Who Can Kill a Child?” for Paramount.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA high-stakes thriller executive produced by Afrobeats star Burna Boy titled “3 Cold Dishes” — about three African women exacting cold revenge on the men who sexually exploited them — is looking to take pan-African cinema to the next level.\n\n\tSet across Nigeria, Benin and Côte d’Ivoire, “3 Cold Dishes” is directed by Nigerian filmmaker Asurf Oluseyi (“Hakkunde”), who learned his craft by watching YouTube and also makes music videos, including several for Burna Boy, who has two tracks in the film.\n\t\n\n\t“My aspiration is for ‘African cinema’ to not just be a term for collective African films, but to actually become a [global] genre just like we have Afrobeat,” Oluseyi tells Variety.\n\n\n\t“As Africans we have shared stories; we have shared realities,” the director adds. “I hope we can get to a point where we have a film that is not just seen as a Nigerian film, or as a North African or South African film, but as an African film. That’s been my dream. I know it’s very tough, but someone needs to start.”\n\n\tDriven by Burna Boy’s global influence and Oluseyi’s assured direction, the thriller — about three women named Esosa, Fatouma and Giselle who were sold as teenagers into the sex trade and reunite across West Africa 13 years later to plot their revenge — opened Oct. 3 at a packed premiere at London’s Cineworld ahead of its Nov. 7 nationwide U.K. release.\n\n\tMeanwhile, “3 Cold Dishes” is set to open the Africa International Film Festival (AFRIFF) in Lagos, Nigeria, on Nov. 2, followed by a theatrical rollout across roughly 26 African countries. Theatrical outings in France, the U.S. and Canada are also planned.\n\t\n\n\t“We went to London first, and we were very strategic with London,” says Oluseyi. “For one, it’s home for Burna. And two, it’s home to a huge percentage of the Nigerian diaspora.”\n\n\tAs Oluseyi explains, the thinking behind the “3 Cold Dishes” rollout strategy is: “If we start the premiere in Nigeria, it could label this as a Nigerian film. But if we go to London, we’re saying: ‘It’s a Pan-African.'”\n\n\t“3 Cold Dishes” is produced by Francis Nebot’s Ifind, Alma Prods., Asurf Films and Martian Network, and co-produced by Pape Boye‘s Black Mic Mac. Burna Boy is executive producing through Spaceship Films, the company he co-founded with Bose Ogulu.\n\n\t“We all know about Afrobeat conquering the world,” Nebot pointed out, before noting that Burna Boy ran a “3 Cold Dishes” trailer on giant screens earlier this year in front of 80,000 people at the end of his concert at Paris’ Stade de France.\n\n\tTalks are now ongoing to premiere the film in L.A., Atlanta and Houston during the second half of November “because Burna Boy is doing a U.S. tour around this release window,” says Oluseyi. He added that its Canadian release is confirmed for Dec. 16 in tandem with Burna Boy’s Canadian tour.\n\n\tBesides having the Burna Boy boost, another key aspect in conceiving “3 Cold Dishes” as a breakout picture is that it’s in English and French (with subtitles) or alternately in a full French dub version, “which is pretty rare” for an African film, notes Nebot, who also points out that the thriller is shot in CinemaScope.\n\n\tNarratively, Oluseyi says what’s crucial is that “3 Cold Dishes” looks at the sex trafficking trade within the African continent, not outside. “We’ve had titles from Africa that have explored trafficking,” he says. “But they are always from Africa to Europe.” However, “the real data is that 90% of these victims are trafficked from one African country to another,” he says.\n\n\tOverall, what makes “3 Cold Dishes” different from most movies that seek to reach Western audiences out of Africa is that it’s meant to be a mainstream movie. “It was important that we make a film that people can watch and people can pay for, and that we can make money back,” he says.\n\n\tIncidentally, the budget for “3 Cold Dishes” was roughly $1 million, which the director and producers say is a big budget for an African movie.\n\t\n\n\tWorld sales on “3 Cold Dishes” are being handled by Pape Boye, while CAA reps the film for North America.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a flurry of activity just hours before the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Universal Music Group announced that it has settled its copyright-infringement litigation against the AI music platform Udio, and that it also has entered into a strategic alliance with Stability AI to develop “next-generation professional music creation tools.”\n\n\tThe announcements arrive against a backdrop of complex legal disputes over whether AI companies can “train” their products on copyrighted music without authorization. Last year, the RIAA, acting on behalf of all three major record companies, sued Udio and the Suno platform for “mass infringement” of copyright; the majors’ legal action against Suno continues. \n\t\n\n\tAt a time when music companies’ revenue from streaming is leveling off and new sources of income are being sought, the threat to that revenue from AI is very real and alarming to shareholders; all three major music groups are public companies. The timing of UMG’s announcements — arriving at 830 p.m. ET Wednesday and 8 a.m. ET Thursday — suggests a last-minute rush to complete the deals (or strategic planning) in time for UMG’s earnings report, scheduled for 1:15 p.m. ET on Thursday. \n\n\tIn the Udio announcement, UMG said the companies “will collaborate on an innovative, new commercial music creation, consumption, and streaming experience” launching next year. It also said that “in addition to the compensatory legal settlement, the new license agreements for recorded music and publishing will provide further revenue opportunities for UMG artists and songwriters.”\n\t\n\n\tUMG noted that Udio’s existing platform will remain available in the months before the new product launches, “with creations controlled within a walled garden and the service amended in multiple ways — including fingerprinting, filtering, and other measures — before the launch of the updated service,” allowing users to stream, share and customize music inside a “licensed and protected environment.”\n\n\tUMG chairman-CEO Lucian Grainge said, “These new agreements with Udio demonstrate our commitment to do what’s right by our artists and songwriters, whether that means embracing new technologies, developing new business models, diversifying revenue streams or beyond.”\n\n\tAndrew Sanchez, Co-Founder & CEO of Udio, added: “We couldn’t be more thrilled about this collaboration and the opportunity to work alongside UMG to redefine how AI empowers artists and fans.”\n\n\tIn the Stability AI announcement, UMG said the new music-creation tools will be powered by “responsibly trained generative AI and built to support the creative process of artists, producers and songwriters globally.”\n\n\tUMG said that these tools will be powered by “responsibly trained generative AI and built to support the creative process of artists, producers and songwriters globally,” and that Stability AI’s research and product teams will “work closely with UMG and its artists to research artist needs and technical approaches for the next generation of music creation tools.” In this effort, Stability AI will work with UMG’s research and product teams to build software trained on licensed music catalogs.\n\n\tSignificantly, the partnership effectively allows UMG into the creation and development process in an effort to create “fully licensed, commercially safe AI music tools” that “support both artists and rightsholders while preserving the integrity of the art form.”\n\n\tStability AI is facing multiple copyright-infringement lawsuits, including one from Getty Images photography service that alleges the company illegally used 12 million images without permission or compensation.\n\n\tUMG EVP/chief digital officer Michael Nash said, “This agreement is an extension of our fundamental orientation that our artists and songwriters are the cornerstone of our business. With AI, as with everything else we do, we start with what best supports our work to help them achieve creative and commercial success and build from that foundation to forge new and better commercial and creative opportunities.\n\t\n\n\t“And as we’ve made abundantly clear,” he continued, “we will only consider advancing AI tools and products based on models that are trained responsibly.”\n\n\tStability AI CEO Prem Akkaraju added, “UMG has long been a leader in technological innovation in music. This partnership marks the next chapter of music creation. At Stability AI, we put the artist at the center and build AI around their unique needs because real transformation has always come from a combination of art and science.”\n\n\tUMG has struck similar AI-related deals with YouTube, TikTok, Meta, BandLab, Electronic Arts and others.\n\n\tUniversal Music Group’s third-quarter earnings report takes place Thursday afternoon. The company posted relatively small gains in the second quarter but stronger ones for the half year that ended June 30, with its publishing division seeing 11%-plus year-over-year gains in both categories. Overall for the quarter, UMG posted revenue of €2,980 million, up 1.6% year-over-year (4.5% in constant currency). For the first half of the year, revenue of €5,881 million increased 6.4% year-over-year, or 6.9% in constant currency.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tCornerstone has come on board to handle worldwide sales for Australian psychological horror “From Below.” Rising actress Alyla Browne, who played the young Furiosa in “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” and whose credits include “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” and “Sting,” has been cast in the lead role.\n\n\tCornerstone is launching sales at the American Film Market.\n\n\t“From Below” is writer-director Sean Loch’s feature debut following his shorts “Rear View Mirror,” “Leech” and “Sleepwalker,” which earned him best director honors at the Short & Sweet Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tProduction on “From Below” is slated to begin in Queensland, Australia next year, supported through Screen Queensland’s Screen Finance and Development funds.\n\n\n\tSet against the backdrop of the Australian Outback, “From Below” tells the story of 15-year-old Riley (Browne) travelling across the Outback with her father when they come across two seemingly abandoned cars at an isolated desert crossing. When an invisible force drags her father away Riley finds herself in a life-or-death struggle against a terrifying creature that is only visible to its next victim.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Sam Price for Pathline Pictures, continuing her partnership with Loch that started on his shorts. Natalie Coleman, former head of investments at Head Gear, will executive produce together with Alison Thompson and Mark Gooder from Cornerstone.\n\n\tThe screenplay featured on the Black List, trending under “Top Horror Scripts” for six weeks. During the development process, Loch collaborated closely with filmmaker Joel Anderson, known for “Lake Mungo” and his work on “Late Night With the Devil.”\n\t\n\n\tPrice commented: “Sean has delivered an exceptional screenplay that blends survival thriller, creature feature and Outback horror to push beyond the familiar tropes of the genre. Having Cornerstone on board is a real testament to that, with their sharp taste for identifying standout projects. Alyla Browne is perfect for the challenging lead role, and the unforgiving Outback of Birdsville, QLD, is the ideal backdrop for this story.”\n\n\tGooder said: “Sean is a hugely talented writer/director and we’re proud to be involved with his debut feature. Sean’s script is strikingly original, full of surprising twist and turns and infused with real tension.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Ping-Pong,” by Palestinian writer-director Saleh Saadi, competed in the development category of this year’s Cairo Film Connection, and won the I Sound Award, worth $20,000 in sound services, a Cinetech Award worth $5,000 in post-production services, and a Special Touch $1,500 cash prize. Variety spoke to the film’s producer, May Jabareen of Philistine Films.\n\n\tWhat is the film’s story and some of the key themes addressed?“Ping-Pong” is the story of Issam, living in the occupied 48 territories grappling with personal loss, as the war on Gaza erupts nearby. He finds unexpected refuge in nightly ping-pong games at his neighbor’s house. These games become a vital sanctuary, exploring how we preserve our humanity and find moments of joy and human connection amidst overwhelming grief and chaos. It’s a film about the quiet, resilient acts of survival.\n\t\n\n\tSound is an important part of the storytelling for this project. Can you explain the approach that will be taken?Sound is a main character and an emotional force in this film and is built on stark realism. The sounds of warplanes, drones and distant explosions haunt the characters and shatter any fleeting moments of innocence and joy. The project also explores, primarily through sound, the rhythm of grief and its constant back-and-forth. We plan to create a realistic and precise soundscape to immerse the audience, ensuring that the tension and grief of the experience in occupied Palestine while the atrocities a few kilometers away unfold and are never forgotten.\n\n\n\tWhat is the current stage of the project?We’ve completed the first draft and are working on the second draft. We received a prize from Masna3 (a new initiative from Tunis, by Mehdi Hmili and Moufida Fedhila), a combination of cash and in-kind consultancy, and last month participated in the Doha Film Institute Producer’s Lab.\n\t\n\n\tWhat are the benefits from attending the Cairo Film Connection?Even though we won’t be present physically at Cairo Film Connection, due to the fact that we couldn’t acquire a visa, we hope the project will get wider exposure and be introduced to potential partners and collaborators. We look forward to receiving constructive feedback from professionals, especially the jury, which would be very beneficial to the project, especially at this stage.\n\n\tWhat other projects do you have in progress?I have been working with the director Annemarie Jacir and producer Ossama Bawardi for a few years on the period-epic feature film “Palestine 36,” as associate producer. The film had a Gala Presentation premiere at Toronto this year and is Palestine’s official selection for the best international film category at the Academy Awards.\n\n\tThe film begins in 1936, when the Arab Revolt stirred beneath the weight of the British rule, as the British Empire tightens its grip on Palestine. Amidst an anti-colonial revolt, and Jewish refugees fleeing persecution from Europe, all sides converge in a decisive moment for the entire region.\n\n\tI also acted as the Palestinian co-producer for “House of Hope” by Marjolein Busstra, which premiered in IDFA this week, and was nominated for the Best Dutch Film Award. It’s an intimate, observational film about Manar, a Palestinian woman who runs a pacifist Waldorf school in the occupied West Bank with her husband Milad.\n\n\tAmid escalating violence, stress, and uncertainty, they strive to provide a safe haven for young children.\n\n\tIn addition to the development of the feature film “Ping-Pong,” I’m developing a dramedy series set in Palestine, two feature length documentaries by Palestinian directors, and an animated series.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrendan Fraser has always been transparent about his disappointment in Warner Bros.’s decision to shelve “Batgirl“: the completed, but unreleased DC superhero movie that would have seen the Academy Award-winning actor play the villainous Firefly opposite Leslie Grace as the titular heroine. In an interview with the Associated Press on Nov. 19, Fraser opened up about what was lost for creatives and audiences when the film was blocked from release and what its cancellation communicates about the current state of Hollywood.\n\t\n\n\t“The product— I’m sorry ‘content’—is being commodified to the extent that it’s more valuable to burn it down and get the insurance on it than to give it a shot in the marketplace,” Fraser said. “I mean, with respect, we could blight itself.”\n\n\n\tDirected by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, “Batgirl” was meant to be the next installment in the DC Extended Universe. Alongside Grace and Fraser, the movie was also supposed to introduce Jacob Scipio as Anthony Bressi and Ivory Aquino as Alysia Yeoh in the franchise and reprise J.K. Simmons as Jim Gordon and Michael Keaton as Batman.\n\n\tProduction took place in Scotland between November 2021 and March 2022, but while in post-production, Warner Bros. announced that it would not release the film as scheduled, opting to shelve it as a cost-cutting measure in Aug. 2022. Not a frame of footage has ever been screened publicly.\n\n\t“A whole movie,” Fraser remarked. “I mean, there were four floors of production in Glasgow. I was sneaking into the art department just to geek out.”\n\n\tThe actor continued to talk about the cultural impact that the film could have made. “The tragedy of that is that there’s a generation of little girls who don’t have a heroine to look up to and go, ‘She looks like me.'” Grace would have been the first Batgirl to headline her own film and one of just a handful of women to get a standalone superhero movie in the male-dominated genre.\n\t\n\n\tAt the same time, Fraser also acknowledged that older fans would delight in seeing Keaton return as the Caped Crusader. “I mean, Michael Keaton came back as Batman. The Batman!” he said. Keaton made his debut as Batman in Tim Burton’s 1989 film, “Batman,” and reprised the role in its 1992 sequel, “Batman Returns.” He eventually donned the cape and cowl in the DCEU for the first time in 2023’s “The Flash.”\n\n\tWith Warner Bros now for sale and the DC intellectual property revamped as DC Studios under James Gunn and Peter Safran’s leadership, the odds of “Batgirl” ever releasing seem even more dubious than they did two years ago. \n\n\tFraser won the Academy Award for his performance in 2022’s “The Whale.” He currently stars in “Rental Family” and is confirmed to reprise his role as Rick O’Connell from “The Mummy” in the series’ upcoming fourth installment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPublic media is hastily bracing for a future without help from Washington.\n\n\tIn the wake of the Trump administration slashing more than $1.1 billion from public broadcasting, New York Public Radio has turned to private donors to fill the gap. The organization raised $1.7 million on Tuesday night at its Stand With Public Media gala, which honored “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert and his wife, Evelyn McGee Colbert, for their ongoing fight for free speech. Colbert says he hopes this erosion of federal support won’t continue under future administrations.\n\t\n\n\t“I have no idea whether it’ll continue into the future, and I hope it won’t,” Colbert told Variety inside the gala. “So many people value what public media can give them. In a lot of communities around the United States, public radio is the only local news because local newspapers have failed. It gives people a sense of community, lets them know what’s happening in and around where they live. And so it’s really critical that these stations continue.”\n\n\n\tBut organizations like New York Public Radio, according to its president and CEO LaFontaine Oliver, have no choice but to prepare for a scenario where federal appropriations may never return.  \n\n\t“We have to look for new revenue pathways,” Oliver explained. “We have to connect to our communities and audiences in different ways. It means we’re looking for institutional funders and philanthropists to ideally step up. We’ll look for ways to monetize the content we produce. This is a time of reinvention for our system. And that spirit of reinvention will serve us, even if federal funding comes back in some slice or portion.”\n\t\n\n\tIn some parts of the country, the withdrawal of federal support has taken on urgent stakes. Local leaders in Alaska have described the loss of public media funding as “a life and death issue.” In dozens of remote communities with limited roads and broadband internet access, public radio is often the only conduit for emergency alerts and fast-changing weather conditions. Alaska station owners warn that they may lose 40% to 90% of their funding, and without backup revenue sources, are at risk of going dark.\n\n\tAt the same time, as trust in national and local news declines, surveys show Americans view public media more favorably and credibly when compared to for-profit outlets.\n\n\t“I think people in the public media space are telling us the facts,” McGee Colbert said. “It’s really hard to go to places now that are unbiased, independent and purely factually-based.”\n\n\tColbert and McGee Colbert, self-described public radio loyalists, say they get most of their news from WNYC. “And because it’s commercial-free news,” Colbert explained, “you get a longer exploration of the story. “You could spend 20 or 30 minutes on a story, rather than 7 minutes. That’d be a long time on cable news. And I can also cook while I’m doing it. I don’t have to look at anything.”\n\n\tColbert’s appreciation for independent reporting arrives at a complicated time for his own relationship with broadcast television. CBS labeled the sudden cancellation of his late-night show as a “financial decision,” but several prominent media voices and organizations — including the Writers Guild of America — have questioned whether the move was connected to Colbert’s on-air criticism of Paramount’s $16 million “60 Minutes” settlement with President Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Colbert said it was “a reasonable thing to think” his show’s cancellation was a politically motivated decision, but it wasn’t “fruitful” for him to “engage in that speculation.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile shooting “The Smashing Machine,” Dwayne Johnson pitched himself to join co-star Emily Blunt in “The Devil Wears Prada 2” as a character “who knew fashion” and “was cool.” Johnson and Blunt reflected on the self-pitch during Entertainment Weekly’s “Awardist” podcast on Nov. 19.\n\n\tJohnson said, “I pitched myself. I told her when she was shooting,” to which a tongue-in-cheek Blunt added, “He tried.” Blunt joked that Johnson’s character would be someone “who’s great at walking in heels.” Johnson clarified, “Size 15 heels.”\n\t\n\n\tBlunt concluded, “You should see him in a pair of heels. Hot,” as the two laughed.\n\n\n\t“The Devil Wears Prada 2” is the highly anticipated sequel to the 2006 dramedy, which saw Anne Hathaway’s Andy Sachs navigate the cutthroat world of high fashion journalism as the assistant to Meryl Streep’s indomitable editor-in-chief, Miranda Priestly. 20th Century Studios is set to release the long-awaited sequel next year, with Blunt reprising her role as Emily Charlton alongside Hathaway and Streep.\n\n\tThe sequel will also see the return of Stanley Tucci as Nigel Kipling, Tracie Thoms as Lily and Tibor Feldman as Irv Ravitz, as well as David Frankel returning to the director’s chair. New to the cast are Kenneth Branagh as Miranda’s husband and Justin Theroux, Lucy Liu and Simone Ashley as original characters. It’s also confirmed that Lady Gaga will have a small role in the film. “Actually, the role Dwayne was going for,” Blunt joked about the pop star’s upcoming part.\n\n\tDetails about the sequel’s story, written by the original film’s screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna, are under lock and key. Blunt said that she “was thrilled” with the script, but candidly responded to questions about details, “You’re trying to get me to talk about the movie and I can’t tell you anything.”\n\t\n\n\tBlunt stood her ground when asked about the status of her character, who remained Priestly’s loyal senior assistant at the end of the first film. “I can’t tell you,” Blunt said. “I will literally be killed.”\n\n\tJohnson did chime in that the film’s fanfare was immense, with massive crowds trying to get a glimpse of its New York City set. “Emily would send me these videos. She was kind of in her car, waiting to step out on set in New York City, out in the streets, she was like, ‘Look at this!'” Johnson said. “It was wild. Like, pop star level sighting.”\n\n\tEvidently, curiosity about the film is rampant, but fans will have to wait until it releases in theaters on May 1, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for plot points, cameos and the ending of “Wicked: For Good” now playing in theaters, as well as minor spoilers for the “Wicked” stage show.\n\n\t“Wicked” makeup designer Frances Hannon had her work cut out for her. \n\n\tAfter successfully finding the perfect verdant hue to turn Cynthia Erivo green, she had to continue each character’s arc for the film’s conclusion, “Wicked: For Good.” \n\t\n\n\t“For Good” doesn’t just continue the story of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda’s (Ariana Grande) friendship; it also gives the backstory of Dorothy’s companions: The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion and The Scarecrow.\n\n\n\tFiyero (Jonathan Bailey), who is in a love triangle with Elphaba and Glinda, becomes the Scarecrow, while Boq (Ethan Slater), a Munchkin, transforms into the Tin Man. All the transformations were done practically.\n\n\tHere, Hannon breaks down how Slater and Bailey transformed into their respective characters.\n\t\n\t\tBoq’s Transformation\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn “Wicked,” Boq becomes smitten with Glinda the moment he lays eyes on her on their first day at Shiz University. But Glinda has her eyes set on Prince Fiyero, so she convinces Boq to court Nessarose instead. Nessa believes Boq truly cares for her.\n\n\tIn “Wicked: For Good,” Nessa becomes the Governor of Munchkinland after her father dies. When Boq tries to leave, she uses her power to oppress the Munchkins, forcing Boq to stay with her. When Elphaba learns of this, she visits her sister to try to help. However, things go wrong, and Nessa casts a spell from the Grimmerie, hoping to have Boq’s heart. Things end with Elphaba regaining control and stepping in.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the scene, Boq begins to feel his heart shrink, and metal starts attaching itself to him. Elphaba leaves, telling Nessa that he is asleep. After she leaves, he awakens and smashes through the door with an axe. Boq is now the Tin Man with no heart, and his transformation is complete.\n\n\tIn pulling it off, Hannon explains that Jon M. Chu and Marc Platt were very specific about what they wanted. It also required a collaboration with production designer Nathan Crowley, costume designer Paul Tazewell and prosthetic makeup designer Mark Coulier. “The main thing was to make sure that whatever we did never removed the character from being so accessible and allowing all that emotion to come through,” Hannon says. “Even though he’s covered in prosthetics, and they were all practical, you still saw Boq underneath it all.”\n\n\tAside from keeping his emotions intact, the details of what made him the Tin Man were just as important.\n\n\tCoulier began by making a plaster cast of Slater’s face. A few weeks later, Slater saw the Tin Man design on a Styrofoam head. He recalls thinking, “It doesn’t really look like me; it looks like the Tin Man.” Coulier assured him that the pieces would stretch to contour to his face. \n\n\tIn total, Slater says 11 pieces were applied to his face, including cheekbone prosthetics that changed his cheek line and additional pieces to alter his jawline. \n\n\tThe application process took four hours. “I would go sit in the prosthetics chair with the team, and they would start applying glue to my eyebrows to tack them down,” Slater explains. “They started layering on these pieces of silicone, piece by piece. It needed to be meticulous and precise.”\n\n\tSlater’s eyelids and lips were painted silver, and he wore dentures. “I had contacts to make my eyes gray-silver,” he adds. \n\n\tThe actor recalls seeing himself in the mirror for the first time: “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It looked like me, but it didn’t look like me. The thing that really blew my mind was it didn’t look anything like it did on the Styrofoam head because it had completely morphed to my face. I could lift an eyebrow, and the eyebrow would lift, and you could see my dimples come through.”\n\n\tThe Tin Man’s body was developed using metal pieces from Nessa’s office. Hannon says, “The little square where his heart would be was part of the fireplace. On the tray were sugar bowls and milk jugs, and the handles of the jug were his ears. On his fingers were salt and pepper pots, thimbles, and bits from the fireplace.” She adds, “The little rivets around the edges were very delicate and hand-picked and chosen by Jon.”\n\t\n\n\tHannon worked with Coulier to find the balance of keeping Slater’s performance visible through the design. “You want him to still have a human quality, so you don’t give him a bulbous nose from the teapot or anything silly. You stay within all the parameters that leave the human that brings the Tin Man to the performance.” When designing him, they wanted to nod to the previous film without copying what had come before. “We started by looking at the silvers. The arms had to match the face. Mark [Coulier] painted the pieces in advance. It matched the other pieces on his body, but it didn’t look different from the other parts.”\n\n\tBy the time of “March of the Witch Hunters,” there was a slight progression in his makeup. \n\n\tThe tin was now starting to show details of rust after he had been out in the rain. \n\n\tAs for Slater’s hair, it needed to be scraped and flattened before a bald cap could be put on. Boq was given extension pieces to make his hair “architectural and big.” Slater says the bald cap was as tight as possible. “It took about 30 minutes to do because there’s a lot of hair there. I feel like I have a lot of hair now, but this was three times as much.” \n\n\tHannon adds, “The little funnel went on at the last minute.” In total, “It took roughly four hours. The suit was left to last because once he was in that suit, he was pretty much standing all the time.” \n\n\tIn addition to the practical makeup, VFX was used. Chu gave credit to the VFX team for their work, saying, “There were mechanical joints on the Tin Man body that were done by VFX and some seams cleaned up.”\n\n\tFiyero’s Transformation\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversal\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFiyero’s transformation is foreshadowed. The lyrics of “Dancing Through Life” hint at what his future holds, and costume designer Paul Tazewell weaves the easter egg into his Emerald City guard costume.\n\n\tDuring “No Good Deed,” Elphaba casts a spell to protect Fiyero from torture after he’s been captured by the Wizard’s guards. The spell turns him into a Scarecrow, which allows him to live.\n\n\tHannon says they definitely took a nod to the film in creating the Scarecrow.\n\n\tShe explains, “We didn’t go for that big baggy look over the head with the big rope around his neck. What Paul Tazewell did was brilliant. He went for the straw coming out of the areas of the seams and everything in his uniform.” She adds, “Mark had made a burlap collar so that where the buttons on the shirt were all busting open.”\n\t\n\n\tHannon made the Scarecrow’s wig and eyebrows from grass and straw.\n\n\t“I used blonde in Fiyero’s hair as a very strong point to carry through that change. The blonde in his own hair in film one and the opening of film two, then develops into the straw quality from the field.”\n\n\tThe wig was made from heads of wheat and sewn in, but with very little hair in it,” She adds, “Then you had that cute little cap that Paul designed from bark on the top.”\n\n\tAdditionally, Hannon points to a subtle detail in Jonathan’s eyes. Fiyero comes from Winkie Country, which is very much in the blue palette. Hannon says, “He had blue contact lenses. When he goes to Scarecrow, we went back to Jonathan’s own color eyes, which are really deep, dark brown, to bring back the earthy quality.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt this year’s Cairo Intl. Film Festival, Iraqi filmmaker Zahraa Ghandour marks a notable milestone with “Flana,” a documentary centered on the lived realities of Iraqi women. After its world premiere in Toronto, the film arrived in Cairo as part of the Horizons of Arab Cinema competition, not just as a promising debut but as a rare work in Iraqi cinema, shaped by a woman living inside the country and focusing on stories too often sidelined or silenced.\n\t\n\n\tGhandour’s path to filmmaking began more than a decade ago, not in film school, but on Iraqi television. At barely 20, she began presenting and eventually directing the popular documentary show “52 Minutes,” a program she now calls her “foundation.” Week after week, she travelled across the country to report on social issues like early marriage, domestic violence, inequitable laws, women’s prisons — stories so pervasive that colleagues and audiences alike joked she worked only on “women’s issues.” Yet for Ghandour, these were not “women’s issues,” they were the systemic realities Iraqi women navigate every day. “There were endless subjects to cover,” she recalls. “And I loved it. I went everywhere in Iraq because of this show.”\n\n\tBut even as she acted in several Iraqi independent films, she felt none went far enough. “They were all about complicated women, but none were written or directed by women,” she notes. When she began working on “Flana” in 2018, she realized she could no longer hide behind other women’s stories without confronting her own. Growing up, she recalls being treated as “less” than her brother, not by him, but by a society structured to celebrate boys to the detriment of girls. “I felt it was missing the truth if I didn’t speak about the story I knew the most,” she reflects. “It’s all connected.”\n\t\n\n\t“Flana” begins with Ghandour’s desperate search for her childhood friend, Noor, whose disappearance two decades earlier haunts her to this day. It expands into an excavation of the systemic violence facing Iraqi women, from patriarchal traditions to the country’s unresolved legal failures around honor killings. For Ghandour, the personal becomes a rallying cry. “If these personal things aren’t addressed in a fair way, then they’re political,” she argues. “People should be shouting nonstop in the streets to stop little girls from being thrown out on the streets, to stop these criminals from murdering their wives and daughters, to have fair laws.”\n\n\tBringing that truth to the screen, however, required not just artistic clarity but constant strategizing, and immense risk. Ghandour speaks openly about the fear that has accompanied the project from the beginning. “Sometimes I fear the reaction physically,” she admits, pointing to worries about retribution. She was more nervous for her Arab premiere in Cairo than for Toronto “because of how this society thinks and because there were many Iraqis in the audience, I was nervous about the possible reaction.”\n\n\tHer concern stems from experience. When she has spoken publicly about gendered violence in the past, she has been accused of “destroying the Iraqi image,” as though acknowledging injustice were a betrayal rather than a demand for accountability. “There is a lot of denial in society,” she laments. “People take it personally because they’re not doing anything about it.”\n\n\tDuring production, she often had to lie to authorities in order to shoot safely, submitting a fake synopsis about empowered Iraqi women gaining opportunities. Within private homes, birth rooms, and shelters, the women who allowed her to film trusted her with their identities and, in some cases, with their lives. Several women initially refused to appear on camera, though one changed her mind after building trust with Ghandour. Even then, Ghandour made the difficult decision to remove entire characters from the film if she feared for their safety. In one case, she excluded a key figure because presenting her story might expose her to retaliation.\n\n\tThe core of the film, however, centers on two women: Ghandour’s aunt, a midwife whose home becomes a refuge, and Natalie, also known by the pseudonym Leila, whose journey through shelters and family violence reveals the human cost of Iraq’s legal vacuum where women are concerned. Both women have seen the film. Ghandour’s aunt offered an emotional, encouraging response, while Natalie was struck by her on-screen appearance, conscious of the reconstructive surgery she needs for her injured chin, a result of the violence she faced. The team is now helping raise funds for the operation.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s title captures the erasure Ghandour is fighting against. In Iraq, “flana” is a term used for a woman whose name is forgotten or dismissed, “as if she’s not worthy to mention,” she explains. She deliberately turned it into a name, a presence.\n\n\tInternationally, “Flana” is arriving at a moment when Arab women directors are gaining unprecedented visibility. Ghandour, fresh off of screening the film at IDFA, sees this momentum clearly. “Women are working more on films and having the chance they deserve,” she observes. In Iraq, the film arrives amid a small but significant shift: the country issued its first-ever public film fund this year, and young filmmakers from the 1980s and 1990s generations are forging a path without formal film schools or established industry infrastructure.\n\n\tYet “Flana” is singular. It is the first Iraqi film about women made by a woman living in Iraq. “That mattered to me more than being selected by a major festival,” she remarks. “It’s a point on the road, one of many. But it’s noticed.”\n\n\tCairo, unexpectedly, became a turning point. “I didn’t expect people to care,” she recalls of the film’s sold-out screening at the Opera House. “That theater being full changed something in me. It gave me trust, in ‘Flana’ and in Arab audiences.”\n\n\tNext, Ghandour plans an Iraq premiere, a national screening tour in towns without cinemas, and a companion book of essays, poetry and comics inspired by the film. Broadcasters across the region are in conversation. Al Jazeera, for example, has expressed interest.\n\n\tBut at its heart, Ghandour hopes “Flana” sparks something far simpler and far more pressing: a reckoning with the shelters, honor killings, and the everyday brutality facing women across Iraq, and further, a path toward accountability.\n\n\t“The experience showed me it’s possible to do more, to keep pushing,” she concludes. “And for anyone who tries to undermine us, we know exactly what we’re doing.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA report published by the Cairo Film Connection, during Cairo Industry Days (Nov. 16-20), provides key data on recent trends in the Egyptian film industry, including the pivotal role played by Saudi Arabia’s burgeoning exhibition and production sector.\n\n\tEgyptian cinema is the oldest and largest in the Arab world and has enjoyed fluctuating export success over the decades. Recently the foreign market has become more lucrative than the local market, above all for a select number of Egyptian titles.\n\t\n\n\tSaudi Arabia’s rapidly expanding exhibition sector ranks as the primary source of box office revenues for nine out of Egypt’s top 10 film exports between 2021 and 2024. Some 27% of the top 65 films at the all-time Saudi box office are Egyptian.\n\n\n\tA small number of Egyptian films have earned much higher revenues abroad than at home. Romcom “Bahebek” (“I Love You”), starring Tamer Hosni, grossed $2.8 million at home, but became a breakout hit across West Asia, garnering $22.9 million abroad.\n\n\tOther international hits include “Sons of Rizk 3: Knockout” (2024) that grossed $6.1 million in Egypt and $22.3 million abroad, and “A Stand Worthy of Men” (2021), with $1.7 million in Egypt and $18.3 million abroad.\n\n\tIn 2024, Egyptian films were ranked third in the Saudi market share, following U.S. and Indian titles. A total of 33 Egyptian films were released in Saudi Arabia that year, generating over $53 million — more than twice the total revenues earned by all Egyptian films in their domestic market ($23.5 million).\n\n\tEgyptian-Saudi coproductions qualify for preferential tax treatment on their Saudi box office revenues. Recent examples include Hani Khalifa’s thriller, “Flight 404,” which is Egypt’s official submission to the 97th Academy Awards for best international feature.\n\t\n\n\tThe importance of foreign exports has been further leveraged by the fall in the dollar value of Egypt’s box office – from $59.6 million in 2019 to a forecast $36 million in 2025. This fall has been driven by significant exchange rate depreciation of the Egyptian pound. Box office revenues in local currency have actually doubled since 2019, due to the double-digit inflation recorded since 2022.\n\n\tCinemagoing in Egypt is still recovering from the pandemic slump. Admissions were 12 million in 2024 and expected to hit 13.8 million by the end of 2025, close to the pre-pandemic level.\n\n\tThe biggest segment of Egypt’s cinema audience is aged between 18-29 years, representing 20% of the total population and 42.7% of the labor force.\n\n\tEgyptian films are around 20% of all films released, but garner almost 70% of total box office, with U.S. films standing at 28.5% in 2025. High budget Egyptian comedies and action/adventure films traditionally dominate the local box office. In 2025, two Hollywood films entered the Top 10 at the box-office – “F1” and “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” the first time in several years that two foreign titles have entered the Top 10.\n\n\tLocal audiences no longer focus solely on high-budget productions. For example, Omar El Mohandes’ mid-budget comedy “Siko Siko,” starring Essam Omar and Taha Desouky, grossed around $4 million in Egypt and a further $4.2 million in Saudi Arabia, making it the second highest successful film in the history of Egyptian cinema.\n\n\tInterest in arthouse titles is also rising. Khaled Mansour’s 2024 Venice-player “Seeking Haven for Mr. Rambo” (2024), grossed $341,000, ranking as Egypt’s biggest-ever arthouse release.\n\n\tOver recent years, the leading film distributor has been Synergy, but has been surpassed in 2025 by Misr International Films. In 2025, Synergy’s former manager, Ahmed Badawy, launched a new company, Film Square, which is building market share. The principal distributor of foreign films, including Hollywood titles, is United Motion Pictures, which due to the recent success of blockbusters such as “F1” has surpassed several Egyptian film distributors. A rising player is UVF, a subsidiary of the Saudi media conglomerate Arab Radio and Television Network, which the CFC report says focuses on financing and distributing mid-budget Egyptian films as a prelude to releasing them internationally, particularly in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries.\n\t\n\n\tThe CFC report also provides a comprehensive overview of the results of the first 10 editions of the Cairo Film Connection, which through its pitching, mentoring and financial and in-kind awards has played a key role in helping Arab filmmakers complete their films and reach local and international audiences, including A-list festivals.\n\n\tRecent successes include “Four Daughters” (2023) by Kaouther Ben Hania (Tunisia) – that was nominated for best documentary feature in the Academy Awards, “Inshallah a Boy” (2023), by Amjad Al Rasheed (Jordan), that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and “Aïcha” (2024) by Mehdi Barsaoui (Morocco), which premiered at the Venice Film Festival.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMartin Scorsese’s “Casino” was released 30 years ago today (on Nov. 22, 1995), and I have no problem saying that I think it’s a Scorsese masterpiece. But I didn’t say that, or anything close to it, when I originally reviewed the film. And I was far from alone. When “Casino” first came out, it provoked a mixed response, on the part of both critics and audiences. And I think it’s easy to see why. Though packed with Scorsese’s virtuosity, the film seemed almost too conscious of its own bravura. For a lot of us, it was bedazzling in a slightly detached and even opaque way.\n\t\n\n\tThe movie marked Scorsese’s return to the glittering, fast-talk mode of Mob docudrama he’d pioneered five years before with “GoodFellas” (both films were based on nonfiction books by Nicholas Pileggi, with scripts by Pileggi and Scorsese). “GoodFellas,” for all its brutality, was a beloved movie, because people thought of it as a joyride to the dark side. “Casino” was colder, longer (three hours!), less relatable, more overstuffed with underworld information, and it had a hero, Robert De Niro’s implacable sports-gambler-turned-Vegas-casino-operator Sam “Ace” Rothstein, who wasn’t exactly easy to cozy up to. At the time, “Casino” struck a lot of people, including me, as both more than “GoodFellas” and less. It felt visibly top-heavy with Scorsese’s ambition to outdo what he’d done before.\n\n\n\tAnd that’s how I’ve thought of it for most of three decades — at least, until I saw it again a few years ago, and what happened took me by surprise. The movie blew me away.\n\n\tLISTEN: ‘Daily Variety’ Podcast — Revisiting Martin Scorsese’s ‘Casino’ With Owen Gleiberman\n\t\n\n\tI was mesmerized from the opening moments: the hallucinatory lights-of-Vegas credits, the ironic surge of Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion” on the soundtrack as Ace, in his pink jacket, gets into the boxy ’70s car that blows up, and the hypnotic extended sequence in which Ace explains in voice-over how the casino operates, and Scorsese’s rushing camera seems to be everywhere at once, darting through the gaming parlors of the Tangiers, taking us back into the counting room to show us how the skim works, mapping out the hustlers and the gangsters and the suckers and the bosses back in Kansas City, channeling the thrill of the bet, showing it to us in close-up detail, but also filling us in on the big picture, which is that it’s all a grand illusion, because in legalized gambling there is (as Ace puts it) only one winner, and it’s the people who own the casino. Everyone else is feeding them.\n\n\tWhat shocked me, this time, is that the hypnotic quality of that opening sequence didn’t ebb away. I sat there riveted, for the entire movie, sinking into the nuances in a way I hadn’t before, seeing how it all fit together: Ace’s impeccable style and threatening manners and control-freak way of running the casino, and the hunger inside him that’s driving it all; the recklessness and wild-card cunning of Joe Pesci’s Nicky Santoro, who’s like a richer, more fascinating variation on his Tommy DeVito in “GoodFellas”; and the way Sharon Stone, playing the impassioned gold-digger Ginger McKenna, gives a lacerating performance that is nothing short of extraordinary, showing you how wily and scurrilous Ginger can be, but also humanizing the damage that drives her. The film starts out as crime-syndicate psychodrama and descends into a scandalous underworld “Scenes from a Marriage.” And the rock ‘n’ roll! If it’s hard to highlight any one needle drop (though the “Can’t You Hear Me Knocking” montage is simply undeniable), that’s because Scorsese now weaves those golden oldies into a dream collage, orchestrating the movie like a jukebox that never stops shuffling.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSharon Stone in “Casino” (Universal/courtesy Everett Collection)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Universal/Courtesy Everett Col\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSo what changed for me? What did I, and a lot of other Scorsese fans, miss the first time? I think “Casino” was experienced far too much through the lens of “GoodFellas.” That film was a work of fabled perfection (though I’ve never shaken the feeling that Ray Liotta was miscast); it had an adrenaline-shot exuberance that made it a violent Mafia-party hangout movie. “Casino,” by comparison, seemed a party with the bliss chilled out of it. Yet that’s kind of like saying that “Macbeth” isn’t “Hamlet.” If you forget about “GoodFellas,” “Casino” casts its own daunting spell. It’s a vision of what it looks like when money fever becomes the life force. The movie could almost be called “Money,” because that’s the obsession that brings everyone in it down.\n\t\n\n\tAt the same time, it’s Scorsese’s darkest Mob drama. When you look at the great Scorsese underworld movies, going back to “Mean Streets” (1973), there’s a paradox built into every one of them. Scorsese, in the very cells of his cinematic being, wants to live in those worlds, to feel as intensely as the characters feel. He’s a saintly rationalist who wants to touch the burn. Yet he also wants to demonstrate the price — to show us that it’s not worth it. And he has never scraped the varnish off the underworld as definitively as he does in “Casino.” That’s what makes the movie not just a masterpiece but such a forbidding one. It’s Scorsese’s most pitiless reckoning of the wages of sin.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOver the first 16 years of David Harbour’s acting career, he built a successful resume of Broadway theater (in productions like “The Invention of Love,” “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” and “The Coast of Utopia”) and supporting roles in TV (“Pan Am,” “The Newsroom”) and film (“Quantum of Solace,” “State of Play,” “The Equalizer”). \n\n\t“I really enjoyed being No. 7 on a call sheet of, like, a Denzel Washington action movie, and also being leads in plays at the Public Theater in New York,” he says. “It was a lovely life, a fantastic life, a one-bedroom-rental-in-the-East-Village life.”\n\t\n\n\tThen, at 41, Harbour was cast in “Stranger Things” as Hawkins, Indiana, police chief Jim Hopper — the only adult male lead (opposite Winona Ryder’s Joyce Byers) on a show populated almost entirely with young people. His life has never been the same. The show became an immediate global blockbuster on Netflix, catapulting Harbour to top-of-the-call-sheet status in a matter of weeks. Over its five-season run of the Netflix blockbuster series, Harbour has also headlined a reboot of “Hellboy” in 2019, played a kick-ass Santa in 2022’s “Violent Night,” and joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the Red Guardian in 2021’s “Black Widow,” 2025’s “Thunderbolts*” and 2026’s “Avengers: Doomsday.”\n\n\n\tSince finishing production on the final season of “Stranger Things” in 2024, Harbour has already shot a new limited series for HBO, the dark comedy “DTF St. Louis” with Jason Bateman and Linda Cardellini, and a sequel to “Violent Night,” both expected in 2026. In late September, he spoke with Variety while in production on the latter, to discuss the end of “Stranger Things” and the creators of the show, Matt and Ross Duffer, for the magazine’s Oct. 15 cover story. (The interview predates the report that co-star Millie Bobby Brown filed a harassment complaint against Harbour prior to shooting Season 5, as well as the announcement and then release of his ex-wife Lily Allen’s new album, “West End Girl.”)\n\t\n\n\tHarbour shared the impact “Stranger Things” has had on his life; how the show’s massive success has changed it, for better and for worse; and how his character has evolved over its five seasons.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRoss Duffer and David Harbour on the set of “Stranger Things 5,” with Matt Duffer, Millie Bobby Brown and Winona Ryder in the background\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtsushi Nishijima/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve said before that, going into Season 1, you saw Hopper as a make-or-break role for you. Did you understand then that the show had the potential to become what it is now?\t\n\n\tNo. You would know better than I in terms of the business models of how something like Netflix operates. But when we started the show, it was the fall of 2015, and the model for Netflix original series was like “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black.” I figured it would be kind of a sci-fi show, which some people would really enjoy, others, you know, it wouldn’t be their thing. But the universal appeal on the sort of zeitgeist that it has become, I never imagined.\n\t\n\t\tWhat has “Stranger Things” done for your career and for your life?\t\n\n\tA lot of people know me now, and it gave me a fan base of a certain type. So, career wise, it just opened a tremendous amount of doors. I mean, I’m interested now in what happens after “Stranger Things,” in terms of walking through those doors. I have this new HBO show coming out in January, me and Jason Bateman, and all this other stuff in the pipe now, so that’s more where my focus is on right now. \n\n\tWhereas, had you asked me that question seven years ago? It just ripped apart the whole conception of what I would be. I got to a certain point in my life when I was 35 — I really enjoyed being number seven on a call sheet of, like, a Denzel Washington action movie, and also being leads in plays at the Public Theater in New York. It was a lovely life, a fantastic life, a one-bedroom-rental-in-the-East-Village life, and “Stranger Things” changed that entire life in many ways. The one thing that it hasn’t changed is my intent, and I think my intent has always been to tell beautiful, weird stories that open people up. That’s been the same pre-“Stranger Things” and after “Stranger Things,” but everything else has changed.\n\t\n\t\tWhy do you think the show has endured for so long as a massive hit? What do you think is at the core of its appeal?\t\n\n\tYou probably know that better than I do. What would you say it is? \n\t\n\t\n\t\tI’ve been asking that question of a lot of people, and one thing that people have really pointed to is that, because of the breadth of the ensemble, there’s a character that basically everyone can identify with — and it’s a story about people who are outsiders fighting back.\t\n\n\tWell, the outsiders fighting back has shifted over the years. I did find that as seasons go on, it’s more interested in empathy. Vecna has become very important, like the monster himself is becoming more human, and we’re supposed to understand and have feelings for the monster. Whereas in Season 1, it was really scrappy outsiders who were taking down a corporation, right? It has been an interesting transition in terms of what they’re focused on, how you elaborate that story. \n\n\tI think, at its best, it really hits all the beats of character and story moving forward at the same pace, which is a difficult thing for a script to do. Usually, scripts focus on character or they focus on plot. “Stranger Things” will do both of them simultaneously in a very sophisticated way. The other thing is, we love “Star Wars,” right? We love “Lord of the Rings.” I think what “Stranger Things” is trying to do is, instead of rebooting “Star Wars” or “Lord of the Rings,” they’re taking the archetypes or the tropes — or the words and the letters, let’s say, and creating new sentences out of them. Hopper is Han Solo, is Indiana Jones, is Gandalf the Gray. There are these archetype tropes that just live in our subconscious cinematic lexicon and we love them. “Stranger Things” just reinvents them with Eleven, Hopper, Max. It’s not afraid to play those really strong power chords.\n\t\n\t\tWhat is the experience like of being directed by the Duffer brothers when the show started?\t\n\n\tWhen we started, I think they were much greener, and the show also had much less at stake. We were the forgotten show that first season. I don’t even know how much money they spent on the show, but it was not a lot, and we didn’t have any executives down there. Nobody was looking at what we’re doing. I think that they looked to me and Winona in a lot of ways to help them more with the bigger dialogue heavy scenes. I mean, not that they didn’t have brilliant stuff every day, but I remember it being a little more freewheeling.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow has that evolved over the last decade?\t\n\n\tAs their aesthetic got more what they wanted it to be, they started getting a lot more specific about camera moves and shots and structure and cuts and things like that. As the show grew in popularity, and as the money grew and the stakes grew, I think we got more precise. They’ve always been very generous with me. They’ve always really appreciated me as performer, really appreciated what I brought to the character, and wanted me to sort of guide him. Over the years before each season, we would talk about the kind of direction that we wanted Hopper to go to. \n\n\tYou know, the problem with TV is that you’re always Gilligan on the island in the red shirt and the bucket hat for 10 seasons. I get bored and I wanted Hopper to be different. I wanted to show different colors of him: the Season 1 guy to the Season 2 very protective, overbearing father, to the Season 3 “Magnum PI” ’80s detective, to the Season 4 gaunt, brutal, resurrected warrior, to this Season 5 — I don’t know what he is this season. But we were very collaborative on where we could take him. They’re super bright guys, and they really know how to tell a story.\n\t\n\t\tFinally, as one of the only adults with a lot of experience on the show, I wanted to ask what it’s been like to be on the inside of it becoming such a phenomenon?\t\n\n\tIt’s going to be hard for me to really speak openly about any of this, because of what people do nowadays when you try to discuss something that I feel is very three dimensional and very complex. \n\n\tYou gain something and you lose something. You know, Hopper doesn’t smoke in the show anymore. That is a direct result of popularity. Because your audience does get so large, you are trying to continue to appeal to the largeness of that audience, and large audiences require soft edges. Which is an interesting conundrum that you deal with in pop music and pop culture and all sorts of popular entertainment. So, for me, the freedoms of that first season, when we were just carving it out and no one expected anything, as opposed to the pressures that we were under on the fifth season, you know, I would prefer the freedoms of that first season. And yet, I love the attention, and I love capturing the widest audience possible, and I love moving the most people with what you’re doing.\n\t\n\n\tThis is just something that entertainment struggles with. I guess the long and the short of it is just that you gain something — obviously, clearly — and you also remember and miss those days when we were all naive and had all the freedom in the world because no one expected anything of us.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for plot points and the ending of “Wicked: For Good,” now playing in theaters, as well as spoilers for the “Wicked” stage show.\n\n\t“Wicked,” created as an origin story for Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West, sets the stage for the world of the 1939 film “The Wizard of Oz,” explaining that not all in Oz is what it seems.\n\n\n\t“Wicked: Part One” established much of the lore — from Glinda and Elphaba’s first meeting at Shiz University to their fateful voyage to the Emerald City to see the Wizard — and “Wicked: For Good” continues that story, including introducing how Glinda and Elphaba become known for good and evil, how the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly come to be and introduce Dorothy (and her little dog Toto, too).\n\t\n\n\tWhile some storylines don’t align perfectly, many familiar characters, places and things appear along the way. Here’s how “For Good” leads up to “The Wizard of Oz.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tElphaba / the Wicked Witch of the West \t\n\n\tElphaba Thropp (Cynthia Erivo), eventually dubbed the “Wicked Witch of the West,” is at the heart of the “Wicked” origin story. Born green from a mysterious elixir, she carries magic in her veins as the daughter of a wizard father and a Munchkin mother. Fierce, fearless, and unafraid to speak out against injustice, Elphaba challenges the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) himself — who, unbeknownst to either of them, is her father — for his cruelty toward animals and twisted politics. Her habit of standing up for what’s right makes her an enemy of the state, and the Wizard and Madame Morrible’s (Michelle Yeoh) counter-PR campaign crowns her the “Wicked Witch of the West,” launching her villain origin story and paving the way for the iconic Margaret Hamilton we know from “The Wizard of Oz.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGalinda / Glinda the Good \t\n\n\tWhile Elphaba rises as a rebel, we watch Galinda (Ariana Grande) transform into Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. In “For Good,” she emerges as a savvy public figure, with her love of adoration propelling her into a leading role in Oz. Her story mostly intersects with Billie Burke’s Glinda in “The Wizard of Oz”: Right after Dorothy arrives, she appears in Munchkinland to address the people, bridging the storylines between the films. While not shown in “For Good,” she seemingly follows the same course: greeting the newcomer after falling from Kansas and sending her on her way down the Yellow Brick Road in the Wicked Witch of the East’s shoes.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNessarose / The Wicked Witch of the East \t\n\n\tNessarose’s story reveals how the owner of the iconic ruby slippers came to be. In “For Good,” Elphaba’s sister has become the governor of Munchkinland, inheriting the role from their father, who died of shame over Elphaba’s growing reputation as the Wicked Witch. But Nessarose proves to be quite ruthless and, paired with her connection to Elphaba, she ultimately earns the nickname of the Wicked Witch of the East (which she’s referred to as in “The Wizard of Oz”). She ends the film in the same place she starts “The Wizard of Oz”: flattened under a house.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Ruby Red Slippers \t\n\n\tBefore Elphaba and Nessarose’s father passed, he gave Nessa a pair of silver shoes that had belonged to her late mother. In “Wicked,” the family heirloom is silver – trademark rules at MGM kept them that way – but during “For Good,” they’re temporarily transformed to look red. When Elphaba gives her sister the power of flight, the silver shoes are blasted with red light, creating the enchanted illusion of the ruby slippers that would become legendary in “The Wizard of Oz.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBoq / Tin Man \t\n\n\tBoq (Ethan Slater) starts his “Wicked” journey as Glinda, Elphaba and Nessarose’s classmate at Shiz University. The Munchkin clearly has a crush on Glinda, who gently nudges him toward spending time with Nessa instead. But what begins as a polite favor spirals quickly: Nessa, who genuinely loves Boq, enslaves him in a desperate attempt to keep him close.\n\n\tIn “For Good,” Boq finally admits his heart still belongs to Glinda and tries to leave. Enraged by rejection, Nessa tries to win his heart with a spell, but her botched hex nearly kills him instead. In a heartfelt attempt to remedy the situation, Elphaba gives him a body that wouldn’t require a heart and rebuilds him from metal scraps around Nessa’s room. Just like that, Boq becomes the Tin Man (a la the version Jack Haley made iconic in 1939). \n\t\n\n\tThe movies tease his fate early and often: when he first meets Glinda in “Part One,” Boq’s stance mirrors the Tin Man’s tilt; later, Glinda tucks a red handkerchief into his sweater, right over his heart. He also introduces himself to Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) as Boq “Woodsman.” In “For Good,” there’s a scene of him chopping wood with an ax before his transformation occurs. Even his Munchkinland uniform has a silver “M” heart-shaped embroidery stitched on his chest — a final wink at his Ozian fate. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFieryo / Scarecrow \t\n\n\tThe brainless Scarecrow was formerly Fiyero Tigelaar, the most eligible bachelor in Oz. The “Wicked” story explains how the Shiz University heartthrob–turned–captain of the Wizard’s Guard becomes entangled in a complicated love triangle with both Glinda and Elphaba before meeting his starchy fate. \n\n\tIn “For Good,” Fiyero is torn between the two witches: he’s engaged to Glinda and tasked to hunt down Elphaba. But when he refuses to betray Elphaba, his fellow guards hang him in the fields to force a confession. He never breaks (what a loyal guy), and Elphaba ultimately saves him by casting the spell audiences hear in the number “No Good Deed.” \n\n\tShe chants: “Let his flesh not be torn, let his blood leave no stain / Though they beat him, let him feel no pain / Let his bones never break, and however they try to destroy him / Let him never die, let him never die.”  \n\n\tFiyero’s fate is teased throughout both films: in one of his earliest interactions with Elphaba, she tells him to “get stuffed.” Then, after “Dancing Through Life,” his shadow appears in a crucified pose. Even his green Wizard Guard uniform eventually resembles the green shirt Ray Bolger made famous as the Scarecrow in “The Wizard of Oz.”  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Cowardly Lion\t\n\n\tThe Cowardly Lion, voiced by Colman Domingo, is introduced in “Part One” as a vulnerable cub whom Elphaba, a fierce advocate for animal rights, rescues during her time at Shiz. The young lion was being used as a classroom demonstration for modern cases until Elphaba (with some help from Fiyero) freed him from captivity. However, the lion later blames Elphaba for preventing him from tearing him from his home and forcing him to learn to fend for himself, which was the catalyst to his cowardly ways.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Tornado\t\n\n\tThe twister that brought Dorothy to Oz wasn’t the product of Kansas’s tornado alley; it was a calculated, engineered event by Madame Morrible. Using her weather-controlling magic, she summons the storm that crushed the Wicked Witch of the East as part of a scheme to draw Elphaba out of hiding and force her back to her sister’s side, where she could be captured. \n\n\t“For Good” also spotlights Glinda’s complicity in this situation via a crushing scene where she reveals that Elphaba would rush to Nessa’s side if she were ever in trouble. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBubble Origin Story\t\n\n\tWhen audiences meet Glinda in “The Wizard of Oz,” she already comes and goes by bubble. But in “For Good,” we see the origin of this transportation device. The bubble, as presented by Madame Morrible, is a piece of propaganda, intended to promote the magical ideals of Glinda the Good. In reality, it’s a mechanical bubble operated by a foot pedal — another clever trick by the Wizard to create the illusion of magic for someone who is otherwise unmagical.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYellow Brick Road \t\n\n\tWhere “Part One” showed Elphaba and Glinda helping the Wizard choose the road’s color during their visit, “For Good” opens with the Yellow Brick Road under construction. But what “The Wizard of Oz” never shows is the road’s troubling creation: the bricks are laid using animal labor — a stark swing for creatures who were once equal members of society. Their forced work becomes the very path that eventually guides Dorothy to the Emerald City. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDorothy \t\n\n\tWe see Dorothy — well, her shadow, or her back, or sometimes just her ear — at several points throughout “For Good.” Her first appearance aligns with her debut in “The Wizard of Oz” — fresh off being dropped into Oz by a twister.\n\n\tUnlike “The Wizard of Oz,” though, audiences don’t see the confrontation between Elphaba and Dorothy in Munchkinland over the ruby red slippers. Instead, we witness the end of Glinda directing Dorothy to follow the Yellow Brick Road. Dorothy walks off in her new heels, with Toto in tow and accompanied by some Munchkins; she eventually meets the Wizard, reconnecting her storyline with the original film.\n\n\tLater, Dorothy is snatched by a flying monkey and brought to Kiamo Ko castle, where Elpahba — who is only after her dead sister’s shoes — plans to hold her until she surrenders the heels. (It’s here that Elphaba and Glinda perform the heartfelt ballad “For Good,” about how their friendship has forever transformed them.)\n\t\n\n\tBut before that can happen, Elphaba hatches an escape plan, using the widespread rumor about her (“I hear her soul is so unclean, pure water can melt her!”). Then, Dorothy throws a bucket of water on her, “melting” Elphaba and giving her the perfect cover to slip away under the floorboards.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAudience with the wizard  \t\n\n\tIn a departure from the Broadway musical, “For Good” brings together the four main characters of “The Wizard of Oz” — Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion — for a brief appearance with the Wizard. The encounter is short, with the animatronic Wizard tasking them to retrieve the Wicked Witch’s broom, but it creates a fun overlap between the two films. \n\n\tThe logistics, however, are a bit fuzzy: does the Wizard realize Fiyero, his former guard is now the Scarecrow? How did Boq, as the Tin Man, manage to find Dorothy on her journey? In theory, this is where they each ask for their heart’s desire: a way home, a brain, courage and a heart. Is that the same? Does the Wizard actually believe this will bring Elphaba back to him, or was it simply a clever nod to cross-reference the films? \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWizard Exit\t\n\n\tDorothy looks for an escape back to Kansas in “The Wizard of Oz” by catching a ride on the Wizard’s hot air balloon. There’s a similar scene in “For Good,” as Glinda exiles him away via balloon and observes the girl in the distance trying to hitch a ride.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFlying Monkeys \t\n\n\tThe flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz were typically considered the Wicked Witch’s henchmen, but “For Good” reveals the origin of their loyalty. Elphaba is their savior; she frees them from captivity in the Wizard’s chambers and their devotion to her stems from the freedom she gave them. \n",

County Medical Examiner will not be able to establish a cause of death ... sources directly connected to the investigation tell TMZ.\n      \n    \n          According to those sources, the medical examiner received the body in horrendous condition ... it was decapitated, and, while the torso was intact, the limbs had been removed and cut into multiple pieces.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          We're told all of the body parts were \"partially frozen\" ... and had, apparently, been thawing out while sitting in the trunk of D4vd's Tesla.\n      \n    \n          Remember, D4vd's vehicle had not been moved for several days when it was parked on a Hollywood Hills street near his rental home ... which resulted in it getting towed, and then the body being found.\n      \n\n          As TMZ reported, Celeste's body was in such bad shape, initially, investigators did not know if it was male or female.\n      \n    \n          When the body was received by the M.E.'s Office, the initial determination was this was a victim of an \"apparent homicide,\" but our sources say the M.E. is now having trouble establishing an official manner or cause of death, and \"It will most likely be 'undetermined.'\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Other sources connected to the investigation tell TMZ the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division is viewing Celeste's death as a homicide, and even if the official cause of death is undetermined, authorities can move forward with an arrest.\n      \n    \n          TMZ broke the story, D4vd is now considered a suspect in Celeste's death. What's more, TMZ has learned there is a second suspect who authorities believe helped D4vd in the dismemberment of Celeste's body.\n      \n    \n          Mark Geragos appeared on the most recent \"2 Angry Men\" podcast and said he knows the name of the second suspect, and authorities have told him this person might have been involved \"before, during, and after\" Celeste's death.\n      \n    \n          TMZ also broke the story ... a critical part of the case involves a trip investigators say D4vd took to a remote area of Santa Barbara County in the middle of the night back in the spring, where he spent 2 hours.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          If Celeste's body was taken to that area -- months before it was discovered in L.A. -- it seems the operating theory is the body parts were put in some sort of freezer for a long time before it ended up in D4vd's Tesla in late summer.\n      \n      ",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-denied-new-trial-acquittal-days-before-sentencing-1236535601/\">Sean “Diddy” Combs has filed</a> a letter to the judge asking for mercy less than 24 hours before he’s set to be sentenced in his federal case.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe mogul wrote a four-page letter to Judge Arun Subramanian asking for leniency in his sentencing. “First and foremost, I want to apologize and say how sincerely sorry I am for all of the hurt and pain that I have caused others by my conduct,” he wrote. “I take full responsibility and accountability for my past wrongs.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the letter, Combs states that he understands that saying “I’m sorry” will “never be good enough” as the words “cannot erase the pain from the past.” He reflects on his time spent in prison over the past 13 months, stating that “the scene and images of me assaulting Cassie play over and over in my head daily. I literally lost my mind.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe explains that he has come to terms with his past behavior and takes responsibility for it. “I lost my way. I got lost in my journey. Lost in the drugs and the excess. My downfall was rooted in my selfishness. I have been humbled and broken to my core. Jail is designed to break you mentally, physically and spiritually. Over the past year there have been so many times that I wanted to give up. There have been some days I thought I would be better off dead. The old me died in jail and a new version of me was reborn. Prison will change you or kill you—I choose to live.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCombs asks for mercy from the judge and says he wants to be a good father to his seven children and resume being the primary caretaker for his ill mother. “Today, I humbly ask you for another chance—another chance to be a better father, another chance to be a better son, another chance to be a better leader in my community, and another chance to live a better life,” he stated. “I am writing this not to gain any sympathy or pity, this experience is simply the truth of my existence and has changed my life forever and I will never commit a crime again.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier this week, prosecutors in the case asked that Combs be sentenced to at least 11 years in prison on his two counts of transportation for prostitution. This afternoon, Combs’ counsel reinforced their request for Combs to be given 14 months, which would free him by the end of the year, inclusive of time already served. On Tuesday, Judge Subramanian denied Combs’ request for a new trial or acquittal.</p>\n<p>\n\tCombs is scheduled to be sentenced tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. ET. He’s expected to speak directly to the Judge during the sentencing.</p>\n</div>",

Netflix makes a strong case with two contenders in the mix: the long overdue Adam Sandler for Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly” and, although brief, William H.

Bouncing from tales of brothers in “Sinners” to sisters in “Sentimental Value,” messy divorces in “Is This Thing On?” and the glitzy chaos of Tinseltown itself in “Jay Kelly.” Political junkies get helpings of government corruption through “It Was Just an Accident” and “The Secret Agent,” while “A House of Dynamite” asks the cheerful question: what if humanity is doomed? </p>\n<p>\n\tThe real fun comes in the category’s wild cards. Newcomer Eva Victor could crash the party with “Sorry, Baby,” proving you don’t need decades of credits to earn critical attention. Horror fans could finally see the genre gets its due with “Weapons,” which could pair nicely with “Sinners.” We also have “Roofman,” which dramatizes the true story of a robber who lived inside a Toys R’ Us for an entire year. </p>\n<p>\n\tSome of this year’s nominees might come from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/lists/screenwriters-to-watch-for-2025-ma-2-supergirl-kpop-demon-hunters\"><em>Variety’s </em>Screenwriters to Watch list</a>, just announced with the likes of Austin Kolodney, who assembles a taut and riveting tale in Gus Van Sant’s “Dead Man’s Wire,” or Danya Jimenez and Hannah McMechan, two of the four scribes of the Netflix smash hit “KPop Demon Hunters.”

Close behind is Ariana Grande, gaining momentum for her highly anticipated turn in the musical “Wicked: For Good,” which is shaping up to be a major contender across multiple categories.</p>\n<p>\n\tEmily Blunt remains a strong presence for her transformative role in “The Smashing Machine,” a performance that could align well with co-star Dwayne Johnson’s potential lead actor campaign. Meanwhile, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” makes a compelling case for double nominations — an occurrence in this category roughly a third of the time — with Regina Hall and Teyana Taylor both in the mix. As the film barrels toward a likely sweep of nominations, the supporting actress race becomes the X-factor in how well the film will ultimately do with the Academy.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>NOTE: All titles,

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA new three-part documentary series starring <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zayn-malik/\">Zayn Malik</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/louis-tomlinson/\">Louis Tomlinson</a> of One Direction is headed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe former bandmates embarked on a roadtrip across America that is described as a spontaneous adventure, complete with “reconnection, exploration and a lot of laughter,” per an official press release. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe series is meant to give fans of the stars a rare look inside the worlds of two of the most private former One Direction members. Across three episodes, Malik and Tomlinson engage in intimate conversations about life, love, loss and fatherhood. This comes after the death of their former bandmate, Liam Payne, who <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/liam-payne-dead-one-direction-1236180399/\">died</a> in October 2024 in Argentina at the age of 31.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe show will be directed by Nicola Marsh (“Song Exploder,” “Stay on Board: The Leo Baker Story”), and is produced by Campfire Studios (“Unknown Number: The High School Catfish”; “Smartless: On the Road”; and “America’s Sweethearts: The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders”).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth artists have had a busy year as solo acts and are teeing up for an even busier 2026. Malik recently announced a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/zayn-announces-las-vegas-residency-2026-1236526274/\">Las Vegas residency</a> set for January of next year. Tomlinson, for his part, is following the release of his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/louis-tomlinson-announces-album-how-did-i-get-here-lemonade-1236535058/\">third studio album “How Did I Get Here?</a>” (slated for Jan. 23) with a 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/louis-tomlinson-how-did-we-get-here-tour-dates-1236536095/\">world arena tour</a> launching next summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn his forthcoming album, Tomlinson said, “I sum up it as ‘The record I always deserved to make.’ My bread and butter is my honesty. I genuinely wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope it comes through in the music. I’m still learning and getting better as a singer and a songwriter. I find it impossible to be complacent; it’s not in my vocabulary. For the first time now, I’m allowing myself to be the artist I’d always hoped to be.”\n\t</p>\n<div><p>\n\tMalik completed a run of his own earlier this year in support of his fourth solo album, “Room Under the Stairs.” Last November, he kicked off his first-ever headlining tour, “Stairway to the Sky,” with a string of shows in London, Manchester and Edinburgh. Earlier this year, he brought the tour Stateside with performances in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles before concluding the trek in Mexico City.</p></div>\n</div>",

George Michael Entertainment wishes Taylor every success with ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ and ‘Father Figure.'”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Life of a Showgirl,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-announces-album-the-life-of-a-showgirl-1236487135/\">first revealed</a> back in August, is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl-release-date-tracklist-1236488000/\">set to debut on Oct. 3</a> and features fellow pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter on the title track. Typical of Swift’s musical catalog, the album will be available in multiple variants, including “The Life of a Showgirl: Sweat and Vanilla Perfume” edition in glitter orange vinyl, as well as “The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd Is Your King” edition sold <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-target-vinyl-exclusive-life-showgirl-1236528210/\">exclusively at Target</a>. The record will also be available in CD and cassette formats.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring her “New Heights” interview, Swift said “The Life of a Showgirl” was inspired by the joy she felt while performing on her Eras Tour.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This album is about what was going on behind the scenes of my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,” she said. “It just comes from the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, and so that effervesence has come through on this record.”</p>\n</div>",

According to a report by <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/10/01/2025/carr-to-testify-before-cruzs-commerce-committee-in-wake-of-kimmel-flap\" target=\"_blank\">Semafor</a>, which first reported the news, the committee is expecting the hearing to be held in November but that the date could move later. The FCC’s two other commissioners, Republican Olivia Trusty and Democratic appointee Anna Gomez, are also expected to appear at the hearing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) chairs the Senate Commerce Committee. Two weeks ago, Cruz criticized Carr’s comments about Kimmel, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/ted-cruz-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-brendan-carr-1236524620/\">comparing the FCC chairman to a “mafioso,”</a> and said it set a bad precedent for ensuring free speech for conservatives.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe controversy started after Kimmel, on the Sept. 15 episode of his ABC show, said that the “MAGA gang” was trying to “characterize” the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk “as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” On Sept. 17, Disney-owned ABC suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” after Carr threatened to take action against local affiliates over the remark, which he called “some of the sickest conduct possible.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the podcast of conservative commentator Benny Johnson, Carr said: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” Shortly afterward, two large ABC station groups — Sinclair and Nexstar — said they were preempting Kimmel’s show (and Sinclair specifically thanked Carr for his remarks). Carr celebrated the news about ABC’s suspension of Kimmel, sending a CNN reporter a GIF of “The Office’s” Michael Scott and Dwight Schrute making “raise the roof” gestures.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week, Carr <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fcc-chairman-brendan-carr-downplays-role-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236526391/\">downplayed</a> his role in Kimmel’s suspension, saying that he never threatened to revoke broadcasters’ licenses and that Nexstar and Sinclair opted to preempt the show of their own accord. Carr said his comment that “We can do this the easy way or the hard way” was a hypothetical point about what the FCC might do if there was a “news distortion” complaint filed against Kimmel and ABC and that Democrats had engaged in “distortion and projection” over his comments.</p>\n<p>\n\t“What I’ve been very clear in the context of the Kimmel episode is the FCC and myself in particular have expressed no view on the ultimate merits [of a ‘news distortion’ complaint about Kimmel] had something like that been filed what our take would be one way or the other,” Carr said Sept. 22 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fcc-chairman-brendan-carr-downplays-role-jimmy-kimmel-suspension-1236526391/\">at the 2025 Concordia Annual Summit in New York</a>. </p>\n<p>\n\tCruz, on his podcast “Verdict with Ted Cruz,” said he “hates what Kimmel said” and that he was “thrilled that he was fired.” (Kimmel was not “fired.”) However, Cruz said about Carr’s threats to broadcasters, “That will end up bad for conservatives. There will come a time when a Democrat wins again, wins the White House. They will get rid of everything America that’s conservative. They’ll get rid of every podcast. They’ll get rid of everything. They will silence us. They will use this power and they will use it ruthlessly and that is dangerous.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter ABC announced the suspension of Kimmel, Gomez, the FCC’s lone Democratic commissioner, suggested Carr was exploiting Kirk’s assassination “as justification for broader censorship and control.” “This Administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression,” she wrote in a post on X. “And it is doing so not because speech glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power or reflects views they oppose. We must stand firm against every attempt to silence dissent, punish satirists and government critics, and erode individual liberty.” When Disney reinstated Kimmel, Gomez <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fcc-democrat-disney-jimmy-kimmel-reinstatement-1236526572/\">said</a>, “I am glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, last week Sen. Adam Schiff (D-California) and eight other senators <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/news/adam-schiff-brendan-carr-fcc-kimmel-1236527374/\">sent a letter to Carr posing a series of questions about the Kimmel episode</a>. They wrote that Carr’s remarks, along with President Trump’s lawsuits against media organizations and the defunding of public broadcasting, “represent the most blatant and coordinated attack on the free press in American history.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The FCC’s regulatory authority over broadcast licenses was never intended to serve as a weapon to silence criticism or punish satirical commentary,” Schiff and the other senators wrote. “Your agency’s mission is to serve the public interest, not to act as an enforcement arm for political retribution against media outlets that displease those in power.” The letter asked Carr to disclose any communications between the FCC and ABC, Disney or its affiliates about the Kimmel show, as well as any communications with the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tA separate group of senators, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), sent a letter to the CEOs of Nexstar and Sinclair asking them to explain their decisions to preempt “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”, including whether Nexstar’s decision had anything to do with its pending $6.2 billion merger with Tegna, for which it needs FCC approval. </p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-fully-back-abc-tv-nexstar-sinclair-1236530517/\">Sinclair and Nexstar announced Sept. 26 that they were ending their preemption of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”</a> and would immediately begin airing the show on their ABC affiliates. Both companies claimed their decisions were independent of any government influence or communications. Sinclair and Nexstar also both asserted that they were justified in originally deciding to preempt Kimmel’s show.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>RELATED: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-sinclair-jimmy-kimmel-networks-affiliates-battle-1236537252/\">How the ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ Flap Exposed The Growing Conflicts Between the Networks and Their Affiliates</a></strong></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kesha-2/\">Kesha</a></strong> has signed with <strong>Mary Hilliard Harrington</strong> and<strong> Red Light</strong> management for representation. Harrington’s roster also includes country artists Dierks Bentley and the Grammy-winning rock duo, the Black Keys.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe move came just as Kesha wrapped her “Tits Out Tour,” which saw her performing in arenas and amphitheaters across the country. The tour will continue internationally next year with stops in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the UK in February and March. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tKesha launched her own independent record label, aptly named <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/music/news/kesha-finally-free-millions-dollars-litigation-dr-luke-1236076250/\">Kesha Records</a>, and in partnership with Warner Music Group’s independent distribution arm ADA.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>MASS MoCA </strong>and <strong>Hen House Studios </strong>have launched a new record label, <strong>MASS MoCA Records.</strong> With a framework that centers artistic creativity, museum residencies and live music making, this new label will provide an alternative to the current commercial model for how independent music is heard, developed and shared.</p>\n<p>\n\tMASS MoCA Records is uniquely designed to build on the museum’s international reach and entrusted relationships with performing artists — musicians, stage-based storytellers, and sound and sonic installation creators — by marrying the expertise of Harlan Steinberger of Hen House Studios (Sunny War, Willie Nelson, Particle Kid), who is best known for his uncommonly attuned ear as a recording engineer and producer specializing in live, studio recordings. </p>\n<p>\n\tArtists selected for the new label will be an extension of the museum’s curatorial ethos and the label will not have a scheduled application process. Launched as a three-year pilot, a limited number of albums will be released each year and produced at various recording studios in the Berkshires and throughout the world.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“MASS MoCA Records is a recording and distribution collaboration born out of our shared love of music and the artists who make it,” said Kristy Edmunds, Director of MASS MoCA. “We have a long-standing, live presenting program at the museum featuring musicians, performers and sound artists, and have supported the creation of new works and ambitious ideas since our inception. By joining forces with Hen House Studios and being able to tap into the remarkable number of music studios and intimate venues in the local area – the ingredients for a hand-made record label were all around us. I see this label as an extension of how we innovate to support the mobility of artists’ ideas and connect audiences the world over.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first band to sign with MASS MoCA Records is the Kasambwe Brothers, a multi-generational band who has been making music together for almost 40 years and are grounded in the rich, musical heritage of Malawi, Africa. </p>\n<p>\n\tMore releases will follow in 2026 from MASS MoCA Records, recording predominately in-person in the Berkshires under Steinberger’s stewardship, including cutting-edge Los Angeles jazz artists Black Nile (release date TBA). </p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>Songtrust</strong>, a Downtown company and global music publishing administration service, announces the launch of <strong>Songtrust Amplified</strong>, a new rewards program designed to elevate career opportunities for music creators at every stage of their journey.</p>\n<p>\n\tAvailable to all active clients, Songtrust Amplified offers exclusive access to discounts, curated resources, and industry opportunities beyond traditional publishing — strengthening the path to success for independent songwriters and rights holders worldwide. </p>\n<p>\n\tSitting in Downtown’s Publishing Division, Songtrust Amplified also represents an extension of the Downtown group’s continued mission, building a more equitable music ecosystem through services that empower creators to control their careers and maximize their potential.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m thrilled to celebrate the launch of Songtrust Amplified as a new chapter in our journey — one that resonates deeply with my own path here at Downtown,” said Emily Stephenson, President of Downtown Music Publishing. “Beginning on the Songtrust operations team, I witnessed firsthand the power of access, transparency, and education in shaping a songwriter’s career. Since then, Songtrust has grown into the industry’s most sophisticated, creator-friendly platform, and Songtrust Amplified will further strengthen our commitment to empowering creators and growing alongside our clients.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCaitlin Stubner, VP of Songtrust commented, “Songwriters often tell us how isolating the industry can feel. We built Songtrust Amplified for them, with no strings attached. We are their trusted partner for global publishing and now, we can support more parts of their creative journey while building community. Amplified also recognizes that publishing is just one chapter of a creator’s story. Through thoughtful collaborations that open doors to distribution, promotion, mentorship, and more, we’re offering the tools and opportunities that help music creators do what they do best—make music.”</p>\n<p>\n\t+ RIAA-Certified Gold a cappella group<strong> Straight No Chaser </strong>has signed to boutique record label <strong>Green Hill Music</strong>. The lifestyle music imprint will release the group’s upcoming holiday album, “Holiday Road,” Straight No Chaser’s first full-length holiday release in five years.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We are thrilled to welcome these music veterans to the Green Hill family,” said Green Hill Music General Manager Blake Davis. “Their unmatched musicality, dynamic a cappella artistry, and signature humor bring something truly unique and captivating to today’s musical landscape. This Christmas album blends timeless classics with fresh favorites, showcasing why they were among the pioneers of the all–a cappella style. It’s a release destined to become a holiday favorite for listeners of all generations. Straight No Chaser truly knows how to put on a performance to remember.”</p>\n<p>\n\tStraight No Chaser member Walter Chase said, “Our group’s catalog of songs cover everything from 1950s doo wop to what’s on the radio today. Partnering with Green Hill Music, a label known for its legacy of iconic vocal music, is a perfect match for Straight No Chaser. We are so proud of our new album, Holiday Road and excited to join Green Hill Music with its release to reach fans of Straight No Chaser far and wide.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDetails of Straight No Chaser’s album Holiday Road will be revealed soon. The group’s annual holiday tour, this year dubbed “Holiday Road,” runs through Oct. 17 and Dec. 31.</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>Oak View Group</strong> has announced the appointment of <strong>Amy Latimer</strong> as chief business officer of Oak View Group. Latimer will oversee the full suite of offerings that OVG employs at its own venues and offers to partners at iconic venues throughout the world, including management, hospitality, security, parking, sustainability consulting, and premium experiences.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am thrilled to welcome Amy to the OVG Family. She is a longtime friend of OVG and uniquely shares our values, our entrepreneurial spirit, and our global ambitions. She is an incredibly well-respected leader, and her work spanning venues, teams, hospitality, development, and premium experiences make her perfectly qualified to join our diverse, deeply talented team. Oak View Group continues to grow exponentially on a global basis, and Amy’s partner-first perspective and deep understanding of how to create and deliver world-class venue experiences will provide additional support and innovation to our team, our partners, and the communities in which we operate,” said Chris Granger, interim CEO of Oak View Group.</p>\n<p>\n\t“After a tremendous and deeply rewarding 30 years with Delaware North, I am excited for this next chapter of my career,” said Latimer. “OVG’s growth trajectory is beyond compelling, they have an extremely accomplished leadership team, and their vision for the future of our industry is exciting, to say the least. I look forward to partnering with Chris, the leadership team, and the ownership group to support and further accelerate OVG’s relentless focus on partnership, innovation, and community impact.” </p>\n<p>\n\tLatimer, who will be based in Boston, will join OVG on Oct. 24, 2025. She will report to Chris Granger.</p>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tMonday, Sept. 29 \t</h3>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Warner Chappell Music</strong>, the music publishing arm of Warner Music Group, today announced the signing of Eagles founding member Bernie Leadon to a long-term, worldwide publishing agreement. </p>\n<p>\n\t “I have been associated with Warner Chappell and the rest of Warner Music since 1971,” said Leadon in a statement. “I am delighted to renew my connections with them now at this point in the 21st Century. Warner Chappell and Warner Music have always been at the pinnacle of support for songwriters and other music creators, and that reality is still very evident in the current leadership and staff. My sincere thanks go to all of them.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Rock and Roll Hall of Famer is slated to release his first solo album in more than two decades,” Too Late to Be Cool,” on Oct. 10. Most recently, Leadon was a headliner at the AmericanaFest in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>\n<p>\n\tWCM’s Guy Moot, Co-Chair and CEO, and Carianne Marshall, Co-Chair and COO, said: “It’s no exaggeration to say that much of the music we call Americana today owes a deep debt to Bernie’s boundary-crossing inspiration. He has helped shape a canon of iconic music, from his early years with genre-defying groups like The Flying Burrito Brothers and Dillard & Clark to his generation-defining work with the Eagles to his countless collaborations with other artists. His creativity, musical brilliance, and pure devotion to his craft have made him a true American treasure, with six decades of extraordinary songs and sounds to his credit. We’re honored and excited to welcome him into the Warner Chappell family.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGreg Sowders, SVP, A&R and Catalog, WCM added: “As a master musician, songwriter and member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Bernie inspired me to start my first real band. And now as his music publisher, I continue to be inspired by his writing and playing, particularly by his new album Too Late To Be Cool. His legend continues.”</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>A2IM</strong> (The American Association of Independent Music), today announces that <strong>Ian Harrison </strong>has been appointed as chief executive officer effective Oct. 1. Harrison succeeds Dr. Richard James Burgess, who will step down at the end of this year. </p>\n<p>\n\tHarrison brings more than 20 years of leadership in the independent music sector, most recently as executive VP of Hopeless Records. Over two decades, he helped transform the label from a small independent into a globally recognized powerhouse. His work as part of the Hopeless Foundation (Sub City) has raised over 3.5 million dollars for a variety of music and mental health charities.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to his label leadership, Harrison has been a longstanding contributor to A2IM and the broader indie community. He has been actively involved with A2IM since 2012 as an Indie Week committee member, five-time speaker and mentor. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The independent community is stronger and more dynamic than ever, yet also facing accelerating challenges that will test our resilience and adaptability. A2IM exists to ensure our members can grow independently in the face of these changes and thrive on their own terms.</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>Carlos “Charly” Pérez</strong> has announced the launch of <strong>Studio VII</strong>, his new firm specializing in communications, public relations, entertainment, as well as the production of experiences and events. The project launches alongside an active strategic alliance with Warner Music Latina, focused on developing new talent and strengthening the company’s artist roster. This collaboration remains non-exclusive, allowing room for new opportunities and partnerships.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe firm is based in the United States, Puerto Rico and is also operating across Mexico, the rest of Latin America and Spain. Studio VII supports artists, brands, and cultural projects from concept to execution, delivering high-impact campaigns, customized events and strategic activations in key markets. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Studio VII represents a new professional chapter that allows me to continue developing projects through an independent structure, while maintaining my collaboration with Warner Music Latina on strategic initiatives,” said Pérez. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t+ <strong>Communities In Schools of Tennessee </strong>(CISTN) today recognized <strong>Creative Artists Agency</strong> (CAA) and the <strong>Scarlett Family Foundation</strong> for their long-standing support at its “All in For Kids” fundraising breakfast.</p>\n<p>\n\tCAA, the world’s leading entertainment and sports agency, received the “All in For Kids Award,” which recognizes a CISTN supporter or organization that has generously given time and resources to significantly advance the nonprofit’s mission to ensure all students have the support they need to succeed in school and in life. John Huie, music agent and founding partner of CAA Nashville, accepted the award on behalf of the agency.</p>\n<p>\n\t“20 years ago, our CAA Nashville founders not only recognized but acted upon the importance of leading and providing support for initiatives aimed at creating a more resilient and equitable public education system in Nashville,” said Colby Gallahar, manager, CAA Foundation. “Through our partnership with CISTN, we remain committed to volunteering time and resources to ensure students are provided with the best education possible, protecting their dreams of becoming future community leaders, educators, first responders, and more!”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Scarlett Family Foundation was recognized with the Alice Chapman Advocacy Award, named in honor of the leadership and legacy of the late Alice Chapman, a member of CISTN’s founding task force who went on to serve as chair of the board. Tara Scarlett, the immediate past chair of CISTN’s board, accepted the award on behalf of her family.</p>\n</div>",

In addition, the festival announced it was cancelling an Oct. 3 conversation between Panahi and Martin Scorsese. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe culprit is the government shutdown, which kicked off on Sept. 30 after congressional leaders failed to reach a funding deal. “It Was Just an Accident” follows a mechanic (Vahid Mobasseri), who believes he has run into the intelligence officer (Ebrahim Azizi) who tortured him. The film is Panahi’s first since being incarcerated for several months in 2023 for criticizing the Iranian government. He was banned from making movies for 14 years and shot his latest production in secret. “It Was Just an Accident” debuted at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d’Or. It has been selected as France’s entry for the Academy Awards.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe French producers were able to attend the premiere of “It Was Just an Accident.” In an introduction to the film, NYFF Artistic Director Dennis Lim paid tribute to Panahi. “He’s the person we need in this moment,” he said. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tNeon bought the North American distribution rights to “It Was Just an Accident.” Despite facing repression in his native country, Panahi is one of the world’s leading auteurs. His films include “The Circle,” “Offside,” “This is Not a Film,” and “Taxi.” Scorsese is the subject of “Mr. Scorsese,” a five-part series about his work from Rebecca Miller that will screen at NYFF. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<h2 id=\"section-heading\">\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t</h2>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/markets-festivals/government-shutdown-director-jafar-panahi-skip-new-york-film-festival-premiere-1236537486/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/It-Was-Just-an-Accident.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"It Was Just an Accident\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n<div>\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/diddy-asks-judge-for-leniency-ahead-of-sentencing-1236537493/\">\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1661384325.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1\" alt=\"Diddy accepts the Global Icon Award onstage at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards held at Prudential Center on September 12, 2023 in Newark, New Jersey.

His newest epic, “One Battle After Another,” is currently projected to earn 14 Oscar nominations — a milestone reached by only three films in Academy Awards history: “All About Eve” (1950), “Titanic” (1997) and “La La Land” (2016).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe sweeping action-dramedy is currently listed in nearly every major category — from best picture and director to technical fields such as cinematography, editing and sound — as well as a potential nod in the newly introduced casting category. With Leonardo DiCaprio leading a star-studded ensemble, Anderson has assembled the kind of cast the Actors Branch has historically favored with multiple acting nominations.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile other best picture contenders like “Wicked: For Good,” “Hamnet” and “Sinners” are expected to perform strongly, “One Battle After Another” appears poised to dominate both above-the-line categories and technical fields. This combination typically signals a serious contender for the top prize. And who knows, OBAA could do even better. Adding the possibility of Benicio del Toro joining Sean Penn in the supporting actor race would give the film two contenders in that category alone, and that’s why the industry awaits official word on whether breakout newcomer Chase Infiniti will officially campaign — lead or supporting actress.</p>\n<p>\n\tWarner Bros., the film’s distributor, is leading all studios in this year’s awards race, with a slate that also includes “Sinners” and possibly sprinkled recognition for “Weapons” and “Superman.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, nominations are only the beginning. </p>\n<p>\n\t“All About Eve” and “La La Land” each converted their 14 nominations into six wins (with the latter famously losing best picture to “Moonlight”), while “Titanic” swept 11 categories, including best picture. Whether “One Battle After Another” will match James Cameron’s dominance or simply join the record books will depend on the next six months of awards campaigning.</p>\n<p>\n\tTop 4 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): “One Battle After Another” (14); “Wicked: For Good” (12); “Hamnet” and “Sinners” (11); “Sentimental Value” (6)</p>\n<p>\n\tTop 4 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

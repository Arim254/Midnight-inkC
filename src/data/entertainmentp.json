    "body": "\n\tParenting doesn’t come with a user manual and there’s never going to be a perfect solution to every situation. But this award season is full of films with mothers who make decisions and sacrifices that will be debated well beyond WhatsApp chats, school drop offs and personal therapy sessions.\n\n\tIs the decision that Teyana Taylor’s “One Battle After Another” revolutionary activist Perfidia Beverly Hills makes to go on the lam and abandon her young child an act of selfishness and self-preservation? Or is it a means of saving her daughter from the dangers of growing up with her, someone who regrets becoming a parent? Is it right for “Sinners’” Grace (Li Jun Li) to sacrifice the last surviving humans at a juke joint to a swarm of vampires if it means she may be able to save the child she has back at home? Is Rose Byrne’s Linda in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” acting on the best interest of her daughter’s medical care? Or is she burned out and drowning in the exhaustiveness of feeding tubes, doctor’s appointments and everything else life throws at her?\n\t\n\n\tMary Bronstein, who wrote and directed “Legs” based on her own experiences (and who appears in the film as a doctor unsympathetic to Linda’s plight), says that “there’s a fantasy fulfillment” to her film; that she couldn’t speak out in parenting support sessions or leave her child at a hotel unsupervised… but Linda can.\n\n\n\t“When you have a child with special needs, or when you’re in a crisis situation with your child, everybody is placating you and trying to make you feel better by saying, ‘It’s not your fault,’” she says.\n\t\n\n\tShe describes these feelings as both confusing and guilt-inducing because “you’re also positioned as the main person that’s in charge of helping your child.”\n\n\tTold from Linda’s point of view, “Legs” shows a caretaker unraveling. The disorder the character’s daughter has is deliberately never named. Bronstein says that choice was made because, if it was named, then it becomes a movie “about a specific illness that a mother is trying to fix or find a cure for.” The daughter’s face is also hidden for most of the movie, and much screentime is fixated on Linda, with her increasingly greasy hair and dark shadows under her eyes. Bronstein also added the sly twist that Linda is a therapist, meaning her entire world is supposed to be about caring for other people.\n\n\t“A big part of this movie centers on the trauma that Linda is experiencing, that Linda holds within her body,” Bronstein says. “The trauma of different things that have happened with the daughter, those are things that she has hidden away in the back of her mind. And one very major one reveals itself to her and slaps her in the face.”\n\n\tBronstein says that “with trauma, I believe that you do hold it in your body somewhere and, if you don’t deal with it, it’s going to get you at some point. And you can’t run away from it, because it’s not external; it’s internal.”\n\n\tWhatever audiences might think of Linda and her decisions, the concept of parental trauma is also seen on film this year in mothers who adhere closer to the textbook definition of “good” parents. Jessie Buckley’s Agnes in “Hamnet” is angry at herself as much as she is guilt-ridden that she couldn’t save one child because she was so fixated on protecting another. Kate Hudson’s wounded musician Claire in “Song Sung Blue” can only see to help her daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) after she puts on her own oxygen mask and gets sober. “KPop Demon Hunters’” Celine (Yunjin Kim) teaches her adoptive daughter to feel shame and hide her true self rather than discuss her otherness.\n\n\tIn director Eric Lin and screenwriter Marilyn Fu’s “Rosemead,” which is based on a true story covered in a 2017 Los Angeles Times piece, Lucy Liu’s Irene must weigh how her own terminal cancer diagnosis will impact her teenage son Joe’s (Lawrence Shou) newly diagnosed schizophrenia. Coping with all of this, as well as the recent loss of her husband to cancer and cultural stigmas toward therapy, Western medicine and mental disorders, Irene uses stoicism to hide her own fears. She both supports her son by joining him in his therapy sessions, even if they make her uncomfortable, and attempts to protect him from ostracization within the community by lying about why he’s there when he’s seen going into these sessions.\n\t\n\n\t“I think there’s a shame behind it [and] I don’t think it’s just solely the Asian community,” she says of reaction to Joe’s diagnosis and treatment. “It’s a stigma that everyone holds that therapy is for someone who really has a problem, and nobody wants to be known as somebody who has a problem or an issue.”\n\n\tThe reality, she continues, “is that we all have to process something that happens to us, whether it’s severe or not.”\n\n\tIn fact, the movie centers so much on Irene’s dedication and concern for her son that it’s easy to forget just how sick she is until her doctor gives her the final diagnosis.\n\n\tLiu thinks Irene’s grief over the loss of her husband plus “the secrecy and the hiding and the stories she made up to try to fit into society, and to also make sure that her son was not sequestered from the community or from other kids … that struggle already was so difficult on top of the physical illness that she was experiencing.”\n\n\t“The corporal body was weak, but her inner willpower and her courage and her love for her son was really strong,” Liu says. “That dynamic tension [and] that urgency sort of fills the time on screen. Her personality comes through with the urgency of trying to save her son because she’s losing her son even though he’s right there in the house.”\n\n\tThe movie ends with Irene making the only decision she deems possible, a parental act of both love and fear.\n\n\t“It’s definitely going to spark conversation, and it should really create a comfortable, safe place for discussion and reaction because it is such a powerful moment of choice for her,” Liu says of the finale. “It’s obviously not for everyone, but it’s a haunting reality that that if it weren’t true, nobody would believe it. I think the legacy that she left behind is something to hold up in our community and others to say that things can become like this if you don’t take these simple steps.”\n\n\tLiu says that parents are taught to be present and work with their children in their current situations, but they also inevitably “futurize or try to live in another fantasy world.” She says she thinks Irene’s decision is “symbolic of how lonely she was and how isolated she was, and how real it was to her.”\n\n\tShe doesn’t know if her own family has experiences with mental disorders, saying, “I don’t know enough about my history because there has been so much secrecy in our own family.” But she says she has seen in society that “everyone wants to solve the puzzle — and it’s not a puzzle to be solved. It’s a puzzle to be lived. And that’s something that people just don’t want to believe because they’re not really living it the way that you are.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tUnder the oversight of Bari Weiss, CBS’s newly revamped weeknight news program is waving the American flag — and it’s not apologizing for its pro-U.S. editorial stance.\n\n\tOn Friday, the program released a statement outlining “five simple principles” that will inform the show’s presentation of the news under anchor Tony Dokoupil, who was previously a morning news anchor on CBS. According to CBS News, what had formerly been a “38-page handbook” is now “5 simple values.”\n\t\n\n\tDokoupil was appointed to the anchor chair of “CBS Evening News” last month by Weiss, the editor in chief of CBS News and founder of The Free Press, which describes itself as “a new media company built on the ideals that were once the bedrock of American journalism.” Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison acquired The Free Press in a reported $150 million deal and installed Weiss to oversee CBS News’ editorial operations in what he said was an effort to restore viewers’ trust in the outlet.\n\n\n\t“When the new ‘CBS Evening News’ kicks off on Monday, we promise to live by these five simple principles – from our very first show on the road, to our first broadcast on the new set in New York, and every one after that,” the show said in a series of posts on social media.\n\n\tOne of the principles outlined by “CBS Evening News” was this: “We love America. And we make no apologies for saying so. Our foundational values of liberty, equality and the rule of law make us the last best hope on Earth.” The news show said that “We aim to do our part every night: One way to think about our show is as a daily conversation about exactly where we are as a country and where we are going.”\n\t\n\n\tOn Thursday, Jan. 1, Dokoupil shared his thoughts on the state of journalism in the U.S. ahead of his taking over as “CBS Evening News” anchor. \n\n\t“People do not trust us like they used to,” Dokoupil said in a video shared on CBSNews.com. He continued: “On too many stories, the press has missed the story. And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates, and not the average American. Or, we put too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\n\tHere are the “five simple principles” that “CBS Evening News” says it will be guided by with Dokoupil as the anchor:\n\n\nWe work for you. That means you come first. Not our advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests, including the corporate owners of CBS News.\nWe report on the world as it is. We’ll be honest and direct with you. That means no weasel words or padded landings. We’ll tell you what we know, when we know it. Well update our reporting when we uncover new facts. And we’ll admit when we get it wrong.\nWe respect you. We believe that our fellow Americans are smart and discerning. It’s our job to present you with the fullest picture — and the strongest voices on all sides of an issue. We trust you to make up your own minds, and to make the decisions that are best for you, your families and your communities.\nWe love America. And we make no apologies for saying so. Our foundational values of liberty, equality and the rule of law make us the last best hope on Earth. We also believe in Franklin’s famous line about America as a republic — if we can keep it. We aim to do our part every night: One way to think about our show is as a daily conversation about exactly where we are as a country and where we are going.\nWe respect tradition, but we also believe in the future. We embrace the tools that allow us to reach you where you are. Some of you will watch this show on linear television. Others will increasingly watch it on social media. What we can guarantee is that the tools will continue to change — but some things never will. One of those things is honest journalism.\n\n\n\n\t“CBS Evening News” with Tony Dokoupil premieres Monday, Jan. 5, at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat does it mean to bring a child into today’s world? Based on some of this year’s buzziest films, that question is on the minds of contemporary directors and writers.\n\n\tFrom the postpartum loneliness and depression that many mothers face depicted in Lynne Ramsay’s “Die My Love,” the multi-generational fight for meaningful change in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” to the never-ending economic stresses placed on family in Park Chan-wook’s “No Other Choice,” many of this year’s films take an unflinching look at the anxiety parents — and, in turn, their children — face in today’s increasingly politically volatile world.\n\t\n\n\tIn appreciating the links between these different stories, “Train Dreams” director and co-writer Clint Bentley says: “The world, for most of us, feels like it’s turning on its axis a bit. Whether we live in Des Moines or Dubai, we feel like the world is changing in a way we can’t quite understand, and that there might be a kind of end-of-the-world feeling even as we’re all going on. Part of that is through, ‘What do I give to the next generation? How do I take care of my kids and give them something when everything seems like it’s fucked up, and that we all kind of fucked it up?’”\n\n\n\tIn tackling grief, Oscar winner Chloé Zhao’s (“Nomadland”) period piece “Hamnet” explores how the death of William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) and Agnes Shakespeare’s (Jessie Buckley) son led to the creation of the much-studied play “Hamlet.” When author and co-writer Maggie O’Farrell, herself a student of English literature, read large Shakespeare biographies, she found herself “really angered” at scholars who claimed it was “impossible” to know whether the revered playwright grieved or not.\n\t\n\n\t“I threw the book across the room because you just think, ‘What are you talking about? Of course he grieved.’ And even if child mortality was high in the 16th century, which of course it was, it doesn’t make it any less devastating when your child dies,” O’Farrell says. “I refuse to believe that anywhere in the world at any point in time, it’s anything less than catastrophic to lose a child. In a way, I wanted to put Hamnet center stage and say to people, ‘We owe this child so much.’”\n\n\tBeyond some of the film’s brutally devastating scenes, which feature Agnes fighting to cure her children of the plague, Zhao and O’Farrell tap into how art can serve as a transcendent, cathartic force, as Shakespeare’s writing ensures Hamnet isn’t forgotten. O’Farrell says: “That’s why the line ‘Remember me,’ which the book ends with, has always been very important because I just wonder if that’s why Shakespeare wrote it. But obviously, Agnes and him had no idea for how many hundreds of years Hamnet would [actually] be remembered.”\n\n\t“Train Dreams,” which follows the life of an ordinary man (Joel Edgerton) in the early 20th century across the Pacific Northwest, serves as a great companion piece to “Hamnet” for its meditative exploration of grief. However, Bentley also wrestles with “the real tragedy” of parents having to spend long periods of time away for work: “You’re always kind of catching up and just when it feels you’re getting used to being back home, you’re leaving again. A lot of people experience that whether you’re a filmmaker, truck driver or somebody needing to leave their country.”\n\n\tSome directors, including Cherien Dabis, found the process of making their films cathartic and inspirational in their own right. For Dabis, writing, directing and acting in “All That’s Left of You,” a decades-spanning personal tale of a Palestinian family’s fight for survival, became a way to understand her own intergenerational trauma.\n\n\t“I definitely wanted to draw attention to the struggles of families under occupation, but especially parents who don’t really have the ability to protect their kids anymore,” Dabis says. “Often, what we see in Palestine is kids who, at some point, realize, ‘Well, my parents can’t protect me, so what use are they?’ It’s like parents lose all authority. I think that’s a problem; that’s something that we need to take a look at.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film, which is Jordan’s Oscar entry for Best International Feature, also deals with the loss of childhood innocence, as the young child Noor watches his father being stripped naked by Israeli soldiers. The father-son relationship quickly deteriorates in the years following the humiliation, and the scene was inspired by Dabis’ own experience — her first memory of traveling to Palestine.\n\n\t“My family was held at the border between Jordan and the West Bank for 12 hours; my parents were interrogated multiple times. The soldiers searched through all the contents of our suitcases and then ordered all of us to be strip searched, including myself and my baby sisters, who were age three and one,” Dabis recalls. “It was one of the first moments in my life where I really understood, viscerally, what it meant to be Palestinian.”\n\n\tIn varying ways, political pressures around the world have found their way into these films. Bentley, himself a father, explains how parents have to reckon with not just what it means to bring a child into the world, but how to prepare them for its realities: “[For example], how do I prepare them for the fact that it’s going to be hard to find a job with AI taking everything over? What do you do? The powerlessness of a parent really feeds into that.”\n\n\tAs many of these directors have traveled around the world with their films — both “Train Dreams” and “All That’s Left of You” started their campaigns at Sundance, and “Hamnet” bowed in Telluride and Toronto — they’ve realized how universal these stories can be in their specificity.\n\n\t“I’m always so excited when it feels like there’s something in the zeitgeist and filmmakers are capturing it. They’ve come together and made films at a similar moment in time, therefore creating a cultural dialogue — it’s almost proof that we’re all connected somehow,” Dabis says. “Even prior to this year, there have been trends toward really talking honestly and openly about motherhood in a way that empowers women.”\n\n\tTo unpack the unspoken pressures of motherhood, Mary Bronstein’s anxiety-including “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” situates the viewer in the subjective experience of one mother’s (Rose Byrne) life as she struggles to care for her child suffering from a mysterious illness. What’s inventive about the craft, here, is Bronstein choosing to have the child’s face be off-screen for most of the runtime, allowing the sound design to put viewers on edge.\n\t\n\n\t“I couldn’t think of another film that really reflected the feelings and experience I was having that got into the existential confusion of identity,” Bronstein says. “My film can be abstracted out to the feeling of disappearing into a care-taking role and how to hold onto your identity. Can you be an individual and a mother at the same time?”\n\n\tWhile Bronstein has received positive feedback from mothers feeling seen for the first time watching the film, especially in today’s climate with rights for women being taken away, what has pleasantly surprised her is hearing from young people who are finally understanding what their mother went through in raising them.\n\n\t“It can feel like a betrayal to the love of your child, and what I’m expressing in the movie is that it’s not. We should be able to talk about these difficult things and the loss of identity that women feel, and the scary parts of being in charge of another living human,” she says. “For women, there’s a freedom in seeing somebody finally express that to you.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a revealing new documentary about his life and career, Chevy Chase alleges that he suffered physical abuse as a child at the hands of his mother and stepfather.\n\n\tIn “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” which debuted Jan. 1 on CNN, Chase and his family and friends said he was beaten, locked in a closet and continually woken up with violence.\n\n\tChase’s parents divorced when he was about 4 years old, and both of them quickly remarried. He described his stepfather, John Cederquist, as “humorless.” Chase’s stepbrother, also named John Cederquist, said, “My father had a flash anger, and he could lash out with a single blow…He did not take to anything that he perceived as insolence. Chevy was insolent.”\n\t\n\n\tChase’s wife, Jayni, said the first time she stayed overnight with Chase and woke him up, he “shuddered.” “He explained, ‘Well, my mother would wake me up slapping me.’ From the time he was a little guy, wham!” she said.\n\n\n\tChase’s mother, Cathalene Browning, is described in the documentary as “a bag of cats, certainly on the schizoid spectrum.”\n\n\t“This was an out-of-control woman who I look back on and I say I feel sorry for her,” Chase said. “She had her own issues — bad ones. But, she was physically abusive to me.”\n\n\tPeter Aaron, a friend of the comedian’s, said Chase told him stories about the “terrible things that would happen to him as a young man — things like being locked in the closet.” Chase’s brother, Ned, added, “There was a cellar, and he was sent down there because of really messing up in school.” \n\n\tIn an interview with The New York Times published Friday, Chase alluded to being “slapped with a yardstick on your bare ass and on the backs of your legs until they’re so bruised that somebody else notices.”\n\t\n\n\tChase would get punished for receiving poor grades in school, but, ironically, he said he was failing academically because of the abuse. “Whereas others would concentrate on their homework, I didn’t have a chance at that,” he said. “I was always worried about one thing or another that had to do with my own health.”\n\n\tChase detailed one incident in which he and Ned were eating breakfast, and their stepfather came downstairs “and started slapping me across the back of the head.” Ned recalled, “I stood up and made it clear I didn’t think this was a time for corporal punishment. And John Cederquist sat down, and I sat down.”\n\n\t“I knew at that time that Ned was there for me,” Chase said. “That was a big moment for us.”\n\n\tWhen asked by director Marina Zenovich if there was a time when Chase walked away from his mother and stepfather and never saw them again, Chase pretended to swat a fly on his forehead, then licked his fingers as if eating the imaginary bug. “Sorry?” he asked, half-smiling.\n\n\tChase’s family and friends described how his trauma informed his comedy — a “coping mechanism” — and how it may have contributed to his struggles with depression in his later life. “It shaped him. He used comedy, he used humor as a way to mask what was going on inside. And that’s continued. It continues to this day,” said Emily Chase, his youngest daughter. “He will joke around from morning until night, and you won’t know what’s going on. … That’s how he always dealt with problems in his life.”\n\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” is now available to watch on CNN’s streaming platforms.\n",

    "body": "\n\t​The investigative docuseries “The Cult of the Real Housewife” has arrived on TLC, and the three-episode exposé unpacks allegations of cult behavior surrounding “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” reality star Mary Cosby and her church.​\n\n\tFrom first-hand accounts from ex-congregants to family members diving into Cosby’s turbulent childhood and her highly criticized marriage to her step-grandfather, the three-hour documentary reveals much more than the rumored cult leader accusations happening at Faith Temple Pentecostal Church, the church Cosby shares with her husband, Robert Cosby Sr., in Salt Lake City.\n\t\n\n\t​With appearances from investigative journalists and bloggers who have covered the story, as well as a leading cult expert, the docuseries features clips of recordings of controversial sermons preached by Mary and Robert, along with historical information about the rise of Faith Temple.​\n\n\n\t“The Cult of the Real Housewife” is directed and produced by Elli Hakami and Julian P. Hobbs, a directing duo who also led Discovery+’s “House of Hammer,” which chronicled sexual abuse allegations and the checkered family history of actor Armie Hammer.​\n\n\tBelow, we broke down the biggest revelations from the docuseries.\n\t\n\t\tCosby’s ex-boyfriend claims she was a childhood bully​\t\n\n\tMichael Enoch, a former member of Faith Temple Church and Cosby’s self-proclaimed childhood boyfriend, describes the reality star as having a mean streak as a kid: “Mary was a bully. I remember Mary picking on certain girls and controlling them. When you’re kids, you see these things and don’t think much of it. But as an adult, you look back on it. And she wasn’t a nice person.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCosby marries her step-grandfather after her grandmother died\t\n\n\tIn Season 1 of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” Cosby appeared with her husband, Robert Sr., discussing how her late grandmother arranged for her to marry her step-grandfather as expressed in her will. “She said if anything ever happens to me, I want you to marry one of my girls because they’ll look out for you,” Robert Sr. said during their confessional. The two, married since 1998 when Mary was in her early 20s, and Robert Sr. was 20 years her senior, share a son named Robert Jr.\n\t\n\t\tAudio leaks of Cosby berating her congregation​\t\n\n\tIn an audio clip that was allegedly obtained from someone inside the church, the documentary includes a resurfaced sound bite of Cosby speaking to members of her church, in which she called them “poor” and “stingy” for giving her only 14 birthday cards and not contributing enough with their tithes. Former church member and organist Ernest Enoch says he was present during the incident, and claims he gave her a birthday card with $1,000 inside.\n\t\n\t\tFormer members claim they felt forced to pay large payments in offerings\t\n\n\t​In addition to tithing, former churchgoers allege that the Cosbys would have six-month heave offerings, in which they would pressure members to make large financial sacrifices for the advancement of the church. Ex-church member Rosalind Enoch also claims that a week in between their heave offerings, they would also be told the church needed urgent financial assistance with offering requests up to $100,000 within a few days. \n\n\tRosalind also says members cashed out their 401Ks and mortgaged their homes in order to pay large sums to the church. “We would have these meetings after church, and Robert would instruct ushers to stand at the doors. You’re barricaded in there,” she says. “During this meeting, everyone put their name and amount on the list. If you didn’t have a certain amount, Robert would say, ‘And that’s all you have.’”\n\t\n\t\tCosby’s first cousin accuses her of having an affair​\t\n\n\tDan Cosby said ex-congregant Cameron Williams — who died after his appearance on “RHOSLC” in 2021 from complications after a brain tumor — talks about having an intimate relationship with Cosby. During a phone call, Dan says that Cameron told him Mary went to his house and requested that he put on music. After sitting beside her, Cameron allegedly told Dan, Mary grabbed his hand and started “rubbing her.”\n\t\n\n\tDan recalls, “According to Cameron, he put his hand in her vagina.” Dan continues, saying Cameron told him, “Then, we had sex.” In an audio clip with Dan, Cameron says, “We had the affair and all that, but that was me being victimized. It had to take therapy for me to get out of that.” Ernest also reveals that Cameron told him about the affair.\n\t\n\t\tFamily members claim Robert Sr. was abusive\t\n\n\t​In the documentary, Sam Kelly, Cosby’s uncle, describes Robert Sr. as having a two-faced personality and exhibiting cruel behavior toward him as a child. Growing up, Kelly recalls having meetings with Robert Sr. and other church elders  where they would gather the young men of the church over the weekend for lessons designed for their personal development.\n\n\tDuring those lessons, Dan and Kelly allege that Robert Sr. would force them to do pushups, sprint around the church, hold books while running in place, among other tasks. “He and some of the older elders were in the military, and they were putting that in us as kids,” Dan says while holding back tears. “For example, taking a pin and putting it under your knees so you wouldn’t hit the pin or it wouldn’t stick to you. I remember a kid couldn’t do a pushup or a sit up, and one of the elders kicked him.”\n\t\n\t\tCosby was excommunicated from the church as a young adult\t\n\n\tAccording to family members, Cosby had a difficult childhood where she allegedly would run away from home several times, skip school and frequently clash with her mother. Their strained relationship led to her grandmother stepping in to help take care of Cosby. Her troubled behavior reached a point where she was disfellowshipped from Faith Temple Church. While shunned, Cosby’s grandmother died.\n\t\n\t\tCosby allegedly divorced her first husband to marry Robert Sr.\t\n\n\t​Investigative journalist Cheyenne Roundtree found Cosby’s divorce and marriage records, which reveal that she married Robert Sr. 19 days after her divorce was finalized. After Cosby’s grandmother died, her family wasn’t supportive of her marriage to Robert Sr.\n\n\tDuring a walkout service, Cosby’s mother stood in the pulpit and publicly rejected their marriage in front of the congregation. “All these lies have been put out, that is not God,” she said in a video clip. “You hear me today. If this is my last stand in the pulpit, that is not God what’s going on around here.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFinancial abuse claims\t\n\n\tAccording to Roundtree, several church members told her they were expected to run errands, clean and manage bills, among other responsibilities, for Cosby and Robert Sr., free of charge. For five years, Rosalind — who at one point lived with the couple — says she was responsible for housekeeping and running errands. “I was never paid,” she says in the documentary. “I was collecting unemployment. I guess that’s what they thought I would live on. It was more like a slave plantation.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tKate Winslet sits down with a mix of exhilaration and disbelief. She’s still processing the magnitude of what she’s just done. The Oscar-winning actress (2008’s “The Reader”) has delivered her directorial debut, “Goodbye June,” an intimate family drama written by her son, Joe Anders, and the reality of it hasn’t quite settled in.\n\n\t“Even hearing you say that I’ve directed a film, I’m almost experiencing the aftershocks,” Winslet says with a smile. “As a woman, making films is hard, even as an actress. Women directors have to advocate for themselves so fiercely. I’ve spent years advocating for others, so suddenly finding myself in that community feels thrilling. I don’t think I ever truly imagined I’d be here.”\n\t\n\n\tThe moment arrived not through urgency, but timing. Winslet had always prioritized motherhood. Now, with her children grown — or growing — space finally opened. “Directing is an end-to-end commitment of a year, sometimes more,” she says. “That’s enormous. But the stars aligned, and in my 50th year, I damn well have to do it — and I loved it.”\n\n\n\t“Goodbye June” centers on a family gathering as its matriarch faces a terminal illness, a subject Winslet approaches with lived understanding after losing her own mother in 2017. The film boasts a formidable ensemble: Helen Mirren, Toni Collette, Timothy Spall, Andrea Riseborough and Winslet herself.\n\n\tWinslet drew on decades in front of the camera to rethink how actors are supported on set. Overhead boom microphones were eliminated. Hidden mics replaced them. Cameras were locked off. For the most private scenes, the crew quietly stepped away.\n\t\n\n\t“I wanted to disarm the space,” Winslet explains. “To remove the things that pull actors out of themselves.”\n\n\tThe result is a film that finds humor inside grief without softening its truth. “Life doesn’t stop being funny just because it’s painful,” Winslet shares. “Sometimes laughter is the only way through.”\n\n\tFor a first-time director, Winslet’s approach feels both considered and instinctive, rooted in empathy and trust. Whether “Goodbye June” marks the beginning of a new chapter or a singular act remains to be seen. But for now, Winslet is allowing herself a moment to acknowledge what she’s built.\n\n\t“I really did it,” she says, still sounding slightly surprised.\n\n\tOn this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, Winslet talks about preparing for this moment in her career, working with her son, and what she wants to do next.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Goodbye June” stars Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet. (Kimberley French / Netflix / Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRead excerpts from her interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\tHow did your experience as an actor shape the way you directed?\n\n\tI knew immediately how to bypass things that wouldn’t be helpful. What surprised me was how different every actor’s needs were. Each person needed something specific from me, and adapting to that was wonderful. It meant learning who they were, what they needed to feel safe — and building trust. That trust was everything.\n\n\tTalk about the choices to eliminate boom microphones on set.\n\n\tAs an actor, I find them incredibly distracting. They move, they hover, and I always feel bad for the person holding them. Boom operators are brilliant, but they anticipate movement — and if an actor changes their mind mid-take, it can throw you out of the moment. I wanted to remove that distraction. We also had children in the film, and little kids always look up at the big black thing waving above their heads. Without booms, that problem disappeared.\n\n\tWhat led you to lock off cameras and clear the set for intimate scenes?\n\n\tIn the quietest scenes — between Helen Mirren and Timothy Spall, or Toni Collette and Helen in the hospital bathroom — the actors were completely alone. Cameras were rolling, but no one was operating them. Helen said to me, “I’ve never had that in my life, and I’m so grateful.” That meant everything. It allowed a different emotional texture to emerge — something very real.\n\t\n\n\tHow did you balance grief with humor in the film?\n\n\tThat balance was essential. When you’re facing tragedy, laughter still happens — sometimes at moments that feel inappropriate. When my own mother was five days from passing, she told my daughter she should take her bras because she wouldn’t need them anymore. We laughed. That moment was how my daughter understood she was losing her grandmother. That’s life. Humor is part of it.\n\n\tHow did you manage a 35-day shoot with Helen Mirren for only 16 days?\n\n\tI’m a forward thinker. If you’re number one on the call sheet and you slow things down, you jeopardize the entire day. With a schedule like that, you cannot afford to drop a scene — you may never get it back. My prep with my DP, Alvin Küchler, was incredibly detailed. He practically moved into my house for a week. We planned everything.\n\n\tWhat was the biggest challenge about directing yourself?\n\n\tThat was the one thing I didn’t know how I’d handle. I had to be ready with multiple choices for myself so that in the edit I’d have options. My instinct is never to put myself first, so I’d always prioritize coverage of the other actors — and then realize I had to rush my own. It was insane. But also exhilarating.\n\n\tDid your photographic memory surprise you in the edit?\n\n\tI could remember specific takes—what worked, what didn’t. I’d say to my editor, Lucia Zucchetti, “Stay on take five.” She’d question it, and I’d say, “No, trust me.” And I was right. That helped us maintain a strong emotional through line.\n\n\tWhat was it like collaborating with your son, Joe Anders, on the screenplay?\n\n\tJoe doesn’t know how I work on set, and I can’t teach my children how to do this job. They have to find their own way. I’m incredibly proud of both my kids because they’re carving their own paths. Collaborating with your child — and having meaningful creative conversations — is very special.\n\n\tWhat struck you most about Timothy Spall’s performance?\n\n\tThere’s a moment when his character is asked, “Do you still love her?” He says nothing. It’s all in his eyes. The hurt, the betrayal — you see his heart crack open. It’s some of the best acting I’ve ever witnessed.\n\n\tHow did you approach the film’s visual language?\n\t\n\n\tThis is a messy, complicated family living with long-term illness. I didn’t want cancer to become the narrative. That’s not the story. The story is how a family is pulled closer together. Early on, I hold back visually — it’s the space between people that tells us how distant they are.\n\n\tDo you want to direct again?\n\n\tI would love to. I genuinely would. I’ve only just delivered the film, so I don’t know yet — but yes, I’d love to.\n\n\tWhat was it like returning to “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and what did it remind you about acting?\n\n\tI shot it years ago, but the experience was extraordinary. The training was intense. Jim Cameron’s passion is unmatched. And as I get older, I realize how much I love being in a pack with other actors. That energy matters. I was fortunate to be part of it.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the series finale of “Stranger Things,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tGaten Matarazzo was hardly a teenager when Matt and Ross Duffer cast him as the insatiably lovable Dustin Henderson in the first season of “Stranger Things.” Now, nine-and-a-half years and five seasons later, the Netflix phenomenon has come to a close, with the series’ epic finale releasing in theaters and on the streamer on Dec. 31.\n\t\n\n\tMatarazzo caught the film on the big screen on New Year’s Eve while visiting family in Jacksonville, Fla. over the holidays. “I went dressed fully as the Grinch so no one recognized me,” Matarazzo told Variety, “but the theater was small enough that I was like ‘Ah, whatever,’ and took the mask off.”\n\n\n\tWrapping up nearly a decade of storytelling, the finale concludes the arcs of the show’s expansive ensemble, giving everyone at least one heroic moment. Dustin — a fan-favorite from the very first episode because of his infectious optimism and unapologetic nerdiness — is no exception. The hero uses his best qualities to contribute to archvillain Vecna’s (Jamie Campbell Bower) defeat. However, the character’s most memorable scene comes in the episode’s final act, when Dustin delivers his graduation speech as Hawkins High School’s Class of 1989 valedictorian. Articulating the themes of the show, Dustin speaks with endearing authority about how friendships have been forged and strengthened through strife. He then shifts his tone, ending the speech by telling off Principal Higgins (Bill Winkler) and shedding his robes for a Hellfire Club T-shirt, riffing on Eddie Munson’s (Joseph Quinn) iconic Season 4 line, “This is our year!” to thunderous applause.\n\t\n\n\t“A lot of shows don’t really give characters the opportunity to kind of just, for lack of a better word, talk shit and air everything out and speak unapologetically about the way they feel,” Matarazzo says of the experience. “I didn’t take for granted how special that opportunity was.”\n\n\tDespite tense moments aplenty, the finale concludes Dustin’s story on an optimistic note, showing him going to college and still making time for adventures with his unlikely best friend from the past few seasons, Steve Harrington (Joe Keery).\n\n\tVariety spoke with Matarazzo about his experience closing the book on “Stranger Things” after nearly a decade of growing up with Dustin.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen did you find out that the “Stranger Things” finale would play in theaters?\t\n\n\tOfficially we found out when it was released to the public. I think we expected it, but there were times when they said they weren’t doing it, but it kept coming up throughout the show. Matt and Ross had been trying to get it done for a while and all of us kept going back to them asking for updates. We’d ask if there was anything we could say to make it happen and they’d say, “No.” They had to work it out on their end because it went against the model that Netflix created and it wasn’t something that had ever been done for TV before. They’d done it for movies, though, so that was probably the kicker. It ended up being put together really quickly once it was confirmed. We went from hearing that it’s not going to happen to, “Never mind, it’s a go” kind of out of nowhere.\n\t\n\t\tDid you get a chance to see it in theaters with an audience?\t\n\n\tYeah, I went with my mom and my siblings when we were visiting her in Jacksonville for the holidays. We made sure that we reserved spots at a theater nearby. The theater itself was actually quite small, so it was really just like four or five other families. I went dressed fully as the Grinch so no one recognized me, but the theater was small enough that I was like “Ah, whatever” and took the mask off.\n\t\n\t\tThe finale looks great in the theater, especially those scenes in the Abyss. What was it like choreographing those battles with the giant Mind Flayer?\t\n\n\tOh man, those days were crazy. They can be the most stressful days because you’re not saying much for a long time. You’ll just be doing so much cardio and then you look up at a tennis ball and go “Ahhhh” and hope it looks good. Luckily, when we ended up watching it, it looks great. The final form of the Mind Flayer, that crazy big Lovecraftian thing, looks unreal.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI know that my theater was very nervous for the fate of all the characters. Did you know how Dustin’s story would end before reading the final script? Were you ever worried that he might not make it?\t\n\n\tWe were all curious going in, and I think everyone was open to the idea of our characters dying, but I just don’t think that was the show that they really had in mind. A lot of the obsession with who’s dying was more fan-pushed than anything. I could be wrong, but I don’t think the creative team ever really pushed that the main characters wouldn’t make it out alive. And I think that ultimately ended up being a really great way to define what the show was about. It’s about persevering through unimaginable odds. I think there’s something special there. The point is that the kids make it through, so I was never really scared. Also, if one of us was dying, I feel like they would have told us before the writing process even started. It’s not something they would have sprung on us in the table read. They would have told us individually if it was coming.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your reaction to finding out where Dustin ends up at the end of the series?\t\n\n\tIt’s such a relief. They’ve all been through so much, so to see him going forward and taking a breath and finally having a shred of normalcy — it’s all he really could have asked for. And that’s what’s so tragic about the end of Eleven’s story. Normalcy would never be guaranteed for the people that she loves if she was there. She didn’t see it as fair, and I think it was a beautiful choice to end her story the way that they did.\n\t\n\t\tDo you have a personal belief in whether or not Eleven is alive?\t\n\n\tI do, but I want to keep that private. I don’t know if others will, but I think that whatever works for you and makes the show wrap up better for you is correct. You have the right to debate it, but whatever you want it to be for you is great. I think they teeter that line very well, because I’ve already noticed a kind of 50/50 split amongst fans about whether they believe.\n\t\n\t\tHow was it preparing and delivering Dustin’s graduation speech where he gets to sum up the point of the show, but also stick it to the principal one last time?\t\n\n\tOh, it was fun. It was a really special opportunity to be given that monologue. It can be a bit stressful to say all those words, especially in front of such a large audience, but a lot of shows don’t really give characters the opportunity to kind of just, for lack of a better word, talk shit and air everything out and speak unapologetically about the way they feel. I didn’t take for granted how special that opportunity was. It also shows that Dustin is in a vastly better place from the start of the season.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDustin has a lot of really emotional scenes in Season 5. How did it feel to tap into the darker, sadder sides of this typically optimistic character?\t\n\n\tIt was weird. It was definitely on the scarier side. I love the show so much, and I was really excited to jump back into what I did in the previous four seasons, so the change was kind of a curve ball thrown out of nowhere and nerve-racking, but I understood it. I was a little anxious, but I felt very honored that Matt and Ross trusted me to approach Dustin differently and give me what I saw as a challenge. I’m always up for a tone shift, and it was a kind of performance that Matt and Ross had never seen me do. There are worlds where actors excel in different genres and styles, but when called upon to jump into something tonally different, it can feel clunky. I wanted to try giving everything I got to be as truthful as I could and service the story the way it deserves. So there was a little bit more pressure, but I was super up for the opportunity. I found it really cool, cathartic and sometimes very fun.\n\t\n\t\tBecause Dustin sort of inherits Eddie’s persona in Hawkins for Season 5, I’m curious if you ever reconnected with Joseph Quinn and discussed your characters going into the final season?\t\n\n\tNot much. I think it was kind of the point that Dustin didn’t get to talk to him as much as he wanted. I had to be as truthful as I could and not ask him too much, because Dustin doesn’t have the opportunity to ask Eddie very much. He has to learn as he goes. The one thing I did ask is if there was any music he listened to to prep, because Eddie’s uncle gave Dustin Eddie’s tapes. It was a great playlist, and I listened to a good chunk of that. I don’t know if that’s something he likes to keep private or not, but it was a lot of good stuff. It actually ended up shifting my taste in music for the year quite a bit.\n\n\t\n\t\tDustin and Steve have become one of the show’s most iconic duos. Did you ever anticipate this for the characters in the early seasons? How has your relationship with Joe Keery developed over the years?\t\n\n\tJoe is the absolute best. He’s the MVP of every room he walks into, and I don’t think he even knows it. He has a leadership quality that he doesn’t demand, but commands, seemingly without trying. He’s a strong actor, a very thoughtful actor, very grounded, a good friend and a tremendously funny guy. It was something that I was so excited to approach when Season 2 started when we had a few scenes together. Before that I didn’t think I’d ever get to work with him, so I was excited to take the opportunity while it was there. Thankfully, it just clicked. \n\n\tI think it’s because these characters were at a crossroads, and we were trying to figure out what to do with them. No one really knew what was next for them. They attempted a bit of a tug-of-war, will-they-won’t-they thing with both Dustin and Lucas [Caleb McLaughlin] having crushes on Max [Sadie Sink], but it was so clear that Caleb and Sadie just had such incredible chemistry and those characters just worked so well together that they ditched the rivalry. That was the train-track scene, Dustin trying to figure out how he can approach telling Max that he likes her and then it’s so funny how literally they drop it instantly after that. Lucas and Max end up together because it just wasn’t clunky and keeping Dustin in that plot would have been weird and bloated. Similarly, Nancy and Jonathan were clearly the couple that were going to be working consistently as the season went on, so it was like “What the fuck do we do with Dustin and Steve right now?” Because they were both kind of dealing with similar predicaments in their love lives and they kind of had something to relate to there. Thankfully, there was a quality that worked between us and we locked into it.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSeason 5 also introduces a slew of younger characters. What was it like to no longer be the youngest actors on set, and to have these kids around and probably looking up to you?\t\n\n\tThey’re the best, talented group of kids. I was so excited for them and their opportunity. They held it down so well, and they brought such a cool energy to such a cool plot line. It’s one of those things that Matt, Ross and Carmen [Cuba], the casting director, seem to have a gauge for and understanding of, because when it comes to casting kids in TV, it’s not just what comes across off the page and whether something works, it’s gauging whether or not there’s going to be an ease in a work environment. It’s hard to put the expectations of a very big show running smoothly in the hands of children. \n\n\tThat’s kind of what was thrusted upon us when we were quite young, but I think they found out how to do it properly and get the right people. These kids are so talented and so kind and I think they had a good time doing it. It was so nice to get to know them and see them experience the show the way that we did, but through a lens of a little more experience. That was really special.\n\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve basically spent your entire adolescence playing Dustin. How has growing up with this character affected you over the years?\t\n\n\tWeirdly, it’s basically shaped everything about me, but I don’t think there’s any other way it could have happened. I spent so much of my time invested in trying to figure out who he was and I think I inevitably learned a lot about myself alongside him. Caleb has always said something really special and really interesting, which is that he knew Lucas before he knew himself, and that’s such an interesting perspective. I never thought of it that way, but he’s right. So much of our time and energy is focused on figuring out somebody that we are not and, inevitably, you end up inadvertently learning about yourself through that. And that’s really cool, so I think that I’m a very different person because of Dustin. I think that I am shaped into a different type of guy because I spend so much of my time shaping who he was. I always consider what i would be like as a person without the show and I’m hyper-convinced that I would be a worse one. It helped me prioritize the people in my life, and I love them very, very much.\n\t\n\t\tDo you have a favorite moment from the series as a whole, either on-screen or on set?\t\n\n\tThat’s such a good question, because now I can finally put it all into perspective and figure out what that really is for me, but it’s so tough. Seasons 4 and 5 feel like one chapter. It feels like one, very long season where they introduce Vecna and it’s like, “OK, great. This is the show now and it feels like one big chapter.” And I had so much fun doing all of what we called the “Scooby-Doo Group,” stuff with the Hawkins investigative crew in Season 4 in the Creel House, figuring out Henry’s backstory and trying to save Max. That was really cool, so I think that was my favorite.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWho on the cast have you grown closest with over the years and who have you learned the most from?\t\n\n\tThat’s so tough. I love everybody on the show so much. They are literally family, and I have such wonderful individual relationships with all of them. They’re so distinct from each other and that’s what’s so special. You know how some friend groups feel like you can’t imagine yourself hanging out with any of them individually? Like when work friends grab drinks, and it’s like, “I don’t think I can ever talk to any of these people by themselves.” I’m so happy that all of us have had the ability to maintain real friendships individually with each other throughout this process. I’m super grateful for that. I lived with Finn [Wolfhard] for about a year, and I think that cemented a cadence that you don’t really get with a person until you spend your mornings and nights with them consistently. It almost sounds like a couple, but we had this very shared experience with the show and getting to see him finish his movie, sell his movie, write his album and watch it all get released was really cool. And Caleb, I’ve never been able to have a heart to heart with anybody as much as I have with Caleb. There’s just a quality that he has. You just feel so safe with him and I just appreciate his candor and the level of respect he has for people. He shows what it means to be a really good friend and he’s taught me a lot.\n\t\n\t\tNow that the show is over, what do you hope Dustin’s legacy is for fans of “Stranger Things”?\t\n\n\tI’m thinking of a word that might seem inconsequential, but I don’t think that it is in the context of Dustin, and that’s “Enthusiasm.” I think something that’s so interesting about Dustin is that every time they’re in grave danger, he’s always kind of smiling. I think that it’s because he’s fully aware and acknowledges how fucking cool everything is. Like, they’re gonna die, they’re literally saving the world, but he’s still floored that he might be the first person to be in contact with exotic matter. He’s so excited and he’s so unapologetically nerdy and so invested in his interests and excited to learn. It’s very Mr. Clarke [Randy Havens]-esque. He’s so excited to learn about what he doesn’t know. A lot of people approach what they don’t know with angst or anxiety because the unknown is scary, but to Dustin, the unknown is the most exhilarating feeling in the world, because he has nothing but a drive to learn more about it. It’s really fun and it’s something that I strive to embody myself.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNo sound effect makes people squirm quite like grinding teeth. Zak Hilditch, who wrote and directed the new zombie feature “We Bury the Dead,” out today via Vertical, has seen the noise make audiences shudder in real time, as it’s the signature of the undead in his film.\n\n\t“When I was delving into the zombie world, we didn’t have all the money in the world, so how do I make these things unique?” Hilditch says. “This idea of growing agitation, what does that look and sound like? It sounds like teeth grinding to me. So that was something even I was milking as much as I possibly could, wherever I could, as it was going to be a really interesting thing to have echo throughout the film. That particular sound was something that the sound team, before we even shot the movie, was most excited about delving into because they could see the possibilities there. \n\t\n\n\t“It’s been interesting watching the film internationally this year, on the festival junket,” he continues. “When we hit that sound, it’s aching, like nails on a chalkboard. There were versions where it was even more extreme, and we had to pull it back a little bit to make it palatable for an audience. That was just one example of how this isn’t a big studio film at all, yet we did everything we could to put you in that headspace. The sound was so important in helping guide that through.”\n\n\n\tIn the film, Ava Newman (“Star Wars” alum Daisy Ridley) heads to Australia to find and recover her husband after a military accident. Unfortunately, the dead are rising after the incident, and Ava must avoid the teeth-grinding zombies.\n\t\n\n\t“Dead” is the Australia-based auteur’s eighth feature, and Hilditch was inspired to write it by the passing of his mother.\n\n\t“It was a personal initial kernel of an idea,” he says. “When it comes to grief, realizing there is no silver bullet or a special guidebook to get you through. When my mum passed, it was my job to pack down the family house that I grew up in, which she died in. It was weirdly cathartic having something physical to do. As a filmmaker, there was a part of me thinking, ‘I’m going room to room and making these discoveries.’ There’s something quite intimate yet surreal about it. I thought that there was something worth mining in terms of grief.”\n\n\tHilditch says that Ridley signing on for the project added an essential layer of humanity to the film.\n\n\t“It was just unbelievable,” he says. “She was the very first actress we sent the script to, and within one week, we were Zooming. She was absolutely perfect for the role: Right time, right place. When she arrived on set, seeing that side of her and how she was all-in on this character and my words that I had spewed out on the page … You see her taking that and turning it into a living, breathing entity that goes far beyond your wildest expectations of what this was going to be.”\n\n\tHilditch says “the whole movie rests on Ridley’s shoulders, and she absolutely crushed it.” \n\n\t“I can’t wait for people to see her in this light. I don’t think she’s done something quite like this before,” he adds. “To be plucked from the millions of people who would have died to play Rey, and get through all those three films, and then moving on to the next phase of your filmmaking life as an actor … She’s got a very eclectic bunch of tastes. I’m just really lucky that she saw something in my pages.”\n\n\tAs for the future, Hilditch loves working in horror but is most drawn in to stories led by dynamic characters, no matter the genre.\n\n\t“I just love ordinary people caught in extraordinary situations,” he says. “This is exactly an example of that. I definitely won’t be going back into zombie tales anytime soon. I never thought I was going to make a zombie movie until I made ‘We Bury the Dead.’ I only wanted to do it if I was able to say something new or interesting. I think I managed to find a fresh enough way to give people the zombie lore that they all have come to expect, but to really pull the rug on your expectations at the same time. If it can still do that, that’s an amazing thing in this modern age.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “We Bury the Dead” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSecuring the rights to use a song in film or TV is a challenging and expensive task — and the more iconic the song, the more challenging and expensive the clearance is likely to be.\n\n\tSo when two of Prince’s most legendary songs, “When Doves Cry” and “Purple Rain,” appeared in the finale of “Stranger Things,” it was obvious that therein lay a tale. And the tale is even more complicated than virtually anyone would have thought.\n\t\n\n\tWhy? Not only because of the challenges in clearing the songs with the Prince estate — but because of the show’s plot: The two songs required for that segment of the show had to be the first and last songs on one side of a single vinyl album, which, to use a reference from the show, is like a Rubik’s Cube for the music supervisor, and much more challenging than selecting Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill,” Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” or any of the show’s many other iconic music moments.\n\n\n\tThe hard work paid off: Since the episode debuted on New Year’s Eve, “Purple Rain” has seen a 243 percent increase in Spotify global streams and a 577 percent surge in global Gen-Z streams specifically, Variety can exclusively reveal. “When Doves Cry” also saw a 200 percent boost in global streams, as well as a 128 percent increase in Gen Z streams. \n\n\tAnd as you’ll see below, Nora Felder, president of Picture Music Company and a veteran music supervisor who has been on board for the entirety of “Stranger Things,” was more than up to the task — which doesn’t mean it was easy! Variety caught up with Felder on Friday afternoon to find out how she got it done …\n\t\n\n\tDid you do anything special for the finale?\n\n\tYes, I saw it in a theater with my family — I’ve never seen “Stranger Things” like that, with an audience. It was the first time I was able to really experience how they’re so emotionally attached to the characters — they were cheering and shrieking, some of them were crying. I can’t think of another way I would rather have seen it. \n\n\tI think the music in the show does so well because it stems from the fans being so attached to the characters and the stories, and the music extends their journeys, so they naturally become attached to it as well.\n\n\tMusic plays a bigger role in “Stranger Things” than a lot of similar episodic shows or films. Was that intentional from the jump?\n\n\tI think the intention was just to find songs to push the narrative of the story, and rolling up our sleeves and keying in on “What is the right song for this character?” and “What is the right song for each moment? Should this be score or a song?” I can’t speak on behalf of the Duffers, but I don’t think there was an overall sense of “We’re going to create something that’s going to make music such a main character that it’s going to blow up all over their world!” No, they just wanted songs that accented their characters, pushed the narrative, and showed the attachment of music to the characters — and how music can sometimes save you. \n\n\tDid we know the Clash was going to have a moment? Or Kate Bush or Metallica, or possibly what’s going on now? No, it’s always been about what is the most effective choice to either move this narrative or represent the true essence of this character. And I think that because we always constantly stayed true to that, the show became what it was. \n\n\tThose two Prince songs were a surprise, and I’m sure it was a challenge clearing them. Why those songs? And how do you think they spoke to those moments in the show?\n\n\tI’m glad you say “do you think” because songs can be interpreted in so many different ways. But they came about in a similar way to Kate Bush and “Running Up That Hill”: They were not scripted. They were “TBD” moments in the two spots in the script where a song needed to play: [SPOILER ALERT] for the scene when Hopper and Murray set off the bomb detonation to collapse the Upside Down gate, which was set off from the record player. So it needed to be the first song from one side of a [vinyl album], and then it needed to segue to the last song on that same side of the [same album], to play through Eleven’s emotional stand against that leads into the collapsing dimension of the Upside Down. So they needed to hit those two spots.\n\t\n\n\tThe Duffers reached out to me about this before the scene was shot — I didn’t even have a shooting schedule, I think they had just written the script and only the cast had seen it. They’d been going through songs, I think they were asking for ideas from the cast. And they said, “This one is a little more tricky because of the way the scenes are going to be set up: We need something preferably from 1987 — but it could be from before — the songs have to be from the same artist; and the first song has to start the A or B-side of an album by that artist, and the second song has to end the A or B side of that album. \n\n\tThat is an incredibly narrow window!\n\n\tExactly! So my heart stopped, like, ooh, that’s a tough one. And remember, the scene’s not shot yet, so I haven’t seen the footage and this is just me imagining it in my head — and it’s got to play through this big, emotional, sad scene that’ll lead into a dimension collapsing! I’ve been doing this for 20 years, but there’s still always a first. \n\n\tObviously I have various ways of finding music: Sometimes songs just pop into my head — and I know the ‘80s quite well — sometimes it’s just e-surfing, Spotify or streaming this or that; sometimes it’s just driving in a car and somebody drives by with a song playing; and I also have 15,000 or 20,000 CDs and albums. But for this one, I needed to go to my research books. I found a couple that listed the albums [by side], and I literally had to go and flip through the book for ideas and then see if the first and last tracks on a side could line up to our needs. And in a lot of cases, they just didn’t. I mean, I stayed up all night, and I think I came up with just two ideas.\n\n\tJust to step away from Prince for a second, in these situations, I like to give the Duffers a lot of different flavors to choose from to find what works best. Like in the scene where [SPOILER ALERT] Karen is fighting the monster to save Holly, I tried all kinds of songs, from Frank Sinatra to you name it, and they fell in love with the ABBA song, “Fernando,” which was actually the first song I sent them.\n\t\n\n\tSo what was the other album you sent them, along with Prince’s “Purple Rain”? \n\n\tPart of me doesn’t want to say what it is, because I don’t want people to feel bad. But I did send a classic artist from the ‘70s, big artists, and I said, “We could end it with this, but I’m not sure about the starting song — and honestly, I don’t even know if those guys will clear it, and it’s going to cost megabucks.”\n\n\tOr, I said, “We could end it with ‘Purple Rain’ and start with ‘When Doves Cry’ — but honestly, I don’t even know if I can clear it.” I mean, I had not heard of [“Purple Rain”] clearing before, although I know now that it did clear for something right after Prince died [in 2016] — there was a relationship with someone who did a series episode about a character mourning Prince’s death, but that was a one-off situation.\n\n\tSo the Duffers wrote back to me and said, “Do you think we could get this cleared?” And I’m like gulp, “I’m really not sure, but I’d be willing to try.” And they said, let’s try. Double gulp! Because this means they really want it — they weren’t having me clear anything else.\n\n\tThe good news is, I majored in English in college, and that helped with creating what I call “theses”: where you give the rights owners all the information of how the song’s going to be used, and the backstory of it, the meaning of it — I go deep. So Jennifer, my clearance coordinator, and I spoke to Marty Silverstone at Primary Wave. He goes, “Well, we all know it’s a tough one, but let’s try.” I said, “If there’s anything that they might clear it for, it would be ‘Stranger Things,’ right?” He goes, “Let’s hope!,” because the estate has so many approvals.\n\n\tThen I talked to Joy Murphy at Universal Music Publishing [which administers the songs’ publishing], and she said the same thing — “Nora, let’s give it a try, we’ll do everything we can to position this in the right way.”  So that was two. Then I had Thuy Lam at Warner Records — which controls the master [recording] — who I’d been down this road before with Kate Bush, and she said, “We support this.” And then we waited — that was grueling, and it took a few weeks — we were getting closer to shooting and I told them to leave it in as a placeholder. But a day or two before the shoot, I got the answer that [the Prince tracks were approved.]\n\t\n\n\tNow, I know the Duffers have said that they feel [Prince’s estate cleared the songs] because of Kate Bush, and they’re not wrong because I’m sure Primary Wave and Universal reminded them. And I did tell them I thought this was going to be one of the most significant moments in the season. But still, for the rights owners, it’s not just about the money, it’s about what lines up with what Prince would have wanted, and to do it in the most respectful manner possible. And I don’t want to discount all the hard work we put into the “theses,” making sure everyone fully understood these uses and what they meant to the characters.\n\n\tFor “Running Up That Hill,” though, there were hundreds of other songs that could have worked, you didn’t need songs that began and ended an album side.\n\n\tYeah, for [the Kate Bush slot], I had 9 or 10 other songs in my pocket — but I said, “This is the best one. This does everything we want it to do.” I don’t think it could have been [as good with] anything else — because the lyrical content lined up so perfectly with what the characters were going through and needed to do. You know, they needed to step outside of their own world and step into someone else’s shoes to truly understand and reconnect. I’m not saying we couldn’t have gotten something else, but I don’t know if it would have lined up as perfectly, not only with the melodic structure in the building, but also with the intricate message that seemed to speak on a deeper level and relate to our characters. \n\n\tAlso, those two Prince songs are so heavily associated with the “Purple Rain” film and the emotions and visuals that go with it — was that a concern?\n\n\tNo, not for me, and the Duffers never mentioned that. We’ve never been against using songs that have been tied to other stories because this is a completely different, unique story. And again, going back to the special relationship that the fans have with this show, once you attach it to their characters and this story, it’s almost as if it takes on a different meaning. And remember, a lot of the young people are not going to have that association. Even the older people that knew and grew up with these songs, they’re listening to it in a different way. \n\t\n\n\tThey kind of line up in that way as well, because “Purple Rain” is obviously the climax of that film, and here it’s part of the climax.\n\n\tYeah, when things are beginning to be resolved and [SPOILER ALERT] Eleven has made her decision that she needs to cease existing in order to save them. And “When Doves Cry” — doves have always represented love and peace, right? And in this case, they’re crying because they’re sorrowful — if we want to get heavy here, and pretend we just smoked some pot together (laughter). \n\n\tBut from what I’ve always understood, the song is about the conflicts that exist within relationships, right? So to me, it was interesting to put the song in that spot, because they’re feeling hopeful, but things aren’t resolved — their mission is not done; there’s still people in danger; the world is not one. So even though the song has a kind of a lightness to it, I think that’s why it worked well. And “Purple Rain” has always symbolized the chaotic, sad world that we live in, but it’s also ultimately about redemption, love, and transformation.\n\n\t[Marty Silverstone, President of Global Sync at Primary Wave Music, tells Variety: “We’re thrilled that we could play a part in bringing these very special uses to life and have Prince’s music included in the phenomenon that is ‘Stranger Things.’ You have to admire the unique connection the show has with its fanbase, its brilliant music curation over its entire run, and its spotlight on the cosmic importance of music in the lives of young people, and all people!”]\n\n\tOK, can I guess the other one you considered? Led Zeppelin? The Eagles?\n\n\tNo, it wasn’t the Eagles. And I’m not going to say Led Zeppelin didn’t come up — I tried Led Zeppelin, but it didn’t work because I was thinking “Stairway to Heaven” and it wasn’t a first [song on album side] and a last situation. And I thought maybe Pink Floyd with “The Wall,” but I can’t remember if the right song was an ending or not. I don’t know how many times I went through this: One song would work and the other one wouldn’t. I mean, that’s why I stayed up all night with my books!\n\n\tAre you having separation anxiety now that the show is over?\n\t\n\n\tI’m sad, but I’m about to go into “Yellowjackets” right now, literally on Monday. And I love that show. And I’m working on the Duffer Brothers’ other project that they’re executive-producing, “The Boroughs,” that’s coming out this year. And then we’ll see about after that! I really want to take some time and find something really special to work on.\n",

And at least one big studio tentpole arrives on streaming this January in the form of “Tron: Ares.”\n\n\tCheck out a full rundown below of the biggest new films to streaming platforms this January. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Smashing Machine (Jan. 23 on HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDwayne Johnson earned career-best reviews for his dramatic transformation into UFC fighter Mark Kerr in Benny Safdie’s “The Smashing Machine.” The film was named a Variety Critic’s Pick: “Johnson, shifting his whole aspect (he seems like a new actor), invests that silent, moody, hidden side of Mark with a quality of mystery. He gives an extraordinary performance, playing Mark Kerr as a gentle giant with demons that will not speak their name, yet the audience can feel them there; we want to see those demons healed.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tIf I Had Legs I’d Kick You (Jan. 30 on HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRose Byrne has emerged as a formidable Oscar contender for best actress after winning honors from the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Board of Review and more. She headlines “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” as a spiraling mother struggling to support her sick child and her own sanity. From Variety’s review: “Byrne is brilliantly unhinged in a chaotic maternal-meltdown drama. Writer-director Mary Bronstein sees something in Byrne the industry missed, casting the ‘Damages’ star as a woman overwhelmed by life in an alternately exhilarating and maddening Safdie-like indie… Delivering a feverish, raw-nerve performance sure to go down as one of the year’s greats, Byrne has never had a role even remotely this intense to prepare us for the emotional acrobatics her writer-director has in store.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTron: Ares (Jan. 7 on Disney+)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJared Leto’s “Tron: Ares” struggled at the box office with $142 million worldwide, but more viewers are likely to discover its pulse-pounding thrills on Disney+ when it begins streaming. Directed by Joachim Rønning, “Ares” centers on dueling corporations who are determined to bring digital creations into the real world. The supporting cast includes Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Jodie Turner-Smith, Hasan Minhaj, Arturo Castro, Gillian Anderson and returning “Tron” star Jeff Bridges. From Variety’s review: “The latest installment’s best ideas compete with director Joachim Rønning’s fetishistic focus on classic Tron mythology, which looks and sounds great in Imax 3D.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBugonia (Peacock)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tYorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone’s latest collaboration “Bugonia” hit Peacock at the tail end of December, meaning January is the pitch-black comedy’s first full month of availability on streaming. Jesse Plemons plays a conspiracy theorist who kidnaps Stone’s CEO under the impression that she is an alien. The film earned nearly $40 million at the worldwide box office in the fall.\n\n\t“Bugonia” was named the fourth best movie of 2025 by Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman: “Lanthimos’s wild and woolly kidnap drama is a violent, hate-fueled, thrillingly warped act of cinematic screw-tightening. It’s also rooted in a humanity that sneaks up on you… For a while, it’s like watching ‘Misery’ restaged as a riveting culture-war two-hander. But Stone and, especially, Plemons keep deepening their characters. (He does a piece of acting that’s like tragedy on the high wire.) And the trick ending has a blow-you-away power that’s worth a dozen doomsday dystopias.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPeople We Meet on Vacation (Jan. 9 on Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNetflix kicks off its original 2026 film slate with what is sure to be a streaming hit with “People We Meet on Vacation,” based on the hugely popular Emily Henry book that has sold more than 2 million copies and spent 69 weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers list. Per the film’s synopsis: Poppy (Emily Bader) and Alex (Tom Blyth) “have been unlikely best friends for a decade, living in different cities but spending every summer vacation together. The careful balance of their friendship is put to the test when they begin to question what has been obvious to everyone else — could they actually be the perfect romantic match?”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Rip (Jan. 16 on Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMatt Damon and Ben Affleck reunite once again for the Netflix original action thriller “The Rip,” directed by Joe Carnahan. The supporting cast features Steven Yeun, Teyana Taylor, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Sasha Calle, Néstor Carbonell, Lina Esco, Scott Adkins and Kyle Chandler. The film’s official logline reads: “Upon discovering millions in cash in a derelict stash house, trust among a team of Miami cops begins to fray. As outside forces learn about the size of the seizure, everything is called into question — including who they can rely on.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLa Grazia (Jan. 23 on Mubi)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tToni Servillo was awarded the Volpi Cup for best actor at the Venice Film Festival this year for his performance as fictional Italian president Mariano De Santis in “La Grazia,” the latest from “The Great Beauty” Oscar winner Paolo Sorrentino. Per the official synopsis: “As his term draws to a close, amid uneventful days, two final duties arise: deciding on two delicate petitions for a presidential pardon. True moral dilemmas, which become tangled, in ways that seem impossible to unravel, with his private life. Driven by doubt, he will have to decide. And, with a deep sense of responsibility, that is exactly what this remarkable Italian President will do.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTwinless (Jan. 16 on Hulu)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Roadside Attractions/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOne year after breaking out at the Sundance Film Festival, James Sweeney’s twisty comedy “Twinless” arrives on streaming via Hulu. Sweeney stars alongside Dylan O’Brien as two young men who meet at a twin bereavement support group and forge an unlikely friendship. Each finds the other fills their missing half, and they become inseparable. But as the friendship expands, it becomes evident that both are holding secrets, some of them dark and dangerous.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Wrecking Crew (Jan. 28 on Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Amazon/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDave Bautista and Jason Momoa headline Prime Video’s action “The Wrecking Crew,” in which they star as two estranged half-brothers who are forced to reunite after their father’s mysterious death. As they set out to uncover the truth, buried secrets resurface and loyalties are tested, unveiling a conspiracy that can tear their family apart. The film is directed by “Blue Beetle” helmer Angel Manuel Soto and also stars Claes Bang, Jacob Batalon, Stephen Root and Morena Baccarin.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJames Bond Movie Collection (Jan. 15 on Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJames Bond is now owned by Amazon, but that’s not stopping the 007 collection from hitting Netflix. Starting Jan. 15, Netflix subscribers in the U.S., German-speaking countries, France, Latin America and several other territories can watch the most recent Bond movie “No Time to Die” as well as “Die Another Day,” “Quantum of Solace” and “Skyfall” and more for a three-month period. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tPreparation for the Next Life (Jan. 30 on Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Minding the Gap” Oscar nominee Bing Liu directs Prime Video’s soulful adaptation of Atticus Lish’s 2014 novel. Starring Sebiye Behtiyar and Fred Hechinger, “Preparation for the Next Life” is set in New York City and centers on the blossoming romantic relationship between a Uyghur migrant and an American soldier. From Variety’s review: “Bing Liu makes his fiction debut with a superbly acted drama chronicling the unstable relationship between an undocumented woman and a U.S. Army vet with mental health issues.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!

One of Hollywood’s most daring satirists from the early years of television sketch comedy through his film and stage hits, Brooks has held a funhouse mirror up to the human condition and used laughter as a path to resilience, connection and joy for nearly a century.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tI’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not (Jan. 31 on HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” is an authorized but unfiltered documentary on comedy legend Chevy Chase. Directed by two-time Emmy Award winner Marina Zenovich, whose work includes “Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic” and “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,” the film “brings viewers into Chase’s inner world through interviews with his family, friends and co-stars, revealing what is beneath the surface of his bravado.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Threesome (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tChad Hartigan’s “The Threesome” stars Zoey Deutch, Jonah Hauer-King and Ruby Cruz in the story of a young man whose unexpected threesome leads to two pregnancies. From Variety’s review: “Hartigan classes up a bawdy premise in a frisky comedy about a carefree sexual encounter with a lasting impact.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tStone Cold Fox (Jan. 9 on Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDon’t be surprised if you see the action thriller “Stone Cold Fox” climbing the Netflix charts this month considering subscribers often devour lower-profile action thrillers. Starring Kiernan Shipka, Krysten Ritter and Kiefer Sutherland, the Sophie Tabet-directed film is set in 1986 and follows a young woman who breaks out of an abusive commune only to have to turn back around and infiltrate it when her little sister is kidnapped. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLicorice Pizza (Jan. 16 on Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPaul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” is now streaming on Max as it enters Oscar season as one of the biggest frontrunners for best picture. The director’s last directorial effort, “Licorice Pizza,” arrives back on Netflix this month just in time to keep the PTA streaming going. Cooper Hoffman plays a charming teen who becomes smitten with Alana Haim’s wayward young woman. The movie was nominated for Oscars for best picture, best director and best original screenplay. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSafe House (Jan. 22 on Hulu)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Emily in Paris” favorite Lucien Laviscount jumps to Hulu this month as the star of the action thriller “Safe House,” which centers on six federal agents who grow suspicious of one another after they are forced into hiding amid a Los Angeles terror attack. Is the perpetrator already among them? The supporting cast includes Hannah John-Kamen, Ethan Embry, Lewis Tan, Holt McCallany and Adam Levy,\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBarron’s Cove (Jan. 1 on Paramount+)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEvan Ari Kelman writes and directs the crime thriller “Barron’s Cove,” which makes its exclusive streaming debut on Paramount+ this month. Garrett Hedlund leads the film as a grieving father who decides to kidnap a boy after the court system fails to apprehend the person responsible for his son’s death. The supporting cast includes Hamish Linklater, Brittany Snow, Christian Convery, Tramell Tillman, Raul Castillo and Stephen Lang.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSmurfs (Jan. 16 on Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe Rihanna-headlined “Smurfs” movie earned $124 million at the worldwide box office last year and is now becoming available to stream on Prime Video this month at no extra cost to subscribers. From Variety’s review: “It feels perfect for these PG times. But though it may be the best of the Smurfs movies, it still puts the innocuous in innocence… ‘Smurfs’ is the first Smurfs movie I’ve seen — and I’ve seen them all, because I do this, dear readers, so you don’t have to — that’s explicitly modeled on ‘Trolls,’ the 2016 fairy tale that I think is one of the five most inspired animated films of its decade.”\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPetitions to Deport Nicki Minaj Gain Over 120,000 Signatures and Counting\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhy the Porsche 964 Is Still the Best Version of the 911 Ever Made\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon vs. YouTube, Other Tech Battles Reshaping Sports in 2026\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNew Year, More Wellness: Build Out Your Supplement Routine With Ritual’s Protein Powders, Multivitamins, and More\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Franky Venegas was arrested again in Florida for alleged drug-related offenses and is currently behind bars.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          According to a sheriff's report we just obtained ... Franky and his female companion were pulled over for a routine traffic stop ... and were allegedly acting super suspicious.\n      \n\n          Deputies searched the car, per the report ... and allegedly found unprescribed Zolpidem tartrate -- basically Ambien -- in a baggy with other pills that were prescribed to the woman. Deputies also allegedly found drug paraphernalia that tested positive for fentanyl -- including Franky's debit card, which allegedly was coated in white powder that tested positive for fentanyl, and a cut straw.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Franky was booked into the Collier County Jail in Naples Wednesday night on one count of drug paraphernalia, posing for a fresh mug shot ... face tattoos and all. The woman was booked for the Zolpidem tartrate since there was no prescription.\n      \n    \n          As we reported ... Franky had no bond, as he was on a hold since he's already out on bond from a February arrest for delivering/possessing/selling a firearm with an altered serial number.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Franky rose to fame in 2021 with brother Alex after their viral hit, \"I'm an Island Boy.\"\n      \n    \n          He's previously been arrested for domestic battery, reckless driving, and driving without a license.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Flyysoulja\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                TikTok\n              \n                          \n                Hip Hop\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Drugs & Alcohol\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

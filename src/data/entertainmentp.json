    "body": "\n\tRatings for the Kennedy Center Honors took a sharp decline this year. The poor turnout comes shortly after Donald Trump added his name to the historic forum.\n\n\tThis year’s Kennedy Center Honors, hosted by Trump, averaged 3.01 million viewers, according to a report from Nielsen Live + Same Day Panel + Big Data. That represents a 25% dip from last year’s numbers. The 2024 show hit a record low of 4.1 million viewers after reaching 4.5 million viewers the year before.\n\t\n\n\tThe Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment.\n\n\n\tTrump is the first sitting president to host the Kennedy Center Honors, which celebrate “individuals whose unique contributions have shaped our world,” according to the organization’s website. This year’s honorees were George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, KISS, Michael Crawford and Gloria Gaynor.\n\n\tOn Dec. 6, the day before the event, Trump told reporters at the White House, “It’s going to be something that I believe, and I’m going to make a prediction: This will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done and they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”\n\n\tTrump has set his sights on remaking the Kennedy Center in his image during his second term, even going so far as to rename the venue “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts” in mid December. The name change has been met with significant blowback, and several scheduled acts have canceled their upcoming performances as a result.\n",

GOD BLESS.”\n\n\tWhitlock played small roles in several of Lee’s films, including “Red Hook Summer,” “Chi-Raq,” “She Hate Me” and “25th Hour.” His two major roles in Lee’s filmography came with “Da Five Bloods,” in which he plays Vietnam veteran Melvin alongside Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters and Norm Lewis, and “BlackKkKlansman,” in which he starred as police officer Mr. Turrentine alongside Alec Baldwin, John David Washington and Robert John Burke.\n\t\n\n\tBrian Liebman, Whitlock’s manager, shared the news of his death in an Instagram post. He wrote, “It is with tremendous sadness that I share the passing of my dear friend and client Isiah Whitlock Jr. If you knew him — you loved him. A brilliant actor and even better person. May his memory forever be a blessing. Our hearts are so broken. He will be very, very missed.”\n\n\tWhitlock was best known for playing the crooked state senator Clay Davis on “The Wire.” He also appeared in a recurring role on Seasons 2 through 4 of “Veep” as U.S. Secretary of Defense George Maddox, who runs against Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ character Selina Meyer in the 2016 primaries.\n\n\tThe Indiana-born character actor also had small roles in “Goodfellas,” “Chappelle’s Show,” “Pieces of April,” “Enchanted,” “Cars 3” and “Lightyear.” His voice can be heard in Pixar’s “Hoppers,” which is set to debut in 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeyer Gottlieb, who headed Samuel Goldwyn Films and produced films including “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,” died Monday in Los Angeles. He was 86. \n\n\tTom Rothman, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, said in a statement, “Meyer was a gentleman of the old school. I was fortunate to work for him when he ran the Samuel Goldwyn Company, in the heyday of independent film. I learned an enormous amount from him — most importantly, that it is possible to make a life in Hollywood without sacrificing integrity and honesty, both of which he embodied entirely, along with smarts, wisdom, and kindness. I send my sincere condolences to his loving family during this difficult time.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Poland just before the Germans invaded, Gottlieb was a Holocaust survivor who lived in Ukraine labor camps during the war and then in a displaced person’s camp in Germany. After a great aunt brought him to Los Angeles, he learned English at school and eventually graduated from UCLA. \n\n\n\tHe became president and COO of the Samuel Goldwyn Co. in 1988 after helped Samuel Goldwyn Jr. revive the company in 1978 with classic films from Goldwyn’s father’s library. \n\n\tAmong the other films he produced for Goldwyn were “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” remake, starring Ben Stiller. As a top Goldwyn executive, he shepherded releases including the received Michael Apted film “Amazing Grace,” “Mystic Pizza,” “Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,” “Super Size Me” and “The Squid and the Whale.”\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife Pattikay, two daughters and two grandchildren.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe team behind Yash‘s highly anticipated “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” has revealed the first look at Nayanthara as Ganga, presenting the actress in a role that combines visual intensity with a commanding presence.\n\n\tThe poster positions Nayanthara in front of an ornate casino entrance, weapon in hand, projecting controlled power within a high-stakes luxury environment. The image marks a departure for the actor, suggesting a character defined by calculated authority rather than conventional heroism.\n\t\n\n\tNayanthara has established herself as one of India’s most acclaimed actor over a two-decade career spanning more than 75 films across Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada-language cinema. Her filmography includes women-centric successes like “Aramm,” “Kolamaavu Kokila” and “Netrikann,” alongside Shah Rukh Khan’s blockbuster “Jawan.”\n\n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\t\n\n\t“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\n\t“We all know Nayan as a celebrated star with a commanding screen presence, and a remarkable career spanning two decades but in ‘Toxic,’ audiences will witness a talent that had been quietly waiting to explode,” said director Geetu Mohandas. “I wanted to portray Nayan in a way that she’s never been showcased before. But as the shoot progressed I began to see how closely her own personality echoed the soul of the character. It wasn’t imitation, it was alignment. The depth, the honesty, the restraint, and the emotional clarity she brought were not performances layered on top of the character, they were qualities she already possessed. I found my Ganga, so brilliantly performed by her, and even more unexpectedly, I found a dear friend.”\n\n\tThe reveal follows previous character unveilings for the production, including Kiara Advani as Nadia and Huma Qureshi as Elizabeth, each presenting distinct visual aesthetics within the film’s narrative world.\n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv and Kecha Khamphakdee.\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter George Clooney said he felt that newly-named editor-in-chief Bari Weiss was “dismantling CBS News as we speak,” Weiss has responded by inviting him to visit the CBS newsroom. \n\n\t“Bonjour, Mr. Clooney! Big fan of your work. It sounds like you’d like to learn more about ours. This is an open invitation to visit The CBS Broadcast Center, where I’m spending the holidays working to relaunch the Evening News with my colleagues. Tune in January 5,” Weiss said in a statement shared by Paramount Skydance. The “bonjour” was presumably a reference to Clooney, his wife Amal and their twins becoming French citizens this week.\n\t\n\n\tIn a wide-ranging interview with Brent Lang about his career and his latest film “Jay Kelly,” Clooney also touched on the upheaval at CBS News, politics and his activism.\n\n\n\t“Am I worried about film studios? Sure. It’s my business, but my primary loyalty is to my country. I’m much more worried about how we inform ourselves and how we’re going to discern reality without a functioning press,” he said. \n\n\tClooney also addressed President Trump’s lawsuits against ABC News and CBS News in Variety‘s interview. “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go fuck yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney says. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\n\tWeiss, who took over CBS News in October, recently came under fire for abruptly pulling a “60 Minutes” report on El Salvador’s CECOT prison.\n\n\tThe response from Weiss was first reported by the New York Post.\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery is poised to reject the amended takeover offer fielded by Paramount Skydance last week as David Ellison keeps up",
    "body": "\n\tThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery is poised to reject the amended takeover offer fielded by Paramount Skydance last week as David Ellison keeps up his pursuit of the assets he sees as crucial to building a 21st century Hollywood heavyweight.\n\n\tBloomberg News reported Tuesday that the WBD board was expected to reject the amended offer that was made with fanfare by Paramount Skydance on Dec. 22. WBD has already struck an agreement to merge with Netflix in a deal valued at more than $80 billion. \n\t\n\n\tBut Paramount Skydance hasn’t given up and is making a tender offer to WBD shareholders. As this tug-of-war has played out in press releases and conference calls and Securities and Exchange Commission filings, WBD shares have soared more than 170% this year, albeit shares were at a low ebb, having traded under $10 for most of 2024. Bloomberg reported the WBD board will meet next week to formally vote on a response to Paramount’s latest offer. A WBD representative declined to comment on matter.\n\n\n\tThe WBD board’s expected decision is not a surprise given there have been no signs of a significant about-face in the panel’s thinking about which company is the best fit for Warner Bros. and HBO Max. There is also much industry intrigue about how far Paramount is willing to go, if at all, in raising the financial value of its bid higher than the existing $30 a share. \n\n\tParamount’s amended offer from last week largely dealt with the financing of the all-cash transaction. Software billionaire Larry Ellison, who is the father of David Ellison, took steps to address the WBD’s stated concerns about the sources of Paramount’s financing. Larry Ellison enlarged his personal stake in the transaction by making an “irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion” toward Paramount’s $108 billion all-cash offer for all of WBD. That includes CNN, TNT and a handful of other established linear cable channels that are now on track to be spunoff into a separate company next year.\n\t\n\n\tParamount’s amended offer of Dec. 22 also upped the breakup fee to match Netflix’s $5.8 billion figure, payable to WBD in the event that its deal does not clear regulatory review. Netflix’s deal is valued at just under $83 billion but does not include the linear cable channels. Netflix’s deal is a mix of cash and stock.\n\n\tIf the expected WBD board rejection spurs Paramount to raise its offer, then the ball moves to Netflix’s court. It’s unclear what, if any, willingness Netflix has to raise its hand.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis year, David Ellison managed to do for Warner Bros. Discovery what WBD CEO David Zaslav had struggled to do for more than three years: dramatically boost the market value of the company that combined Discovery and Warner Bros.\n\n\tShares of Warner Bros. Discovery, formed in April 2022, zoomed to all-time highs in 2025 — up more than 170% for the year. WBD as of Dec. 30 has a market capitalization of $71.8 billion, up from about $25 billion at the start of the year.\n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery’s Wall Street rally was triggered by Ellison: After his Skydance Media had swallowed up Paramount Global, he aggressively set his sights on buying WBD next — backed with billions from his father, Larry Ellison — and triggered an M&A battle that caused big swings in the stocks of WBD, Paramount Skydance and Netflix.\n\n\n\tNetflix shares were up as much as 51% in mid-2025, as the streaming leader continued to show solid growth and analysts continued to be bullish on its future prospects. In October, amid the continuing climb of its share price, Netflix executed a 10-for-1 stock split, to make it more affordable. 22.3% as of Dec. 30.\n\n\tAfter Netflix announced an $83 billion deal to buy Warner Bros.’s studios and HBO Max businesses, investors got spooked at the prospect of the deal’s uncertainty and heavy debt load. Still, Netflix shares ended the year up around 22%. Paramount shareholders, meanwhile, were enthusiastic about David Ellison’s play for the company, but PSKY’s stock price has fallen down as WBD repeatedly rebuffed the Paramount bid.\n\n\tComcast, which made an unsuccessful bid that proposed combining the WBD streaming and studios business with Comcast’s related businesses, saw its stock price languish, closing down 17% for the year. On Jan. 2, Comcast’s spin-off of Versant (comprising cable networks like CNBC, MS NOW and USA) is set to close. The goal of the Versant transaction is to unshackle the NBC broadcast and Peacock streaming businesses from the declining cable TV networks and convince investors the newly streamlined Comcast is worth more.\n\t\n\n\tThe M&A drama surrounding Warner Bros. isn’t over yet. David Ellison has launched a hostile takeover attempt for Warner Bros. Discovery, hoping to convince WBD shareholders that his $30-per-share bid (which the WBD board has rejected) is a better than Netflix’s terms. Last week, Paramount Skydance updated its offer for WBD with certain new provisions; among those, Larry Ellison made an “irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion” toward Paramount’s all-cash offer for WBD. The WBD board is expected to turn that down, too, with a formal response in the next few days.\n\n\tWhether the Ellisons will go higher in their quest to capture Warner Bros. Discovery remains to be seen. Note that whoever ends up owning Warner Bros. Discovery, Zaslav stands to cash in from a sale: He’s set to become a billionaire given his WBD stock holdings regardless of whether Netflix completes the deal or Paramount Skydance swoops in to poach the whole company.\n\n\tHere’s a chart showing the performance of top media stocks:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreated with Datawrapper\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCanal+ and Warner Bros. Discovery have signed a new multi-year, multi-territory agreement to strengthen their partnership internationally, including the expansion of HBO Max to two more countries.\n\n\tThrough the pact, which a press release calls a “major milestone” in the companies’ collaboration, distribution of HBO Max via Canal+ will be renewed in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania, and will expand to Belgium and Austria. Distribution of Cartoon Network, Cartoonito and CNN International in Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia will also be renewed, as will Warner TV in the Czech Republic.\n\t\n\n\tAcross MultiChoice Group territories in Africa, distribution of 12 WBD thematic channels will be renewed, including CNN International and Cartoon Network, Cartoon Network Porto, Cartoonito, Cartoonito Porto, Discovery Channel, Discovery Family, Real Time, ID, TLC, HGTV, Travel, TNT Africa and Food Network.\n\n\n\tThe agreement between WBD and the French media group builds upon previous deals made in 2024, including the renewal of the exclusive pay-TV window for Warner Bros. Pictures films six months after their theatrical release in France and the integration of HBO Max within select Canal+ group offers. \n\n\tIt also comes during Netflix’s pending purchase of WBD, which could further position Canal+ as a power player on the global stage as the company already has distribution deals in place with Netflix. On Dec. 16, Netflix boss Ted Sarandos made a surprise appearance at Canal+ Group’s Paris showcase and reassured the audience of his plans in purchasing WBD.\n\t\n\n\t“Our intentions when we buy Warner Bros. will be to continue to release Warner Bros. studio movies in theaters with the traditional windows,” Sarandos said during a conversation with Canal+ chair and CEO Maxime Saada. “Then those movies would flow through the Canal+ output deal. That’s very exciting for us.”\n",

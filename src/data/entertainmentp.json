    "body": "\n\tBased on the popular book series by Andrzej Sapkowski and adapted for television by Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, “The Witcher” has returned to Netflix for its fourth and penultimate season. This time, Liam Hemsworth is stepping into Henry Cavill’s shoes to portray the silver-haired monster-slaying witcher, Geralt of Rivia — Cavill left the series in 2022 after Season 3, an announcement that was made simultaneous to Hemsworth taking over the role.. In a much sharper and less convoluted season than the previous one, “The Witcher” Season 4 is action-packed and full of dazzling characters both old and new. It acts as a reset, ironing out the confusing conflicts and plot points that have long plagued the series. \n\t\n\n\t“The Witcher” Season 4 opens with an old man reading the story of The Butcher of Blaviken. A century in the future of the show’s chronology, the man tells a group of eager young children about the legend of Geralt of Rivia. This opening sequence recaps the events of the first three seasons and grounds the audience in the epic’s current timeline. Separated from his lover, Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) and his adoptive daughter, Ciri (Freya Allan), Geralt has been severely injured by the evil mage Vilgefortz (Mahesh Jadu). Still struggling to walk on his battered knee, he, along with his best friend, Jaskier the bard (Joey Batey) and the legendary archer Milva (Meng’er Zhang), are embarking on their quest to find Ciri before Vilgefortz or Emhyr (Bart Edwards), the emperor of Nilfgaard, gets a hold of her. During this adventure, Geralt eventually becomes allies with a crew that “Witcher” book lovers will recognize as the Hanza. On the opposite side of the war-torn Continent, Yennefer has begun recruiting her fellow mages, including Philippa (Cassie Claire), Francesca (Mecia Simson), and Fringilla (Mimî M. Khayisa), to Aretuza in an effort to begin crafting plans to try and take down the increasingly powerful Vilgefortz. \n\t\n\n\tFor her part, Ciri, now in her twenties, is exhausted by her legacy. Her powerful Elder blood and Nilfgaard lineage have made her a coveted commodity for some of the most powerful people on the Continent. As a result, she has shed her identity and powers. She has found refuge among a ragtag band of thieves — the Rats — under the new identity, Falka. As young people tend to do, viewers see Ciri trying to define herself outside her parents’ shadows. Still, she struggles to understand and adhere to the Rats’ precarious moral code. Without Geralt and Yennefer’s direct guidance, Ciri tries to define her future for herself. Yet, what she comes to understand is that no matter how far she tries to run from her past, destiny has a way of catching up to her. \n\n\tMost fans of the show have likely been bracing themselves to see how Hemsworth takes on a character Cavill has long mastered. Although the voice isn’t quite the same, as the episodes move forward and given the season’s straightforward structure, which zeros in on Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri separately, the transition is mostly seamless. Moreover, as the stoic monster hunter has become increasingly attuned to his own emotions, the distinct difference between the two actors makes even more sense, given Geralt’s slightly more emotive nature in the story’s current timeframe. \n\n\tIn addition, the gorgeously shot action sequences, full of magic, sword-wielding, beheadings and, of course, an array of monsters, are complemented by several new characters who also make their distinct mark on this robust, fully rendered universe. Over the eight-episode season, fans are introduced to Regis (Laurence Fishburne), a mysterious herbalist who aids Geralt and his gang during a desperate time of need. Additionally, there is Zoltan (Danny Woodburn), the fan-favorite dwarf with some rather thrilling skills, and several others to round out the already expansive cast. \n\n\tOverall, even as a brand-new lead takes the charge, “The Witcher” Season 4 has mostly reclaimed its magic. Though Episode 5, “The Joy of Cooking,” acts as a filler chapter rather than an actual narrative, the rest of the season is well-paced, tonally on point and offers ample screen time to the leading trio, interweaving the immense fable in a way that is accessible and interesting instead of overstuffed and exhausting. Though Season 4 is not the final chapter of “The Witcher,” it’s an essential building block for what is to be a fifth and final swing at this extravagantly told medieval tale. “The Witcher” is coming to a close, but in many ways, this feels like the beginning.\n\t\n\n\t“The Witcher” Season 4 is now available to stream on Netflix. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTetsu Fujimura’s keynote talk The Future of Japanese Intellectual Property in Global Adaptations offered TIFFCOM attendees a convincing argument that Japanese IP is quickly becoming one of the country’s core industries, rivalling even its mighty car manufacturers.\n\n\tTIFFCOM is the market arm of the Tokyo International Film Festival. \n\n\tThe founder and CEO of consulting firm Filosophia, as well as the founder of major distributor Gaga Corporation, Fujimura began the talk with a brisk run through of his rise to a leading producer of Japan-generated content for a world audience, including the hit Netflix live-action “One Piece” series.\n\t\n\n\tKey to his success, he explained, were connections with top-tier Hollywood producers, beginning with Marvel Studio founder Avi Arad, with whom he produced the 2017 live-action sci-fi “Ghost in the Shell,” and TV producer Marty Adelstein, who became his partner in making “One Piece.”\n\n\n\tBut his individual achievements, as he illustrated with a blizzard of meticulously researched facts and figures, form only one wave of growing tsunami of Japanese IP, from manga and anime to movies and games, that is advancing into the global marketplace.\n\n\tThis tsunami has been a long time in building, from the 1990s when only about 10 or 20% of the top 30 films at the global box office were based on existing IP, to approaching 90 percent in the current decade.\n\n\tOf the top 20 titles in the most current IP revenue rankings, compiled in 2021, ten are Japanese, including ‘Pokemon,’ ‘Hello Kitty,’ ‘Anpanman,’ ‘Super Mario,’ ‘Shonen Jump,’ ‘Gundam,’ ‘Dragon Ball,’ ‘Fist of the North Star,’ ‘One Piece’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh!.’ “In these kinds of global rankings, Japanese works inevitably appear in large numbers,” Fujimura commented. “So I think you understand that Japan occupies a significant presence in the world in many ways.”\n\t\n\n\tWhat makes Japanese IP so strong? Fujimura listed three reasons: Japan’s massive appetite for manga and anime, fueled by major publishers, TV broadcasters and animation studio; the global distribution of anime, with Netflix and Amazon leading the way; and Japan’s rank as one of the world’s leading gaming powers, with Sony (“Uncharted,” “Gran Turismo”) and Nintendo (“Sonic the Hedgehog,” “Super Mario”) not only leading the pack but generating hit films from their games.\n\n\t“Among game originals adapted into Hollywood live-action films Japanese IPs are currently the most numerous,” Fujimura said. “I believe they will attract even more attention going forward.”\n\n\tOne example is the 2023 “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” which grossed $1.361 billion worldwide making it the fifth highest earning animation of all time. “Disney has produced countless animated films, and this outranks all of them but ‘Frozen 2,’” Fujimura said. “What it’s achieved is incredible and really shows just how powerful Japanese animation is.”\n\n\tHis conclusion: “Japan’s representative IP genres – manga, anime, and games – possess extremely high growth potential that I believe will continue to be a source of pride. It’s a testament to Japan’s strength, proving that Japanese IPs can succeed in Hollywood.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJapan’s anime industry reached an all-time high in 2024, climbing to JPY3.84 trillion ($25.25 billion) in total market value, according to data presented by the Association of Japanese Animations (AJA) at TIFFCOM, the market arm of the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe session, which also featured presentations by “Godzilla” studio Toho Global on its international strategy, the “Gundam” franchise, and Annecy-winning feature “ChaO” — which is also screening at the Tokyo festival — underscored how anime continues to drive Japan’s expanding global content economy.\n\t\n\n\tOverseas revenues surged 26% year-on-year to JPY2.17 trillion ($14.27 billion), while local earnings rose 2.8% to JPY1.67 trillion ($10.98 billion). This marks the second-highest annual growth rate on record after 2019’s 15.3% increase.\n\n\n\tAJA chair Kazuko Ishikawa, who is also president of Nippon Animation, said anime has become a core pillar of Japan’s cultural and economic exports. She added that the association aims to further improve industry conditions so that creators and studios can continue producing high-quality works that resonate with audiences worldwide.\n\n\tThe upcoming Anime Industry Report 2025, set for publication in December, divides the market into two key sectors: the broad “anime industry market,” which estimates total consumer spending across anime-related goods and licensing, and the narrower “anime production market,” which tracks studio revenues.\n\n\tThe production-side market also set a record in 2024, rising 9.1% year-on-year to JPY466.2 billion ($3.06 billion). Overseas business contributed JPY118.8 billion ($781 million) — still a smaller share overall, but growing steadily year by year.\n\t\n\n\t“The overseas market now far exceeds local revenues, and the gap will only widen,” said Masahiko Hasegawa, editor-in-chief of the AJA report. “Growth today includes bundled contracts that span theatrical, streaming, merchandising, and event rights — not just content distribution.”\n\n\tAJA data indicates that overseas anime revenues overtook domestic earnings in 2023 for the first time since the pandemic, and that the gap widened dramatically in 2024. The International Otaku Events Association now lists 136 anime-related events in 51 countries and regions, reinforcing the genre’s global momentum.\n\n\tJapan’s government continues to position anime and related media — including film, games, manga, and music — as a strategic core industry. Under its revised Cool Japan initiative, the national goal is to triple overseas content sales to JPY20 trillion ($131.4 billion) by 2033, from approximately JPY5.8 trillion ($38 billion) in 2024.\n\n\tAJA forecasts that future growth will not only come from distribution and theatrical revenues but from exporting Japan’s entire anime ecosystem, including merchandise tie-ins, retail campaigns, and cross-media collaborations.\n\n\t“Anime is no longer just storytelling,” said Hasegawa. “It’s a full cultural economy — and that economy is rapidly going global.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tComcast said third-quarter profit dropped as the media-and-cable conglomerate continued to grapple with cord cutting in its flagship content distribution business and faced comparisons with last year’s Paris Olympics, when the company generated $1.9 billion in extra revenue. \n\n\tThe Philadelphia company said it lost 104,000 domestic broadband customers during the period, bringing its total subscriber base to roughly 31.4 million — the fourth consecutive quarter of subscriber losses in this key business area. It also lost 257,000 pay TV subscribers. Revenue tied to its media operations which include NBCUniversal, came to $6.6 billion, a drop of  almost 20%. Without taking the 2024 Paris Olympics into account, revenue rose 4% over the year-earlier period, Comcast said.\n\t\n\n\tNet income attributable to Comcast fell 8% to $3.33 billion, or 90 cents per share, compared with $3.63 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter. The company’s results beat Wall Street’s estimate for the period.\n\n\n\tComcast said it continued to emphasize sales of mobile service, and added 414,000 mobile customers in the third quarter — a record number for the company. \n\n\tIn a statement, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts pointed to the mobile gains as well as a growing focus on sports at NBCUniversal, which he said would create new interest in the company’s TV networks and Peacock streaming service. “We’re building momentum across NBC and Peacock as we head into one of the most exciting stretches of live sports in our history, including robust NBA coverage which just began last week,” he said in a statement, adding: “We generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow this quarter and $14.9 billion year-to-date despite significant investment we’re making in repositioning our company, a testament to both the durability and resilience of our underlying business.”\n\t\n\n\tPeacock, which is still in its early days, boasted 41 million subscribers as of Sept. 30,  close to flat with results from the rest of the year. Comcast said the streaming service lost $217 million in the third quarter, narrowing losses from $436 million in the year-earlier period.\n\n\tThe company found bright spots in its film and theme park operations. Movie revenue rose 6% to $3 billion, thanks in part to the release of “Jurassic World Rebirth” in July. Revenue from theme parks rose nearly 19% to $2.72 billion, due in part to the May opening of the new Epic Universe.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFox Corporation said profit in its first fiscal quarter fell due to higher operating expenses, even as overall revenue rose 5% or $174 million, tied to increased cash from advertising and distribution.\n\n\tThe owner of Fox News Channel, Fox Sports and the Fox broadcasting network said net income attributable top shareholders came to $599 million, or $1.32 per share, compared with $827 million, or $1.78 per share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items, first quarter profit came to $1.51 per share. The company also said its Tubi ad-supported streaming service became profitable in the quarter, faster than previously anticipated.\n\t\n\n\tFox said it saw higher expenses during the period tied to increases in digital marketing and content costs and entertainment programming rights amortization.\n\n\n\t“We are delivering for audiences with continued engagement growth across the portfolio which underpins the robust advertising demand we are seeing across sports, news, entertainment and Tubi,” said Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch, in a statement.\n\n\tFox has thrived during a difficult period for media companies by focusing largely on news and sports, two TV formats that continue to attract the large, live audiences that advertisers crave When it comes to streaming, Fox has focused the bulk of its resources on Tubi, which is free and ad-supported and has not required the billions of dollars for new, premium content that subscription-based rivals have. Fox earlier this year launched a subscription streamer, Fox One, that features the programming it offers on its TV networks — but for cord-cutters who do not have a subscription to a cable or satellite service.\n\t\n\n\tFox said revenue rose 4%, or $65 million, from its cable operations, with distribution revenue up 3%, to $28 million. Advertising revenue rose 7%, or $24 million, due to higher prices for news programming. \n\n\tThe company’s linear TV operations saw revenue rise 5% ,or $97 million. Advertising revenue rose 6%, or $59 million, tied to Tubi and the NFL. Distribution revenue rose $15 million or 2%.\n\n\tMore to come….\n",

    "body": "\n\tNexstar Media Group, the largest U.S. broadcast TV station group, extended the employment agreement of chairman and CEO Perry Sook through March 31, 2029.\n\n\tSook, who is the company’s third largest shareholder, oversees Nexstar, which has just over 200 owned or partner stations in 116 U.S. markets. Now Nexstar wants to get even bigger: In August, the company announced an agreement to acquire rival station group Tegna, which has 64 stations, for $6.2 billion.\n\t\n\n\tSook founded Nexstar in 1996 and has served as CEO of the Irving, Texas-based company ever since. During his tenure as chief executive, Sook has led the completion and integration of more than 40 acquisitions. In 2024, he had a compensation package worth $35.9 million (up 23% from the year prior), including stock awards valued at $27.7 million and a $3.2 million cash bonus.\n\n\n\tNexstar and Sook have also been in the headlines recently over the company’s decision to pre-empt Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show on its ABC affiliates, over comments Kimmel made about the MAGA movement’s attempts to score political points from Charlie Kirk’s assassination. With the Tegna deal pending, Nexstar’s decision was seen as an attempt to get in the good graces of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who had vigorously criticized Kimmel’s remarks and suggested local TV stations could lose their broadcast licenses if Kimmel were not taken off the air. Nexstar’s acquisition of Tegna would require the FCC to lift the station ownership cap, which allows broadcasters to reach no more than 39% of the national audience.\n\n\tNexstar denied Carr’s threats influenced its decision to pre-empt Kimmel’s show. Three days after ABC reinstated Kimmel, Nexstar agreed to start airing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” again (as did Sinclair, which also had boycotted Kimmel over the Kirk remarks). The company said Disney execs were taking a “constructive approach to addressing our concerns.” Sook, in a memo to Nexstar staffers written with president/COO Mike Biard, defended Nexstar’s move to pull Kimmel’s show, saying the company was exercising its “duty to program in the public interest” as FCC licensees. Sook and Biard also said Nexstar’s blackout of Kimmel wasn’t a First Amendment violation: “No one has an unlimited right to say whatever they want on a talk show.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a statement Thursday, Sook said, “As we embark on this next phase of growth for Nexstar, I have never been more energized about the prospects for the industry, for Nexstar and for what Nexstar can become. I look forward to leading the company to new levels of success and continuing to create value for our shareholders, our advertisers, our employees and the communities we serve.”\n\n\tJay Grossman, chairman of the Nexstar board’s compensation committee, commented, “The board is delighted to extend Perry’s employment agreement at this pivotal moment for Nexstar and the local broadcast television industry. Perry’s vision, commitment and deep understanding of the media landscape have been instrumental in driving Nexstar’s strong and consistent record of operating execution, financial growth and shareholder returns.”\n\n\tNexstar expects the Tegna deal to close in the second half of 2026, pending regulatory approvals. Grossman, commenting on the pending Tegna deal, said, “The proposed acquisition of Tegna represents the next chapter in Nexstar’s growth story and with Perry’s unmatched experience and track record of success in broadcast M&A, he is uniquely qualified to deliver the full value we expect for shareholders, as well as the local communities we serve.”\n\n\tNexstar’s national television properties include the CW, the U.S.’s No. 5 broadcast network, NewsNation, multicast networks Antenna TV and Rewind TV, and a 31.3% ownership stake in TV Food Network. The company’s digital assets include its local TV station websites, political news outlet The Hill and NewsNationNow.com.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA quintet of stars are set to lead the voice cast for “The Turning Door,” the newly-announced family fantasy epic being written and directed by filmmaker and VFX supervisor Nicholas Ashe Bateman (“The Wanting Mare”). \n\n\tAlicia Vikander (“Firebrand,” “The Danish Girl”), Jamie Dornan (“Belfast”), Jodie Turner-Smith (“Tron: Ares”), Bill Nighy (“Living”) and Gillian Anderson (“Sex Education”) have joined the film, being produced by Christine D’Souza Gelb of 2AM (“Babygirl,” “Past Lives”) with Bateman and Hunter Hall of Maere Studios (“An Almost Christmas Story”). The film will feature original music and songs written by People Museum’s Claire Givens (“Mother Mary”) and Bateman. Production is currently underway.\n\t\n\n\tMister Smith Entertainment is onboard for international sales and will introduce footage from the film to buyers at the upcoming American Film Market. 2AM is handling North American sales.\n\n\n\t“The Turning Door” follows a young girl called Ariadlyn, who is sent to bed as a party rages downstairs. Escaping her bedtime, she slips into her parents’ room, where she discovers an ornate wooden box, opening a door to a magical world called The Turning. To find her way back home and save her parents — now frozen in the real world — Ariadlyn must seek out a sorceress and her crystal vial. Along the way, she will encounter giants, whales, armies, shapeshifters and acrobatic monkeys as she discovers what it means to grow up.\n\n\tThe films marks Bateman’s second feature following 2020’s critically acclaimed sci-fi fantasy “The Wanting Mare.” He is the founder of Maere Studios, the award-winning VFX and animation studio, designing effects for films such as “The Green Knight,” “Origin,” “Hocus Pocus 2,” “Mother Mary,” “Peter Pan and Wendy” and “An Almost Christmas Story.”\n\t\n\n\t“The pictures, places and songs of ‘The Turning Door’ have been with me since I was a child,” said Bateman. “Thematically, its world is a combination of the ones which have filled me with wonder since I was little: the Neverlands, Wonderlands and all those adventures in far-off fantasies. Technically, the film is the result of the past 15 years of trying to make stories — while developing the tools, the dreams and the incredible artists needed to pursue them. More than ever, it’s important to believe that independent animation made by passionate artists and a dream cast has a place in the world; entirely new cinematic experiences — made by people — without any generative AI.”\n\n\tAdded Mister Smith CEO David Garrett: “Anyone with a heart and with an appreciation of the magic of filmmaking cannot help but fall in love with this film. It has the makings of a classic for all audiences for all time.”\n\n\tMister Smith’s current sales slate includes Mercedes Bryce Morgan’s psychosexual thriller/horror “Bone Lake,” Directors’ Fortnight selection “Dangerous Animals,” Christmas comedy “Tinsel Town,” SXSW Narrative Spotlight selection “The Threesome,” magical realist drama “The Accompanist,” drama “Everybody Digs Bill Evans,” action/spy thriller “Blake & Mortimer: The Yellow M,” supernatural horror thriller “Hide and Don’t Speak” and faith-based family epic “In the Beginning.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAcclaimed Bulgarian directing duo Kristina Grozeva and Petar Valchanov (“The Father”) are in post-production on their fifth feature, “Black Money for White Nights,” an absurdist tale about a middle-aged couple who lose their life savings in a travel scam. The directors will be presenting the film during the Works in Progress program of the Thessaloniki Film Festival’s industry arm, Agora, which takes place Nov. 2 – 6. \n\n\t“Black Money for White Nights” is the story of Marina, a maternity nurse, and her husband Gosha, a railway dispatcher, who have spent years collecting small bribes to afford their dream trip to St. Petersburg to witness the White Nights. When Russia invades Ukraine, however, and the travel agency vanishes with their savings, their dream collapses — along with any illusions they clung to that they were in control of their lives.\n\t\n\n\tWhen Gosha winds up in the hospital, after being beaten while trying to recover the couple’s missing money, long-buried betrayals surface, forcing the couple to finally confront the lies their life was built on. In the end, their misfortune might ultimately present an opportunity to search among the ruins for a trace of dignity and grace.\n\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety ahead of the Thessaloniki Film Festival, Grozeva and Valchanov described “Black Money for White Nights” as a “tragicomic meditation on post-communist life, where moral black and white have switched places.” It is a film, they said, “born out of confusion [at] a time when words lost their meaning and moral gravity seemed to collapse.”\n\t\n\n\tThe veteran filmmaking tandem first conceived of the film nearly a decade ago, at a time when Valchanov said they were “taking a little break from the script for ‘The Father,’” an odd-couple road-trip comedy about a hapless man struggling to care for his father in the days following his mother’s funeral. The title is a riff on the Bulgarian expression to “save white money for black days,” the equivalent of an American rainy-day fund. Eventually the idea had to be shelved as the directors focused on other projects, but “we returned after some years and said, ‘Ok, this idea still provokes us,’” Valchanov said.\n\n\tIn the interim years, “The Father” would go on to win the Crystal Globe at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in 2019, while “Triumph,” starring Maria Bakalova, would premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 2024 and be named Bulgaria’s submission for the best international feature Oscar race. Meanwhile, the world was turned upside-down by the coronavirus pandemic, and the global political order was upended by the growing influence of the far right. Then Russian forces invaded Ukraine, putting that very political order to the test.\n\n\tIn Bulgaria, Grozeva and Valchanov watched with “disbelief” as the society around them was not only transformed but disfigured, and the very people who lived under the shadow of totalitarian rule were suddenly clamoring to defend the very forces that had enslaved them. The film, said the directors, grew out of that “absurdity,” focusing on the “quiet moral erosion that hides beneath the surface — invisible until one day everything built upon it collapses.”\n\n\t“Black Money for White Nights” is written by Grozeva, Valchanov, Diana Stoykova and Decho Taralezhkov and produced by Abraxas Film (Bulgaria) in co-production with Graal Films (Greece), with the support of the Bulgarian National Film Center, Eurimages, the Greek Film Center, BNT and ERT. The director of photography is Alexander Stanishev (“The Magic Life of V”), while editing is done by longtime Yorgos Lanthimos collaborator Yorgos Mavropsaridis (“The Favourite,” “Poor Things”).\n\n\tThough the film presents an unflinching “portrait of a generation who was the bearer of change, the bearer of hope for democracy…[whose] lives are built on mistaken beliefs,” Grozeva said the directors sought to portray their characters with sympathy — “to try to understand, not to judge them or point at their wrongs, but to understand…[and] get into their shoes.” \n\t\n\n\tIt is when Marina and Gosha’s comfortable lives crumble, after all, that “they are forced to confront their own mistaken beliefs,” said Grozeva. It’s at that moment that perhaps a glimmer of light can creep in.\n\n\t“There is hope, and the hope comes when everything falls apart,” Grozeva said. “When lies and delusions collapse completely, maybe that’s when we open the space for truth and some different kind of order.”\n\n\tThe Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLily Allen has announced a slew of tour dates across the U.K. in support of her red-hot new album, “West End Girl.”\n\n\tThe English singer-songwriter made the announcement on Instagram Thursday, nearly a week after the surprise release of her first album since 2018. Taking place in March of next year, the tour includes two dates at the London Palladium and will see Allen perform in theaters in Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Manchester, Nottingham, Cambridge, Bristol and Cardiff. It marks Allen’s first time touring since 2019.\n\t\n\n\tTickets go on sale Nov. 7 at 10 a.m. local time, with the sign-up for presale access now live here.\n\n\n\tAllen’s “West End Girl” stirred up buzz after its release on Friday, with the album serving as confirmation that she and her husband, “Stranger Things” actor David Harbour, have split. Though Allen has said in interviews that the album is not to be taken as the full truth of what happened in the relationship, her scathing lyrics on songs such as “Pussy Palace,” “Sleepwalking” and “Madeline” have both shocked and delighted the internet.\n\n\tIn Variety‘s review of the album, chief music critic Chris Willman called “West End Girl” an immediate album of the year contender. “It’s the pleasure of listening to a master storyteller who makes your jaw drop by seeming to have spilled all the tea almost at the outset, and then the tea just keeps on coming,” Willman wrote. “Not since Boston in 1773, maybe, has anyone dumped it this massively, or this fulfillingly.”\n\n\tSee all the info about Allen’s “West End Girl” U.K. tour below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tYou could say Italian actress Matilda De Angelis was fated to work with French film director Luc Besson as she was named after a character from a Besson film.\n\n\n\n\n\t“It’s true,” she says talking to Variety on the occasion of “Dracula: A Love Tale” screening at Lucca Comics and Games in Lucca, Italy. ”My mom and my dad went to see ‘Leon’ in 94 and they came out of the movie, and they loved it, loved it, loved it, and they loved the character of Natalie Portman. And they decided if their baby was a boy, he was going to be Leon and if it was a girl, she was going to be Matilda. So here I am.”\n\t\n\n\tShe saw the film herself when she was 13 years old. “I was happy to hear that I was named after her. And I fell in love with the character. I fell in love with Besson’s movies in general. Then I saw ‘The Fifth Element,’ and then ‘Valerian’ and ‘Arthur’ and ‘Lucy,’ and then I grew to be fan of his work.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDracula: A Love Tale\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of EuropaCorp, TF1 Films Production, SND/Shanna Besson\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe star, best known for her starring roles in the Netflix show “The Law According to Lidia Poët” and the Amazon show “Citadel: Diana,” first met Besson over a Zoom call. “We talked about everything but the movie,” she says. “It was more getting to know each other, and we talked about what we like, what we don’t like; and then he told me about the movie and the character.”\n\n\tIn the film she plays Maria, a society lady who has been turned into a vampire by Count Dracula played by Caleb Landry Jones. Oscar winner Christoph Waltz plays Van Helsing. “Luc wanted Maria to be very unpredictable. He told me, I need tons of mood changes in one scene, from laughing to crying and laughing and crying at the same time. She’s like an animal at one moment, she’s like a cat, pawing and crying and trying to seduce the priest, and the moment after, she’s like a beast, she’s like a tiger and ready to attack. I studied my cat. Cats are a bit crazy. They’re cuddling, and then the next moment, they bite you, and they do it with the same sweetness and the ferocity at the same time.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Dracula: A Love Tale”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of EuropaCorp, TF1 Films Production, SND/Shanna Besson\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“And I knew I was opposite Christoph Waltz, who is one of my favorite actors of all time. And I knew Caleb Landry Jones was playing Dracula. So, I knew the stakes were high and the challenge was hard, but it made me feel important. It made me feel great, you know, good, challenging.”\n\n\tIt’s not the first time De Angelis has been part of an international ensemble. Having made an impression in her native Italy with award winning turns in films such as “Italian Race” and “Rose Island,” she was cast in the HBO miniseries “The Undoing,” where she starred alongside Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant as well as starring in the adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway novel “Across the River and Into the Trees,” alongside Liev Schreiber and Josh Hutcherson.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Dracula: A Love Tale”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of EuropaCorp, TF1 Films Production, SND/Shanna Besson\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHowever, she is in no hurry to set up her next project. “Actually, I want to study my next moves. I don’t want to just binge-eat everything that comes. I’m ready to work more abroad and outside of Italy. It would be my dream right now. I’m waiting for the next good character for me.”\n\n\tFollowing her appearance at Lucca Comic and Games with Luc Besson, she will be seen next in Mario Martone’s film “Fuori,” which premiered at Cannes earlier this year and is set to be released in France on Dec. 3. “Working in France would be one of my dreams right now. And I’m happy the film will be released there.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Lucia Iorio\n\t\n\n\n",

According to ABC7 Los Angeles, further investigation also uncovered rapes he committed against several women over more than a decade -- he was also convicted of multiple counts including forcible rape, sexual penetration by use of force, rape of an unconscious person, and sodomy by use of force.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Prosecutors said Pearce reportedly met Giles and Cabrales-Arzola at an after-hours rave and later drugged them to facilitate a sexual assault.\n      \n\n          The details of Giles' and Cabrales-Arzola's last moments are disturbing. On November 13, 2021, Giles -- a model and aspiring actress -- was already dead when she was taken to Southern California Hospital at Culver City in the L.A. area, ABC7 reports.\n      \n    \n          Cabrales-Arzola -- an architect -- was in critical condition when she arrived at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Hospital. Her heartbroken family made the difficult decision to take her off life support later that month.\n      \n    \n          Prosecutors told jurors Pearce and co-defendant Brandt Walter Osborn were the ones who dropped the women off at the respective hospitals 2 hours apart ... after they overdosed at the apartment the men shared.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Giles reportedly died of a lethal mix of cocaine, fentanyl, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, and ketamine ... while Cabrales-Arzola died of multiple organ failure, with cocaine, ecstasy, and other undetermined drugs found in her system.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Pearce reportedly denied giving them the drugs that killed them, but after two and half days of deliberation, the jury decided they weren't buying it.\n      \n    \n          Osborn, 46 -- who was facing 2 counts of being an accessory after the fact -- is awaiting a potential retrial after jurors said they were deadlocked over his verdict.\n      \n    \n          Giles' mother, Dusty, reportedly said she was \"so proud\" of the prosecution for winning the case, and happy that Pearce's sexual assault victims \"finally had their day in court\" too.\n      \n      ",

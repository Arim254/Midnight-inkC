    "body": "\n\tCasey Wasserman will remain as the chairman of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics amid calls for his resignation due to his Jeffrey Epstein ties.\n\n\tThe LA28 executive committee of the board — which was hand-picked by Wasserman and includes Jeffrey Katzenberg, Jeanie Buss, Kevin McCarthy and Jessica Alba — held an emergency meeting to discuss Wasserman’s recently revealed relationship with the convicted sex trafficker. The committee, a smaller subset of the 35-person Olympics board, conducted a review with the help of law firm O’Melveny & Myers LLP and put out a statement on Wednesday asserting that “Mr. Wasserman should continue to lead LA28 and deliver a safe and successful Games.”\n\t\n\n\tWasserman, the founder and CEO of the eponymous Hollywood agency, is under fire after flirtatious emails with Ghislaine Maxwell surfaced in the latest batch of Epstein files released by the Justice Department. Wasserman’s correspondence with Maxwell dates back to 2003, before she was convicted of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\n\n\t“We found Mr. Wasserman’s relationship with Epstein and Maxwell did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented,” the Executive Committee of the Board said in its statement. “Twenty-three years ago, before Mr. Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell’s deplorable crimes, Mr. Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein’s plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation. This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell.”\n\t\n\n\tThe statement concludes: “The Executive Committee of the Board has determined that based on these facts, as well as the strong leadership he has exhibited over the past ten years, Mr. Wasserman should continue to lead LA28 and deliver a safe and successful Games.”\n\n\tWasserman has faced pressure from talent signed to his agency, with artists like Chappell Roan and athletes like Abby Wambach exiting the company and calling for him to resign. Dozens more clients have severed ties with the agency over Wasserman’s Epstein controversy.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 22nd annual Puppy Bowl put up impressive numbers on Super Bowl Sunday. \n\n\tThe program pulled in 15.3 million viewers across Animal Planet, Discovery, TBS, truTV, HBO Max, and Discovery+ on Feb. 8, airing at 2 p.m. ET/11amPT. That is the show’s best performance since 2018 and a 20% increase over last year.\n\n\t“This year’s Puppy Bowl delivered its strongest performance in nearly a decade, and its success across linear and streaming highlights our unique ability to unite audiences around content that feels good and does good,” said Joseph Boyle, head of content for Discovery Channel. “We’re grateful to bring viewers so much joy and are deeply proud of the purpose at the heart of this event.”\n\t\n\n\tPuppy Bowl XXII is produced for Animal Planet by Bright Spot Content, an All3Media America company.\n\n\n\tNews of the strong Puppy Bowl numbers comes just one day after it was reported that this year’s Super Bowl averaged 124.9 million viewers, down roughly 2% from the previous year. Meanwhile, the highly-anticipated halftime show led by Bad Bunny nabbed 128.2 million viewers, making it the fourth most-watched Super Bowl halftime show ever. The official YouTube video of Bad Bunny’s performance has reached 69 million views in two days. \n\n\tCompare that to the Turning Point USA alternative halftime show headlined by Kid Rock. Though it is not an apples to apples comparison due to the fact they aired on different platforms, the TPUSA peaked at 6.1 million concurrent viewers, while the video on the official TPUSA YouTube channel has drawn approximately 21 million viewers since Sunday. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe producers behind Broadway’s biggest night are getting a shake-up.\n\n\tTony Award Productions announced that Raj Kapoor, Sarah Levine Hall and Jack Sussman will serve as executive producers of the upcoming 79th Tony Awards, set to return to Radio City Music Hall on Sunday, June 7.\n\n\tKapoor, an Emmy-winning live events veteran, joins the Tony Awards for the first time. Levine Hall, also an Emmy winner, and Sussman, a longtime CBS executive and live-events producer, bring deep Tony and broadcast experience to the team. Kapoor and Levine Hall will serve as co-showrunners.\n\t\n\n\t“The 79th Annual Tony Awards are in exceptional hands,” said Heather Hitchens, president and CEO of the American Theatre Wing, and Jason Laks, president of the Broadway League, in a joint statement. “With this team’s unmatched expertise in live events and bold creative vision, they will elevate the broadcast to new heights, building on last year’s record-breaking telecast while delivering a show that’s fresh, modern, and fully reflective of Broadway’s ever-evolving spirit.”\n\n\n\t“As former theater kids, stepping into the role of Executive Producers for the 79th Tony Awards is a tremendous honor,” said Kapoor, Hall, and Sussman. “There’s nothing quite like capturing the magic of live theater on a global stage. Our team is committed to bringing audiences closer to the creativity, innovation, and heart that define Broadway.”\n\n\tKapoor’s resumé includes nine recent Academy Awards telecasts and 12 Grammy Awards, earning Emmy wins for executive producing “The 96th Oscars” and “Adele: One Night Only.” He is currently serving as showrunner and executive producer of the upcoming 98th Oscars and the most recent 68th Grammys. Levine Hall has worked on 19 previous Tony Awards and won an Emmy in 2024 for the Oscars. Sussman, formerly executive vice president of specials, music and live events at CBS Entertainment, oversaw the network’s Grammy Awards and Tony Awards broadcasts for more than two decades.\n\t\n\n\tThe eligibility cut-off for the 2025-2026 Broadway season is April 26, 2026, with nominations set to be announced May 5. The ceremony will air live coast-to-coast on CBS and stream on Paramount+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Van Der Beek, the actor known for playing Dawson Leery on “Dawson’s Creek” and for numerous other TV and film roles, died on Wednesday. He was 48.\n\n\tVan Der Beek was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2023 and made his diagnosis public in 2024.\n\n\tVan Der Beek’s family announced the news with a statement on his Instagram: “Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Connecticut, Van Der Beek got his start acting Off-Broadway while still in high school. He had appeared in several theater productions and a few independent films before his big break came when he was cast in “Dawson’s Creek” in 1997.\n\n\n\tThe show’s creator, Kevin Williamson, based Van Der Beek’s filmmaker character on his own experiences growing up. The popular series aired for six seasons on The WB and co-starred Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson and Michelle Williams. Van Der Beek’s teary response to being dumped by Katie Holmes’ Joey character became a meme that endured long past the show’s end.\n\n\tThe cast of “Dawson’s Creek” reunited in September for a benefit in New York to raise money for Van Der Beek. He was too sick to participate in the live script reading, which was Williams’ idea, but sent in a video-recorded message for the audience.\n\n\tDuring his time on the show, he took on other roles such as starring in the football drama “Varsity Blues,” for which he won an MTV Movie Award. He played Jay in Kevin Smith’s “Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back,” and starred in “The Rules of Attraction.” \n\t\n\n\tAfter “Dawson’s Creek” ended, he returned to the stage in “Rain Dance,” and guest starred on shows including “Criminal Minds” and “How I Met Your Mother.”\n\n\tOn “One Tree Hill,” Van Der Beek had a recurring role as a filmmaker, then had roles in series including “Mercy,” “Don’t Trust the B—- in Apt. 23” and “Friends With Better Lives.” On the Vice scripted series “What Would Diplo Do,” he earned positive reviews for playing the flashy dj.\n\n\tMore recently, his recurring roles included “CSI: Cyber,” “Pose” and he voiced 69 episodes of the animated “Vampirina.” He also appeared on the 28th season of “Dancing With the Stars,” and competed as Griffin on “The Masked Singer” in 2025. His most recent guest appearance was in two episodes of “Overcompensating.”\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife, Kimberly Brook, and six children. \n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWas “Melania” worth it?\n\n\tAmazon MGM‘s controversial documentary about the first lady of the United States has earned $13.5 million after two weekends of release. It’s projected to end its theatrical run with $16 million to $20 million, which would place “Melania” among the highest-grossing docs (not including concert films like Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” and Beyoncé’s “Renaissance”) in years. And moviegoers, most of whom were older white women, liked what they saw on screen. “Melania” earned an “A” grade on CinemaScore and 99% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, a vast discrepancy from the 8% Rotten Tomatoes average it received from critics.\n\t\n\n\tIf Amazon MGM executives are popping champagne, however, it’s not because “Melania” is a financial triumph. Theater owners get to keep roughly half of ticket sales, meaning in the best-case scenario, the studio is walking away with just $10 million. For traditional studios, that’s hardly enough to justify the film’s price tag: Amazon paid a staggering $40 million to acquire “Melania” and a follow-up streaming docuseries. Then the company shelled out $35 million on the theatrical marketing spend, an unprecedented sum considering documentaries aren’t traditionally a driver of big box office dollars.\n\n\n\tAmazon’s expenditure has led others to question whether “Melania” was a box office gamble or bribe. Consider the global tallies for top-earners in the non-fiction space in the past decade, which were a string of 2018 winners including the stranger-than-fiction “Three Identical Strangers” ($13.4 million), Ruth Bader Ginsburg portrait “RBG” ($14.4 million), Fred Rogers life story “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” ($22 million) and climber Alex Honnold’s death-defying “Free Solo” ($29.2 million). Production and marketing expenses for those films were all in the low seven-figures. \n\t\n\n\tAmazon’s deep pockets makes it easier to absorb losses as the company enters the theatrical space in earnest. One of the studio’s only major releases of last year, the #MeToo-inspired “After the Hunt,” carried an $80 million production budget and ended its theatrical run with just $9 million worldwide. In 2024, Dwayne Johnson’s holiday adventure “Red One” cost a staggering $250 million and earned $186 million globally. A general rule is that films need to gross 2.5 times their production budget to break even theatrically (which plenty of movies don’t do, particularly in the current box office landscape). Neither “After the Hunt” nor “Red One” were close to achieving that metric, though Amazon MGM’s distribution chief Kevin Wilson said in the past that the studio uses a different barometer for success. He’s maintained that a win for the company would be earning back the marketing and distribution costs.\n\n\t“Whether or not people like it, the value of these movies is different for our business model. We’re getting a massive marketing campaign that’s being paid for before the film gets to streaming,” Wilson told Variety in 2024. “If we can put these movies out theatrically and cover our P&A [print and advertising] costs, why wouldn’t we?”\n\n\tIn the case of “Melania,” Amazon MGM is unlikely to recoup the marketing and distribution spend. Hollywood rivals believe that Amazon MGM is after something more valuable than profits on a single film. Given the lavish spending (Amazon’s bid was reportedly around $25 million above Disney’s next-best offer of $14 million) there’s been rampant speculation that the doc is the retailer’s attempt to cozy up to the current administration. Although “Melania” would be more of a proactive effort, media companies have been more willing to bend to Trump’s will during his second term. Last summer, Paramount paid $16 million to the president to settle what the company initially called a “meritless” lawsuit tied to “60 Minutes,” while a year earlier, Disney wrote a $15 million check to Trump’s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit brought against ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\n\tWhen Amazon MGM acquired “Melania” in early 2025, a studio spokesperson said, “We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.”\n\t\n\n\tAmazon, as a business, is unique in other ways. At least compared to other streamers, the company is less concerned about churn, a term for the rate at which subscribers cancel services. More than 200 million people subscribe to Prime for free shipping on paper towels, shampoo and trash bags — a portion of whom may not even realize a membership also grants them access to stream thousands of movies and TV shows. Still, Amazon MGM can monetize films like “Melania” when they land on streaming. In several statements about the theatrical release of “Melania,” Wilson argued the big-screen debut (and the endless conversations it has generated) only boosts the movie’s profile.\n\n\t“Together, theatrical and streaming represent two distinct value-creating moments that amplify the film’s overall impact,” Wilson said after ticket sales for “Melania” declined 67% in its second weekend of release. “Audience response is already validating this approach, with exit data showing strong intent to rewatch on Prime Video and meaningful interest in the forthcoming docuseries.”\n\n\tIndustry watchers are mixed on how “Melania” will perform on Prime Video. Some believe that everyone who had interest has already watched Amazon’s glossy look at the first lady in the lead up to the inauguration. Others suggest it could see a surge from morbidly curious liberals wouldn’t never pay for a ticket for a film endorsed by the Trumps and directed by director Brett Ratner, who has been exiled from Hollywood since he was accused in 2017 of sexual harassment.\n\n\tA loss in the tens (or, heck, even hundreds) of millions can be chalked up to a rounding error for Amazon, which has a $2.2 trillion market cap. It’s hard to estimate the losses on “Melania” because like other streaming services, Amazon MGM doesn’t disclose the way it values streaming viewership. However, most companies would be writing down tens of millions on the film.\n\n\tAmazon’s true metric of success might not be ticket sales or streaming figures but rather how the president is feeling about his wife’s big screen debut. After all, those signature Melania Trump popcorn boxes could pay off with regulatory approvals, government contracts and all the missions to space that Bezos could dare to dream. In this transactional administration, $75 million may just be the price of doing business.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Oscar race is on.\n\n\tThe acting races at this year’s 98th ceremony are anything but straightforward. Across lead and supporting categories, the field is defined by generational clashes, overdue narratives, potential history-makers and a few spoilers who could upend what pundits and awards enthusiasts are expecting.\n\n\tWe have candidates like Timothée Chalamet and Jacob Elordi who are chasing youth records. Contenders like Emma Stone and Sean Penn who are eyeing rare third trophies. There are veterans like Delroy Lindo and Amy Madigan, who have long-awaited for recognitions throughout their careers. And of course, international standouts like Renate Reinsve and Wagner Moura, showing that subtitles are no longer hinderances. Each nominee carries momentum, and each one has some vulnerabilities, in the context of what could have their names printed on an envelope.\n\t\n\n\tVariety breaks down the pros and cons facing each contender because in a season this competitive, the smallest advantage could decide who hears their name called on Oscar night.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARTY SUPREME, Timothee Chalamet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tActor in a Leading Role\t\n\t\n\t\tTimothée Chalamet\t\n\n\t“Marty Supreme”\n\n\tFORChalamet highlights his charisma and volatility playing an unknown table tennis prodigy. This marks his third Oscar nomination, following “Call Me by Your Name” and “A Complete Unknown,” signaling the Academy’s sustained respect for the actor’s evolution. With Critics Choice and Golden Globe wins already secured, the momentum is real.\n\n\tAGAINSTHe’s still young in Oscar terms. At 30, he would become the second-youngest best actor winner ever. The performance is deliberately showy, and some voters may feel the virtuosity outweighs emotional revelation. Chalamet also plays a character, Marty Mauser, that is also deeply unlikable — a hurdle in a category that often rewards empathy.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLeonardo DiCaprio\t\n\n\t“One Battle After Another”\n\n\tFORA controlled, often comedic performance with plenty of memorable moments. The eight-time acting nominee and 2016 winner (“The Revenant”) reminds voters of his commanding screen presence. The film’s robust 13 nominations, including best picture, signal enthusiasm across all branches.\n\n\tAGAINSTThis is familiar territory for DiCaprio, and the film’s ensemble emphasis can blunt the sense of a singular, career-defining showcase. It also doesn’t follow the typical narrative of a second Oscar win for a leading man (i.e., Daniel Day-Lewis, Dustin Hoffman, etc.)\n\t\n\t\tEthan Hawke\t\n\n\t“Blue Moon”\n\n\tFORA devastating portrait of famed musician Lorenz Hart that conveys his rhythm and intellect. Hawke’s fifth nomination — his first in lead actor — feels like a career acknowledgment for decades of grinding in the Hollywood industry. Few actors have collaborated so widely or so curiously across generations and styles.\n\n\tAGAINSTThe performance is big and plays to the back of the room. Some voters may not respond to his charm and wit. With only two nominations for “Blue Moon,” the film appears to have struggled to fully register with the Academy at large.\n\t\n\t\tMichael B. Jordan\t\n\n\t“Sinners”\n\n\tFORIt’s a bold turn playing twin brothers that balances confidence with psychological fracture, demanding stamina and range. Jordan’s first Oscar nomination follows long-cited omissions in earlier Ryan Coogler films such as “Fruitvale Station” and “Black Panther,” and arrives alongside the year’s most-nominated film. If voters treat “Sinners” as a full-scale sweep, he could ride that wave.\n\n\tAGAINSTSome may view the doubling as a technical achievement rather than an emotional one, with focus split between identities. Genre bias remains a real obstacle. See Demi Moore’s loss last year for “The Substance.”\n\t\n\t\tWagner Moura\t\n\n\t“The Secret Agent”\n\n\tFORA refined, textured performance that charts identity with political urgency. Moura inhabits the raw honesty of a man caught in the heart of authoritarianism, anchoring a timely, true-story-adjacent drama. As the first Brazilian nominee in the category — a milestone that lives beside his historic Golden Globe win — his presence alone marks a meaningful moment.\n\t\n\n\tAGAINSTThe film’s density and non-English-language presentation may limit its immediacy for voters drawn to more overt catharsis. It is also a deliberately restrained performance in a field full of volume. SAG and BAFTA snubs further limit Moura’s winning chances as no lead actor has ever won an Oscar without them in the modern era.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAMNET, Jessie Buckley\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tActress in a Leading Role\t\n\t\n\t\tJessie Buckley\t\n\n\t“Hamnet”\n\n\tFORA raw, unsparing embodiment of grief as a lived-in condition rather than a narrative device. Buckley navigates the film in elemental sorrow without sentimentality, delivering what many consider the performance of the year, and undoubtedly her career so far. Her second nom after “The Lost Daughter” confirms her stature among the most formidable actors of her generation with adoring respect. \n\n\tAGAINSTThe movie’s emotional severity may be eclipsed by those who are scared to engage with it. Despite eight nominations, the film’s failure to carry Paul Mescal to a nom hints at uneven Academy support.\n\t\n\t\tRose Byrne\t\n\n\t“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”\n\n\tFORA ferocious, discomfort-forward performance that never softens its edges. Byrne commits fully to a woman unraveling in real time, turning psychological collapse into something uncomfortably familiar. After two decades of exceptional work (i.e., “Bridesmaids,” “Spy”), this marks her long-overdue first invite to the ceremony.\n\n\tAGAINSTThe film’s abrasive tone may alienate voters, and with just this single nomination for the Mary Bronstein dark comedy, it lacks broader institutional support.\n\t\n\t\tKate Hudson\t\n\n\t“Song Sung Blue”\n\n\tFORA warm and calibrated comeback that blends her talents with vulnerability and musical ease. Twenty-four years after her “Almost Famous” nomination, Hudson returns with added gravity and reminds voters that she still has it (and never lost it).\n\n\tAGAINSTThe arc may feel familiar compared with more formally adventurous work. With just one nomination, the film failed to generate additional momentum.\n\t\n\t\tRenate Reinsve\t\n\n\t“Sentimental Value”\n\n\tFORQuietly authoritative, Reinsve anchors Joachim Trier’s Norwegian drama with intelligence and restraint. After missing recognition for “The Worst Person in the World,” her nomination positions the star as one of international cinema’s most compelling contemporary performers.\n\t\n\n\tAGAINSTSubtlety can be mistaken for simplicity, particularly in a field favoring loud voices and transformations. Despite nine nominations, the SAG snub lingers as a warning sign.\n\t\n\t\tEmma Stone\t\n\n\t“Bugonia”\n\n\tFORA fearless performance that leans fully into absurdity while maintaining control that keeps the viewers on the edge. The two-time Oscar winner (“La La Land,” “Poor Things”) continues her run of bold, director-driven choices that make her a default nomination for anything she touches. A strong future candidate to join Meryl Streep and Frances McDormand in the three-timers club.\n\n\tAGAINSTVoters may hesitate to reward her so soon after a recent win. In addition, the film’s tonal extremes could divide viewers. It’s a Yorgos Lanthimos film after all.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStellan Skarsgård in “Sentimental Value”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tActor in a Supporting Role\t\n\t\n\t\tBenicio Del Toro\t\n\n\t“One Battle After Another”\n\n\tFORA volatile, scene-stealing turn marked by charisma and mordant humor in Paul Thomas Anderson’s revolutionary epic. The Oscar winner (“Traffic”) exerts effortless control, reminding voters of his unguarded presence.\n\n\tAGAINSTLimited screen time may make the impact feel fleeting compared with meatier roles. At just 13 minutes and 11 seconds — the briefest among this year’s nominees, according to Screen Time Central — his performance would rank as the sixth shortest ever to win the category by total minutes, and the third shortest by percentage of the film, at 8.15%.\n\t\n\t\tJacob Elordi\t\n\n\t“Frankenstein”\n\n\tFORA physically demanding and vulnerable take on the Creature that avoids caricature. Elordi brings unexpected tenderness and discipline under Guillermo del Toro’s direction, earning his first nomination and a Critics Choice win.\n\n\tAGAINSTGenre bias remains a stubborn barrier, regardless of ambition or execution. At 28, he would also be the second-youngest winner in the category. Would the Academy skew so young for two winners?\n\t\n\t\tDelroy Lindo\t\n\n\t“Sinners”\n\n\tFORA monumental, lived-in performance steeped in history, authority and quiet devastation. Lindo elevates every scene through presence alone, and his first nomination at 73 carries the undeniable weight of being overdue (hello, “Da 5 Bloods”).\n\n\tAGAINSTThe film’s scale can swallow even exceptional supporting work. He also lacks any other televised nominations, which no acting winner except for Marcia Gay Harden for “Pollock” (2001) was able to overcome.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tStellan Skarsgård\t\n\n\t“Sentimental Value”\n\n\tFORA devastating portrait of paternal regret delivered almost entirely through restraint. Skarsgård communicates volumes in silence, earning his first nomination after an impeccable 50-year career. A Golden Globe win strengthens his case.\n\n\tAGAINSTThe subtlety may be overlooked in a category that often rewards bolder strokes. Category placement remains contentious, and he also missed a SAG nomination.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSINNERS, Wunmi Mosaku\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tActress in a Supporting Role\t\n\t\n\t\tElle Fanning\t\n\n\t“Sentimental Value”\n\n\tFORElegant and incisive, Fanning provides a crucial emotional counterbalance as a Hollywood actress taking on a role that seems too large for herself. Her first nomination at 26 reflects her years of carefully chosen work.\n\n\tAGAINSTLimited spotlight and missed SAG and BAFTA nominations weaken her path in a crowded field.\n\t\n\t\tInga Ibsdotter Lilleaas\t\n\n\t“Sentimental Value”\n\n\tFORA finely tuned, quietly affecting portrayal that adds specificity to the film’s family dynamics. Her nomination shows the Academy’s continued openness to international actors, even if they don’t know how to pronounce their names, and could even translate into a surprise BAFTA triumph.\n\n\tAGAINSTLimited name recognition, which has hindered contenders in past years, along with potential vote-splitting with Fanning, further complicates her pathway.\n\t\n\t\tAmy Madigan\t\n\n\t“Weapons”\n\n\tFORIt’s a lively yet grounded performance that anchors the intensity of Zach Cregger’s horror film. Her first nomination since 1985’s “Twice in a Lifetime” marks one of the season’s strongest comeback narratives, bolstered by a Critics Choice win.\n\n\tAGAINSTThe role lacks the typical traditional Oscar-clip moment. As a lone nominee from a horror film, that hurts her chances. Missing BAFTA also stings.\n\t\n\t\tWunmi Mosaku\t\n\n\t“Sinners”\n\n\tFORA commanding, soulful performance by the Nigerian British actress provides the film’s moral center. Mosaku adds beautiful textures to a visually driven spectacle that earned her a deserved inaugural Oscar bid.\n\n\tAGAINSTThe ensemble focus diffuses individual attention, and a missed Globe nomination slowed early momentum.\n\t\n\t\tTeyana Taylor\t\n\n\t“One Battle After Another”\n\n\tFORA fearless, sharply etched turn that lingers well beyond its opening 30 minutes of Paul Thomas Anderson’s ambitious dramedy. Taylor’s first acting nomination speaks to a welcomed embrace by the Academy of an unconventional talent that’s been amplified by a Golden Globe-winning speech that became an instant season highlight.\n\t\n\n\tAGAINSTSome voters may view the character as more emblematic than fully dimensional, lacking the traditional arc — one that is often not rewarded in this category.\n\n\tFinal Oscar voting will take place from Feb. 26 to Mar. 5. The 98th Oscars will be held March 15 and will air on ABC, hosted by Conan O’Brien. Variety’s official Oscar predictions are updated every Thursday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHollywood is mourning the loss of James Van Der Beek, the “Dawson’s Creek” star who died on Wednesday at the age of 48. \n\n\tVan Der Beek was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2023 and made his diagnosis public the following year. \n\n\tThe actor’s family announced the news of his death with a statement on his Instagram: “Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.”\n\t\n\n\tSarah Michelle Gellar, Chad Michael Murray and more paid tribute to Van Der Beek in the comments of the Instagram post.\n\n\n\t“I’m so sad for your beautiful family,” Gellar wrote. “While James’ legacy will always live on, this is a huge loss to not just your family but the world. Fuck Cancer.” \n\n\tMurray shared similar sentiments, writing, “Sending love and light to your beautiful family. James was a giant. We’re so so so sorry for what you’re going through. His words, art and humanity inspired all of us- he inspired us to be better in all ways. God bless you guys.” \n\n\t“Dancing With the Stars” pro Emma Slater, who competed with Van Der Beek on Season 28, commented, “I’m so devastated. He is and will always be family to me. Love you so much James. The man that you are, you can be proud of. So grateful that I got to be there to say goodbye to you.” \n\n\tPaul Walter Hauser posted on his Instagram page an image of the amount he raised for Van Der Beek’s cancer treatment, along with the message: “Love you, James. I know you’re in Heaven being pampered with love. The Van Der Beeks will be in our daily prayers and we’ll be drumming up some money to support your beautiful family. Thanks for the body of work and for being one of the good guys.”\n\t\n\n\tVan Der Beek was known for playing Dawson Leery on the WB drama series “Dawson’s Creek,” which ran for six seasons from 1998 to 2003. He went on to appear in multiple shows, including playing a fictionalized version of himself on the ABC sitcom “Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23.” Other television credits include “Mercy,” “How I Met Your Mother,” “Friends With Better Lives,” “CSI: Cyber,” “Pose,” “Vampirina” and more. \n\n\tOn the film side, Van Der Beek starred as Mox in the 1999 sports dramedy “Varsity Blues.” His additional film credits include “Texas Rangers,” “The Rules of Attraction,” “Formosa Betrayed,” “Labor Day” and “Bad Hair.” \n\n\tSee tributes for Van Der Beek below. \n\n\n",

'cause one contestant on the new season made her experience on the show painfully literal by practically gluing her own eye shut!!\n      \n    \n          The wildly ironic moment went down during the S10 premiere of the Netflix dating series when 39-year-old nurse (yes, really ... nurse😬) Elissa Finley was rushed to the hospital after accidentally putting nail glue straight into her eye.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Elissa told her costars she spotted a tiny bottle in the bathroom, assumed it was eye drops, and squeezed a few drops in -- only to realize it was nail glue. Brutal.\n      \n\n          She explained docs hooked her up to an IV and flushed her eye with tubing while another staffer tried to get the glue out.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Elissa admitted she was terrified and thought she might lose her sight after her vision went blurry ... proving she definitely didn’t have an eye for detail when it came to reading labels.\n      \n    \n          Good news though -- she looked A-OK afterward and jumped right back into the experiment, ready to get her head (and eyes) back in the dating game.

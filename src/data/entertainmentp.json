    "body": "\n\tSomebody up there who likes epic baseball games also likes Brad Paisley. \n\n\t“I would like to be called Mr. More Baseball,” the country star tells Variety, the day after singing the National Anthem at a World Series game that went to a record-tying 18th inning. “If you’d like more baseball, I’m your guy.”\n\n\tIt’s not that this was an isolated occurrence. The previous time a World Series game went to an 18th inning, back in 2018, Paisley also happened to be singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” In fact, all four times he has sung the anthem before a Series game, it has gone into extra innings, although not always as radically as these two instances.\n\t\n\n\tA few wags have wondered if this is “the Brad Paisley curse,” but most baseball fans would be more likely to qualify as something like “the Brad Paisley blessing.” Rather than become bored by the lengthy standup, many were agreeing with the sportcasters who called Monday’s game one of the most thrilling in the history of the sport, even though — maybe especially though — it went to almost seven hours.\n\n\n\tSo many people have credited him as the charm that made that possible again, he’d like to put himself up for more such possibly crowd-pleasing opportunities to usher in a two-for-the-price-of-one game.\n\n\t“I’m available also for football,” Paisley points out. “I’d like to see that go into more quarters, as well.”\n\n\tPaisley did an interview for an MLB program before his performance and was asked, presumably jokingly, if he could foresee something similar happening as went down in 2018. He brushed it off.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s statistically impossible. I don’t understand,” says the country star. “I was like, I just want to get the words right. I had no idea that there would be major cosmic ramifications.”\n\n\tAs another point of coincidence, his birthday is Tuesday. “Here’s the fun fact: On the east coast, they won this on my birthday. They almost won it on my birthday on the west coast. If they win tonight, I get two wins on my birthday. Wouldn’t that be nice? That’s all I want. I can’t think of anything stranger, first of all,” than the Dodgers winning two on his big day without there being a double-header.\n\n\tHe won’t really take any credit for Monday’s seeming serendipity. “I definitely don’t think it had anything to do with me,” the Dodgers megafan says. “I did start to wonder what we were headed for in the ninth. I was like, ‘Please God, let’s win this now.’ And then I thought, ‘Okay, please God, let’s win this now in the 10th.’ And then last year the walk-off was in the 11th with Freddy Freeman, and that was a grand slam, and I’m like, ‘That’d be fine. Let’s do that. Yeah, that’d be a fun stat — do that twice!’ Nope. And then it was like, oh no… But it was one of the best-played baseball games of all time. I mean, the defense that both teams showed, the way they kept the score tied, and then the pitching… I just don’t even know what we just watched. It really was one of the most exhausting sporting events that you could ever see. Anybody who’s on the fence about what it’s like to be a baseball fan…”\n\n\t“Last night when that was happening, it was the same exact feeling when I was waiting on that in 2018. Just every inning, a pitcher just absolutely out-dueling the other, and then some close calls and then, I mean, none of us could believe what we were seeing, and I thought, who’s gonna end this? And then all of a sudden, here comes Freddy, which is also poetic. He did it two years in a row. It’s crazy.”\n\n\tPaisley is a friend of the Dodgers, literally, and is closest to the legendary pitcher who came into the game for just one out, at a point when the bases were loaded, with a serious threat to see the Blue Jays finish the home team off and change the momentum of the series.\n\n\t“My favorite moment was with my dear friend Clayton Kershaw, who’s my favorite player of all time, and not just because we’re friends. I think he’s the exemplary baseball player of our generation,” Paisley says. “And for him to go in there… I couldn’t believe the situation he was asked to perform in last night. Never in history, going in an extra inning, ever, and then goes in an extra inning with bases loaded and doesn’t give up. To me, that’s just the beautiful thing about this game. They cut to Ellen, his wife, in the stands, and she’s crying when he gets that.” Paisley had chatted with him before the game. “He said it last night. ‘He’s like, ‘Four more games at most, and then I’m done.’ And it’s like, whoa. And then to see this play out, it’s like Brad Pitt said in ‘Moneyball’: ‘How can you not be romantic about baseball?'”\n\t\n\n\tSome thought that was a risky move on manager Dave Roberts’ part that could have had fans feeling sorry for the nearly-retired Kershaw if things had not gone his way. “That’s foremost on Dave’s mind,” Paisley says. “He must have really, really felt like that was the best shot at that moment. He needed that out, and he needed it from somebody that’s not gonna buckle. Clayton is the fiercest competitor you will ever meet. In the case of Dave, they’re very mindful of the fact that his legacy needs to be one of his entire incredible, massive career being this major accomplishment. And you don’t want that footnote at the end (if winning runs are batted in on Kershaw’s watch). I was really praying at that moment, but it worked out. And I think that somehow that was meant to be.”\n\n\tPaisley talks about the slow evolution of his relationship with the Dodgers before he became known as one of the most reliable musical faces in Chavez Ravine.\n\n\t“It goes back to when Kim and I got married in 2003 and started living out there part-time in Santa Monica. We bought our first house, which was in the Palisades, which is one of my houses that burned down (this year). I didn’t own it anymore, but it’s a tragedy; it was a beautiful old place, built in 1922, and the first house we ever bought together. Jjust like everything else in that area, it’s gone. But around that time, my kids started to be of the age where they need to go to baseball games. I mean, that’s a rite of passage. And so I started to fall in love with the Dodgers as a team and got to know guys like Clayton and Justin Turner, and became good friends with Dave Roberts and Andrew Friedman and these folks. It kinda helps, too, that Nashville doesn’t have anything like that, other than the Sounds, who aren’t competing in that category. But it’s a really neat organization and I just love the sport.”\n\n\tHe didn’t grow up obsessed with the game. “I grew up kind of half-watching baseball. In the years where the Pirates were good when I was growing up, my dad for some reason was a Cleveland Indians fan, instead of the Pirates, probably from his dad. But we just didn’t go to many games or anything like that and I just wasn’t invested.”\n\n\tWhen he was asked to do his first performance of the National Anthem for the Dodgers in 2000, it planted a seed. “That first anthem was interesting. It was a middle of the day, hot L.A.-sun-type sun game, and you sing and they give you the jersey and tickets and you have a hot dog and call itan accomplishment.” But eventually it got to be personal, not just a gig, with Paisley.\n\t\n\n\t“One of the more memorable ones I ever did was what they called opening day 2.0, I think — the opening day of fans being allowed back in ‘21, after that whole year of just our cardboard cutouts sitting in the stands over there. I sang that day and that was really emotional — I mean, it just felt like the world was right when people were allowed to watch this game again in person. I loved it. And that one was hard to get through; it felt like a cathartic thing.”\n\n\tNow, “I think if you want more baseball, call me.  I would like to think it’s the blessing, being that my team won; I guess it would be a curse if every time I sang it went long and the team I was rooting for lost. But I love being some part” of the lore, he says. “Because look, I’m never gonna swing a bat or be anywhere near the real sport itself, and then, to see these articles today” on sports sites and in other news stories, “there’s so much fun to read mentions that are like, ‘Did you know he did this and this and this?’ It’s really mind-blowing to even be mentioned in the course of some baseball statistic, for a guy who loves the sport…\n\n\t“It’s my one historic contribution to mankind,” he cheerfully decides.\n\n\tNext up for Paisley is a Christmas album he’s soon putting out, “Snow Globe Town” — and it’s hard to think about yuletide cheer being night when the boys of summer are still at it in the L.A. sun. But he’s ready for the transition, with or without a rocking holiday collection to soon promote. “That’s why you turn Hallmark on in November. Well, I do. It’s like, ‘Let’s leave this channel on for the next two months.'”\n\n\tPaisley is sticking around to attend Tuesday’s Game 4, naturally. From the stands. “Whatever happens tonight ain’t my fault,” he says.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrankie Muniz revealed during an episode of “The Joe Vulpis Podcast” last month that he has not spoken to Hilary Duff in the 22 years since they starred in “Agent Cody Banks” together (via People). Muniz blamed Duff’s mother for creating a split between the two young actors after she allegedly interfered in the movie’s casting process and went behind Muniz’s back to get Duff cast as the female lead in the action comedy.\n\n\tMuniz and Duff met as teenagers as their careers took off around the same time, with Duff’s Disney Channel series “Lizzie McGuire” premiering in 2001 and Muniz’s Fox sitcom “Malcom in the Middle” debuting in 2002. Muniz even cameoed as himself on Duff’s series.\n\t\n\n\t“We became really, really good friends. We had a really great relationship for a long time,” Muniz remembered. “I was on the set of ‘Lizzie McGuire,’ and I was in Hilary’s dressing room and her mom was there… Her mom was like, ‘Do you know what you’re doing this summer? What are you doing this summer?’ And I go, ‘Oh, I’m filming this movie where I’m playing like a junior James Bond.'”\n\n\tMuniz said he told Duff’s mom all about “Agent Cody Banks,” and she allegedly responded by asking if the movie had a female lead yet. According to Muniz, the production was already interested in casting “Smallville” star Kristin Kreuk opposite him, and he “really thought” Cody’s love interest, Natalie Connors, would be played by her when he read the script. Plans suddenly changed, however. Muniz said the next time he spoke to Duff’s mother (which was the very next morning), she was informing him that Duff had already been cast.\n\t\n\n\t“Her mom’s like, ‘Guess what? We’re going to be spending the summer together… she’s doing “Cody Banks” with you… They signed the contract last night,’” Muniz said, adding that he was shocked and remembered thinking: “The movie you knew nothing about yesterday?”\n\n\tMuniz was surprised because he thought he was at a point in his career where he would have pull with the studio when it came to finding his “Agent Cody Banks” co-star. He called his agents, who confirmed that “calls were made” about casting Duff in the role. The agents “just assumed it was fine” since he was already close with Duff, as proven by his cameo on “Lizzie McGuire.”\n\n\t“Needless to say, I wasn’t thrilled about it. And not because I didn’t want it to be Hilary,” Muniz said. “I don’t know how much I want to say. I’m trying to think about it because I’ve already said way too much.”\n\n\t“Agent Cody Banks” ultimately went into production with Muniz and Duff as the leads, with Muniz saying: “I was very sad when Hilary’s mom would come on set… And if I told you I’ve never talked to Hilary since the last day of filming. I’ve not said one word to her since then. So that’s the truth of that. No one knows about my Hilary Duff story.”\n\n\tMuniz then got honest by sharing the guilt he feels for not having continued his friendship with Duff just because of what her mother allegedly did to him by going behind his back.\n\n\t“I regret not just continuing to be friends with her because we had a great friendship for such a long time, and I let her mom… it pissed me off,” Muniz said. “I would love to catch up with her [in the future]. I would love to even talk about that because I’m sure she doesn’t know any of that happened.”\n\n\t“Agent Cody Banks,” directed by Harald Zwart, opened in theaters in March 2003 from MGM and grossed nearly $60 million worldwide. Muniz played the title role, a 15-year-old teenager who goes undercover for the CIA as a super-spy. The supporting cast featured Angie Harmon, Keith David and Ian McShane. Muniz returned for the 2004 sequel, “Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,” but Duff did not.\n\n\tWatch Muniz’s full interview on “The Joe Vulpis Podcast” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJeff Bridges says opening weekend grosses are not the final word on the quality of a film.\n\n\tIn a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, the “Big Lebowski” star was asked for his thoughts on the growing importance of opening weekends, and some deeming “Tron: Ares” a disappointment for grossing below debut projections. Bridges says it’s “interesting” how movies are deemed a flop after only one weekend in theaters, and noted his 1980 film “Heaven’s Gate” as an example of a film that gained popularity over time.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s interesting, though, how movies are received at opening weekend,” Bridges said. “I remember ‘Heaven’s Gate’ was considered, you know, very disappointing or a flop, but nowadays it’s considered kind of a masterpiece.”\n\n\n\tSpeaking from personal experience, Bridges explained that films often “grow on you,” and that his initial reactions can flip in a matter of weeks or months.\n\n\t“Even as an individual, often, I have not liked a movie,” he added. “And then a couple weeks or months later, I’ll see it again. I’ll say, ‘What was I thinking?’ As the Dude would say, ‘That’s just like your opinion, man.'”\n\n\t“Heaven’s Gate” was famously pulled from theaters after critics lambasted its limited release. The 291-minute cut was slimmed down to 149 minutes for the wide debut, but even so, the film only grossed $3.5 million against a budget of $44 million. However, with time, the film has garnered critical praise and a deeper understanding of its historic production.\n\n\tAs for “Tron: Ares,” the $180 million budgeted sci-fi sequel was targeting a domestic debut between $45 million and $50 million, but only grossed $33.5 million during its first weekend in North American theaters. Since its release on Oct. 10, the film has grossed $123.4 million globally.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTIFFCOM, Tokyo International Film Festival‘s market arm, is riding a wave of international momentum, with CEO Shiina Yasushi pointing to strong year-on-year growth as evidence the market is successfully transforming from a purely sales-driven event into a co-production and financing hub.\n\n\t“TIFFCOM 2025 will host a total of 322 exhibiting companies, up from 283 last year, with booths nearly sold out by early July,” Shiina says. The market brings together film, television, animation and IP business under one roof, with Japanese content at the center. “It is increasingly recognized as a comprehensive market that brings together film, television, animation, and IP business. The diversity of Japanese content and Tokyo’s rich cultural and creative energy are major strengths.”\n\t\n\n\tThe executive emphasizes that TIFFCOM will continue strengthening ties with the Tokyo International Film Festival while expanding collaboration across Asia and enhancing both its project market and IP market to establish its position as an international hub in the region.\n\n\n\tThe shift in TIFFCOM’s identity represents a significant evolution for the market. “Now in its sixth edition, the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market (TGFM) is showing strong results, with past participating projects selected in major festivals such as Cannes, Venice and Berlin,” Shiina notes.\n\n\tThe quality of submissions continues to rise, and this year’s Tokyo IFF lineup also includes three firms that previously participated in TGFM. However, challenges remain. “One of the key challenges is increasing participation from Japanese producers, and this year we will hold lecture sessions to support those interested in international co-production with practical insights into co-production and financing.”\n\t\n\n\tThe rebranding of the Tokyo Story Market into the Tokyo IP Market marks another strategic shift. “The rebranding reflects the growing global demand for Japanese IP,” Shiina explains. “In addition to major publishers, production companies such as Toei have joined to introduce remake rights.”\n\n\tThe Tokyo IP Market aims to connect Japanese rights holders – offering diverse stories from books and audiovisual works – to international producers, furthering TIFFCOM’s role as a central hub within the IP ecosystem.\n\n\tASEAN partnerships represent a stated priority this year. “East Asian regions such as China, Korea, and Taiwan have long collaborated with Japan on production and continue to feature large pavilions at TIFFCOM,” Shiina says. “While strengthening partnerships with the rapidly growing ASEAN countries, we aim to position Tokyo as the central hub in the expanding Asian content ecosystem.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount has signed a minimum 10-year lease agreement with 1888 Studios to occupy more than 285,000 square feet of the production company in Bayonne, N.J. as a way to capitalize on incentives offered from the state’s film and digital media tax credit program.\n\n\tVariety has learned that 1888 Studios is expected to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2028.\n\n\tCurrently under development by Togus Urban Renewal, 1888 Studios will offer 1.1 million square feet of production space spanning 23 smart sound stages with a minimum of 40-foot clear ceilings, production support space, flexible post-production space, offices, mills, base camp and backlot, and lighting and grip facilities to accommodate every phase of production.  \n\t\n\n\tThe tax credit program, which expanded in 2025, empowers the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) to designate three studio partners and three film-lease partner facilities, each linked to large-scale infrastructure commitments. \n\n\n\t1888 Studios was designated New Jersey’s first film-lease partner facility in May 2024, and Paramount has submitted its studio partner application, which is under NJEDA review and will be brought to its Board for consideration on Oct. 30.\n\n\t“With 1888 Studios, we set out to build a cutting-edge facility that would attract the world’s most ambitious storytellers – giving New Jersey true scale and a home for every facet of film and television production under one roof,” Arpad “Arki” Busson, chairman of Togus Urban Renewal, said in a statement. \n\n\tHe continued, “By keeping American productions at home, the project, which will be constructed by union workers, will generate thousands of jobs and additional opportunities for New Jersey’s small businesses.”\n\t\n\n\tThe 1888 Studios campus will provide infrastructure, proximity to Manhattan, access to the regional industry workforce and post-production tax incentives.\n\n\t“With industry leaders like 1888 Studios and Paramount choosing New Jersey, it proves that our film and TV tax credit law – while prudent, guardrailled, and built for long-term capital investment – is competitive and can significantly boost our economy and local small businesses,” Senator Raj Mukherji, representative of New Jersey’s 32nd District, said about the partnership.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDon Josephus Raphael Eblahan’s “Hum” is making its pitch at the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market.\n\n\tAfter a devastating earthquake, a young veterinarian works at an evacuation center to treat injured farm animals. While caring for them, her professor discovers something extraordinary: her student can “speak” to animals. As she learns to harness this gift, she realizes that the creatures can sense and even predict aftershocks. Using this newfound connection, she helps her cowboy friends and family prepare for what’s to come. But her world is shaken once more when another person with the same ability appears… a man who police believe is responsible for causing the earthquake that destroyed their town. Upon his mysterious arrival, she attempts to unravel his mystery by interrogating him in the secret primal language that only the two of them speak.\n\t\n\n\t“The film is a meditation on earthquakes, environmental disasters, and weather anomalies in the age of climate change,” Eblahan tells Variety. “It aims to examine how such natural events that seem so cosmic and out of our control are tethered to the choices we make as humans. The film is also an exploration of personal memories: dead family members, my indigenous identity, and the stewardship of the land that indigenous communities have and the corrupt forces that threaten us from doing so.”\n\n\n\tThe film was developed in the Festival de Cannes Residency, and went on to the Berlinale’s Script Station, and the Sundance Institute’s Native Lab. “We have taken the film to markets all around the world such as in Busan, Berlin, and now TIFFCOM where we are in hopes of finding co-collaborators in helping the film come to life,” Eblahan says. “Most of the challenges of the film is working on the script because it takes a lot of time to make a story so rich with lore: especially for a sci-fi western.”\n\t\n\n\t“Hum” has been developed and shown at several labs, residencies, and markets, including the Festival de Cannes Residency, Locarno Academy & Residency, Sundance Native Lab, and Berlinale Script Station and Talents Project Market. “A special moment for our team is when we were awarded the ArteKino and the Sorfond Award at the [Busan] Asian Project Market, because it was our first market with this film and validated all of the work put into script development,” says producer Hannah Schierbeek. “Hum” also recently received minority co-production funding from the Polish Film Institute, which marks a big milestone in the financing journey because it was a challenge to secure the first co-production grant.\n\n\t“Our participation at Busan’s Asian Project Market and the Berlinale Talents Project Market have brought in our Polish and Singapore co-producers,” says producer Alemberg Ang. “The script has also significantly changed from the first time we pitched the project to the most recent application that we have made. And it’s getting better and better.”\n\n\tAt the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, the producers are excited to meet potential sales agents, distributors, financiers, and funding bodies. “We are at a stage in our development where we are now thinking critically about the set up of our production as well as the distribution and marketing of the film, and would love to meet people who can help us explore possibilities during production and beyond,” Schierbeek says.\n\n\t“Working with Don and Hannah is such a dream. Don is a very gifted filmmaker and Hannah is very passionate about her work,” Ang says. “I’m quite fortunate to be working with them for Don’s past two shorts and now, in ‘Hum.’ Having received grants from the Sundance Institute, Polish Film Institute, Film Development Council of the Philippines and the Gold House, we’re hoping we close the gap in Tokyo and hopefully bring in an equity investor or sales agent to the project.”\n\n\t“We hope to make a film that speaks feelings that many communities around the world can resonate with, despite this being a story that is so unique from within Don’s perspective as someone who grew up in the northern Philippines,” Schierbeek adds. “We also hope for the film to show how relevant, creative, and subversive indigenous Filipino cinema is.”\n\t\n\n\t“Right now, we are mounting an Oscar campaign for Don’s short, ‘Vox Humana,’ which serves as the feature film’s proof-of-concept,” Ang says. “Hopefully, given the visibility and promotion around this, it will also help us in creating a buzz for the feature film.”\n\n\tBesides “Hum,” Eblahan is currently developing two other scripts: One of them is an analog horror film about modern chess players and their relationship with computer opponents, interwoven with memories of the controversial 1978 World Chess Championship held in his hometown of Baguio during the Cold War era. And the other one is a dark fantasy re-telling of the Grimm’s “Rapunzel” set in colonial Philippines.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIkeda Kaori, managing director of TIFFCOM, is steering the Tokyo-based content market toward a more integrated role in Asia’s rapidly evolving entertainment landscape, leveraging years of experience in acquisitions and international sales to strengthen the platform’s regional positioning.\n\n\tSpeaking about her background in the sector, Kaori notes how her perspective has evolved. “Having spent years in acquisitions and international sales, I have some understanding of the ecosystem, which helps us shape TIFFCOM into a platform that enables comfortable and effective business meetings and information exchange,” she says. “TIFFCOM covers the full value chain — from Japan and Asia’s rich IPs to live-action films, dramas, animation, and both theatrical and streaming content — and we aim to strengthen its position as a valuable market in Asia.”\n\t\n\n\tThe 2025 seminar program reflects this ambition, with a sharp focus on co-production, IP strategy and Asian-centric expansion. Kaori identifies key industry gaps the sessions aim to address: “As the industry continues to evolve rapidly, interest in international co-productions and the global adaptation of IP is growing. However, I feel that a lack of practical knowledge and networks remains a challenge.”\n\n\n\tTo tackle this, TIFFCOM will host seminars featuring directors, producers and experts sharing real case studies on international co-production and IP adaptation. “These sessions will provide participants with concrete insights into the entire process, from project development and financing to distribution and beyond,” Kaori explains.\n\t\n\n\tOn the enduring appeal of Japanese IP — spanning manga to gaming — Kaori acknowledges persistent obstacles in cross-border adaptation. “Regarding animation, I believe many of the hurdles have already been overcome, but in general challenges often pointed out include the complexity of rights management for library titles and the slow pace of decision-making in Japan,” she says. “In addition, depending on the scale of the IP holder, there can still be a lack of sufficient structure and expertise to handle international adaptations effectively. The IP Market serves as one of the key initiatives to address and overcome these challenges.”\n\n\tCo-production has emerged as a cornerstone of TIFFCOM’s strategic vision. When asked what determines successful Asian co-production outcomes, Kaori emphasizes infrastructure and trust: “The success of co-productions in Asia requires both institutional support and a collaborative working environment. While public frameworks such as film commissions provide financial stability and facilitate permits, it is cross-border teamwork and trust among creators that lead to true creative outcomes. At TIFFCOM, we aim to build a platform that connects these two aspects — linking institutional support with human collaboration.”\n\n\tLooking beyond transactional exchanges, Kaori outlines a more ambitious goal for the market. “In recent years, TIFFCOM has placed greater emphasis on fostering connections that lead to project development and co-production,” she says. “Through initiatives such as the TGFM [Tokyo Gap-Financing Market] and the Tokyo IP Market, we aim to be more than just a marketplace — a space where lasting creative and financial partnerships are built.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“South Park” will break from its typical release pattern for a special episode debuting on Friday evening, timed to Halloween. The second episode of the newly inaugurated Season 28, titled “The Woman in the Hat,” will tackle the news of President Trump’s demolition of the east wing of the White House and his plans to construct a new ballroom on the premises.\n\n\tPer the logline released by Comedy Central, the episode’s events will include the White House dealing “with a disruptive spirit from the east wing,” while “Stan worries that South Park has become too political.” A preview image of the episode, included above, depicts Trump and his in-show lover Satan overseeing the demolition of the White House. Another released sneak peek, shown below, depicts leaders within Trump’s administration, such as Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, seeming to be haunted by a spectral presence. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe episode will premiere on Comedy Central on Friday at 10 pm. It replaces the show’s typical time slot on Wednesdays. A new episode had been slated to air Wednesday, Oct. 29, but an adjustment was finalized the day before, with the network’s social media posts promoting the original airdate since being deleted. Further episodes of “South Park” Season 28 will continue to air on Wednesdays, with dates currently slated for Nov. 12, Nov. 26 and Dec. 10.\n\n\n\tThe latest season of “South Park” abruptly premiered on Oct. 15. The long-running animated comedy series had been airing its 27th season earlier in the fall, but that ended after just five episodes and a sudden week-long delay for a sixth installment. The network had previously announced an order for 10 episodes for Season 27. No details were provided as to why the series suddenly turned the page to another season. \n\t\n\n\tHowever, Season 28 still picked up where Season 27 left off, with a focus on skewering the Trump administration’s policies, honed around an ongoing, bad romance between the commander-in-chief and Satan.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This interview contains spoilers for the Season 5 finale of “Only Murders in the Building.”\n\n\tJust in time for early voting in New York City, some news has come out about the mayor. He’s a murderer.\n\n\tThe mayor in “Only Murders in the Building,” that is. Season 5 of “Only Murders in the Building” concludes with the reveal of Mayor Beau Tillman (Keegan-Michael Key) as the killer of the Arconia doorman, Lester (Teddy Coluca).\n\t\n\n\tThe episode opens with Mabel (Selena Gomez), Charles (Steve Martin), Oliver (Martin Short) and Teddy Dimas (Nathan Lane) confronting Sofia Caccimelio’s (Téa Leoni) mother about why she stole the mysterious finger out of Charles’ freezer. Since they first found the finger in a shrimp tower Oliver had ordered for his wedding, and they recently learned that Lester urgently ordered Randall (Jermaine Fowler) to deliver the shrimp right before he died even though the wedding was over, they believed Lester had sent them the finger as a clue. Sofia’s mother implies that the finger belonged to someone Sofia was sleeping with, so the trio lures billionaires Jay Pflug (Logan Lerman), Bash Steed (Christoph Waltz) and Camila White (Renée Zellweger) to the secret poker room in the Arconia basement to try to get some answers.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Patrick Harbron\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJay removes the bandages on his hand, Bash removes his ring and Charles checks Sofia’s gloves, proving that none of them are hiding that they’re missing a finger. But soon, Mayor Tillman enters the room. At the same time, Howard (Michael Cyril Creighton) sends Mabel a text saying, “Someone’s coming down. It’s Beautiful.” Then he adds, “Sorry, autocorrect. It’s Beau Tillman.” Mabel remembers that Teddy texted his wife “It’s Beautiful” moments before he died, and realizes what he was trying to say.\n\t\n\n\tTillman confesses, saying that the billionaires invite him to the Arconia game room whenever they need a favor, in this case a permit to replace the Arconia with a casino. In a flashback, we see the night of their last game, when Nicky Caccimelio (Bobby Canavale), who ran the secret gambling nights, realized that Tillman was sleeping with Sofia, his wife. He chopped off Tillman’s finger with a cleaver in a drunken, coke-fueled rage, and Lester intervened, stopping Nicky by hitting him with his elevator crank and threatening to go to the police. Nicky, stumbling and slurring, ends up putting the cleaver in Lester’s hands before falling on top of him — and on top of the cleaver, killing Nicky. While Tillman and the billionaires discuss what to do, Lester grabs Tillman’s finger and the elevator crank and runs.\n\n\tTillman runs after Lester, who has already hidden the finger. After decades of feeling guilty for working for Nicky, Lester is desperate for the truth to come out and refuses to give the finger back, despite Tillman’s pleas about his humble beginnings and how hard he worked to become mayor. Realizing Tillman is going to kill him, Lester realizes that the Arconia’s only security camera not owned by Bash is his bird camera in the courtyard. He runs grabs his bird whistle and runs outside, saying, “My friends are gonna catch you.” “You don’t have friends. You have tenants. No one cares about the damn doorman,” Tillman replies. As they struggle, Lester drops his whistle in the fountain and gets in the water to grab it, but Tillman pushes him into a sharp stone corner in the center and runs away. As Lester begins to bleed out, he blows his bird whistle to trigger the camera, which records the video that was revealed earlier in the season of Randall finding the elevator crank in the coutyard.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Patrick Harbron\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe dirty cops Charles discovered earlier in the season chain up Mabel, Charles and Oliver in the secret passage Mabel previously found off the game room. Since the Arconia is about to be demolished to make room for the casino, they’ll die if they don’t escape. But Charles manages to climb up the pole he’s chained to, grabbing a clothes hanger from Nicky Caccimelio’s dry cleaning business above them, and uses it to pick the locks on their handcuffs. At the same time, in the Arconia lobby, Thé (Beanie Feldstein) crashes Camila’s press conference about the casino by announcing an impromptu concert in the game room, pushing past the crooked cops and bringing everyone downstairs. Mabel, Charles and Oliver emerge from the passageway and reveal Tillman as a murderer in front of all the press. Then Jay confesses to the police that he, Camila and Bash were involved in the cover-up — ruining the casino plans and saving the Arconia. He tells Mabel he’s probably not a good person, but that he thinks he’s different from the others.\n\t\n\n\tAs the episode ends, Mabel, Charles and Oliver get together to listen to a new London-set podcast by Cinda Canning (Tina Fey), the true crime savant who inspired their first-ever murder mystery together. In it, Canning describes “a young woman with curls as red as blood,” the prime suspect in the murder of a royal descendant, though Cinda believes her to be innocent. “I feel a strong need to protect her, to send her to America, which may be the only place she can be safe,” she says. As Cinda’s voice plays, we see a woman with curly red hair from behind. She runs down a New York City street while coughing and almost collapsing and with her hands covered in blood. She falls down in front of the Arconia, then crawls closer to the building, stopping right in front of the gate.\n\n\tAs Charles, Oliver and Mabel approach the gate, Howard tells them what he saw — then tells them she doesn’t qualify to be investigated in their podcast since she didn’t technically make it all the way to the gate. The woman, with a final gasp, puts her hand through the gate, turns over and dies. It’s Cinda.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Patrick Harbron\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Only Murders in the Building” co-creator and showrunner John Hoffman spoke with Variety about writing a murderous mayor, an aspirational billionaire and a dead true crime legend.\n\t\n\t\tNow that you can talk through all of it, please explain how you arrived at the idea to have Lester kill Nicky and then Tillman kill Lester.\t\n\n\tIt was a big dance. Always, we have to start with what really happened and twist our way there, understanding Lester as the victim and what themes we were wanting to go into. The dance of power and the unexpected nature of a doorman being put in a position to feel a sense of protection for the people in his building. When things get out of control, the buildup of his relationship with Nicky Caccimelio and all of those things come into a head on this one night with every character in that gaming parlor. We had to really build histories as to what brought all of them to that point, and that’s oftentimes what happens when any crime occurs. The most dimensional, emotional, high-pitched moments just come together — if it’s not a [premeditated] murder. It’s built on in-the-moment passion.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Patrick Harbron\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhy did you choose Tillman as the murderer this season? What was on your mind as you put the mayor of New York City at the center of your murder mystery?\t\n\n\tThe ways he’s played the game with with the powers that be in New York, and the sidesteps he’s needed to make, getting paid off [by rich people] — these kinds of things are unfortunately pretty prevalent in big cities. We did not plan to have the [real-life] mayoral election happening. I did not really figure that that would be happening as the finale dropped, but it’s intriguing to me that it did.\n\t\n\n\tThis is what his life is made up of and who he’s dealing with, and then there’s the big complication of his affair with Sophia Caccimelio. Obviously, he was very haughty that night, being in his full power knowing what those three billionaires were wanting from him. He was the man in control — until he lost a finger because of a bad move in his personal life. Once that happens, everything becomes magnified. “I need that finger. I can’t let it out what happened.” So those billionaires help him and cover it up and literally repair a finger. And he goes to Lester’s wake — it’s odd that he’s making an appearance there, and yet he’s doing it with the purpose of making cover for himself.\n\n\tI found it really moving, the negotiation he has with Lester in that lobby, talking about his own father and finding the connections between two people in different spheres, but one rogue finger can bring it all down. It’s absolutely maddening to him. “This guy who’s a simple doorman is not going to end my career. I won’t let it happen.” And the night has gone off the off the rails anyway, so he goes a bit off the rails too.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIt’s moving how determined Lester is to do the right thing when he could have just looked the other way like he’s been doing for decades and saved his own life. \t\n\n\tThere was a scene we shot that I would have loved to have kept in this this episode, but we have a very limited amount of time: It’s the photo from earlier in the season of Lester at Oliver’s wedding, and he’s having a good time, and Nicky comes out. He’s saying, “I need you to deal for me tonight.” And Lester’s like, “I’m done. Never. I’m not going anywhere near you anymore.” And Nicky actually says, “You come deal for me tonight, and you are done. I’ll let you go.” That’s why Lester went down there.\n\t\n\t\tThe billionaires already don’t come off well after their schemes to replace the Arconia with a casino, and then we find out they helped Mayor Tillman cover up Nicky’s and Lester’s deaths. Why did you decide to set Jay apart from the other two with his confession to the police and his words to Mabel?\t\n\n\tGosh, wouldn’t that be nice? I look at this the way the world is going, and you have less and less people with much more distilled power, and it’s very frustrating. When there is that much wealth and power, I just long for one of them to step up and confront and make the right choice and and reverse things. Mabel keeps asking, “Are you a good person? I don’t know if you’re a good person,” and it’s making him reflect in a way that he’s never really had to before. So on the personal level, that’s what’s going on. But on a more global level, it would be lovely if we had a few more of those people with great wealth and power to make a call that is for the greater good. So it’s absolutely yes. As Mabel says, “If you want to make the world a better place, stop making it worse.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Patrick Harbron\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat themes are you going to be exploring in Season 6 with the murder of Cinda Canning?\t\n\n\tSeason 5 really brought it home: The meaning of that building and their home and New York itself was very much explored in this season, so [we had] this idea that of taking it back to an origin story with Cinda being what brought them all together. Their fandom of her and her podcast was how it all started. And then taking it to [London], the origin of of mystery writing. Fiction-meets-true crime storytelling and podcasting became really intriguing to me, to mix those two worlds. It’s the land of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle combined with our podcasters and what they’ve been successful with. Marrying those things in the place where the cozy murder mystery began felt really intriguing.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s a full-circle moment to kill off Cinda, especially with the conversation as the finale ends about whether her murder counts as “in the building.” Should we take this as a hint that Season 6 will be the end of the show?\t\n\n\tThe only way I look at the ending of this series is when we’re genuinely out of turns that take us into deeper territory. If [Disney says], “Enough is enough! Get out of here,” and, or if, our cast is done — I think we’re all gaming this and seeing how embraced we remain. I think we all want to be conscious about when the ending is, and whether that’s a situation that ends in London or ends in New York, is another question. So we’ll see.\n\t\n\t\tYou’re writing a new season now, so you’re clearly not out of ideas. As of this moment, would you still want to make a seventh season?\t\n\n\tFull speed ahead. I’d be an idiot to walk away from this one. It’s been the most rare bird experience — not to bring up birds again, because you’ve had enough of those over this last season. But it’s rare air to have an opportunity like this with the with the people we get to work with and to love it as much as we all do. Who knows? It may be this season; it may be next; it may be somewhere down the road.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

Bruel – who lived in New York for several years until 2023 as the former head of French Cultural Services, a division of the French Embassy — is making his first official trip to the U.S. under his new role this week, to take part in The American French Film Festival (TAFF) which kicks off today (Oct. 28). \n\t\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety on the eve of his departure for L.A. to attend TAFF, Bruel discussed the increasingly large role of France in international cinema, which is reflected in the large number of French co-productions among the official Oscar submissions, including this year’s French Oscar candidate, Jafar Panahi’s Palme d’Or-winning “It Was Just an Accident.” \n\n\n\tBruel, who previously worked closely with the CNC to promote French talent in America and helped create Villa Albertine, a U.S. residency program for French creatives, also talked about his mandate to bolster the profile of France as a top filming destination for American filmmakers tackling mid-budgeted, ambitious projects, on the heels of Jim Jarmusch‘s Golden Lion-winning “Mother Father Sister Brother,” among others. He also addressed U.S. President Trump’s threat of imposing tariffs on movies produced outside of France; and the country’s evolving relationship with streamers; as well as the importance of its windowing model to protect theaters and independent film financing at a crucial time when “all premium creative models in the moving-image space are being disrupted by low-cost ones powered by AI, free platforms, and new forms of piracy.” \n\t\n\n\tEvery year, France is behind so many movies submitted for the international feature film category at the Oscars. How many of them are co-produced by France this year?\n\n\tThis year, nearly one-third of the films submitted for the International Feature Film category were co-produced with France, and more than 20% received support from the CNC. Out of 86 submissions, 27 were French co-productions and 19 benefited from CNC funding — Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent,” Diego Céspedes’s “The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo,” Oliver Laxe’s “Sirat,” Laszlo Némès’s “Orphan,” Maryam Touzani’s “Calle Malaga,” Tarik Saleh’s “Eagles of the Republic”, Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” among many others.\n\n\tFrance’s Oscar committee chose Jafar Panahi’s Palme d’Or winning film “It Was Just an Accident” which triggered some criticism in some French circles because it’s a Persian-language film shot with Iranian actors. What’s your position on that issue?\n\n\tI saw zero controversy. I just saw attempts at controversy. This is not the first time that France has chosen a film by a foreign director to represent it in this category. “Mustang” in 2016, directed by Turkish director Deniz Gamze-Erguven. The following year, “Elle,” by Paul Verhoeven, who is Dutch. And looking beyond France, there are many precedents: “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” by Mohammad Rasoulof, submitted by Germany last year; “Amour” by Michael Haneke, a French film that represented Austria; or “Perfect Days” by Wim Wenders, which was Japan’s submission. “This Was Just an Accident” fully meets the Academy’s criteria. It is a French co-production that could not have been realized without the decisive contribution of France and its production ecosystem. This film grew out of a long-standing collaboration between French producer Philippe Martin and Jafar Panahi who had previously worked together on a short film. The trust between them is a powerful symbol of the confidence that France places in the world’s greatest filmmakers, especially those who face threats or censorship in their own countries. But before being a film born of extraordinary circumstances, it is, quite simply, an extraordinary film. That is why the independent selecting committee decided that it was the best positioned to win the Oscar after the Palme d’Or, and France is extremely proud to stand behind it.\n\t\n\n\tWhy is France playing an increasingly active role in international cinema today?\n\n\tIn France, we place equal faith in French cinema and in a universal idea of cinema. That is why we choose to support French talent first and foremost, but also a strong ecosystem of production, distribution and international sales that helps sustain cinema around the world. This ranges from Jafar Panahi, who worked with Philippe Martin, to Brad Pitt whose company Plan B — behind “F1” — is now part of Mediawan, the group founded by Pierre-Antoine Capton. At Cannes this year, among the eight films that received awards, one was French and five had been supported by the Aide au Cinéma du Monde. The “ACM” is the largest co-production fund in the world, with a budget of €7 million, and the only one that provides up to €300,000 per project. The ACM supported 17 films in the race for the International Feature Film category this year, including Panahi’s. We’re in a process of increasing the amount of the fund for next year. It’s a critical moment for cinema, and France stands with those who uphold its highest ideals worldwide. At a time when we so often speak of art but think mostly in terms of industry, we owe it to filmmakers like Jafar Panahi to stay true to what cinema truly is.\n\n\tStreaming services tend to view films like audiovisual product and they’re lobbying to launch them on their platform in France as close as possible to their theatrical release. That won’t happen anytime soon I’m guessing?\n\n\tYou can’t have your cake and eat it too. You can’t hope for a strong theatrical market if you don’t stand up for it. Let’s not ask the impossible of movie theaters — to be both desirable and distinctive while their efforts are undermined by an all-too-brief window of exclusivity. I’m sometimes told it’s easier to release a film in Germany. But the German market is only half the size of France’s, even though Germany has a larger population. France is the third-largest box office after the United States and China, even though it ranks only seventh in economic power and twenty-third in population. Cinema is part of France’s DNA — and that’s what makes the French market one of the most resilient in the world amid the current decline in theater attendance. In countries where films have been reduced to mere by-products of the wider audiovisual industry, cinema itself faces an existential threat. Korea is a striking example — once seen as a driving force. When the focus shifts solely to the industrial dimension, or when trade agreements undermine cinema — as happened with the 2006 U.S.—Korea accords — cinema risks being swept away entirely. Today, cinema attendance has dropped by 40% worldwide between 2019 and 2024, but in Korea, the decline is even steeper — around 60%. In 2019, the country recorded 220 million admissions; this year, it may fall below 100 million. The situation in film production is even more alarming: output has shrunk fivefold over the same period, as investors have lost confidence in the theatrical market. As a result, in 2024 Korea saw a record 228 re-releases of older films, simply to fill screens — many of which are now being converted into religious halls or even indoor hiking spaces.\n\t\n\n\tYou’ve mentioned before that streaming platforms can be strategic allies of cinema. How would that work in a regulated market like France? \n\n\tPreserving a balanced window of theatrical exclusivity doesn’t mean that streaming platforms aren’t welcome in this market — quite the opposite. In fact, the rivalry between theaters and platforms, between the big screen and the small screen, belongs to the 2010s and now feels increasingly outdated. We are entering a new paradigm: today, I do think streaming platforms and the film world can work hand-in-hand — as long as they recognize the need to protect theaters. When you look at all the studies about young people’s viewing habits that have come out in the last three years, you notice that the competition is no longer primarily between streaming competing and cinemas, nor is it even between video games and streaming. There is a shift in audiences towards social media and free platforms, and it affects everyone, and especially streaming streamers.\n\n\tDo you view microdrama as a worrying trend that could hurt moviegoing? \n\n\t I’ve just returned from a trip to Korea, where a full season of 60 two-minute episodes costs around $200,000 to produce. That’s the going rate for a microdrama today. In France, this format has exploded across social media over the summer: each episode is like a two-minute ad — you click, you watch, and you’re sent to a dedicated platform. In China, the microdrama market actually surpassed theatrical box office last year — despite the country having 94,000 cinema screens. This may sound like good news for some, who see clear financial opportunities in it, but for the industry as a whole — and for audiences — the rise of microdrama, which epitomizes a low-cost content model, is not encouraging news. Our societies are increasingly endangered by our relationship with screens. We’ve never spent so much time in front of them — and yet, paradoxically, never spent so little time truly watching what they show.\n\n\tWhy do you think most streaming services are perceiving theaters differently today?\n\n\tTheatrical releases create value — community, cultural conversation, media resonance, and revenue — in ways that streaming platforms alone have never managed to generate. But there’s more. Streamers and theaters now face a common threat. According to Deloitte’s latest “Tech Trends” report, 57% of young people prefer watching video content on free or social platforms over every other form of audiovisual experience — cinema, streaming, and gaming combined. Even video games are under pressure: we are seeing a generation of gamers smaller than the one before, as audiences increasingly choose to watch a handful of players on YouTube or Twitch rather than play themselves. The reality is that all premium creative models in the moving-image space are being disrupted by low-cost ones, powered by AI, free platforms, and new forms of piracy. Even YouTube, which appears triumphant today, cannot be entirely confident about its future as we witness the rise of AI. In this landscape, facing a shared threat, streamers and theaters have more in common than they think, starting with their most precious asset: regular audiences. Studies show that the more streaming subscriptions people have, the more often they go to the cinema, and vice versa. That’s precisely what both streamers and theaters need most: audiences who choose to watch films and series over other forms of video content. \n\t\n\n\tThere’s actually been alliances formed in France between streaming services and TV groups.\n\n\tYes, absolutely. The recent distribution deals between TF1 and Netflix, and between France Télévisions and Amazon Prime Video, are good news for both cinema and series. When the value of linear broadcasting declines sharply, it becomes essential to forge alliances with native digital players — but these platforms, in turn, have much to learn from the advertising expertise of strong private broadcasters, and from the audience engagement cultivated by major public ones. It shows once again that different models are not necessarily in opposition — and that those who thrive on framing divisions may, in the end, find themselves standing alone. I’m not making a political point here.\n\n\tBut Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have also lodged an appeal to the France’s Council of State over windowing rules which force them to wait 15 to 17 months to access films after their theatrical release. What’s the latest with that? \n\n\tTheir complaint doesn’t target the rules themselves, but rather a specific extension that has not yet met their request to move up in the release window — it’s quite different. They are not questioning the system as a whole — at least not in France, where their legal approach remains less aggressive than in other parts of Europe. From my understanding, their aim is to advance the discussion about their own positioning within the French release window system. What they dispute is the temporary outcome of a specific negotiation with industry organizations, which have not yet responded to their proposal — a negotiation that is entirely theirs to pursue. I would note that Disney+ has successfully completed such a negotiation, with its window shortened from 17 months to 9 months in exchange for additional investment in French cinema. That alone shows that the discussion remains open.\n\n\tDon’t you think that the French windowing system is increasingly obsolete? \n\n\tOn the contrary, I believe it is more relevant than ever. Our windowing system — which Tom Rothman, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures, recently praised — serves two essential purposes. The first, as I’ve already mentioned, is to protect theaters during the crucial first weeks of release. In France, films benefit from a four-month exclusive theatrical window. As a direct result, France has the densest network of theaters in the world: 90% of the population lives less than thirty minutes from a theater, and for the remaining 10%, they are itinerant circuits ensuring that no region becomes a “cinema desert”. This is a major reason why cinema remains such a deeply rooted part of everyday life in France. Every village wants to have its school, its bakery — and its cinema! The second purpose is to secure film financing through a clearly defined sequence of exclusive windows. Since filmmaking is both costly and complex, the French model structures a film’s life cycle to reflect levels of investment — allowing those who contribute the most to appear earliest in the chronology, and those who follow to participate proportionally.\n\t\n\n\tThe French box office has suffered in 2025. It’s been down compared with last year. What happened in your opinion?\n\n\tWe’ve just come off a strong year in 2024, with 182 million admissions — a drop of only 15% compared to 2019, while global theatrical attendance declined by 40% over the same period. We had an excellent slate of films, including French productions, which captured a 44% market share — twice Italy’s 22%, and six times the UK’s 7%. This shows that our model continues to produce films that truly resonate with audiences. The same is true for television: last year, 100% of the highest-rated prime-time dramas were French. That said, the beginning of this year has been more challenging, as we’ve had a double effect from lower output of American and French films. So our message to Hollywood is simple: send us more films — great films, and a greater variety of them! And the same goes for French producers. France isn’t just a country accustomed to cinema — it’s a country passionate about it. It’s in the DNA of the French to go to the movies whenever there are films they want to see. We just need those films to exist. Having said that, I’m working on a plan to bring admissions back up to 200 million — close to our pre-pandemic level.\n\n\tHow do you plan to achieve that goal of getting moviegoing back to 200 million admissions in the next couple years?\n\n\tFirst, we must continue to offer a genuine diversity of films, from France and beyond, for every audience and every taste. In this respect, France is one of the few countries capable of producing such a wide range of cinema: dramas, comedies, historical epics, action and adventure films, romantic comedies, thrillers, and genre films… Second, we must keep protecting and supporting our movie theaters. We feel very strongly that cinemas are local cultural landmarks, deeply rooted in the daily life of our communities. Third, we need to be far more proactive in what we call in France éducation aux images — film literacy, or education to screens through cinema. For forty years, a national program has enabled 80,000 teachers to take 2 million students — from kindergarten through high school — to the cinema three times a year. Every study confirms its extraordinary impact. When you give a six-year-old the experience of the big screen, you can spark an emotion that lasts a lifetime. Exhibitors love it, too, because it benefits them in both the short and long term. These screenings take place when theaters are least busy, with reduced tickets funded by the state and local authorities — and in the long run, those children become their audiences of tomorrow. Today, only 15% of our young people experience this program each year. Our goal is to raise that to 30% in the next few years — and ultimately, to reach every child in France.\n\t\n\n\tYou’re about to travel to the U.S. on your first official visit there since you took the helm of the CNC. Why was it important for the CNC to become a partner of TAFF?\n\n\tI’m very happy to be back in the United States for the first time since becoming President of the CNC. I spent four years in New York in my previous role and often traveled to Los Angeles, where I had a team and established a branch of Villa Albertine — France’s network of creative residencies I created across the United States. I’ve come to Los Angeles first and foremost for the TAFFF, which has been running since 1997. Its name has evolved over time, but its core mission remains the same: to promote French cinema in the United States. In Europe, American films account for 60% of the box office, while European films represent barely 1% of the U.S. box office — and, of course, France’s share is even smaller. By joining forces with the DGA, the MPA, the WGA, and the SACEM — the French society of authors, composers and music publishers — which are behind the TAFF, the CNC, together with Unifrance, aims to strengthen connections between our industries and foster in-depth dialogue on the major challenges we face today. I personally believe that our ties are stronger than political stances or legal disputes. When France and the United States talk about cinema, it’s not just two countries discussing business or creative interests — it’s the two nations that invented cinema and shared it with the world, coming together to help shape its future.\n\n\tBesides showcasing French movies and series, I know you’re also looking to promote French locations and facilities to American producers at TAFF.\n\n\tIn just a few years, there was a lot of change in France. The France of today is no longer the one you once knew — the country you went to for a holiday after a film shoot, rather than a place to actually make one. Our strengths now go far beyond our tax incentive — though it remains one of the most attractive in the world, offering up to a 40% credit with no annual cap. Five years ago, President Macron launched an ambitious plan, “France 2030,” to double our training and production capacity. That plan is now nearing completion, and the transformation it has brought is already remarkable. As part of this year’s TAFF, we’ll highlight two case studies that embody this renewal: “Head of State,” one of Amazon Prime’s biggest global hits, which was largely filmed in France, and “Father Mother Sister Brother,” winner of the Golden Lion. Jim Jarmusch will also join us to share his experience shooting in France.\n\t\n\n\tYou’ll also talk about how France can bring financial support to independent American cinema besides hosting shoots, right?\n\n\tIn recent years, the sustainability of mid-budget dramas has become an existential issue in the United States. Finding a viable economic model for these films — which are neither the blockbusters sought after by platforms nor small independent productions, but ambitious works that aim to reach a wide audience — has become increasingly complex. France firmly believes in these films. They are precisely the kind of projects we’ve been welcoming recently — and we hope to see more in the years ahead. I’m thinking of “The Substance,” made for €22 million, and “Emilia Perez,” for €26 million — figures my American friends never believe when I mention them, assuming the budgets were at least twice as high. To put it another way, our goal is not to attract the next Marvel productions, but to be the preferred partner of American independent cinema. Jim Jarmusch — whose latest film was partly shot in Paris — embodies this vision perfectly, and I’m delighted that he’s expressed his desire to work even more closely with France in the future.\n\n\tPresident Trump has recently threatened to put in place tariffs on films produced overseas. What do you think of that threat and do you anticipate that it will refrain some producers from coming to France?\n\n\tIt seems to me that the logic behind this statement applies more to the car industry than to the film industry — but since it’s the second time we’ve heard it, no one is taking it lightly. It comes with real risks: American professionals could find themselves caught between an impossible financial equation and potential retaliatory measures. I completely understand Michael Mann’s position when he says, “I want to shoot in Los Angeles — you have to help me make that possible.” This isn’t about taxing films; it’s about improving tax incentives, and ideally creating one at the federal level. From France’s perspective, again, we’re not trying to attract the next “Avengers” or “Spider-Man.” Rather, we just believe there are specific projects for which shooting in France makes perfect sense — and we’re working hard to make that both technically and financially appealing. It’s also worth noting that 80% of our film production remains national. And it’s precisely by strengthening the international reach of our domestic production that we’ve raised our crews to world-class standards — without relying solely on projects from abroad. In other words, the unique vitality of our homegrown production ensures a healthy, resilient, and dynamic environment for international shoots, with consistently high activity levels regardless of market fluctuations. And we have some of the very best line producers in the world. You should try them!\n\t\n\n\tTilly Norwood crystallized a lot of fears around AI in the U.S. earlier this month. But it seems that there isn’t that much concern over AI in France. Why is that do you think?\n\n\tThe reason is simple. When you’re a market like France — not the United States — being competitive has always been an obsession. It goes back to the “Nouvelle Vague,” when filmmakers learned to create masterpieces on a shoestring budget. That’s why, in France, we didn’t wait for AI to learn how to do more with less — it’s been our hallmark since the 1950s. So when people in the U.S. were talking excitedly about OpenAI, saying, “It’s a revolution — we can now make an animated film for only $30 million,” it made us smile. We made “Flow,” with Latvian partners, for under $4 million — and it won an Oscar. There’s no AI in “Flow,” yet it made animation history. The second reason is that we’re not AI-averse — quite the opposite. The question isn’t whether we’re for or against it; it’s already here. What matters is embracing it fully, but with transparency and responsibility — so that we don’t lose ourselves in the process. Otherwise, the risk we face is nothing less than the collapse of our creative model.\n\n\tCan you elaborate on the model collapse and the reason why you view it as the biggest danger with AI?\n\n\tHave you seen “The Substance”? If we fail to keep creators at the heart of creation, and let AI content feed endlessly on itself, we’ll inevitably end up with increasingly repetitive models — and images that all look the same. In that sense, AI in cinema could well become like the monster in The Substance. It’s tempting. We want to try it. It promises youth, perfection, and infinite productivity — just as The Substance promised an improved, half-dead version of Elisabeth Sparkle. But we know how that story ends. The creature we believe we can control ends up devouring its model — bursting through its Botoxed seams, spawning ever more grotesque copies of itself. That is the danger of generative AI: once it begins feeding on its own output, it distorts, collapses inward, and turns into emptiness. So once again, I believe that today — and this is the real global battle — there are those who still believe in cinema, and those who no longer do. Those who remember that cinema is, first and foremost, an art form — and those who are content to see it merely as another audiovisual sub-product. The former — those who still believe in cinema — understand what AI can offer, but they also know that safeguards are essential. Under those conditions, cinema may yet enter a new creative era — surviving the streaming age just as it survived the TV and VHS revolutions.\n",

Bader was discovered by neighbors and appeared \"not to be breathing.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The spokesperson also said first responders performed life-saving measures on Bader, and continued when medical personnel arrived. Reed added Bader was eventually taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n      \n\n          The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner will determine the final cause of death, but as of now, authorities haven't ruled out anything -- and that includes foul play.\n      \n    \n          As you know ... the content creator tragically passed away October 23. His girlfriend, Reem, shared the sad news in an emotional tribute to Ben, saying, \"Ben was the kindest, most caring, most generous person I have ever met in my entire life ... He genuinely loved every single person that he met and he was so positive all the time.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to Reem, the death was \"extremely sudden.\"\n      \n    \n          In a statement to TMZ ... the Upham and Bader family remember him as a \"visionary who led with love, lived with intention, and turned his passions into helping others.\"\n      \n    \n          He was 25.\n      \n    \n          RIP\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                TikTok\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Influencers\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

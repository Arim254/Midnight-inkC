    "body": "\n\tIf you’ve ever wondered what happened to Alice after she grew up and left Wonderland, or had a sneaking suspicion that the Lewis Carroll fantasy takes place in the same universe as “Peter Pan,” the new musical stage play “Alice in Neverland” will answer your queries and confirm your intuitions.\n\n\tThe play, featuring book, music and lyrics by Phil Kenny and Reston Williams and directed by Catie Davis, takes place between the events of “Alice in Wonderland” and “Peter Pan.” It follows a grown-up Alice who, bored and disillusioned with adulthood, escapes to Neverland to try and recapture her childlike vivacity. As the lines between reality and fantasy start to blur, though, the wish to never grow up takes on dangerous new meanings.\n\t\n\n\t“Alice In Neverland” will host an invite-only industry presentations at New York’s New 42 Studios on Nov. 6-7. The presentation is being produced by Hal Luftig, Kevin Connor, Jamie deRoy and 42nd.club.\n\n\n\tThe performance features choreography by Dominique Kelley, puppet design by Nicholas Mahon, music supervision by Kris Kukul and music direction by Adam Laird. The reading cast includes Jane Bruce as Alice, Akron Watson as James, Jake Pedersen as Peter, Jackera Davis as Tinker Bell, Beth Leavel as the Queen of Hearts and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe first teaser has been unveiled for “Early Days,” a Mumbai-set drama about the perils of influencer culture that will world premiere at the Red Sea International Film Festival. \n\n\tThe India-Singapore co-production, directed by feature directorial debutant Priyankar Patra, has been selected for the festival’s New Visions Competition, which runs Dec. 4-13 in Jeddah.\n\n\tThe film marks a timely exploration of digital-age relationships, following a young couple thrust into social media visibility as they navigate love, ambition and economic survival in India’s most expensive city. Blending cinematic realism with the visual language of social media, “Early Days” captures what Patra describes as “what happens when life itself becomes performance.”\n\t\n\n\t“I wanted to tell a story that feels intimate but universal,” said Patra, whose previous credits include producing several international festival titles under the For Films banner.\n\n\n\tThe project is executive produced by Aditya Vikram Sengupta, whose films “Labour of Love” won an award at Venice, while “Once Upon A Time In Calcutta,” where Patra was one of the producers, premiered there.  Co-producers Isabella Sreyashii Sen and Olivier Dock, co-CEOs of Singapore’s Hazelnut Media, bring global distribution expertise to the project.\n\n\t“Priyankar’s voice is distinct and urgent,” Sengupta said. “This film captures our times with empathy and sharp observation.”\n\n\tThe cast features newcomers Manasi Kaushik and Sarthak Sharma, with a creative team including editor-producer-composer Anupam Sinha Roy, sound designer Sukrit Sen and production designer Sayanika Mukherjee. Patra shot the film. \n\t\n\n\tSen and Dock said they were drawn to how the film “interrogates the human cost of online aspiration —it’s both a deeply personal story and a quietly incisive social portrait.”\n\n\tFor Films, based in Mumbai, focuses on character-driven cinema exploring intersections of technology, emotion and modern Indian life. Hazelnut Media specializes in impact production with a focus on cross-cultural storytelling.\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRithy Panh can credibly hold the title of both Cambodia’s most important film director and one of the greatest documentarians alive. A survivor of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime that claimed the lives of his family members, he began studying filmmaking in France before returning to his native country in the late 1980s. His nonfiction output largely focuses on the aftermath of the Cambodian genocide and moves fluidly between brutally direct vérité (“S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine,” 2003), archival material (“Irradiated,” 2020) and, in the case of the his most celebrated film “The Missing Picture” (2013), claymation. With his most recent film, “We Are the Fruits of the Forest,” Panh opts for a more restrained but still incisive approach to the plight of a specific group of downtrodden people in his nation’s present.\n\t\n\n\tAfter a brief drone shot over the trees, “We Are the Fruits of the Forest” begins with Panh’s main recurring formal gambit for this particular project: a split screen presentation of silent black-and-white archival footage. The subject in both that found material and his film at large is the Bunong people, an indigenous ethnic group living in the highlands of northeastern Cambodia. Historically, they have grown large-grain rice in mountain forests, clearing sections of trees to create fields according to their ancestral ceremonies and offerings. By the 21st century, the Bunong have become beholden to the demands of companies seeking to access their cultivations, forcing them to harvest and clear forests at a much more rapid pace and take on additional products like cassava, rubber and honey.\n\t\n\n\tPanh’s contemporaneously shot footage forms the bulk of “We Are the Fruits of the Forest,” remaining focused on the inhabitants of what appears to be one unnamed village as they cycle through the various duties needed to maintain their already precarious status. Though there are scenes reflecting a more relaxed way of life, including a few of the village children watching an action movie on a cellphone, the vast majority of sequences take place without any obvious visual signifiers of a more putatively modern world.\n\n\tTo convey that, “We Are the Fruits of the Forest” relies equally on extensive voiceover. Though no specific credits are provided, it seems that one single male voice is used to represent the anxieties of his village, if not his entire people as a whole. It is his words that are used to contextualize the images of work on screen, explaining various customs and the animist beliefs that govern their society. Also addressed are the various classifications of forests that the Bunong may or may not work in, the increasingly predatory bank loans that they must rely on as their crop yields become ever poorer, and the racist insults that wider Cambodian society uses to refer to them. The man occasionally mentions his father, but his words are generally used in an explanatory manner, informed by a deserved pride in his people’s work and understandable concerns about their future.\n\n\tSuch a monovocal approach, especially considering that little of the frequently heard dialogue between the village people is actually subtitled, does run the risk of being repetitive, as the same problems surrounding each facet of the Bunong people’s lives are evoked again and again. But there’s an elegance to Panh’s rhythms and his focus on the many faces of the village that continually proves of interest. Even as this might be Panh’s first nonfiction film to avoid even a glancing reference to the Khmer Rouge, the numerous references to modern capitalism’s erosion of Bunong customs (including some of their people’s adoption of Christianity) ensures that this new focus for Panh is by no means a lighter or less urgent topic.\n\n\tAll this, of course, is tied back into Panh’s use of archival footage. While past and present are juxtaposed less frequently than might be expected, the material is used in an overtly poetic manner, offering brief glimpses of a previous way of life. Most strikingly, the same image is often displayed in both frames, as if to suggest a double vision that seeks to divine a greater understanding of these long-gone figures and landscapes. Woven throughout “We Are the Fruits of the Forest” is an image of a topless Bunong woman, often shown in a brief flash that intrudes into the present. Whether this is meant as a literalization of the spirits of the forest or (as suggested by the voiceover) a bad omen is left up to interpretation, but it captures the vivid past and present lives of these people, and how quickly modern forces can cause them to fade away.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the Tokyo International Film Festival’s TIFF Lounge, two of world cinema’s most distinctive voices — Cambodia’s Rithy Panh and Japan’s Miyake Sho — shared the stage for a conversation about filmmaking, memory, and work. Panh, speaking in French, served as president of the Locarno Film Festival jury that awarded Miyake’s “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” the Golden Leopard earlier this year. Miyake responded in Japanese.\n\n\tPanh said he was pleased to see Miyake again after Locarno and recalled that the jury had been unanimous. “That doesn’t happen often,” he said. “I don’t usually watch many films, but this one impressed me. It speaks about solitude and the beauty of everyday gestures. When a director places the camera where human grace appears, that’s cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tMiyake said the film was based on stories by manga artist Yoshiharu Tsuge, but that its real focus came from working with contemporary actors. “We can only film them as they are now — their 2025 selves,” he said. “Ten years later, that version of them will be gone. I want to record what can only exist in this moment.”\n\n\n\tPanh said the film reminded him of his work in Africa, when he filmed the Dogon people and learned the word dama, meaning divine grace. “In every person there is a light,” he said. “When the camera finds it, we see beauty at every level of human life.”\n\n\tMiyake thanked him and urged audiences to watch the film in theaters. “It’s a beautiful film,” he said of “Two Seasons, Two Strangers.” “Editing, lighting, acting and time are all in harmony.”\n\t\n\n\tTurning to Panh’s new work “We Are the Fruits of the Forest,” which world premiered in Tokyo, the director described it as “a political film about capitalism’s destruction of nature and communities. It’s about gestures of work, survival and dignity.” He said that for the forest’s ethnic minorities, “the earth, the spirit, the trees, the wind and the sun are vital.” The film, he said, depicts their resistance to the modern economy through the physical acts of labor.\n\n\tMiyake said those ideas resonated with him and recalled his grandfather in Hokkaido, who had worked as both a farmer and a coal miner. “I wanted to film his hands but never did,” he said. “Your film reminded me of what I lost and why I wanted to film in the first place.”\n\n\tBoth reflected on how viewing habits have changed. “Now everyone watches the small screen,” Panh said. “Each episode lasts about as long as two subway stops.” Miyake added, “We’re not criticizing that format, but what we do is different. We’re making full meals, not snacks.”\n\n\tPanh said he was planning to shoot his next project on Super 8 film, describing that choice as a protest against the dominance of mini digital formats. “Whether anyone sees it or not, I don’t know,” he said. “If no one watches, maybe I’ll open a fast-food restaurant instead.”\n\n\tDiscussing recurring themes in his own work, Panh said that while he often revisits the Khmer Rouge period, it remains part of his life story. “Cinema saved me,” he said. “I’m the only Cambodian filmmaker who has worked on that memory, but I also keep searching for new cinematic forms and viewpoints.”\n\n\tWhen asked about the meaning of work, Miyake said that every kind of labor — even the hardest — had taught him something. “It’s experience more than work,” he said. “Experience shapes us.” Panh said he had worked all his life, sometimes by force, sometimes by choice. “I’ve said I want to stop,” he said. “My wife says, ‘You’ll never stop.’ Maybe she’s right.”\n\n\tPanh said that teaching cinema was another way of learning. “Empathy — the attention we give to the weakest — is a political act,” he said. “I often get angry. The world isn’t simple. But I try to stay calm and think of something positive every day. That’s my definition of work: to keep learning and to keep hope.”\n\t\n\n\tMiyake said, “I don’t know if anyone will watch my next film. But if one film can still reach someone with empathy, that’s enough reason to continue.”\n\n\t“Two Seasons, Two Strangers” opens in Japan next week. \n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen the “Shogun” team gathered in a Washington, D.C. hotel room last February, champagne in hand, counting down to the show’s global release, producer Miyagawa Eriko wrestled with the TV settings and watched the clock tick toward launch. “That moment when something you’ve poured years of your life into finally goes out into the world, I thought, perhaps this is what feels like to send a child off to college, that mix of pride, terror and love,” she recalled during her keynote address at the MPA seminar at the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tThe emotional moment came as the culmination of a full-circle journey for Miyagawa, who had returned to D.C. to screen episodes at MPA headquarters just before the series launched. For the Yokohama native who graduated from Georgetown University in 2002, the nation’s capital represented where her “international adventure began.” Twenty-two years later, she was back presenting “a Japanese jidaigeki, a period drama born of genuine cross-cultural collaboration.”\n\n\n\tThe event took on added significance when a deputy chief of mission at the Embassy of Japan shared how the original 1980 “Shogun” miniseries had become an unexpected diplomatic tool when he was a teenager living in the U.S. “Americans were captivated by stories in a faraway land with unfamiliar customs and codes,” Miyagawa recounted. “Many of his classmates had a crush on Shimada Yoko.”\n\n\tThe anecdote resonated with Miyagawa’s own childhood experience of cross-cultural connection. When her family moved to Dubai for her father’s work, she befriended a Dutch neighbor girl despite sharing no common language. “One day, my father put on the VHS of ‘Alice in Wonderland.’ I remember sitting side by side with that girl giggling at the Mad Hatter’s unbirthday party. We didn’t need words, we just needed story,” she said. “That small moment of connection stayed with me and became, I think, the seed of everything.”\n\t\n\n\tMiyagawa’s career trajectory reads like a masterclass in bridging Hollywood and Japanese cinema. Her first job out of college was translating on the set of “Kill Bill: Vol. 1,” where she was stunned by the scale and international collaboration. “The crew came from all over the world — U.S., Japan, China, Hong Kong, Australia, Canada. It was a beautiful chaos, and I felt completely at home,” she said.\n\n\tWorking on Martin Scorsese’s “Silence,” a passion project decades in the making, proved formative. Traveling with the legendary director to Nagasaki, Miyagawa was struck not by his fame but his humility. “Despite being an auteur, he approached the material like a student. He surrounded himself with historians, priests and cultural advisors, not to verify facts, but to seek understanding. He listened, he asked and kept asking. And that openness, that curiosity, stayed with me.”\n\n\tWhen Miyagawa joined FX’s “Shogun” after “Silence” was released, the timing proved prescient. The series, based on James Clavell’s 1975 novel previously adapted into the 1980 miniseries, found passionate champions in FX leadership John Landgraf and Gina Balian, who brought on co-creators Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo to reinvent the story for contemporary audiences.\n\n\t“In one acceptance speech, Justin joked that he still couldn’t quite believe FX had greenlit a very expensive subtitled Japanese period drama whose central climax revolves around a poetry competition,” Miyagawa said.\n\n\tWhile many applauded FX for taking such a gamble, Miyagawa prefers a different framing. “I like to think of John and Gina as reading the direction of the wind, waiting for the right moment and striking. The timing was remarkable. COVID accelerated the rise of global streaming. Audiences became more and more adventurous, willing to read subtitles, hungry for good stories, wherever they came from.”\n\n\tThat shift brought deeper responsibility toward authenticity, which Miyagawa described as “a process, one that requires patience, curiosity and respect. Every hairstyle, every sleeve pattern, every historical gesture, was discussed in English, discussed in Japanese, and often returned to English again. Every line of dialogue was translated, polished, retranslated, repolished by writers, translators, historians, playwrights, producers and actors.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production became its own cultural conversation. “If you visited our set, you would have seen crew from five continents, sharing bento and donuts, carefully wearing food covers so as not to damage the county lands. We weren’t just making a story about cultural exchange. We were living it.”\n\n\tReflecting on her career, Miyagawa revealed: “I’ve realized something — I’ve never worked on a show that didn’t require translation. My entire career has been one long experiment in translation, not just of language, but of worldview. From ‘Kill Bill’ to ‘Silence’ to ‘Shogun,’ I’ve lived at the crossroads where Hollywood ambition meets Japanese precision and where misunderstanding, treated kindly, can turn into magic.”\n\n\tAsked about creating epic storytelling, Miyagawa rejected the expected answers about budgets and scale. “The truth is, I think an epic story isn’t about how big we can make something. I think it’s about how many hearts it can belong to. Every true epic story I’ve been part of began the same way, with people from different worlds meeting in the same creative space, figuring out what the common language is, finding the story they’re trying to tell — curiosity, empathy and courage.”\n\n\tThough “Shogun” could not be filmed in Japan due to logistical reasos, Miyagawa hasn’t ruled out the show returning to the land where it is set for future seasons.\n\n\tShe concluded with a rallying cry: “Let’s keep making the kinds of stories no single culture could imagine alone.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Reel World Entertainment has unveiled the teaser for “Chatha Pacha: The Ring of Rowdies.”\n\n\tThe teaser offers a glimpse into the film’s chaotic world centered on the southern Indian state of Kerala’s WWE-style wrestling culture. Headlined by Roshan Mathew (Busan winner “Paradise”) and Arjun Ashokan (“Bramayugam”), the ensemble cast also features Vishak Nair (“Officer on Duty”) and Ishan Shoukath (“Marco”).\n\t\n\n\tFirst-time director Adhvaith Nayar helms the project, with creative producer Shihan Shoukath leading the charge under the Reel World Entertainment banner alongside Ritesh and Ramesh S. Ramakrishnan.\n\n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew, including director of photography Anend C. Chandran, action choreographer Kalai Kingson, lyricist Vinayak Sasikumar, and composer Mujeeb Majeed. Sanoop Thykoodam penned the screenplay, with Praveen Prabhakar handling editing.\n\n\tIn a significant coup for the film, celebrated Bollywood composer trio Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy are making their Malayalam cinema debut with the soundtrack, with music rights held by T-Series.\n\n\tThe film, which is in the Malayalam language and will also release in several other Indian languages, has secured an expansive distribution network. In Kerala, Dulquer Salmaan’s Wayfarer Films will handle the release. PVR Inox Pictures has come aboard for Tamil Nadu and Karnataka distribution, while leading players are reportedly in final negotiations for Telugu and Hindi language rights. The Plot Pictures will manage international distribution.\n\n\t“We’ve spent the last two years building ‘Chatha Pacha’ from the ground up, and in that time, it’s grown from a scrappy underdog idea into a full-blown world we’ve poured our hearts into,” said producer Shihan Shoukath. “It’s loud, chaotic, full of emotion, and rooted deeply in the culture we love, but it’s also wild and genre-bending in a way that hopefully feels new.”\n\t\n\n\tRoshan Mathew added, “‘Chatha Pacha’ is unlike anything I’ve done before. The best part is, I think that’s true for most of us who are part of this film. It really is a uniquely mad idea.”\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tYash Raj Films is bringing a treasure trove of Bollywood classics to Netflix in a major partnership that will make the storied studio’s catalog available to streaming subscribers worldwide.\n\n\tThe collaboration will see YRF titles released in strategic phases tied to festivals, special occasions, and cinematic milestones, allowing fans across the globe to access beloved Hindi films from home.\n\n\n\tThe rollout kicks off Nov. 1 — timed to Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan‘s birthday — with nine of the superstar’s most iconic YRF films, including “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” “Mohabbatein,” “Dil Toh Pagal Hai,” “Veer Zara,” and “Chak De India.”\n\t\n\n\tAdditional classic titles such as Sridevi starrer “Chandni” and “Lamhe,” Amitabh Bachchan’s “Kabhi Kabhie” and “Silsila,” and Anil Kapoor’s “Vijay,” will become available starting Nov. 14.\n\n\n\tThe holiday season will see a daily release schedule, with 34 films — including “Bunty Aur Babli,” “Hum Tum,” “Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic,” “Mujhse Dosti Karoge,” and “Ta Ra Rum Pum” — premiering two per day from Dec. 12 to 28.

    "body": "\n\tA music documentary built entirely around one song sounds like a precious affair, but it can be a tantalizing one if the song is right. The one-song doc has now emerged as a genre, and in a small way it’s an exciting one. I dug “The Greatest Night in Pop” (2024), about the creation of “We Are the World” (though that was obviously an anomaly of a song), and also “Hallelujah: Leonard Cohen, a Journey, a Song” (2021), which explored how a tune that wasn’t even all that wonderful in the original recorded version could evolve, over time, into a transcendent global hymn.\n\t\n\n\tThe latest one-song music doc, Rick Korn’s “Harry Chapin — Cat’s in the Cradle: The Song That Changed Our Lives,” feels like it was influenced by the Cohen film. It, too, captures a song that became a hymn, one that grew larger than the artist who recorded it ever imagined, becoming part of the story of its time.\n\n\n\tYet the film’s title throws down a bit of a gauntlet. Was Harry Chapin’s “Cat’s in the Cradle” really the song that changed our lives? Having seen the movie, my short answer is yes. I mean, it’s not the only song that did that. Looking back, though, I think it changed mine, and I think it changed a lot of people’s. But not because we thought of it that way. It changed our lives because its message, for a pop song, was so original, so tender yet searing, so defining of the experience of both parents and children that you drank in the song’s plainspoken beauty, you thought about the story it was telling, and it had this weirdly large effect. Even if you first heard it as a teenager, as I did, it made you say two things to yourself: that I’m going to be a better parent than that; and that maybe I won’t. That’s the song’s enticing double meaning.\n\t\n\n\tIn 1974, Harry Chapin was an internationally known folk-rock singer with a nimbus of wavy thick hair and a cleft chin and a handsome geek grin and the voice of a romantic minstrel. He looked more like a ’70s movie actor, or the lost bohemian Kennedy brother, than a pop star (and, in fact, Chapin had worked in movies, getting nominated for an Oscar for “Legendary Champions,” a 1968 documentary about boxing that he directed). Chapin sang story-songs, drawn from his experience, that he presented as parables — like his first hit, “Taxi,” about driving a cab and picking up an old flame from his youth as a fare, and in six minutes that encounter becomes a journey through his life that’s worthy of James Joyce, or at least a great acid trip.\n\n\tChapin was earnest to a fault, but his brainy charisma made him a sexy troubadour. He was something old and new at the same time: a folk singer, but one who’d come up through the paradigm shift of the singer-songwriter boom, so his populist music was infused with a very particular sort of 1970s therapeutic confessional spirit. “Cat’s in the Cradle” was the lead single off his fourth album, “Verities & Balderdash,” and it took two months to become number one in the country. It struck a chord. In “The Song That Changed Our Lives,” we hear testimonials from an array of musicians who talk about their experience of it, from Darryl “D.M.C.” McDaniels to Billy Joel to Judy Collins to Pat Benatar to Dee Snider, who grew up as the ultimate head-banging delinquent and makes a funny point of saying, “I hated acoustic. I hated anything mellow.” But Harry Chapin spoke to him.\n\n\t“Cat’s in the Cradle” is built around an incredibly subtle and powerful psychological insight: that what we pass on to our children, the good and the bad and everything in between, happens in a karmic way. We don’t control it. Yet maybe we can guide it, even as it’s guiding us. The song tells the story of a father who has a son, who looks up to him and wants to spend time with him (“I’m gonna be like you, dad, you know I’m gonna be like you”). But the father never seems to have the time, and that’s how their relationship goes. A few verses later, the son is grown, and the father asks to see him, only now the son doesn’t have time for him. The key lines in the song would seem to be, “And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me, he’d grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.”\n\t\n\n\tYou could say the message is: As a parent, you reap what you sow. Yet part of the spellbinding quality of “Cat’s in the Cradle,” apart from what Chapin’s musician brother Steve calls the “Appalachian” modalities of its opening chords (he’s right — the song seems to emerge from some ancient folk wilderness) as well as the lyricism of the melody, is how Chapin’s voice somehow expresses both points-of-view at once. It has an edge of wounded defiance (the son wanting to know why his father wasn’t there for him). At the same time, there’s a sadness threaded through it, a stoic heartbreak that unites these two more than the time they should have spent together.\n\n\tThose of us who grew up with fathers who weren’t there for us tended to feel, at the time, like we were the only ones on the planet who had this problem. But “Cat’s in the Cradle” blasted a message out into the world: “No, children of the ’70s with daddy issues, you are not alone. And part of the club you’re in includes…the daddies themselves.” That was the mind-blower.\n\n\tIt will come as a revelation to many who watch “The Song That Changed Our Lives” that the groundbreaking lyrics of “Cat’s in the Cradle” were written by Chapin’s wife, Sandy, who is interviewed in the film (she’s a feisty 91). But, in fact, this was something Chapin talked about effusively at the time, to the point that it almost seemed part of the politics of their relationship. He was a loving husband and, back then, a “new male.” It’s not just that he gave credit; I think it was his way of acknowledging that there was something different about the song’s vantage. I wish the documentary had made more of a point of this — of exploring how and why this particular insight into fathers and sons came from a woman. I also wish the movie had mentioned how the villain of the song, if you really look at it, might be late capitalism. The father isn’t a bad guy; his son isn’t a bad guy. But no one has the time! That’s partly because, increasingly in our society, no one did (or does).\n\n\tBut, of course, that’s only part of the meaning, because the real meaning is that as a parent, even as you feel that you don’t “have the time” to be spending enough time with your kids, that is always a lame excuse. As the Beatles taught us, the love you take is equal to the love you make. As Harry and Sandy Chapin taught us, the time you have for your kids is the time you create out of your desire to be with them.\n\t\n\n\tEven Harry himself didn’t always have the time. The film kind of buries the lead by saluting his extensive charity work, then sneaking in the point that he was doing 100 benefits a year, in addition to 100 shows of his own, which meant that he was away from Sandy and his five children (two with Sandy; three adopted from her previous marriage) two out of every three nights of the year. It’s sure nice talking to you, dad! Yet the documentary demonstrates that Chapin’s kids adored him (they’re all interviewed in the film). And the fact that Harry Chapin, who died at 38 in a freak car accident that he nearly prophesized, was a less-than-perfect and even absentee father only completes the cycle of the song. The movie includes a number of YouTube reaction videos, with younger people listening to “Cat’s in the Cradle” for the first time, and their tearful responses tell the song’s real story: that when it comes to parents and children, none of us may ever feel we give enough time, and that that feeling is timeless.\n",

We built the costume together — a little father-son Halloween teamwork.\"\n      \n    \n          But it's pretty clear Justin is giving a nod to Katy ... he mentioned he's \"to his left\" and the left shark was the one most folks remember from her Super Bowl performance.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Bonus points for the homemade costume and the throwback pop culture reference!!!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Katy Perry\n              \n                          \n                Justin Trudeau\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Super Bowl\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Halloween\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

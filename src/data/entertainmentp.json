    "body": "\n\tBollywood star Ranbir Kapoor has praised fellow actor Rani Mukerji‘s three-decade legacy in Indian cinema as the industry rallies around the actor with the upcoming release of “Mardaani 3.”\n\n\t“It is really amazing to see the entire industry come forward to celebrate 30 years of her iconic legacy,” said Kapoor, who co-starred with Mukerji in his 2007 debut “Saawariya.” “I have always felt that Rani is one for the ages, one of the greatest ever actors in India and someone who has defined our industry through her work. Her choice of projects and roles have shaped how women are portrayed on the screen today.”\n\t\n\n\t“Mardaani 3,” where Mukerji returns in the lead role of police officer Shivani Shivaji Roy, will focus on the kidnapping of girls aged 8-9 from low-income communities across India. Directed by Abhiraj Minawala and produced by Aditya Chopra for Yash Raj Films, the film extends the franchise’s examination of crimes against women.\n\n\n\tThe franchise launched in 2014 with “Mardaani,” which centered on human trafficking. “Mardaani 2” followed in 2019, exploring a serial rapist who challenged law enforcement. Mukerji was last seen in critical and commercial success “Mrs. Chatterjee vs. Norway” (2023).\n\n\t“Rani is the co-star of my first film ‘Sawaariya’ and she is the first person who told me that if I worked hard, I would go a long way. I will never forget that interaction because it gave me so much confidence when I needed it the most,” Kapoor said. “I have seen her as a person closely, I have seen her work closely and have been bowled over by her grace, charm and brilliance.”\n\t\n\n\tKapoor added: “Thank you Rani for the movies, the memories, the nostalgia and the powerhouse performances. She is an entertainer who has dedicated her life to make people happy and I don’t have words to describe the impact her films have had on me.”\n\n\t“Mardaani 3” releases Jan. 30. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMedia Partners Asia hosted its first AETHER Summit in Singapore, convening senior executives from telecommunications, media, artificial intelligence, healthcare and investment sectors for discussions on how AI is transitioning from experimental technology to core infrastructure.\n\n\tThe closed-door forum ran at Marina Bay Sands, where industry leaders examined AI’s shift from pilot programs toward capital-intensive, system-level deployment across networks and platforms.\n\t\n\n\tA consensus emerged that the industry’s primary challenge has moved from technical capability to execution at scale. Competitive advantage now hinges on how effectively organizations integrate AI into real-world systems spanning compute infrastructure, connectivity, data management and governance.\n\n\n\t“AI is no longer a tool or a feature. It is a system-level economic force reshaping infrastructure, media, advertising, and experiences end to end,” said Vivek Couto, CEO and executive director of Media Partners Asia. “The defining challenge now is execution and how leaders invest, govern, and scale AI responsibly in environments that touch millions of users.”\n\n\tDiscussions centered on infrastructure’s evolving role in the AI era, with participants examining how global investment is flowing toward compute resources, data centers, networks and energy systems. Infrastructure is increasingly seen as the primary bottleneck shaping AI outcomes.\n\n\tTelecommunications operators are positioning themselves as AI-native platforms. As intelligence embeds across networks and customer service, telcos are moving beyond traditional connectivity to become delivery platforms for AI services including real-time inference, personalization and automation.Success in this transition depends less on accessing advanced models and more on capital allocation, platform architecture and organizational transformation, leaders said.\n\t\n\n\tThe summit tackled AI’s impact on media and entertainment economics. AI production tools are compressing timelines and cutting costs across animation, post-production, marketing and localization, challenging traditional studio and agency advantages.\n\n\tBut declining production costs are flooding the market with content, intensifying competition for attention. Authenticity, creative judgment and taste are emerging as differentiators in an oversaturated landscape.\n\n\tContent libraries are being repositioned as strategic training data for proprietary AI systems, reordering value chains from labor-intensive workflows toward capital-intensive technology infrastructure. The shift raises questions around intellectual property rights and cultural stewardship.\n\n\tParticipants emphasized AI’s expanding role in public services and national development. Leaders discussed population-scale deployments across fraud prevention, digital identity, healthcare, education and citizen engagement.\n\n\tTrust, accountability and governance emerged as critical unresolved constraints. As AI systems become more autonomous, participants stressed the importance of limiting scope, maintaining human oversight and designing for verifiable outcomes.\n\n\tThe summit framed governance as a design challenge requiring early attention rather than a regulatory afterthought.\n\n\tAETHER operated as a closed-door forum, with a CEO session under the Chatham House Rule. Insights have been compiled into the AETHER 2026 Summit Report analyzing AI’s deployment phase and implications for infrastructure and media.\n\n\tJioStar and BytePlus supported the inaugural summit, with research partnership from MPA subsidiary ampd.\n\n\tSpeakers included Uday Shankar, founder and CEO of Bodhi Tree Systems and vice chair of JioStar; Vikram Sinha, president director and CEO of Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison; Simon Fuller, founder of XIX Entertainment; and Vicki Dobbs Beck, VP of immersive content innovation at Lucasfilm/ILM.\n\n\tOther participants were Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at Nvidia; Sharad Devarajan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and co-founder and CEO of Graphic India; Anton Reynaldo Bonifacio, chief AI officer and chief information security officer at Globe Telecom; and Oscar winner Mark Sagar, chief AI officer at FaiBLE Media.\n\t\n\n\tTechnology and investment executives included Ken Xu, solutions architect director at Alibaba Cloud; Jawn Lim, regional head of solution architecture for GenAI at BytePlus; Dr. Wei Chu, chief scientist and co-founder of INF Tech; Pinn Lawjindakul, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners; Guy Piekarz, CEO of Panjaya; Josh Baillon, co-founder of Collective Imagination; Jed Weintrob, CEO and co-founder of 30 Ninjas; and Ulf Ewaldsson, AI-RAN advisor and former president of technology at T-Mobile.\n\n\tRonit Satchi-Fainaro, head of the Gray School of Medical Sciences at Tel Aviv University, also participated.\n\n\tMedia Partners Asia is an independent insights and advisory platform focused on connectivity, entertainment and technology sectors across Asia Pacific. Founded in 2001, MPA operates leadership forums including APOS and AETHER.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEvery Pokémon fan’s childhood dream has come true: PokéPark Kanto, a sprawling Pokémon world, has come to life in Tokyo’s Yomiuri Land amusement park, complete with hundreds of life-sized Pokémon, two rides and countless hidden secrets to discover.\n\n\tOpening Feb. 5, PokéPark Kanto is the world’s first permanent outdoor Pokémon facility. It leads visitors through the Pokémon Forest, crawling with realistic Pokémon you can touch, and into the fictional Sedge Town, home to several stalls with food, games and rides. The first of its kind, PokéPark Kanto puts fans into the video games they grew up with, and its attention to detail and variety of Pokémon would make any casual trainer want to catch ’em all.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter moving through the entrance, fans will instantly recognize Prof. Oak’s lab before setting foot into PokéPark Kanto. The lab is complete with a PC, healing station and three Poké Balls housing starter Pokémon, ripped straight from the original “Red” and “Blue” games. From there, you’re transported to the Pokémon world. After stepping through a giant wooden door, tall grass teems with wild Pokémon, adorable critters strike charming poses and battles break out between fierce opponents. Every tiny detail transports you into a fully realized Poké-universe.\n\n\n\tPikachu and Eevee take center stage in the first area that visitors can explore. Dozens of the fan-favorite Pokémon reside in the grassy habitat, and fans can go off the main path to touch and take photos of the cute creatures. A squad of Pikachus chase each other through the grass, while others stuff themselves with berries or balance them on their tails. One Eevee poses cheek-to-cheek with a Pikachu, another rolls on its back and others share a meal in a circle. There are so many picture-worthy moments in PokéPark Kanto that visitors will want to stroll through slowly and keep their eyes peeled for Pokémon hiding off the beaten path. In just this area, there is a Raticate and Gloom facing off in battle, Bellsprouts sunning their leaves, Starlys roosting in trees, Charjabugs spooking a Pikachu, Aipoms climbing on branches, and much, much more.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGround-type Pokémon take over the next area as the terrain grows a bit more rugged. Digletts pop their heads out of underground holes, as Drilburs and Excadrills burrow in the hillside. A single Cubone stands off on its own, ever the loner. Squirrel-like Skwovets and Greedents hoard their berries and jam their cheeks with food as a Fearow flaps its wings overhead. \n\n\tPast the Pokémon Forest, a pack of Bidoof and Bibarel turn the trees into their stomping — and chomping — grounds. They gnaw on branches and build dens for themselves, even crashing through the wooden path that visitors walk on at one point. After a short detour, visitors will find some cute photo ops with the beavers and even more Pokémon creeping onto the main trail. Slimey Goodras ooze across the route, with some Shroomishes and a Sudowoodo watching from the bushes.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA stampede of Rhyhorns invades the path next, causing visitors to walk around them — or hop on their spiny backs for photos. Rock types, like Geodude and Graveler, smash through next, and a dark tunnel filled with (of course) Zubats awaits. There’s also a Carkol, a minecart-like creature, and a Sableye hoarding some jewels, plus some Pokémon fossils for eagle-eyed explorers. With Sedge Town closing in, Pokémon like Sentret, Furret, Charmander, Charizard, Zorua, Bellossom, Roselia and Budew help bid you farewell to the forest.\n\n\tThe fun doesn’t stop in Sedge Town, though. Even more Pokémon call the town home, and it has two kid-friendly rides, a gym, Pokémon Center and Poké Mart waiting inside. A fountain with water-type starters, including Squirtle, Totodile, Mudkip, Piplup, Oshawott and Froakie, surrounding a Primarina, greets you as you enter. A Chansey is ready to heal wounded creatures inside the Pokémon Center, and a group of Psyducks look confused as Sprigatito and Litten climb their way on top of the Poké Mart. You’ll have to look high and low as Pokémon like Abra, Espurr and Altaria hang out on rooftops, and Shinx, Exeggcute and Vulpix stay close to the ground — there’s even a Kecleon blending into the fence.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere are two rides in PokéPark Kanto: Eevee’s Vee Vee Voyage carousel and Pikachu’s Pika Pika Paradise spinner. Guests can choose to ride their favorite of Eevee’s evolutions, plus Ponyta and Rapidash (and their Galarian forms), on the carousel, and every adorable electric-type powers Pikachu’s spinning ride. Pichu, Raichu, Plusle, Minun, Pachirisu, Emolga, Dedenne, Togedemaru, Morpeko and Pawmi lend their electricity and allow riders to move their cart up and down as they gently spin around.\n\t\n\n\tNext to Pika Pika Paradise is a colorful birthday cake filled with Alcremie, and a Kangaskhan and Dragonite battle as a Fidough chases Eevees nearby. There are plenty of scenes to discover, like Machops lifting beams with Applins on them, a Greninja striking an epic pose against graffiti painted by a Smeargle, a Snivy and Grookey playing on a rooftop, Jigglypuff smiling with a microphone, a Squirtle squad with a Wartortle and Blastoise and many more.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere are a couple more surprises at the end of Sedge Town, including a gym that houses a Pikachu dance show with performers dressed as the lovable mascot. There are 300 seats in the gym, and fans will recognize that each spot has the image of its corresponding Pokémon from the Pokédex. Outside the gym, there’s an epic double battle: a Gyarados and Raichu versus a Garchomp and Tyranitar. The four Pokémon square off against each other, cracking the pavement beneath their feet. Finally, a gift store with exclusive merchandise and hundreds of plushies lies at the very end.\n\n\tPokéPark Kanto is a Pokémon fan’s wildest dream come to life. It’s almost like playing “Pokémon Go” in real life, with hordes of new creatures to discover just a few steps away — and it’ll feel like “Pokémon Snap” with how many photos you’ll want to take. Tickets have dynamic pricing for different dates, ages and park access, ranging from ￥4,700 to￥16,500, once PokéPark Kanto opens on Feb. 5. Everyone from longtime Pokémon trainers who have caught ’em all to casual fans still learning the names of the 1,025 creatures will find something to love in PokéPark Kanto.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Trump renewed his threat to tariff films made overseas on Monday, but also suggested that he would offer “low-interest bonds” to help stimulate domestic production.\n\n\tIn an interview with the New York Post, the president did not explain his proposal but indicated he is still considering the decline in production.\n\n\t“I want to bring the movie business back to Los Angeles in particular,” he said.\n\n\n\tHollywood unions and producers have been lobbying the administration for a year to create a federal film incentive to compete with similar production incentives in the U.K., Canada and elsewhere. Such subsidies are structured as tax credits or rebates that create a steep discount on production costs in particular territories — and not as loans that would have to be paid back.\n\t\n\n\tTrump has twice threatened to impose a 100% tariff on films made abroad, though without explaining how that would work, or what legal authority would allow it.\n\n\t“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” he wrote on Truth Social in May, threatening to movies made in “foreign lands” and setting off a mild panic among filmmakers who work overseas. But when he reiterated the tariff threat in September, the industry responded with a collective shrug.\n\n\t“It’s just hot air again,” one producer told Variety.\n\n\tTrump’s initial threat followed a meeting with actor Jon Voight, whom he had named as one of three “special ambassadors” to Hollywood. Voight and two producer friends, Steven Paul and Scott Karol, developed a plan for the industry that included federal incentives, deductions and tariffs, among other ideas.\n\t\n\n\tTrump has previously endorsed only the tariff idea, but discussed bonds as well in the interview with the new California Post offshoot of the New York Post, which launched Monday.\n\n\t“And so I’m going to put tariffs on and we’re going to be doing bonds, some bonds, some low-interest bonds, for the movie industry. We’ll bring it back,” he told the Post.\n\n\tSen. Adam Schiff and others in Congress have worked on the idea of establishing a federal production incentive. California Gov. Gavin Newsom last year expanded the state’s tax credit for production to $750 million, and challenged Trump to support a federal incentive that would be 10 times as large.\n\n\tHollywood unions have praised Trump’s attention to the issue, but sought to redirect his interest to a more limited goal of extending and reauthorizing federal tax deductions that assist producers.\n\n\tThe Motion Picture Association declined to comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHundreds of protesters marched down Main Street in Park City on Monday during the Sundance Film Festival, chanting anti-ICE slogans and calling for accountability following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis.\n\n\tThe demonstration unfolded during Sundance’s final hurrah in Park City, the Utah ski destination where Robert Redford established the festival in 1981 as a haven for independent cinema. The march marked the most visible escalation of the politically-charged atmosphere at this year’s festival, largely shaped by the growing national backlash to ICE’s weeks-long deployment in Minnesota.\n\t\n\n\t“If we are going to stop our country’s slide toward authoritarianism, each of us must commit to regular, sustained and, most importantly, peaceful resistance,” one volunteer with Utah Overpass Action told the crowd. “We must stay engaged until we can come together and end this national nightmare.”\n\n\n\tAt one point, he asked protestors to observe a brief moment of silence “to recognize and remember the countless human beings who have been abused and killed by ICE over the years.” Demonstrators chanted “Shoot films, not people,” a nod to the ongoing festival screenings and industry events being held right down the street. Other chants included “Abolish ICE,” “Hey hey, ho ho, Trump and ICE have got to go,” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,” while speakers urged attendees to call their senators and push for legislative action.\n\n“Shoot films, not people.” Hundreds of protestors have gathered in Park City in the midst of the Sundance Film Festival to speak out against ICE’s actions in Minneapolis. pic.twitter.com/ljD1eqGID5— Variety (@Variety) January 26, 2026\n\n\n\tJes Vesconte, a U.S.-based activist who led several chants in Park City, said they’re a filmmaker who came of age in Los Angeles, “raised by a community of people shaped by immigrants.”\n\t\n\n\t“They are going after our neighbors — our storytellers,” Vesconte told Variety in front of the crowd. “Fascists go after artists because artists let you know that this world was built by people. It’s imaginary — and that means it can be imagined differently. We have the power to do things differently, and artists help us imagine that world. Journalists, artists, storytellers, activists. All of us.”\n\n\tThroughout the festival, several actors and filmmakers wore ICE Out pins on red carpets and used press appearances to criticize the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Natalie Portman, Olivia Wilde, Will Poulter, Zoey Deutch and Molly Ringwald were among those who spoke out to Variety.\n\n\t“I’m appalled and sickened,” Wilde told Variety on Saturday at the premiere of “The Invite.” “If we can do anything out here to support the movement to cast ICE out — to delegitimize this criminal organization — then that’s what we should be doing.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Vietnam veteran Ed Emanuel wrote the memoir “Soul Patrol” (2003), the gesture could have been likened to that of a marooned man sending out a message in a bottle. Although he’s had a decades-long career in the film industry, Emanuel had lived with troubled memories of serving in the first African American special operations six-man Long-Range Reconnaissance Patrol team. His tour ran from 1968-1969. As profoundly bonded as those men had been in combat, they’d lost touch in the intervening years. He hoped the book would find its way to his compatriots and if so, maybe they’d find their way to him. It did. They did. And the men began having reunions.\n\t\n\n\tIn director J.M. Harper’s haunting, revelatory documentary “Soul Patrol — premiering at the Sundance Film Festival — the veterans gather at a hotel for their final reunion in 2024. The film features Emanuel as well as other “LURP” (as the units were called) fellow team members Thad Givens, John Willis, Lawton Mackey Jr., Norman Reid and Emerson Branch Jr., among others. “Soul Patrol” contributes a little-known chapter to the nation’s understanding of Vietnam War and Black history.\n\n\n\tAs the documentary opens, insect whirs and faint helicopter chuf-chufs mix with a choral hymn. An intertitle offers a quote commiserate with the music’s reverence: “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how,” courtesy of the philosopher Frederick Nietzsche (who will be one of the film’s guiding muses). A handful of soldiers creep cautiously in the shadows while a voiceover narration sets the stage for the harrowing encounter central to the film. In Cu Chi, in the Southeast stronghold of Tay Ninh province, Emanuel had an out-of-body experience that he has grappled with ever since.\n\t\n\n\t“Soul Patrol” shifts to the present-day grocery store, where Emanuel and his partner, Anita Sue Wallace, steer a shopping cart through the aisles. Also wandering (or else patrolling) the store’s aisles beneath the fluorescent blare are a handful of soldiers in combat gear. It’s a creative salvo: employing a cast to represent the figures of Emanuel’s wartime past that have haunted him, including his younger self (played by Myles Simms-Aur), helmeted and carrying an M-16 rifle. That solemn poetry the soldiers recite either aloud or in their thoughts comes by way of Nietzsche.\n\n\tThis is Harper’s second documentary (2024’s “As We Speak,” about the weaponization of hip-hop lyrics in the courts, also premiered at Sundance). He’s proving to be a filmmaker deeply compelled by the intersections of the individual and the institutional. He’s also an experimenter, leaning here into stylized re-creations, but also utilizing that grocery moment to further center Emanuel’s reckoning with a not fully reconcilable past. The rare Super 8 footage, taken by some of the subjects at the time of the tours, lends even more intimacy to their experiences of Vietnam. Along with a cache of their still photos, the personal visual record underscores how impossibly young they were.\n\n\tStanding at the podium that day, Emanuel recalls another of his reasons for writing the book: “Maybe I could free myself of demons and the questions and bad memories I have,” he tells the men and their partners and spouses gathered at their final banquet reunion. It’s an unburdening he offers to his fellow comrades. This meal — everyone dressed to the nines — is just one strand Harper utilizes to braid a complex story of soldiers and citizens (his subjects are both), war overseas and conflict at home (and they suffered both).\n\n\tIn 1968, the war was increasingly unpopular. Protests were growing. This unrest mirrored the ongoing fight for Civil Rights and the rise of the Black Power movement, whose best-known leaders roundly condemned the war. (In 1967, Muhammad Ali had been sentenced to five years for refusing to serve.) But they were not a fringe. Harper makes resonant use of Martin Luther King Jr.’s speeches about the moral implications of America’s incursion into Vietnam.\n\t\n\n\tThe ratio of Black men serving at the time of Emanuel’s tour was 23%. Yet those soldiers’ returns were often met with derision. Two survivors admit that many of the people in their lives had no idea they’d served. The ’60s remains one of the most turbulent periods in modern U.S. history. Emanuel recounts the captain of his flight to Vietnam coming on the PA to tell the soldiers that Bobby Kennedy has been killed.\n\n\tBuilding on the rapport Harper built with his subjects in “As We Speak,” the interviews in “Soul Patrol” brim with trust. The subjects say rending but also disquieting things about killing. In a fine nod to the insights of those who live most intimately with the bedeviled memories of the veterans, Harper convenes their partners, who share with each other their insights and challenges. A takeaway: It has not been easy. The men’s recollections about the boredom and terror of their time in Vietnam and the censoring they experienced upon their return offer reasons for that.\n\n\tToward the end, “Soul Patrol” returns to Emanuel standing in that grocery store. It’s an image that hints at some measure of spiritual repair. The credits begin their roll with Jimmy Ruffin’s aching ballad “What Becomes of the Brokenhearted?” playing. Like Emanuel and his comrades, Harper and his film go a meaningful way in asking and offering an answer to that plaint.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTexas is a big place that can feel so small sometimes. Just ask comedian Iliza Shlesinger, who clearly gets it. Born in New York, but raised in the suburbs of Dallas Fort Worth, she made her break from the Lone Star State right after high school and never looked back. Well, that part’s not quite true. Her hilarious, perceptive and deeply relatable indie comedy “Chasing Summer” (directed by Josephine Decker) is all about looking back, as her overachieving character Jaime returns “home” after nearly 20 years away to make peace with her past.\n\t\n\n\tNo one questions when men do what Jaime did, ditching their families (in this case, MVP Megan Mullaly as her well-mannered mama Layanne and Jeff Perry as her more oblivious dad) to go off and make a career for themselves. As the film opens, Jaime is out saving the world — that’s literally her job, as a disaster relief worker — cleaning up after a tornado in neighboring Mississippi. Without calling attention to it, Decker shoots the scene like she’s got something to prove (when it’s Jaime who’s the one with a chip on her shoulder), swooping through the aid camp in an elaborate, “Touch of Evil”-style oner.\n\n\n\tJaime has just gotten news that her team has been picked to serve in Jakarta next (the “Nobel Prize” of such assignments, she explains), and right after the cut, she receives another shocker: Her boyfriend’s dumping her for a younger woman. They’ve already packed up her stuff. It wasn’t her plan to detour through Dallas and see her folks — Jaime’s been doing her best to avoid them for almost two decades — but now she needs a place to stay.\n\t\n\n\tSo begins a familiar “you can’t go home again” story (till now, Reese Witherspoon had a corner on the market) that miraculously doesn’t feel like we’ve heard it before, even if the moral is perfectly clear from the get-go. Something embarrassing happened between Jaime and her teenage crush, Chase (“Smallville” star Tom Welling, to whom time has been kind). She’s been running ever since, never staying in one place for long. Coming back, she’s almost immediately reminded of Chase. He sure has changed, but has Jaime?\n\n\tNot according to a trio of popular girls from her high school class, whom she runs into at the grocery store. They swear she looks the same. Extrapolating from the way Jaime rides a shopping cart (like a 10-year-old, zooming through the frozen goods section with both feet off the ground), these grocery aisles are like memory lane. Practically everyone she encounters speaks to her with politeness and respect, though none — not even her mom — seem to recognize or care what she’s accomplished career-wise.\n\n\t“Your nails are scraggly from all that volunteering,” scolds Layanne in her articulate Southern drawl — except Jaime doesn’t volunteer, and her mom’s never understood that. She can’t even keep the places Jaime’s served straight. Being back under her childhood roof is stressful, but not nearly as much as sleeping in tents halfway around the world — or so you’d think. Shlesinger does an excellent job of communicating Jaime’s anxiety (sometimes it feels like she’s playing to the camera, ready to break the fourth wall with a “can you believe these people?” shrug). But we believe that’s the character. Jaime has spent half her life watching herself from a self-conscious remove.\n\n\tIf she’s running from anything, it’s herself, not Chase. Her ex long since moved on with his life: settled down, gotten married, had kids. In Texas, as in most of the country, the majority of folks don’t drift far from home. Jaime’s the exception. She convinced herself she was escaping judgment — cruel rumors that trace back to high school. But that strange mix of nostalgia and ridicule Shlesinger’s script shows for certain Texas customs (big hair, oversized pickup trucks and bladder-challenging beverage containers)? The judgment stems from her/Jaime.\n\t\n\n\t“Nobody’s thinking about high school anymore,” Chase says when he runs into Jaime at the roller-skating rink run by her screw-up of an older sister (Cassidy Freeman). Jaime agrees to help out around the place, but it’s hard not to get pulled back into old patterns. Despite all those years away, Jaime essentially reverts back to her teenage self, accompanying the much-younger Harper (Lola Tung) to a kegger, where she meets a kid, Colby (Garrett Wareing, who comes across like a conscientious quarterback). He’s barely half her age, but more considerate than all her exes combined, so she allows herself to be loved.\n\n\tJaime has a lot of sorting out to do while in Texas, and Shlesinger generously allows her character to fumble through it. She’s been responsible for so long, obviously trying to prove herself to people who haven’t given her much thought. That’s a rude awakening plenty of people experience at their high school reunions: The bullies have mellowed, forgetting and/or forgiving themselves for their behavior, while the underdogs go on to become overachievers. Colby explains as much. (He’s handsome, which makes it easy to be aloof. But he’s wise enough to recognize that caring what others think is a curse that people impose on themselves.)\n\n\tThere’s real wisdom to “Chasing Summer,” which Shlesinger and Decker offset with a handful of steamier-than-you’d-expect sex scenes. Jaime resists Colby at first — not for long, really — after which, their physical interplay is presented with her pleasure as the priority. That’s the one element in which audiences might recognize Decker’s hand. Otherwise, the movie bears almost no resemblance to her past work (“Butter on the Latch,” “Shirley,” “Madeline’s Madeline”). Compared to those low-budget marvels, “Chasing Summer” shows all the polish and soul of those glossy studio comedies that result when Judd Apatow picks a comedian and builds an entire project around them. He wasn’t involved here, but the movie still ranks right up there with “Trainwreck,” even giving “Bridesmaids” vibes at times.\n\n\tYou needn’t know Texas to see the truth in it, but if you do, the details certainly add to the experience. Like Mullaly’s jewelry and accent. Or the mercurial weather, which has driven so many from the state. Or the way that coming back is the best way to move forward.\n",

Additionally, she will continue to lead the company’s marketing operations, content and creative, and audience insights and analytics teams, unifying theses strategic operations, according to the announcement. Joshua’s mandate includes advancing BMG’s global digital ecosystem, enhancing fan-engagement models, and accelerating the company’s work in emerging AI technologies and commercial formats.\n\n\tThomas Coesfeld, BMG CEO, said: “Celine’s elevation reflects both her achievements and BMG’s commitment to accelerating growth through technological innovation, artist-centric strategy, and our global where possible, local where needed paradigm. Her considered approach, coupled with her deep understanding of how artists and fans connect across platforms and how AI can amplify music experience, makes her uniquely equipped to drive BMG’s next chapter forward.”\n\n\tPrior to joining BMG in 2024, Joshua served as Executive Vice President of Commercial Innovation & Artist Strategy at Universal Music Group, where she worked across the company’s global recorded music business to develop artist experiences, brand extensions, and new commercial pathways.\n\n\t+ Primary Wave Music, in conjunction with South American partner Nas Nuvens Music Group, has announced a partnership with the legendary Brazilian composer, singer and guitarist Gilberto Gil.\n\n\tTerms of the deal will see Primary Wave and Nas Nuvens work alongside Gil on his celebrated catalog of music. This partnership is one of the most significant to emerge from South America, combining one of Brazil’s largest music transactions one of the country’s most influential cultural figures. The partnership will focus on the preserving Gil’s legacy while expanding the reach of his catalog and to new generations and territories.\n\n\t+ Concord Music Publishing has announced the signing of artist, songwriter, and producer Aksel Arvid in his first publishing deal. This deal is a joint venture with Norwegian producer Peder Losnegård, better known as Lido. \n\t\n\n\tAt the age of just 23, Arvid executive-produced PinkPantheress’ critically revered “Fancy That” album, which landed him two 2026 Grammy nominations. He has also worked extensively with Jack Harlow and others.\n\n\t“Aksel is a special young talent with a creative vision that feels like it blends the spirit of the old school with the techniques of the new. We couldn’t be more excited to partner with Concord to help foster his vision,” says Jonathan Tanners, Manager at Blood Company.\n\n\tJeremy Yohai, SVP A&R at Concord Music Publishing added, “Aksel is an amazing talent that possesses an extraordinary work ethic and distinct point of view. We are thrilled to be working with him alongside Lido.”\n\n\t+ Capitol Music Group has announced the promotion of Walter Thomas to Executive Vice President, Motown Gospel / Tamla. In his expanded role, Thomas will oversee the creative, marketing, and strategic direction for Motown Gospel and Tamla, strengthening partnerships and continuing to champion world-class talent across Gospel, Christian, R&B, and positive music, according to the announcement.\n\n\t“Walter is an exceptional leader with a strong work ethic and clear vision. Working alongside him over the past few years, I’ve seen firsthand his passion for artist development and the role faith plays in his leadership. Motown Gospel and TAMLA are entering a new era of growth and impact under his leadership,” said Brad O’Donnell, president of Capitol Christian Music Group.\n\n\t+ Pulse Music Group has announced the promotion of Saul Fitton to senior VP/ head of creative, U.K. His responsibilities will include signing, developing, and implementing creative strategy for the company’s roster of songwriters and producers. He will be based in London and will report to co-CEOs Scott Cutler and Ashley Calhoun.\n\n\tFitton previously held A&R roles at Sony Music Publishing and Warner Chappell Music, and began his career in management and A&R with Fraser T. Smith. \n\n\tScott Cutler, Josh Abraham, and Ashley Calhoun commented: “Saul has a proven track record of discovering, signing, and developing internationally successful songwriting, production, and artistic talent. What truly sets him apart is his ability to create innovative opportunities and to stand up for the commercial and artistic needs of his writers. We know that our writers will benefit from his exceptional dedication to their careers.”\n\t\n\n\t+ Secretly Distribution has announced a worldwide distribution deal with Ipecac Recordings, “the independent record label that has been making people sick since 1999,” as the announcement puts it. Founded by musician Mike Patton — vocalist with Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Fantômas, Tomahawk and more — and artist/label manager Greg Werckman (of Alternative Tentacles and Mercury Records and Pick-A-Winner Management), Ipecac has released music across rock, country, hip-hop, electronic, comedy, classical, soundtracks and more.\n\n\t“One needs to evaluate constantly with the ever-shifting music industry landscape. Where do we fit? Who understands us? Who are our people? Partnering with Secretly at this time makes perfect sense,” says Werckman. “From the people that work at Secretly to the eclectic collection of labels and artists they work with, it feels like joining a commune of like-minded, fairly well groomed, independent music lovers. We are honored to be asked to join the ‘club’ and look forward to much more shared mayhem.”\n\n\t“Take a look at the Ipecac roster and you’ll see a rundown of artists who have consistently pushed at boundaries, challenged preconceptions, thrown curveballs and made us all wince, gasp, laugh and, frankly, rock in various measures,” adds Tom Davies, Director of Global Marketing & Campaigns at Secretly Distribution. “It’s been a pleasure to listen to their output for 25 years, and everyone at Secretly Distribution is beyond excited to get to work with a label whose commitment to supporting groundbreaking music matches our own. We are thrilled to collaborate with Greg, Marc and Mike to support their amazing catalog and new releases.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFor many of the attendees at this year’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend festival in Mexico, one of the highlights of the four-day gathering came when founder Brandi Carlile stepped out to join co-headliner the Chicks for what can rightly be called one of the signature songs of the 21st century, “Not Ready to Make Nice.” While the duet might have happened under any circumstance where these two artists were set to join forces, it felt especially trenchant, in these tropical climes, given the topical climate back home. The audience of about 5,000, consisting primarily of women, listened to Carlile do her take on a guest verse and then sang or shouted along with the chorus of the Chicks’ almost exactly 20-year-old anthem as if their lives, pride, anger and glee depended on it. Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” might also serve a sort of universal anthem of defiance, but in “Not Ready to Make Nice,” indomitable women in particular have had — still have — a rallying cry of their own.\n\t\n\n\tBut the other thing about Carlile joining Natalie Maines and the Chicks? Nothing says totally making nice like three-part harmony expanded into four-. And Girls Just Wanna Weekend is about nothing if not about women and non-binary people coming together in a spirit of harmony, figuratively and very, very literally… with just an undercurrent of FAFO activist energy bubbling underneath.\n\n\n\tGirls Just Wanna Weekend is often characterized, fairly accurately, as a once-a-year modern update  of Lilith Fair, with Carlile picking up the flag for a women-based festival that Sarah McLachlan set down. But there’s no doubt that the mid-2020s are feeling more threatening in many ways to much of the core audience than the late ‘90s did. And so the issue arises each January as to whether “the Brandi bubble” — as attendees regularly refer to the festival as — is a place for pure pop-feminist escapism for a weekend south, or whether concerns affecting the largely female, largely gay audience can be kept in mind without popping the rare sense of safetyfelt by nearly everyone involved.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tCarlile acknowledged that possible dichotomy between girls just wanting to have fun and just wanting to fret about the world in her opening toast (following a land-acknowledgement prelude overseen by Mexican hosts).\n\n\t“The land acknowledgement is a big deal. What I’m doing right now is just about fun,” she said, holding a champagne glass, standing alongside her bandmates Phil and Tim Hanseroth. “But I think to myself, when I’m falling asleep, how can I give everybody permission to have fun when things are so hard? And it’s a complicated question because none of us want to breed apathy; we want to breed activism, and so we don’t know exactly how to exist in both ways sometimes, do we? We don’t know how to be heartbroken and full of joy at the same time. But joy is essential to resistance.\n\n\t “You can resist all you want,” she continued, “but you won’t do it for long if you don’t know how to recharge your batteries, rest, look inward and have fun. It is resistance, and it’s the kind of resistance that is contagious, that calls other people into resistance —the irresistible resistance of joy. And that’s what I want you to be thinking about this weekend. I want you to have so much fun, but I want to recharge your batteries so that we can go home and go about the work that we all know that we need to do the things that are keeping us up at night. But you’re already doing it. You are already doing it.”\n\n\tWith that, she dedicated the evening’s performances to Renee Good, and announced a vigil to be held in her honor the following evening (Alex Pretti had not yet been slain at that point). And then, glasses aloft, she offered the festival’s traditional kick-off words: “Bottoms up, bitches.”\n\n\tGirls Just Wanna Weekend is one of the warmest festivals it’s possible to experience during the winter months, although, if we’re talking purely in terms of temperature, it shares that honor with some of the other fests that 100x Presents in the Cancun area in January (including ones headlined or curated by Noah Kahan, Luke Bryan and Dave Matthews). It might be the warmest festival all year if heat is being measured in friendship, nonjudgmental acceptance and a shared sense of social empathy as unifying factors.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJensen McRae at Arroba Nat at Brandi Carlile’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy 100x\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThere may be a trickle-down factor at play there, symbolically and otherwise, with the festival’s figurehead being the woman who is the best known among all pop stars for being eager to share her stage on just about any occasion, whether with elder legends or complete unknowns. Practically unique among the new wave of rocker-led festivals, Carlile is likely to jump on stage for a duet with most of the performances featured through a four-day weekend — not just with the Chicks and fellow headliner Sam Smith but artists like Jensen McRae, Lucius, CMAT, August Ponthier and Jasmine.4.t, not to mention her singing harmony with every non-pro guest picked to participate in the annual round of poolside “Brandi-oke.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandi Carlile and Sam Smith at Girls Just Wanna Weekend in Mexico, Jan. 17, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHanna Hanseroth\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBackstage on night 3, Carlile talked with Variety about some of the dichotomies she’s juggling as the festival gets bigger. Presenting a female-centric bill for a female-centric audience hardly puts any limits on the kind of music being performed, when it reflects Carlile’s wide spectrum of tastes. She grew up wanting to be either Tanya Tucker or Elton John, at any given time in her girlhood, and you could see echoes of both those primary influences in a festival where the Chicks and Smith were her co-toppers.\n\n\t“That’s so queer, to be able to have both,” Carlile said, smiling after Smith’s ballad-filled but powerhouse set. “You know, it’s a beautiful thing. Sam was just talking about how we don’t do binaries with fashion. We don’t do binaries with genres, either.”\n\n\tProtecting the relative intimacy of the festival has been a challenge Carlile has taken on, keeping a substantial focus on affinity groups and seminars during the day, while growing the event for an audience that may just come for the bands. On one level, it’s a big rock show, at least at nighttime, right?\n\n\t“It is a big rock show,” agreed Carlile — “a big rock show with huge production and big screens and fog machines and huge speakers. And it sounds huge; you know, it sounds like Bonnaroo out there. But it’s not that. And I’m still mystified by the evolution of the festival and how it’s gotten to this point; how we’re getting people like the Chicks and Shania Twain [one of last year’s headliners] and Sam to come out and do this.\n\t\n\n\t“But it has a scaled feel to it, in the sense of the dynamics,” she continued. “The interpersonal part of the festival has felt smaller than ever. And that, I think, is my goal, is to create big drama, big moments, big sweeping, loud, profound shows, but then a family environment the rest of the time. So I think that’s a tricky balance to strike, because how do you make something feel like it’s a really big deal and make people feel like they’ve come home?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandy Clark and Shelby Lynne at Brandi Carlile’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy 100x\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSome of the artist comments during the weekend reflected how paying attendees typically feel. “We woke up in paradise with a bunch of queers and peers,” said the rising artist Autumn Nicholas, kicking off the pool stage on Friday. “I’m reminded of what a utopia Brandi Carlile created here,” said Brandy Clark, as an aside during a daytime songwriting seminar she was doing with fellow Americana icon Shelby Lynne on Sunday. “This is the greatest festival on earth,” exulted the trans rocker Jasmine.4.t, who had other fests like a well-received stop at Glastonbury to compare it to.\n\n\tBackstage, Sam Smith said, “From what I’d seen online and just from knowing Brandi over the last few years, I had a feeling of what this would be, but being on stage tonight and actually seeing and feeling the audience, the kindness in the whole festival is incredible. And something I’ve never actually felt before on stage — I felt very safe and just free to be myself on stage. I felt no judgment. It’s way more beautiful than I could ever have imagined.”\n\n\tShelby Lynne came to this year’s GJWW to do a daytime stage chat with Clark, then stuck around for the closing ‘90s tribute celebration, performing a cover of Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” that brought the house down as a highlight of the night or even fest. I caught up with her after the set and she explained that she had offered up a little prayer to Kurt Cobain before going on, which very much seemed to manifest itself in some Method performing.\n\n\t“I’m honored to be invited,” Lynne said. “I always thought for years, maybe they don’t like me, but I’m thrilled to death, to play with Brandi’s band and have the love here. Everybody’s free. There’s no judgment. You know, somebody said to me earlier, ‘If you lose your child, it’ll come back with a snack and a sunscreen on,’ and it’s true, it’s that kinda loving. There’s not any bullshit here. And the music. I mean, come on, it’s such an eclectic choice; Brandi’s just killing that, with bringing in people that matter and new acts. I love Lucius, and I got to meet with my good friend Shawn Colvin, and we just laughed for about four days.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCMAT performs at Girls Just Wanna Weekend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy 100x\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd then there was CMAT, the Irish singer who has already become a European sensation, exulting in a sensational reception for her mainstage set at GJWW, which some attendees went online to cite as the most thrilling full-length performance of the weekend. “This whole thing is a cult — and I’m joining it!” a surprised-seeming CMAT yelped toward the end of her set, as the crowd of about 5,000 roared their eagerness to induct her.\n\n\n\n\n\tOut in the audience on the night the Chicks headlined, I spotted a group of five women all dressed in nude-style bodysuits with words and slogans stencilled onto their bodies. This was an homage to the then-Dixie Chicks’ famous “naked” Entertainment Weekly cover of 2003, fronting an article in which they first explained and stood up behind the anti-war, anti-George W. Bush concert talk that got the group canceled in country music. Having an intimate connection to that particular cover, I went over and chatted them up, and found that, although they hail from different cities, they dress up thematically for every night of every GJJW, a tradition they have kept up since year 3 of the festival, after meeting randomly in year 2.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The first year we just showed up as newbies and didn’t really know what we were doing,” said Lindsey Sargent, who hails from Seattle, “and by year two we made custom floaties, custom bathing suits, custom costumes. Now it’s whole months of planning and Zoom calls to get all the costumes ordered. These women are in my life because of Brandi, because of the festival. The community that she’s created, it’s incredible.”\n\n\tOn a personal note, Sargent explained how attending GJWW heals a festering injury from her youth. “I was a big nerd growing up, and summer camp for me was a ton of anxiety and mean girls,” she explained. “And now as an adult, I get to go to summer camp and heal the childhood wounds from not being enough, not having the girlfriends, not fitting in. Here, we go hard and we do it, and I relive a piece of my youth that was painful as an adult and just come and have the most joy.”\n\n\tAsked about past GJWW performance highlights from having attended almost every year, Sargent spoke about empathy playing a role even in choosing a favorite for that. “Janelle Monet was insane,” she said. “But the year Wynonna was here right after her mom had passed away, in my heart, I could feel Wynonna’s sadness. There was the sweetest trans person up in the front row that had a sign they were holding up for Wynona, and she acknowledged them — they had this moment. Then they took off the most ugly, huge binder bra you’ve ever seen and threw it up on stage, and Wynonna was like, ‘No one has ever thrown a bra at me before!’ And all bets were off at that point — everyone was throwing brass at Wynonna, and Brandi’s running around the stage, picking up bras, hanging them on her mic stand. She showed up at all the events, and we were just giving her love because we knew she was in a moment of her life where she needed some lady power, so we gave it to her.”\n\t\n\n\tSam Smith might have seemed to at least a few festivalgoers like a left-field pick, when virtually everyone who had been on the bills for the previous six editions of the festival had either been female-identifying or started their careers as such. Carlile called Smith the first non-binary headliner at the festival, and some attendees pointed out that that wasn’t strictly true, when Monae had come out as non-binary not long before co-headling GJWW — but it was accurate inasmuch as Smith was the first such guest star to have initially risen to stardom with a he/him identity.\n\n\tCarlile said backstage that imagining Smith could be part of GJWW came from “thinking about how cool it would be to celebrate Sam’s kind of feminine energy at this festival and how needed that was  to expand our understanding of the feminine, to include Sam in a really profound way. And I think tonight I saw that play out, and it was stunning.” [Read here for Variety‘s full joint backstage interview with Smith and Carlile.]\n\n\tAnother artist who has changed pronouns, much more recently in this case, was August Ponthier, who played the pool stage for a second year in a row, but for only the first time as August. Last year, the acclaimed young pop singer-songwriter was she/her, and determinedly lesbian, instead of they/them, which was announced just weeks before this year’s festival.\n\n\t“Last year I played here under a different first name, in a different mindset,” said Ponthier, taking a poolside break. “I’ve always had big support from other LGBTQ+ people, but there really is nothing like this, at least not that I’ve been to. And last year, being able to be in a space where I not only was around queer people my age, but queer people who are my past, present, and future all in one place together, really set my intention for the year, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I played Girls Just Wanna before I went through a lot of personal change. That experience kind of carried me into a year where I made a lot of decisions about wanting to live my life the way that I’ve always wanted to live it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandi Carlile and August Ponthier duet at Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy 100x\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Brandi in general has really made me feel like a lot more things are possible,” they continued. “I think I really boxed myself in, emotionally, and I was afraid to make big choices or afraid to exist in the way that made me feel the most comfortable because I had this imaginary audience around me telling me that maybe I was someone who could be voted on — like maybe I should only do what people find the most comfortable or the most interesting or most palatable. Being around Brandi has really made me value being a trailblazer, because she is a trailblazer, and her seeing herself in me makes me feel like that’s possible.”\n\t\n\n\tCarlile offered musical and not just moral support by joining Ponthier to duet on the title song of August’s upcoming album “Everywhere Isn’t Texas,” twice, first during the founder’s own headlining set and then later during the younger artist’s acoustic pool performance. It’s a song about Ponthier grappling with leaving their home state for more queer-hospitable climes, but still having affection for it. “I think the reason that that song connected with her is because she is an artist that makes protest music… That song is about how I grew up in Texas and I felt like I loved it, but it did not love me back. I felt like I was being pushed out, kind of like the way white blood cells will push out an infection, and I didn’t want to feel like I was diseased or wrong or made wrong. And because I can’t stop thinking about home and all the things that happen there because Texas is a leader in politics, it became the title of the album. It just is the most complicated and deep love of my life, and it resonated with Brandi, who’s not someone that’s afraid to talk about politics or to stand up for what she believes in. It means a lot that a major artist would be so brave and talk about a state that is really polarizing and sing alongside with me.” Of Texas generally, Ponthier says, “We can love something and be critical of it at the same time and want better for it.”\n\n\tPonthier was on their way from this chat to a trans and non-binary affinity gathering hosted by Jasmine.4.t, the festival’s first mainstage trans performer. Not all the daytime activities were as serious as all that: Attendees could attend or participate in a soccer game, with Olympian Abby Wambaugh as coach; a ‘90s costume contest judged by SistaStrings; drag bingo with Anania; or a Carlile tour trivia contest with the Hanseroth Twins.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKate Moennig and Leisha Hailey speak at Brandi Carlile’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy 100x\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, in one of the few instances in which fans have ever had to make a choice between Carlile and the Hanseroths, overlapping with the trivia contest the brothers hosted was Brandi’s on-stage interview with the stars of “The L-Word” who recently released a book titled “So Gay for You,” Leisha Hailey and Kate Moennig. (The two actors teased during the conversation that they had a big announcement they’d wanted to make there that would have to wait another couple weeks, because of contracts not yet signed.) The weightier fare in the daytime events schedule included a showing of the Oscar-nominated (and Carlile-coproduced) documentary “Come See Me in the Good Light,” with one of the movie’s subjects, Megan Falley, interviewed by Glennon Doyle; a seminar for parents of trans and non-binary teens; a BIPOC “centering joy” happy hour; and a workshop titled “Hot & Healthy: Pleasure, Power, and Aging in Our Bodies.”\n\t\n\n\tThe focus in that latter seminar on midlife issues was raised in a different way by a comic, Kristen Key, returning for the second year to do a comedy set on the final night. Her focus on “old lesbians” cracked the house up — and, she predicted, would offend a few, even though the fortysomething Key counts herself in that demographic. Getting serious for a moment backstage, Key said, “The difference between a comedy club and thousands of people at Girls Just Wanna Weekend is just the amount of dopamine that gets dripping out of your ears from having that much love thrown at you all at once. You just really just get to live a dream by being on stage and having that much positivity and love come at you.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn-stage, Key riffed, “I came here last year and it is magical. This place will transform you, and I mean, literally many women walk in married straight ladies and walk out late-in-life lesbians. Not, like, a few… like, a percentage of this audience came to Girls Just Wanna married to Frank and they leave engaged to Veronica. I’m beginning to suspect that Brandi puts subliminal messages in her songs that turns straight women gay. … They’re just innocently listening at home” — she sang a snippet of “The Story” — “and then they listen to the record backwards: ‘Your husband doesn’t please you.’” Key also referred to a moment from opening night when Leisha Hailey joined Carlile on stage to duet on “Fake Plastic Trees.” “When you brought out Alice from ‘The L-Word’ to sing Radiohead,” Key said, “I mean, there wasn’t a dry pair of Woxers in Mexico.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe fact that Key can do a 35-minute set in front of thousands of people consisting 95% of lesbian humor may raise the question: How gay do you have to be to attend Girls Just Wanna Weekend? The answer is, not very, although at least liking lesbians enough to laugh with and not at their culture surely counts as a prerequisite. The audience for GJWW probably skews — in a very unscientific survey — about 90% female and about 70% queer (including gay men). But straight women and men and cis couples, with and without children in tow, are plentiful enough, and all apparently enjoying a bubble that presents a happy fantasy of just how beneficient an actual matriarchy might feel, even for those not part of that cheerfully lopsided majority.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLucius performs at Brandi Carlile’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtes 100x\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOne thing that can easily bring any audience of straights and queers or women, men and binary people together, without fail, here or probably anywhere: ‘80s and ‘90s nostalgia. Lucius began the Sunday night mainstage music with a magnificent rendering of Cyndi Lauper’s entire “She’s So Unusual” album. And then, before everyone was sent home to the land of ICE, the closing night of GJWW provided a pure, epic bachanal of covers from the 1990s, arguably the last era in which there was anything resembling a pop monoculture. Carlile did not sing her planned cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing,” having sung with so many artists and fans over the previous four days that she didn’t quite feel up to tackling that summit. But even without taking one last lead vocal, the host was on stage singing backup for a long succession of tribute songs.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGlennon Doyle and Abby Wambach perform at Brandi Carlile’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALIVE for 100x Hospitality\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHighlights, besides the aforementioned Shelby Lynne/Nirvana moment, included: SistaStrings’ Chauntee and Carlile’s new bass player, Solomon Dorsey, doing a sublimely belted version of Celine Dion’s and Andrea Bocelli’s quasi-classical “The Prayer,” complete with Italian verses. Dorsey and Lucius doing another ‘90s movie theme, “A Whole New World,” with the two women of Lucius emerging from behind a magic carpet to bust in with their parts. A Spice Girls homage that had Catherine Carlile joined by British TV host and comic Alan Carr, baring his midriff. Joy Oladakun’s take on the Fugees’ take on “Killing Me Softly.” Mexican singer Arroba Nat rousingly bringing things closer to home with a lone Spanish-language number of the night, Selena’s “Como la Flor.” Wambach and Doyle athletically leaping into one another’s arms during an affectionately pitchy cover of Melissa Etheridge’s “Come to My Window.” The very promising upcomer Autumn Nicholas bittersweetly sewing up “Torn.” Carlile’s brother, Jay, getting in one of the few male lead vocals of the weekend with a sibling version of “Boot Scooti’ Boogie.” And, complete with a kids’ chorus, a closing gospel group-sing of the “Joyful, Joyful” medley from “Sister Act 2.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Chicks perform at Brandi Carlile’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico on January 15-19, 2026. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALIVE for 100x Hospitality\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut the choicest cover of GJWW 7? That may have belonged to the Chicks, who, one night earlier, used their first concert in three years as a chance to bust out a freshly minted cover of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Manchild.” It was ostensibly light-hearted… but given that most in attendance were about to return to a land where manchildren are having a deep and deleterious effect on an entire citizenship’s lives every day, it felt like it fit in right alongside “Not Ready to Make Nice” as a protest song.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoy Oladokun at Brandi Carlile’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico on January 15-19, 2026. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALIVE for 100x Hospitality\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandi Carlile’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy 100x\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tArroba Nat at Brandi Carlile’s Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico on January 15-19, 2026. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALIVE for 100x Hospitality\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandi Carlile joins the pool party at Girls Just Wanna Weekend 2026 Music Festival held at Barcelo Maya Riviera in Cancun, Mexico \n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tGreek filmmaker Thanasis Neofotistos is in post-production on his buzzy feature debut “The Boy With the Light-Blue Eyes,” a genre-bending coming-of-age story about fear, superstition and acceptance set in the hinterlands of rural Greece. The director will be presenting the film during the Works in Progress program of the Thessaloniki Film Festival’s industry arm, Agora, which takes place Nov. 2 – 6. \n\n\tWritten by Neofotistos and Grigoris Skarakis, “The Boy With the Light-Blue Eyes” follows teenager Peter as he navigates the suffocating confines of his superstitious and traditional village community. Born with light-blue eyes — considered an ill omen by the villagers — he is forced to wear a mask by his mother, who claims he suffers from a threatening “eye disease” to prevent his true nature from being revealed.\n\t\n\n\tRaised in this blissful ignorance, Peter and his best friend Aemon one day embark on an adventure to visit the mythical wind turbine far from his village. Eventually, he learns the unsettling truth about his eyes — and the lies he’s been told — forcing him to face a painful reckoning in order to be free. Neofotistos describes the film as “an allegory on acceptance in a society that is resistant to anything different,” adding: “It is for all the people who feel that they don’t belong and struggle to understand why.”\n\n\n\tThe director’s anticipated feature debut was a long time in the making — what he describes as a “rollercoaster” ride since it was conceived nearly a decade ago at First Things First, an academy for young filmmakers from Southeastern Europe supported by the Goethe Institute. The script went on to be developed through the Mediterranean Film Institute and the Sarajevo Script Station before the project was chosen to participate in Cannes Focus CoPro in 2022.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the long gestation process, Neofotistos did not sit idly by, shooting several acclaimed short films including “Patision Avenue” (2018), which went to Venice and Clermont-Ferrand, as well as the 2022 Locarno premiere “Airhostess-737,” which traveled to Sundance, Toronto and Clermont-Ferrand and was acquired last year by the New Yorker. \n\n\t“The Boy With the Light-Blue Eyes” eventually took shape as an elaborate, seven-country co-production between Greece (Argonauts Productions, Atalante Productions), Cyprus (Yannis Economides Films), North Macedonia (Sektor Films), Croatia (Studio Corvus), Serbia (Sense Production), Romania (Luna Film) and the U.S. (WILLA, Astrakan Film, Cold Iron Pictures).\n\n\tThe film is a deeply personal one for Neofotistos, who was born in Epirus, a mountainous region on Greece’s border with Albania, and grew up in a conservative family for whom religion and superstition were deeply intertwined. Aware of his homosexuality from an early age, the director admitted he had a difficult childhood. \n\n\t“I felt really, really alone,” Neofotistos told Variety. “My family didn’t accept me. But not only my family. I didn’t accept myself. It was [considered] a flaw in the family to be gay. I was hiding my identity.” \n\n\tBullied in high school for being different, the director grew up feeling isolated and alone. As a result, he sought refuge in cinema and literature, finding a creative spark that would set him on course to become a filmmaker. “I was trying to create universes to escape from this reality,” he said. “That was how I became a storyteller.”\n\n\t“The Boy With the Light-Blue Eyes” relies heavily on the director’s world-building capabilities. He describes the film as a “dark folk tale” set in a “timeless” place ruled by religion and superstition that is viewed entirely from his young protagonist’s POV — a perspective that offers the viewer “a blend of reality and his imagination.” Citing Guillermo del Toro’s “Pan’s Labyrinth” as an inspiration, Neofotistos says it’s “not a fantasy film,” per se, but a movie that utilizes “folk tradition and magical-realist elements to tell a very simple story about diversity and acceptance.”\n\n\tThe film is built around the mythology of the evil eye, a superstition that is prevalent not only in Greece but throughout the Balkans and the wider region, where blue-eyed individuals — a genetic rarity — were traditionally viewed with fear and suspicion. That “fear of the unknown,” said Neofotistos, made the evil eye a “perfect allegory” for his story about otherness and acceptance.\n\t\n\n\tWhile the director’s own coming-out journey inspired the film and there is a powerful “queer subtext” throughout, “The Boy With the Light-Blue Eyes” is not “100% about a gay awakening,” said Neofotistos. Rather, it tells a more universal story about the difficult road many must travel to ultimately find themselves.\n\n\t“Only when they realize what marks them as misfits or outcasts in their community can they truly come to terms with themselves. And oftentimes, this liberation comes at an important price,” the director said. “From my experience, in the end, you can be surprised from what follows a painful coming of age.”\n\n\tThe Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Yoroï,” a fantasy tale starring famed rapper-turned-actor Aurélien Cotentin aka Orelsan, is the latest example of the cultural bridges that Cinefrance Studios has built between France and Japan.\n\n\tUnder the impulse of its co-founder David Gauquié, who recently completed his 38th trip to Japan, the Paris-based company has become a favorite partner for celebrated Japanese filmmakers aspiring to make atypical movies in France. The banner previously co-produced Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s 2024 thriller “Serpent’s Path,” a remake of his own 1998 film of the same name; and recently completed the Paris shoot of “All of a Sudden,” directed by “Drive My Car”‘s Oscar-winning helmer Ryusuke Hamaguchi with Virginie Efira (“Benedetta”) and Tao Okamoto (“The Wolverine”). The film shot for 8 weeks in the French capital, followed by a week in Kyoto. Cinefrance Studios also produced Japanese master Naomi Kawase’s latest film “Yakushima’s Illusion” headlined by Vicky Krieps. It world premiered at Locarno and will be released in Japan in February.\n\t\n\n\tThe banner’s pipeline of prestige films in development includes the next project by Hirokazu Kore-eda, who won Cannes’ Palme d’Or with “Shoplifters” in 2018; and Daigo Matsui’s next project, a romantic comedy pitched a twist on “Lost in Translation,” revolving around a Japanese star of Kabuki and a French woman — who will be played by a famed French actor.\n\n\n\t“Yoroï” marked a different kind of collaboration for Cinefrance Studios as it involved a French talent seeking a project set in Japan. Orelsan’s hot profile as France’s biggest music artist helped Cinefrance Studios to get Sony Pictures on board for the ambitious movie. The studio handles worldwide rights and released it this week in France and Belgium. \n\t\n\n\tShot for the most part in Japan over the course of three months, Yoroi stars Cotentin as himself — a famous French musician who grows tired of the limelight and decides to move to Japan with his pregnant wife Nanako (Clara Choï) after touring the world with Civilisation which turned out to be France’s best-selling album in 2021 and 2022. Nestled in the Japanese countryside, Cotentin stumbles upon a samurai armor that awakens strange creatures.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJOHN HOADE\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn a wide-ranging interview at their Paris office, Gauquié and producer Renan Artukmaç (who joined Cinefrance Studios) two years ago, said the creative affinity between France and Japan spans art, cinema, and theater, and has inspired by French artists and intellectuals, including Le Corbusier, Roland Barthes, Victor Hugo and Charles Perriand over past centuries. Even today, some of Paris’ biggest theaters are holding Kabuki residencies and performances, says Gauquié. Conversely, French plays are popular in Japan, for instance Florian Zeller’s shows which are sold out at major Japanese theaters. \n\n\tJapanese directors also hold French cinema in high esteem, Gauquié said, citing Hamaguchi who stunned him with his “enormous knowledge of French films,” including the Nouvelle Vague classics, “sometimes better than many French people.”\n\n\tIn the case of “Yoroï,” Cinefrance Studios fully developed the project with Cotentin, who came up with the idea for the film and co-wrote the manga-inspired script with filmmaker David Tomaszewski. \n\n\tGauquié and Artukmaç say their work on “Yoroï” illustrates Cinefrance Studios’ commitment to immersive, on-the-ground development, even if it means incurring development costs before securing full financing. The banner was ultimately able to attract big backers for the €15-million project. Besides Sony Pictures, “Yoroï” was boarded by Prime Video France which previously streamed Orelsan’s biopic documentary series, “Don’t ever show this to anyone,” which was directed by his brother Clément Cotentin and topped viewing charts on the platform.  \n\n\t“When developing a project with a Japanese partner in France, or with a French partner in Japan, we strive for authenticity, and that’s why we plan trips even before we have co-producers and funding in place,” says Gauquié, adding that the banner took a similar risk with a pair of films that shot in Taiwan, Abderrahmane Sissako’s “Black Tea” and Regis Wargnier’s “La reparation.”  \n\t\n\n\tOn “Yoroï,” Gauquié says location scouting started eight months before filming. “We travelled 4,000 kilometers in ten days, by plane, train and minivan,” says the producer, who ended up staying about 20 more days on the ground “to get to know Japan, get to know the scenery, get to know the places and everything.” The film ended up being shot in the countryside in Osaka, three hours away from Tokyo during the cherry blossom season. Since the local crew was Japanese, it required Cinefrance Studios to hire interpreters who specialize in cinema in facilitate the interactions between the French and Japanese on set. Cinefrance Studios, which has opened a Japanese office, also tapped Toho Tombo Pictures, a well established production services company whose credits include “Bullet Train” and “Tokyo Vice,” to work on “Yoroï.”\n\n\n\n\n\tThe immersive development approach was used for Hamaguchi who traveled to France multiple times before starting to film “All of a Sudden” to workshop material with local actors, among other things. Matsui, meanwhile, came to France in March for the first time and was introduced to a French talent, French location managers and locations to spark his inspiration while he writes the script, Gauquié explains. “Japanese people filming in France are not doing ‘Emily in Paris,’ so that requires a lot of preparation and meetings,” he points out. \n\n\tCinefrance Studios also developed Kawase’s “Yakushima’s Illusion” from scratch, “right here in this office, to turn it into a film,” says Gauquié. “We didn’t produce it with a Japanese studio, we made with her and she’s the Japanese producer of the project,” he continues. He was introduced to Kawase through her French agent. \n\n\tArtukmaç says the company has gained traction with Japanese filmmaker because they are able to secure significant budgets with European co-production partners (in the absence of a French-Japan co-production treaty), soft money and international sales (which they now handle), but they’re also “making films in a controlled economy that allows you to make films that are truly profitable at the box office.” “We don’t make €40 million films that don’t generate anything,” he says. The other draw is France’s vast pool of talent, many of whom are eager to work with Japanese filmmakers. Hamaguchi, for instance, was able to cast Efira, a major star in France, while Kawase enlisted Krieps and Kurosawa cast Mathieu Amalric and Damien Bonnard. \n\t\n\n\tFrench distributors and TV channels also have an appetite for movies by prestigious Japanese directors. As such, “All of a Sudden,” which is going into post-production, has already secured financing from a long list of partners, including Canal+ and Arte, Eurimage and Diaphana. \n\n\t“I’m still stoked that Hamaguchi trusted us enough to say, ‘My next film after winning an Oscar will be made with these French producers in France,” Gauquié says, “because it’s always a big leap of faith for any director, but especially so for a Japanese filmmaker of that caliber, to trust producers overseas to organize the shoot and the crew he’ll work with on a daily basis.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tPakistani superstar Farhan Saeed will drop his first solo album this month, marking a significant milestone two decades into his career. Saeed, the former lead vocalist of Pakistani band Jal, has built a following across South Asia by excelling in both television dramas and music. He will release “Khat” through Warner Music and Silent Roar’s global distribution network.\n\n\tThe lead single and title track arrives Nov. 14, kicking off a staggered rollout with new songs dropping each month. The album features 10 tracks performed in the Urdu and Punjabi languages.\n\t\n\n\t“Music has always been something I’ve lived,” Saeed said. “I’ve been fortunate that audiences have always understood and connected with how I express myself through my songs. This album is inspired by my fans and their constant love. It’s a letter — a khat — from my heart to theirs.”\n\n\n\tFour tracks will get the music video treatment, with Saeed tapping a different filmmaker for each clip to bring varied creative perspectives to the visuals.\n\n\tOn the acting front, Saeed has feature film “Luv Di Saun” in the pipeline, continuing his parallel track as a screen performer alongside his music career.\n\n\tThe album represents a new creative chapter for Saeed, drawing on his established fanbase while positioning him for broader international reach through Warner’s distribution muscle. The project stays anchored in his linguistic roots while aiming to connect with listeners beyond regional boundaries.\n\n\tBy spacing out the releases monthly rather than dropping the full album at once, Saeed’s team is betting on sustained attention for individual tracks in an increasingly crowded music streaming landscape.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSeven years after its launch, Taiwan-based Each Other Films is stepping into an expanded phase of international production, with co-founder and head producer Jacqueline W. Liu and co-founder and CEO Tiffany Yu-Chia Chen unveiling a diverse lineup that stretches from documentary to big-budget action.\n\n\tThe quartet of projects represents a widening scope for the Taipei company, which has steadily built credentials through festival selections, streaming deals and local box office success since 2017.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the newly revealed titles is a documentary about drag performer Pangina Heals, a figure who bridges Taiwanese and Thai cultures. The film, titled “Heals,” represents the company’s initial move into factual storytelling through international partnership, working alongside Thailand’s N8 and World of Wonder.\n\n\n\tFiction projects include Henry Tsai’s first directorial effort, “Spent Bullets,” adapted from short stories by Taiwan writer Terao Tetsuya. Production will span multiple cities including Silicon Valley, Las Vegas and Taipei. The film has secured spots at both Golden Horse Film Project Promotion and Taiwan Creative Content Fest 2025.\n\n\tThe company is also returning to a proven property with a fresh chapter in its hit “The Accidental Influencer” franchise. Centered on the character Red, “The Accidental Influencer: Love Me If You Dare” will launch next January on both GTV and Netflix, bringing back the series with additional cast members and storylines focused on contemporary relationships.\n\n\tPerhaps the most ambitious entry is “The Odd Three: Madam Tiger,” which director Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu (whose credits include “Little Big Women” and Tokyo-bowing “Double Happiness”) is developing as a large-scale adventure that reinterprets traditional folklore through a modern lens. The project is being positioned as a potential launching point for additional character-driven stories across the region.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve always believed that a story rooted in a specific place, language, or authentic human connections can still move people everywhere,” said Liu. “That’s the power of cinema — it turns the personal into the universal. As we enter this next phase, I’m excited to expand what that means, especially across genre, scale, and collaboration.”\n\n\t“Building a production company means knowing where you want to go, and choosing the right stories and people to take you there,” added Chen. “We’ve spent the past seven years building trust — with creators, with partners, and with each other. Now, we’re ready to scale. The future of Asian storytelling is global, and we’re here to be part of that shift.”\n\n\tThe company’s previous work includes the 2020 theatrical release “Little Big Women,” which topped the Taiwan box office that year and earned recognition at the Golden Horse Awards before landing on Netflix. More recently, “The Accidental Influencer” became an HBO Asia original in 2024, while “Dreams in Nightmares” played Berlin’s Panorama section this year. “Penguin Girl” opened last year’s Kaohsiung Film Festival.\n\n\tOperating under a mission statement emphasizing female perspectives and universal connection, Each Other Films continues developing its pipeline while pursuing additional partnerships across borders.\n",

    "body": "\n\tToho has officially revealed the title of its next “Godzilla” feature: “Godzilla -0.0” (Godzilla Minus Zero). The announcement was made at the annual Godzilla Fest in Tokyo and confirmed via Toho’s official X account.\n\n\tThe film will once again be written, directed and supervised for VFX by Yamazaki Takashi, with VFX work by Shirogumi and production handled by Toho Studios and Robot, the same team behind 2023’s “Godzilla Minus One.” Toho Co., Ltd. will produce and distribute.\n\t\n\n\tA new “Godzilla” film was teased almost exactly a year ago. \n\n\n\tYamazaki’s “Godzilla Minus One” became a landmark hit for the franchise. Released in Japan in November 2023, it grossed more than JPY7.65 billion ($50 million) locally, making it the top-earning live-action Japanese Godzilla film in history. In North America, it earned $56 million, making it the highest grossing Japanese-language live-action film of all time. The film later made history at the 96th Academy Awards, where it won the Oscar for best visual effects — the first “Godzilla” film ever nominated for an Academy Award and the first Japanese feature to win in that category.\n\n\tThe franchise began in 1954 with Ishirō Honda’s “Godzilla,” a grim allegory for nuclear devastation that introduced audiences to the radioactive reptile who would become Japan’s most enduring pop-culture export. Since then, Toho has produced 33 live-action “Godzilla” films across multiple eras — the Showa, Heisei, Millennium, and now Reiwa — while American studios have released five additional titles, including Legendary’s MonsterVerse.\n\t\n\n\tSet in Japan after World War II, “Godzilla Minus One” starred Kamiki Ryunosuke as Shikishima Koichi, a former kamikaze pilot who survives an almost fatal encounter with Godzilla and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. When the massive beast reappears years later, a group of soldiers and veterans must band together to defeat the monster before it can destroy Japan. The cast also includes Hamabe Minami, Yamada Yuki, Aoki Munetaka, Yoshioka Hidetaka, Ando Sakura, and Sasaki Kuranosuke.\n\n\tWith “Godzilla -0.0,” Toho appears to be signaling a continuation of Yamazaki’s “Minus” saga while teasing a thematic reset implied by the “Zero” in its title. No plot or release date has yet been announced, but anticipation is running high for the next stomping move of the King of the Monsters.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the upcoming doc “Newville,” Pisie Hochheim and Tony Oswald follow 10 siblings who “cover the entire American political spectrum.” \n\n\t“They have many different spiritual beliefs and lifestyles. We’ve watched over the years as they’ve managed to ‘leave their swords at the door’ when they gather, as one aunt says,” says Hochheim, who is also a part of the family. \n\n\n\tNow, they return to their childhood home in Newville, NY, for the first time in 35 years. They attempt to repair it, but tensions arise. \n\t\n\n\t“Many people in the U.S. feel completely at odds with their families politically, and it’s understandable to choose to shut out or cut off and move on. But for Tony and me, living with difference and trying to find common ground is a belief we desperately try to hang onto.”\n\n\n\t“Newville” won the Ji.hlava New Visions Award for the most promising U.S. project in partnership with AmDocs and the Jacob Burns Film Center Award. \n\n\t“Europe has an appetite for supporting daring, bold work,” notes Hochheim. The awards will be useful, as resources for U.S. filmmakers are dwindling and they’ve self-funded the project, working as a two-person team. \n\n\tOswald says: “In the U.S., specifically lately, government-backed funding bodies have been cut, existing grants have been slashed and some are closing completely. Private equity or streamers look to a familiar slate of celebrity profiles or true crime docs. Everyone else has to fight over the scraps.”\n\n\tHochheim used to go to the house depicted in the doc for family events and holidays. She later married Oswald on the premises. \n\t\n\n\t“We still visit at least once a year, but for most of the year it sits empty. It’s beautiful, but it’s also 250 years old, and my family doesn’t have the money or time to address all of its problems, although my mother tries.”\n\n\t“Some days, we feel so connected to it we can’t imagine a world where it doesn’t exist. My mum and I have nightmares about it catching on fire or a tree falling on it. But then we hear one of the siblings speaking about it without sentiment, and we remember we haven’t chosen to move back there either. As much as we love it, the house resists us, and we’ve begun to wonder what it wants as much as what we want from it.” \n\n\tIn “Newville,” the house becomes a “container” to showcase the vibrant siblings who grew up there. \n\n\t“They’re hilarious, warm and unique, and have completely different worldviews. We’re very interested in how these worldviews shape their approach to the house, and why some have stayed involved while others think it’s time to let it go.”\n\n\tThis isn’t the first time the filmmaking duo has talked about family. \n\n\t“All of the films Tony and I have directed together so far are either about, or feature, our families. Even our narrative fiction work,” says Hochheim. “Our goal is to see how these small stories can be stretched through art and playful collaboration into more cinematic, universal narratives. We wouldn’t live long enough to make all the films that could spring from our family, but that doesn’t mean they’re biographical.”\n\n\tOswald, whose sister Alicia was featured in their short doc “Cycles,” adds: “We think it’s part of the reason our body of work is so diverse. We try to discover the films through our relationships with them. This has created a mini cinematic universe in which the same faces and locations appear across our very different films.” \n\n\tThough personal, “Newville” has already resonated with its Ji.hlava audience. \n\n\t“We’ve been so heartened to hear how universal this story is. People have come up to us to share their experiences: the sadness of losing a childhood home in Sudan, a house being sold and the discord it caused in Bosnia, or one whose future is unsure in Finland. This very specific story about Newville resonates with people across cultures,” he says, also recalling his experience on “Cycles.” \n\t\n\n\t“It’s a perfect example of how we work: Alicia [who used to anonymously donate eggs] wanted to document the experience and we wanted to tell a story about the wider context of egg donation in America by focusing solely on her,” observes Oswald. But working with family “isn’t without its challenges.” \n\n\t“We can’t wait for the day when we can be at a reunion without considering how it will fit into our movie, or actually help them fix the house instead of just filming them do it!” \n\n\tThey’ve been filming for almost seven years and really got to know the siblings, notes Hochheim.  \n\n\t“Because they’ve spread out across the country and are mostly in their 70s and 80s, filming was honestly the first time I’d had an in-depth conversation with some of them as an adult. We are also interested in what they are finding out about each other. We’ve taken to asking them: ‘What’s the one thing you wish your siblings knew about you’?”\n\n\tBased in Nashville, Hochheim and Oswald are also co-producing and editing “Kinfolk” by Nicole Craine, executive produced by Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst. \n\n\t“It’s a great joy and privilege, and every dinner is a write-off because we live and breathe our movies,” says Hochheim of their creative partnership. Oswald adds: “Our production company is called Same Person Productions. Having someone who can fill in your gaps, someone you trust more than anything, is the greatest gift.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo new releases led the China box office over the weekend of Oct. 31–Nov. 2, according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tMaoyan Movie’s “Her Turn” topped the chart with RMB35.5 million ($5 million) in its opening two-day frame.

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump had kind words for Skydance’s takeover of Paramount and Bari Weiss’ appointment at CBS News during his first sit-down interview with “60 Minutes” in five years.\n\n\tCBS News on Sunday released a transcript of the full 90-minute session with Norah O’Donnell, CBS News’ senior correspondent and a contributor to “60 Minutes.” The conversation touched on a host of topics, from international politics to ICE raids in the U.S. to the economy and healthcare police to the federal government shutdown. The interview was recorded Oct. 31 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Highlights from the interview aired Sunday on “60 Minutes.” \n\t\n\n\tThe session also marks the first time Trump has returned to CBS News for an interview since the network’s parent company reached at $16 million settlement in a lawsuit that Trump filed against the venerable news magazine. CBS’ previous owner, Paramount Communications, wrote the check under pressure as it sought to close the $8 billion Skydance Media transaction. Trump’s baseless claims that “60 Minutes” doctored then-candidate Kamala Harris’ responses in a manner that damaged Trump would have been easily beaten on the legal merits in court, legal experts agree, but the previous Paramount ownership regime buckled under extraordinary pressure brought by President Trump and FCC chairman Brendan Carr. \n\n\n\t” ’60 Minutes’ paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not– you have a great– I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, who’s the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great– from what I know,” Trump said, referring to the appointment last month of Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\t\n\n\t“I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person. But ’60 Minutes’ was forced to pay me– a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news. And I think that it’s happening. I see …I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press,” Trump said.\n\n\tO’Donnell also questioned Trump about the conflicts of his role as Commander in Chief and his family investments and marketing of Trump-branded crypto currencies.\n\n\t“I wanna make crypto great for America. That’s the only thing. I don’t wanna have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto,” Trump said. “Because in crypto it’s a kind of an industry where basically you’re going to have number one and you’re not gonna have a number two. And right now we’re number one by a long shot. I wanna keep it that way. The same way we’re number one with AI, we’re number one with crypto. And I wanna keep it that way.” \n\n\tAsked point-blank about the Trump family crypto activity, Trump was dismissive. “I can’t say, because– I can’t say– I’m not concerned. I don’t– I’d rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, “Can I ask another question?” And I said, yeah. This is the question–.”\n\n\tMuch of the interview was devoted to O’Donnell’s questions about the president’s views on geopolitical hot spots and challenges the U.S. faces in dealing with Russia, China, Israel, Venezuela and other unpredictable situations.\n\n\tWhen it came to discussing economic issues at home, Trump brought his usual bravado and side-stepped O’Donnell’s efforts to press him on any specifics.\n\n\t“We’re doing very well. By the way, the stock market just hit — perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. It’s hit an all-time high 48 times during the course of my — nine-month period. But just yesterday, the stock market hit an all-time high. We’re doing really well, and everybody knows it,” Trump said.\n\t\n\n\tHe blamed his White House predecessors Joe Biden and Barack Obama for myriad problems including the continuing high price of groceries.\n\n\t“It was a dead country, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. We have the strongest stock market, we have everybody wants to come in. A year ago we were a dead country. Right now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. And I did that in nine months. And it’s only gonna get better,” Trump said.\n\n\tO’Donnell pressed Trump on the issue of Justice Department’s recent indictments of Trump’s political foes, including New York state Attorney General Leticia James and former FBI chief James Comey.\n\n\t“I think I’ve been very mild-mannered. You’re looking at a man who was indicted many times, and I had to beat the rap,” Trump told O’Donnell.\n\n\tOn the subject of the brutal ICE raids in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities that have shocked the nation, including some prominent Trump supporters, the president was unbowed.\n\n\t“I think they haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said. O’Donnell asked explicitly if he approved of violent actions taken by heavily masked law enforcement officials in workplaces, schools and courthouses. Trump left no question of where he stands. “Because you have to get the people out,” he said.\n\n\tOn the state of the government shutdown, now heading into its 33rd day, Trump said Republicans “keep voting” despite the fact that House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House in recess for most of the shutdown to date.\n\n\t“What we’re doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they’ve never had this. This has happened like 18 times before,” Trump said. “The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, ‘Give us an extension, we’ll work it out.’ They’ve lost their way. They’ve become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, ‘Let’s vote.’ “\n\n\tOn the subject of the ceasefire in Gaza that Trump helped bring about last month, he disputed O’Donnell’s suggestion that the situation is “fragile.” He threatened to use force against Hamas terrorists if need be.\n\t\n\n\t“Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don’t behave. They know that. If they don’t behave, they’re going to be taken out immediately,” Trump said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore Chloe Zhao and Kore-eda Hirokazu sat down for their Tokyo International Film Festival conversation, they had each been crying over the other’s work.\n\n\tKore-eda watched Zhao’s “Hamnet” in a small screening room with just one other person, grateful no one else was there to see his tears. “I couldn’t stop crying,” the Japanese auteur admitted, moved by the film’s exploration of why creators tell stories and the communal act of experiencing tragedy together.\n\t\n\n\tThat morning of their conversation, Zhao had risen at 4 a.m., jet-lagged, to watch Kore-eda’s 1998 masterpiece “After Life.” She was crying for an hour while her makeup team worked on her before the event. “I said to Kore-eda-san, I feel like ‘Hamnet’ and ‘After Life’ are very much the same film,” Zhao told the TIFF Lounge audience. “Because it is about how when we see our lives, whether it’s joyful or painful, mirrored back to us, it gives these experiences meaning and makes the human experience a little less difficult.”\n\n\n\tThe mutual admiration set the tone for an intimate conversation between two auteurs who share more than they might have expected. The discussion took place as Zhao’s latest feature prepared to close the festival, while Kore-eda is currently in production on his new film “Sheep In The Box,” starring Ayase Haruka and comedian Daigo.\n\n\tThe emotional connection revealed a striking similarity in how both directors approach their work: neither knows how their films will end when they begin shooting.\n\n\t“When I go in to make a film, I never know how it’s going to end,” Zhao explained. “I will write it on the page so it reads nice, so it gets greenlit and gets money to make a film. But I know deep inside – and often my lead actors know – that it’s not there.”\n\t\n\n\tThis creative philosophy nearly proved disastrous on “Hamnet.” Four days before production wrapped, only two people at the Globe Theatre knew there was no working ending to the film: Zhao and her lead actress, Jessie Buckley.\n\n\t“I filmed the ending that was on the script,” Zhao recalled. “I looked at it and said, ‘This doesn’t work. We don’t have a film.'” She remembered Buckley’s reaction: “Jessie’s looking at me like, ‘This is it? I went through all of this and this is the ending?'”\n\n\tThe breakthrough came the following morning during a car ride through rainy London. Buckley sent Zhao Max Richter’s “On the Nature of Daylight” – the haunting track that appeared in “Arrival” and other films. “That song has a very special ability to harmonize your whole body to the world around you,” Zhao said. “You suddenly feel like one with everything.”\n\n\tWhile listening to the song, Zhao found herself reaching for the rain outside the car window. “I wanted to reach nature so that I can no longer be afraid of losing my love, because if we’re all one, then you can’t lose love. It just transforms into something else.” In that moment of personal grief and creative desperation, the film’s true ending revealed itself.\n\n\t“I always wait for the ending to show up, which is very stressful because you’re always this little bit from not having a film,” Zhao admitted. “But that’s how life is.”\n\n\tKore-eda expressed understanding, revealing his own unconventional process. He creates storyboards but abandons them once on set. “I’m always looking about two weeks ahead,” he said through translation. “I look at the schedule to see which actors will be on set, and I think about what I can do. I actually write and rewrite the script on set in that space. The staff are probably nervous, but what emerges this way rarely feels wrong.”\n\n\tZhao drew a distinction between her latest work and her previous films. “‘Hamnet’ is about the internal landscape, as opposed to ‘Nomadland,’ which is about the external landscape,” she explained.\n\n\tWorking with cinematographer Lukasz Żal for the first time, Zhao shifted from the wide-open horizons of her earlier American films to something more contained. “In my previous films, I was in my 30s and very much about chasing as many horizons as possible. So it wass about going wide. With ‘Hamnet,’ I was interested in how can we confine everything into one frame, one stage, one room, so that the water can go deeper.”\n\t\n\n\tThis theatrical approach led Zhao to ask Kore-eda about his own precisely composed frames, which often recall stage backdrops. The Japanese director explained that he exchanges few words with his cinematographer on set, preferring to explore each other’s intentions through the camera itself. “It’s very enjoyable,” he said. “If I just followed the storyboard, it would just be about consuming a tight schedule.”\n\n\tWhen asked why she works in fiction rather than documentary, Zhao offered a surprising answer about courage – or her lack of it. “I think when you’re making a documentary, you’re saying, ‘This is me and this is the subject,'” she explained, citing Werner Herzog’s “Into the Abyss” as an example of fearless documentary filmmaking. “I haven’t found that courage in my 30s to do that work.”\n\n\tBut there was another reason, rooted in representation and dignity. Zhao spoke about marginalized communities in America – people on reservations or living in vans – who are often documented with rough digital cameras under unflattering lights, studied as social issues rather than human beings.\n\n\t“If you are with them in their lifestyle, you are exposed to the most beautiful landscape of America,” Zhao said. “And cinema’s cinematic treatments, these painterly images, are usually – because of circumstances of history – preserved for certain demographic people.”\n\n\tWorking with her cinematographer, Zhao insisted on capturing these faces with the same cinematic treatment as any Hollywood star, shooting at the golden hour. “The quality of lighting makes us feel like we’re one with light. And that kind of sunset and sunrise, these people who aren’t in big cities, or have the privilege many of us do, are actually experiencing on a daily basis.”\n\n\t“Sometimes poetry can capture truth better than facts can,” Zhao concluded. “It is an emotional truth, not just fact.”\n\n\tZhao found unexpected freedom in her outsider status. “I only saw two and a half westerns when I made my own westerns,” she laughed. “I didn’t have the burdens on my shoulders as Americans do about making a Western. And when I made this Shakespeare, I don’t know Shakespeare very well, so I don’t have the burden as a British person. Everything about Shakespeare is so sacred. I just do whatever I want.”\n\t\n\n\tThis cavalier approach masks an earlier struggle. When Zhao first came to America for school, her insecurity about language was so profound that she gave up on storytelling and studied politics instead. “I didn’t think I could tell stories. How can I do it if I don’t speak a language?”\n\n\tBut her favorite films had lots of silence. “There’s a language of how your face moves and how your body moves,” she realized. “And if you don’t speak the language, you actually develop an extra sensitivity to nonverbal interactions.” What was once a challenge became an advantage.\n\n\tBefore the conversation, Zhao had watched Kore-eda’s 1998 masterpiece “After Life” – a film about newly deceased people who must choose one memory to take into eternity while workers in a way station create film recreations of those memories.\n\n\t“I was crying for an hour,” Zhao confessed, explaining how the film resonated with her work on “Hamnet,” which deals with how Shakespeare and his wife processed the death of their son. “When we see our lives, whether it’s joyful or painful, mirrored back to us, it gives these experiences meaning and makes the human experience a little less difficult.”\n\n\tShe identified with the characters in “After Life” who choose not to select a memory, instead staying in limbo to help others. “My favorite memories in my life are actually while making belief, while making fantasies that are not real, for other people’s memories,” Zhao said. “When you see ‘Hamnet,’ you’ll see that Shakespeare is also a man who has a lot of trouble connecting and communicating in real life. But when he’s on his stage, he can connect with everything. So there’s a bittersweetness to many of us who chose to be storytellers.”\n\n\tKore-eda, who made “After Life” in his 20s, acknowledged this tension still exists for him in his 60s. “I want to keep making work without becoming cynical about that feeling,” he said.\n\n\tZhao praised Kore-eda’s films for their focus on mundane details – laundry, cooking, daily routines – that create a meditative rhythm before emotional tsunamis arrive. “A lot of times cinema skips past the 80% in between, showing only the highs and the super lows,” Zhao observed. “But you invite us into the comfort of these daily rituals. And through that, it goes and it pushes us off. It’s like some kind of ritual and the piece comes in a loop. And then when it hits you, it’s in the body.”\n\t\n\n\tKore-eda modestly accepted the compliment, saying he hopes to build stories from small emotional fluctuations in daily life, though he’s unsure how well he succeeds.\n\n\tThe conversation also touched on practical matters. Kore-eda shoots for roughly two months and tries to finish before dinner when children are on set, adhering to improved labor rules in Japanese production. He also edits at night during production, sometimes sending footage to his team for feedback the next day – a practice that elicits nervous anticipation from his crew.\n\n\tZhao, by contrast, needs eight hours of sleep and doesn’t touch the edit during production. “I’m so easily influenced by everyone around me,” she explained. “If I edit something early on and it hasn’t quite worked, it might change how I want to do things.” “Hamnet” shot from late July through September.\n\n\tWhen asked about the tension between communal theatrical experiences and streaming platforms, both directors acknowledged the paradox. Kore-eda said he still can’t separate the act of watching a film with someone in the dark from what cinema means to him. “That’s why we need film festivals – so that experience doesn’t cease to exist.”\n\n\tZhao agreed about the importance of communal viewing – it’s central to “Hamnet’s” themes – but also celebrated how technology has democratized access. “Because of iPhones and technology, ‘Songs My Brothers Taught Me’ could be watched by a teenager in South Dakota on the Lakota reservation. I think that is an incredible thing.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, Zhao said she believes stories choose filmmakers, not the other way around. “When the conduit, the lightning conductor is ready, it will come.”\n\n\tShe has noticed patterns: her first three films explored identity, home and belonging, while “Eternals” and “Hamnet” deal with oneness and dissolving the illusion of separation. “I think that’s what I’m looking for – how do we dissolve the illusion of separation that we feel with each other, and feel that kind of oneness that you feel in the moment you are born or when you’re in nature.”\n\n\t“I believe in the power of threes,” she added. “Since I made two about that, I think there’s a third one. I just don’t know what it is.”\n\n\tAs for Kore-eda, he continues production on “Sheep In The Box,” maintaining the work-life balance that isn’t really a balance at all. “I’ve become someone who’s always working, and that’s not unpleasant for me,” he admitted. But he wants younger filmmakers to know they don’t have to be 60-year-old workaholics to make films. “If they think filmmaking might be fun even when choosing it as work, that would be good.”\n",

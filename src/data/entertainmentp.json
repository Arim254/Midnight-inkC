    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tDove is entering the Ton.\n\n\tThe personal care brand has teamed with Netflix’s “Bridgerton” for a limited-edition bodycare collection timed to the show’s highly anticipated fourth season next month. The Dove x Bridgerton line is packaged in bespoke Regency-inspired packaging and includes four new limited-edition scents: Moonlit Masquerade (hydrangea, eucalyptus and warm musk), Whispering Wisteria (orchid, champagne and watery florals), Raspberry Rendezvous —(raspberry, rose, peony and whipped cream) and Love & Meadows (bergamot, wildflowers and rose with amber and cedarwood).\n\n\n\tThe lineup launched exclusively on Target.com on Dec. 25 and rolled out in Target stores beginning Dec. 28, with prices ranging from $3.99 to $7.99. The products are available for a limited time only.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIMITED-EDITION\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDove x Bridgerton Personal Care Collection\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe Dove x Bridgerton collection spans body wash, body scrub, body mist, hand wash, antiperspirant deodorant and beauty bars, all featuring Dove’s familiar moisturizing formulas. The four fragrances nod directly to the show’s romantic storylines and set pieces: Moonlit Masquerade pairs hydrangea, eucalyptus and warm musk; Whispering Wisteria blends orchid, champagne and watery florals; Raspberry Rendezvous leans into a playful gourmand mix of raspberry, rose and whipped cream; and Love & Meadows combines bergamot, wildflowers and rose with amber and cedarwood, inspired by Sophie and Benedict’s long-awaited connection.\n\n\tProduced by Shondaland, the Netflix series has become a merchandising and cultural juggernaut since its debut, with fashion, beauty and lifestyle brands increasingly eager to tap into its pastel-drenched fantasy. Sandie Bailey, Shondaland co-president and chief innovation and design officer, framed the partnership as a natural extension of the company’s long-standing values around inclusivity and authenticity. “We are proud that this incredible product line carries those values forward and are excited to see fans of the Ton and Dove give themselves the ‘Bridgerton’ royal treatment they deserve,” she saidi in a statement.\n\n\n\tSeason 4 of “Bridgerton” will premiere on Netflix in two batches, debuting Jan. 29 and continuing Feb. 26, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeyer Gottlieb, who headed Samuel Goldwyn Films and produced films including “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,” died Monday in Los Angeles. He was 86. \n\n\tTom Rothman, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, said in a statement, “Meyer was a gentleman of the old school. I was fortunate to work for him when he ran the Samuel Goldwyn Company, in the heyday of independent film. I learned an enormous amount from him — most importantly, that it is possible to make a life in Hollywood without sacrificing integrity and honesty, both of which he embodied entirely, along with smarts, wisdom, and kindness. I send my sincere condolences to his loving family during this difficult time.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Poland just before the Germans invaded, Gottlieb was a Holocaust survivor who lived in Ukraine labor camps during the war and then in a displaced person’s camp in Germany. After a great aunt brought him to Los Angeles, he learned English at school and eventually graduated from UCLA. \n\n\n\tHe became president and COO of the Samuel Goldwyn Co. in 1988 after helped Samuel Goldwyn Jr. revive the company in 1978 with classic films from Goldwyn’s father’s library. \n\n\tAmong the other films he produced for Goldwyn were “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” remake, starring Ben Stiller. As a top Goldwyn executive, he shepherded releases including the received Michael Apted film “Amazing Grace,” “Mystic Pizza,” “Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,” “Super Size Me” and “The Squid and the Whale.”\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife Pattikay, two daughters and two grandchildren.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpike Lee has paid tribute to his longtime collaborator Isiah Whitlock Jr., who died on Tuesday in New York at age 71. \n\n\tLee shared a photo of himself with Whitlock on Instagram on Tuesday, writing, “Today I Learned Of The Passing Of My Dear Beloved Brother ISIAH WHITLOCK. GOD BLESS.”\n\n\tWhitlock played small roles in several of Lee’s films, including “Red Hook Summer,” “Chi-Raq,” “She Hate Me” and “25th Hour.” His two major roles in Lee’s filmography came with “Da Five Bloods,” in which he plays Vietnam veteran Melvin alongside Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters and Norm Lewis, and “BlackKkKlansman,” in which he starred as police officer Mr. Turrentine alongside Alec Baldwin, John David Washington and Robert John Burke.\n\t\n\n\tBrian Liebman, Whitlock’s manager, shared the news of his death in an Instagram post. He wrote, “It is with tremendous sadness that I share the passing of my dear friend and client Isiah Whitlock Jr. If you knew him — you loved him. A brilliant actor and even better person. May his memory forever be a blessing. Our hearts are so broken. He will be very, very missed.”\n\n\tWhitlock was best known for playing the crooked state senator Clay Davis on “The Wire.” He also appeared in a recurring role on Seasons 2 through 4 of “Veep” as U.S. Secretary of Defense George Maddox, who runs against Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ character Selina Meyer in the 2016 primaries.\n\n\tThe Indiana-born character actor also had small roles in “Goodfellas,” “Chappelle’s Show,” “Pieces of April,” “Enchanted,” “Cars 3” and “Lightyear.” His voice can be heard in Pixar’s “Hoppers,” which is set to debut in 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis year, David Ellison managed to do for Warner Bros. Discovery what WBD CEO David Zaslav had struggled to do for more than three years: dramatically boost the market value of the company that combined Discovery and Warner Bros.\n\n\tShares of Warner Bros. Discovery, formed in April 2022, zoomed to all-time highs in 2025 — up more than 170% for the year. WBD as of Dec. 30 has a market capitalization of $71.8 billion, up from about $25 billion at the start of the year.\n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery’s Wall Street rally was triggered by Ellison: After his Skydance Media had swallowed up Paramount Global, he aggressively set his sights on buying WBD next — backed with billions from his father, Larry Ellison — and triggered an M&A battle that caused big swings in the stocks of WBD, Paramount Skydance and Netflix.\n\n\n\tNetflix shares were up as much as 51% in mid-2025, as the streaming leader continued to show solid growth and analysts continued to be bullish on its future prospects. In October, amid the continuing climb of its share price, Netflix executed a 10-for-1 stock split, to make it more affordable. 22.3% as of Dec. 30.\n\n\tAfter Netflix announced an $83 billion deal to buy Warner Bros.’s studios and HBO Max businesses, investors got spooked at the prospect of the deal’s uncertainty and heavy debt load. Still, Netflix shares ended the year up around 22%. Paramount shareholders, meanwhile, were enthusiastic about David Ellison’s play for the company, but PSKY’s stock price has fallen down as WBD repeatedly rebuffed the Paramount bid.\n\n\tComcast, which made an unsuccessful bid that proposed combining the WBD streaming and studios business with Comcast’s related businesses, saw its stock price languish, closing down 17% for the year. On Jan. 2, Comcast’s spin-off of Versant (comprising cable networks like CNBC, MS NOW and USA) is set to close. The goal of the Versant transaction is to unshackle the NBC broadcast and Peacock streaming businesses from the declining cable TV networks and convince investors the newly streamlined Comcast is worth more.\n\t\n\n\tThe M&A drama surrounding Warner Bros. isn’t over yet. David Ellison has launched a hostile takeover attempt for Warner Bros. Discovery, hoping to convince WBD shareholders that his $30-per-share bid (which the WBD board has rejected) is a better than Netflix’s terms. Last week, Paramount Skydance updated its offer for WBD with certain new provisions; among those, Larry Ellison made an “irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion” toward Paramount’s all-cash offer for WBD. The WBD board is expected to turn that down, too, with a formal response in the next few days.\n\n\tWhether the Ellisons will go higher in their quest to capture Warner Bros. Discovery remains to be seen. Note that whoever ends up owning Warner Bros. Discovery, Zaslav stands to cash in from a sale: He’s set to become a billionaire given his WBD stock holdings regardless of whether Netflix completes the deal or Paramount Skydance swoops in to poach the whole company.\n\n\tHere’s a chart showing the performance of top media stocks:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreated with Datawrapper\n\t\n\n\n",

You’re in luck. One of the best online learning sites is Rosetta Stone, and right now, the site is offering a limited-time deal that gets you unlimited access to Rosetta Stone‘s language-learning program for 45% off.\n\n\tWhile a monthly subscription to Rosetta Stone starts at $15.99 and up, this deal gets you unlimited access to Rosetta Stone forever, for a one-time payment of only $219. That’s right: buy one price now and lock in access to the online learning site for life. The deal is a nearly half-off discount from the original price of $399, and the best Rosetta Stone deal we’ve ever seen.\n\n\n\tPrefer less of a commitment? The new Rosetta Stone promo also drops the price of their single-language, 12-month access plan, to just $143 (regularly $239+). Meanwhile, a three-month plan is down to $47.85 for all three months (regularly $60).\n\n\tAll Rosetta Stone’s plans offer bite-sized lessons available online and offline; it’s a fully immersive environment for long-lasting learning, with leading speech recognition technology to perfect your accent.

    "body": "\n\tSince being founded in 1996, Disney Entertainment Television has become a platform for rising actors to begin their careers on screen. As the brand is gearing up for 2026, the year marks two milestones for the company: 20 years of “Hannah Montana” and “High School Musical,” where actors and musicians like Miley Cyrus, Zac Efron, and Ashley Tisdale got their start on children’s programming. For Brenda Kelly Grant, Senior Vice President, fostering and uplifting the industry’s upcoming slate of actors is key when it comes to future programming.\n\t\n\n\t“For my entire casting team, we remember that everyone we’re looking at is in a stage of becoming,” reveals Grant. “It’s our job to interpret the gray area. We have an initiative where we will actually help talent. For example, if we have really good actors, but they’re not so great at singing or dancing, we’ll pair them up as it gets closer to the testing process with coaches who can help them with the singing and with the dancing. Our objective is to remember that this talent is becoming. We want to create the very best atmosphere for them from the beginning of the audition process until hopefully they move to other places within our company.”\n\n\n\tThroughout the last few years, former Disney talent such as the Jonas Brothers and Selena Gomez have returned to collaborate with young actors on projects like “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” and “Wizards Beyond Waverly Place.” It’s an opportunity for young actors to gain insight into working at Disney, while also offering former stars the chance to explore what they’re passionate about on or off screen.\n\t\n\n\t “I think why they come back and work with us is about the opportunities and the scope of what the Walt Disney Company can offer them,” said Grant. “We have so many sandboxes to play in, whether it’s producing, creating, or doing voice overs. The possibilities are endless. It really goes through all of our senior leadership of just creating a best home for talent and being able to be in partnership with people to create what they want to see and what they want to feel.”\n\n\tWith the release of Season 2 of “Percy Jackson and The Olympians,” Grant is excited for audiences to see and connect with actors like Walker Scobel, Leah Sava Jeffries, and Aryan Simhadri as they begin to return to Camp Half-Blood. As the leads of the series, Grant is hopeful that the casting and work of younger actors at Disney Entertainment Television resonates with viewers at any age.\n\n\t“Walker was a young kid in the casting process, and now he’s like a man,” said Grant. “When I see Leah come to me and she’s like, “You know what? What else can I do?” People see themselves in our talent. They see their stories and their experiences, and the challenges that you face in the world of becoming an adult. They see the power and like what they’re doing. That’s really appealing to people. We always not just want to meet our viewers where they’re at, but we want to exceed those expectations.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSimu Liu said in a new interview with Collider that Robert Downey Jr. had a “convoy of trailers” on the set of “Avengers: Doomsday,” which the film’s cast and crew hilariously named “Downey Land.” Liu returns to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Shang-Chi in the 2026 tentpole opposite Downey as the villainous Doctor Doom. Downey’s return to Marvel as a villain and not in his iconic Iron Man role is fueling the majority of interest in “Doomsday.” It appears the studio pulled out all the stops on set for the Oscar winner’s grand return.\n\t\n\n\t“Downey famously has this convoy of trailers and this whole area in base camp that we affectionately called Downey Land,” Liu said. “And I remember getting invited to Downey Land for the first time and just showing up in this tent, and it’s all this beautiful Andy Warhol-esque artwork, except all the characters are Downey. I mean, he’s so self-aware.”\n\n\n\t“So, he greeted me, and then I didn’t realize that Downey Land has its own chefs, but I had brought my set lunch, and he was like, ‘Oh, no, no, no. We don’t do that here,’” Liu continued. “The chefs had come and laid out this full buffet, and I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll put this away.’ And then just the people walking through, I was like, ‘I cannot believe I’m having lunch with these people.’”\n\n\tLiu and Downey are just two members of the sprawling “Avengers: Doomsday” cast, which mixes Marvel stalwarts like Chris Hemsworth, Florence Pugh and Tom Hiddleston with returning X-Men actors like Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn and James Marsden, plus new MCU favorites like Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby and a lot more. It’s unclear which actors Liu shares scenes with in the film, but it’s safe to say he was a big admirer of every scene partner.\n\t\n\n\t“For me, it was very imperative that I put that fan side away,” Liu told Collider. “I compartmentalized that side of me because I was like, ‘I have a job to do. I have a job to do, and the worst thing that I can do right now is be a fan. I’m not a fan. I’m a coworker.’ As ridiculous as that sounds, or as ridiculous as it sounded to me at the time, I was like, ‘No. I have to treat these people as my equals, even though I’m literally like a little boy right now.’”\n\n\t“Avengers: Doomsday” opens in theaters Dec. 18 from Disney.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIsiah Whitlock Jr., an actor best known for playing the corrupt state senator Clay Davis on “The Wire,” died on Tuesday in New York, Variety has confirmed. He was 71.\n\n\tHis manager, Brian Liebman, shared the news on Instagram, writing: “It is with tremendous sadness that I share the passing of my dear friend and client Isiah Whitlock Jr. If you knew him — you loved him. A brilliant actor and even better person. May his memory forever be a blessing. Our hearts are so broken. He will be very, very missed.”\n\t\n\n\tIndiana-born Whitlock was a prolific character actor who was a frequent collaborator of Spike Lee, appearing in his films “BlacKkKlansman,” “Da 5 Bloods,” “She Hate Me,” “25th Hour,” “Red Hook Summer” and “Chi-Raq.” \n\n\n\tAcross many of his projects, he developed the catchphrase “sheeeeee-it,” an elongated pronunciation of the word “shit.”  It started in “She Hate Me” and “25th Hour,” and then the writers of “The Wire” began incorporating it into the HBO series. Whitlock said he could be stopped on the street two to three times per day by fans asking him to say the catchphrase. In a meta turn, Whitlock got to play a man obsessed with “The Wire” in the 2011 comedy “Cedar Rapids.”\n\n\tWhitlock also played a doctor in Martin Scorsese’s “Goodfellas” and had roles in “Chappelle’s Show,” “Pieces of April,” “Enchanted” and Pixar’s “Cars 3” and “Lightyear.” He also lent his voice to “Hoppers,” Pixar’s animated sci-fi comedy due in 2026.\n\n\tIn Seasons 2 through 4 of “Veep,” Whitlock played George Maddox, the U.S. Secretary of Defense who runs against Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ character Selina Meyer in the 2016 primaries.\n",

Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” is available on Disney+ after earning more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office, while Warner Bros.’ “A Minecraft Movie” is streaming on HBO Max and Prime Video after its $958 million box office run. China’s animated sensation “Ne Zha 2” is ready to watch on HBO Max after earning $2.1 billion worldwide, which makes it the top grosser of 2025. These three movies are the biggest of 2025 along with “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” both of which are in theaters and won’t arrive on Disney+ until 2026.\n\n\tThe best movies of the year are also now available to stream. Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” topped Variety’s best films of 2025 list and is now available on HBO Max. Several other critical favorites and Oscar contenders are also ready for home viewing, from “Bugonia” (Peacock) to “Sorry Baby” (HBO Max), “Frankenstein” (Netflix), “Sinners” (HBO Max), “Weapons” (HBO Max) and more.\n\n\tCheck out a full rundown below of the best and/or biggest movies of 2025 now available to stream.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t28 Years Later (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDanny Boyle and Alex Garland’s “28 Years Later” was named the fifth best movie of 2025 by Variety film critic Peter Debruge: “The reason this movie rocked me — emotionally, I mean — is that Boyle et al clearly recognized they were telling a post-pandemic narrative for a society (ours) that had just endured a pandemic (COVID-19), building in an opportunity to grieve and process what we’ve collectively been through via the cathartic Bone Temple sequence.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBlack Bag (Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSteven Soderberg’s excellent thriller “Black Bag” is a sturdy caper dealing in espionage thrills. The film stars Michael Fassbender as an insect-like spy, bugging out as he carefully probes his peers, including his wife (Cate Blanchett, perfect as the femme fatale), to discover a traitor among the ranks. The film was named one of Variety’s best movies of 2025: “Soderbergh’s perfectly ingenious romantic thriller about two married British spies trying to outmaneuver each other is the year’s most captivating bauble.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBring Her Back (HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Talk to Me” directors Danny and Michael Philippou reunited with A24 this summer for “Bring Her Back,” which Variety named one of the best horror movies of 2025: “The rare horror movie unnerving enough to disturb your sleep. Its creep factor begins with Sally Hawkins’ impishly disturbing performance as a foster mother from hell, who takes a couple of orphaned siblings — 17-year-old Andy (Billy Barratt) and his legally blind sister, Piper (Sora Wong) — under her broken wing… the movie finds terrifying ways to get under your skin, pushing everything to the brink of transgression, using domestic trauma to create a symphonic projection of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, all sealed by Hawkins’ gargoyle grin of evil.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBugonia (Peacock)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tYorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone’s latest collaboration “Bugonia” was named the fourth best movie of 2025 by Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman: “Lanthimos’s wild and woolly kidnap drama is a violent, hate-fueled, thrillingly warped act of cinematic screw-tightening. It’s also rooted in a humanity that sneaks up on you… For a while, it’s like watching ‘Misery’ restaged as a riveting culture-war two-hander. But Stone and, especially, Plemons keep deepening their characters. (He does a piece of acting that’s like tragedy on the high wire.) And the trick ending has a blow-you-away power that’s worth a dozen doomsday dystopias.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDangerous Animals (Shudder)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©IFC Films/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJai Courtney is a shark-obsessed serial killer in Shudder’s white-knuckle horror movie “Dangerous Animals,” which earned rave reviews out of the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Courtney plays a deranged Australian tour guide who steers you out to sea and lets you swim with the sharks. Then he feeds you to them. From Variety’s review: “We have screenwriter Nick Lepard to thank for these vivid new nightmares, presented with such conviction by ‘The Devil’s Candy’ director Sean Byrne that the efficient and highly effective thriller scarcely allows a calm moment in which to question how deranged its premise truly is.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDie My Love (Mubi)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Mubi/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJennifer Lawrence’s “Die My Love” struggled at the box office this fall with $5 million domestically and $10 million worldwide, but more curious moviegoers are hopefully discovering the psychodrama on Mubi. Lawrence gives an acclaimed performance as a new mother who spirals into madness while dealing with postpartum and a husband (Robert Pattinson) who can’t support her needs.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDrop (Peacock and Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Christopher Landon crafts a pulpy surveillance mystery that gives way to something giddy and exciting,” reads Variety’s review of “Drop,” the Blumhouse thriller starring Meghann Fahy as a widowed mother whose first date takes a nightmarish turn when she begins receiving threatening text messages. “The film’s complicated setups are executed with a deft and capable hand. Although set in a fine dining establishment, it’s a junk-food thriller fried to near-perfection, balancing the tensions of kidnapping, conspiracy and murder with those of a nerve-wracking first date. It’s crisp and delicious.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEddington (HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAri Aster’s “Eddington” stars Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone and Austin Butler. The movie is set in a small New Mexico town come undone by politics, COVID and more. “Just when you think you’ve got ‘Eddington’ pinned down as a coherent and even conventional suspense tale, the movie wriggles out from under you and enters a terrain of stranger things,” writes Variety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman in his review. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tF1 (Apple TV)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBrad Pitt’s racing blockbuster “F1” is streaming on Apple TV after grossing $631 million at the worldwide this summer to become the biggest box office hit of the actor’s career (unadjusted for inflation). The movie, directed by “Top Gun: Maverick” helmer Joseph Kosinski, follows Pitt’s character as he emerges from retirement to coach a rookie driver (Damson Idris) and save a failing F1 team.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFantastic Four: First Steps (Disney+)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Fantastic Four: First Steps” grossed $521 million in the theaters worldwide over the summer and got Marvel back on a more solid critical footing. Depicting the titular superhero family are Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm/The Thing.

After being plagued by recurring nightmares, she begins to embark on a journey to track down who may be able to help her break the cycle and save her family from their deaths.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFrankenstein (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGuillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” is a passion project from the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who adapts Mary Shelley’s iconic novel with Oscar Isaac as the eponymous mad scientist and Jacob Elordi as his misunderstood creature. At TIFF, the film came in as the runner-up for the fest’s coveted people’s choice award — an accolade that’s traditionally a key bellwether for the Oscar race. The supporting cast includes Mia Goth and Christoph Waltz. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFreakier Friday (Disney+)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe sequel to the 2003 comedy classic once again stars Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis as a daughter and mother who swap places, but this time the women find themselves swapping with the daughter and soon-to-be daughter in law of Lohan’s character. “The movie winds up being rather touching,” wrote Variety‘s film critic Owen Gleiberman in his review. “It’s all about how Harper and Lily, in trying to break up their parents’ engagement, discover that they really do want to be sisters.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFriendship (HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA24’s black comedy “Friendship,” starring Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd, was a spring hit at the indie box office with $16 million domestically. Robinson plays a socially awkward husband whose infatuation with a charismatic new neighbor (Rudd) leads to unexpected consequences. Kate Mara and Jack Dylan Grazer also star. From Variety’s review: “While we may think, at first, that we’re watching a comedy about a sad-sack geek who’s drawn out of his shell, the film always makes sure that Craig, as inhabited by Robinson, is a notch weirder and more off-putting than we expect.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLa Grazia (Mubi)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tToni Servillo was awarded the Volpi Cup for best actor at the Venice Film Festival this year for his performance as fictional Italian president Mariano De Santis in “La Grazia,” the latest from “The Great Beauty” Oscar winner Paolo Sorrentino. Per the official synopsis: “As his term draws to a close, amid uneventful days, two final duties arise: deciding on two delicate petitions for a presidential pardon. True moral dilemmas, which become tangled, in ways that seem impossible to unravel, with his private life. Driven by doubt, he will have to decide. And, with a deep sense of responsibility, that is exactly what this remarkable Italian President will do.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHedda (Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Candyman” and “The Marvels” director Nia DaCosta returns before next year’s “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” with a sizzling and seductive reimagining of Henrik Ibsen’s “Hedda Gabler.” Simply titled “Hedda,” the film stars Tessa Thompson as the eponymous woman who navigates a house she does not want, a marriage she feels trapped in and an ex-lover who has reappeared in her life.

The film, a New York City-spin on Akira Kurosawa’s kidnapping drama “High and Low,” world premiered to strong reviews at Cannes. From Variety’s review: “Washington plays a music mogul who faces a series of big moral choices in a film whose sensational third act more than justifies what might have seemed an unnecessary update.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe History of Sound (Mubi)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDirected by Oliver Hermanus (“Living,” “Moffie”) and starring Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor, “The History of Sound” follows two young men, Lionel (Mescal) and David (O’Connor), in the shadows of WWI who are determined to record the lives, voices and music of Americans. As they begin to log the events, the two fall in love. The film was penned by Ben Shattuck, adapted from his own award-winning short story.

Adam Sandler plays the actor’s manager, while Laura Dern stars as his publicist. From Variety’s review: “Directed by Noah Baumbach, from a script he co-wrote with the actor Emily Mortimer, ‘Jay Kelly’ is a fictional inside-the-movie-world portrait that’s been made with a great deal of care and affection and entertaining dish; it’s the definition of a movie that goes down easy.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJurassic World Rebirth (Peacock)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tUniversal’s “Jurassic” franchise roared back to life on the big screen over the summer when the Scarlett Johansson-led “Jurassic World Rebirth” earned a mighty $867 million at the worldwide box office.

Lofton.\n      \n    \n          Since it was the last \"TMZ After Dark\" of 2025, the night centered on New Year’s resolutions ... with Lofton actively engaging passengers by asking about their goals for the year ahead.\n      \n    \n          As the buses returned to Hollywood Boulevard, the energy only intensified -- no one wanted to get off!\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The DJ kept the music going, the buses turned into dance floors, and the night ended with everyone dancing instead of disembarking!\n      \n    \n          The tour also included standout nightlife stops, with shoutouts to Scum and Villainy, an outer-space-themed bar that gave us their famous \"blue milk\" cosmic shots ... Saddle Ranch, which gave us gummy-flavored shots and FREE CHICKEN STRIPS ... Rainbow Bar & Grill for a live band experience, where passengers took their apple whiskey shots and watched a live performance ... and The Burgundy Room, a fan-favorite stop known for its pirate-ship divey vibe, where we got green tea shots.\n      \n    \n          It was the perfect celebratory send-off to the year ... the new year is right around the corner ... snag your tickets to the hottest party in town -- grab yours right here and come turn up with us!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Tours\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Holidays\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\t“Our objective today is to figure out the nature of this project and what we must do to contain it.”\n\n\tThe line is from the trailer to “White Horse,” which got its unofficial debut on Tuesday at the federal trial of director Carl Rinsch, who is accused of swindling Netflix out of millions in the course of the boondoggle production.The show, which was never completed, was pitched to the streamer as a high-concept thriller about the rise of humanoid OI’s (organic intelligences) and the human factions determined to destroy them. Described as a mix of “Star Wars,” “Westworld” and “The Matrix,” the series was once touted by Netflix execs as their next big franchise.But those dreams faltered when the big-budget series began to face major production issues in the fall of 2019. Netflix tried to solve the problems by sending Rinsch an additional $11 million. That was March 2, 2020 — just before the pandemic disrupted nearly every production. Netflix never saw any additional footage or material for “White Horse” and ultimately wrote off its entire investment.Over five years later, Rinsch, 48, is facing many years behind bars if convicted of wire fraud, money laundering and making a series of illegal transactions. The “47 Ronin” filmmaker is alleged to have used the $11 million for his own benefit, buying a $740,000 Ferrari, a $340,000 watch and four luxury mattresses totaling $638,000, among other purchases.\n\n\n\t“This is a case about greed and lies,” the prosecutor told the jury, saying Rinsch “saw an opportunity to make a killing” in the stock market at the start of the pandemic and “deceived” multiple employees at Netflix to get the $11 million. “And Netflix paid because they continued to believe in the project.”\n\t\n\n\tProsecutors say Rinsch routed the money through multiple bank accounts before moving it into his personal brokerage account. He then “went on a spending spree,” they alleged. \n\n\tThe government told jurors they’ll “be able to follow the money” through testimony from witnesses Rinsch allegedly deceived, including his financial manager, personal assistant, bookkeeper and editor. Several Netflix executives, including Cindy Holland, who is now head of streaming at Paramount, are also expected to take the stand.\n\n\tDefense attorney Michael Arthus offered a more favorable portrayal in his opening statement, painting Rinsch as an artist embroiled in a contract dispute — not a criminal. Arthus called him a “luminary and visionary who can breathe new light into a universe that doesn’t exist” — but suggested he was in over his head as a producer.\n\t\n\n\t“The artist Carl valued the story more than the producer Carl worried what it would cost,” Arthus said.\n\n\tThe lawyer also blamed “executive group think” and the pandemic for pushing the project off the rails.\n\n\t“He was Vincent van Gogh with a Netflix deal struggling with his benefactor,” Arthus concluded. “This is the story of a creative genius… He couldn’t quite deliver, but that doesn’t make him a fraud.”\n\n\tRinsch scribbled notes in a yellow legal pad during opening statements.\n\n\tPeter Friedlander, who recently left Netflix to become head of global television at Amazon MGM Studios, was the first witness to testify. He and Holland were the two main execs who acquired “White Horse,” alongside producers Keanu Reeves, Rian Johnson and Gabby Roses, who is Rinsch’s ex-wife. He testified about the project’s initial presentation, saying Rinsch brought him five to six short episodes that were “visionary.” The trailer was played for the jury, which featured Cronenberg-esque body horror and finished visual effects.\n\n\tWhile Rinsch’s original pitch outlined 13 episodes with runtimes of four to 14 minutes, Friedlander set forward a plan to shoot a significant amount of new footage, requiring Rinsch to expand his story and add new characters into the mix. On Sept. 9, 2019, he received an email outlining production problems.\n\n\t“The problem, in this case, is a simple one of money,” Rinsch wrote. “Which is a reality I have to face. And manage.”\n\n\tRinsch outlined two options: to “protect and survive” and limit financial exposure or “forge ahead” and continue to increase the budget. Friedlander was committed to the vision for the series and its potential as a franchise. “The show was at a crisis point at this point,” he said on the stand. “We were investing in this to tell the entire story… To end it right before the end would create a terrible, unsatisfying customer experience.”\n\n\tFriedlander took a more hands-on approach, directing Rinsch to submit detailed production reports going forward. He flew to the troubled Budapest set in October 2019 with another Netflix executive, Mike Posey. Reflecting on the experience, he said, “We wanted to be thought partners and better understand the shooting challenges.”\n\n\tIn February 2020, emails showed that Rinsch outlined a roadmap to condense the production timeline and get the project back on track. On March 4, 2020, he was sent $11 million to spend on storyboards, production designs, fabrication of art/costumes, pay or play on key crew and artists, editing of existing material and other production costs in a five-week period. Although the pandemic paused a lot of filming for various projects, Friedlander asserted that Rinsch could’ve continued working on the project.\n\t\n\n\tAround that time, Rinsch gifted Friedlander a lavish coffee table book with production photos of the 2019 shoot. It was the last material on “White Horse” Friedlander ever received.\n\n\tJudge Jed Rakoff told jurors he expects to be wrapped before the end of next week.\n",

    "body": "\n\tStreaming platforms operating in Australia are already investing more in local content than traditional broadcasters, according to new data that the streaming industry says undermines recently passed legislation mandating content quotas for subscription services.\n\n\tMajor streaming platforms collectively invested nearly AUD$1.1 billion ($719 million) in Australian and Australian-related programming during the 2024-25 financial year, marking the highest level of content spending since voluntary reporting began in 2020, according to a report from the Australian Communications and Media Authority.\n\t\n\n\tThe figures arrive on the heels of legislation passed in the Senate last week introducing mandatory Australian content obligations for subscription video-on-demand services.\n\n\n\tPaul Muller, chair of the Streaming for Australia Coalition, said the figures demonstrate the new legislation is unnecessary.\n\n\t“Contrary to misleading claims that SVOD services have been reducing investment in the Australian screen industry, the ACMA data clearly shows that Australia’s SVOD services are already investing at a higher rate than Australia’s broadcasters,” Muller said. “This further demonstrates that the legislation passed last week is trying to solve a problem that simply doesn’t exist.”\n\n\tThe ACMA data shows Prime Video, Disney+, Netflix, Paramount+ and Stan allocated AUD$414 million ($271 million) toward Australian content and AUD$687.8 million ($450 million) on Australian-related programs. The investment in new commissions and co-commissions reached AUD$316.6 million ($207 million), representing a 40% jump from the previous year’s AUD$225.2 million ($147 million).\n\t\n\n\tRecent Australian content produced by global streamers include Prime Video’s “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” and Netflix’s “The Survivors.”\n\n\tStreaming platforms now invest more in Australian scripted drama than all subscription and commercial broadcasters combined, despite accounting for only 23% of total television viewing time. The increase in streaming expenditure on Australian content nearly equals the AUD$72.8 million ($47.6 million) that all commercial broadcasters spent in total on Australian drama, children’s programming, documentary and other local content last year.\n\n\tOver six consecutive years of voluntary reporting, streaming services have invested nearly AUD$4 billion ($2.6 billion) cumulatively in Australian production, supporting local employment, infrastructure and international exposure for Australian creative talent.\n\n\tMuller noted that while the ACMA report shows streamers commissioned fewer total programs year-over-year, the increased spending reflects a strategic shift toward larger-scale productions. “SVOD services operate in a highly competitive environment and have focused on what their audiences want: bigger, bolder and more ambitious Australian stories,” he said.\n\n\tThe streaming coalition invested AUD$97 million ($63.5 million) in acquired Australian content for global licensing during the reporting period. However, Muller warned the new mandatory investment obligations create a disincentive for continued licensing activity, as acquired content cannot be counted toward meeting the regulatory requirements.\n\n\tAustralian audiences had access to a record 3,919 titles of Australian content across the five major streaming services during the financial year, according to ACMA data.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix came to the defense of its new docuseries “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” on Tuesday night after the film’s subject, Sean “Diddy” Combs, and his team attacked the project as a “shameful hit piece” that used “stolen footage that was never authorized for release.”\n\n\tA Netflix spokesperson told Variety, “The claims being made about ‘Sean Combs: The Reckoning’ are false. The project has no ties to any past conversations between Sean Combs and Netflix. The footage of Combs leading up to his indictment and arrest were legally obtained. This is not a hit piece or an act of retribution. Curtis Jackson is an executive producer but does not have creative control. No one was paid to participate.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s statement comes on the heels of a quote from “The Reckoning” director, Alexandria Stapleton, who also asserted all footage was obtained legally with all the “necessary rights.”\n\n\n\t“We moved heaven and earth to keep the filmmaker’s identity confidential,” she said. “One thing about Sean Combs is that he’s always filming himself, and it’s been an obsession throughout the decades. We also reached out to Sean Combs’ legal team for an interview and comment multiple times, but did not hear back.”\n\n\tThe statement from Combs’ rep, released Monday, alleged that Combs “has been amassing footage since he was 19 to tell his own story, in his own way,” but Netflix was spinning his words out of context. It also claimed that executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is “a longtime adversary with a personal vendetta who has spent too much time slandering Mr. Combs.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Matalon, a founding member of TriStar Pictures and producer of films like “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape” and “Hear No Evil,” died on Dec. 2 in his Beverly Hills home, Variety has learned. He was 82.\n\n\tBorn in 1943, Matalon began his career at Columbia Pictures International. He worked his way up to executive vice president of the company before leaving to co-found TriStar Pictures. He served as president of TriStar Pictures during his tenure. Matalon led strategic direction for TriStar and was integral in shaping the company’s early identity. \n\t\n\n\tAfter leaving TriStar, Matalon went on to lead day-to-day operations at Regency Enterprises. Under Matalon’s guidance, Regency produced films such as “L.A. Confidential,” “Heat,” “Fight Club,” “Unfaithful,” “Entrapment,” “The Fountain” and “Mr. & Mrs. Smith.” During his twelve years with the company, Regency signed an exclusive 15-year distribution contract with 20th Century Fox.

    "body": "\n\t“Frankenstein” director Guillermo del Toro is set to receive a BFI Fellowship, the film organization’s highest honor.\n\n\tThe award will celebrate del Toro’s “extraordinary contribution to film and the distinctive artistry that runs through his work across animation and live action, and as a Mexican filmmaker, in both Spanish and English,” according to a press release. “Fusing dark horror and gothic fantasy, drawing on folklore, fairytales, literature, sci-fi, religion and comic books, del Toro creates lavish fantastical cinematic worlds and characters, often monsters and creatures, of deep emotional complexity.”\n\t\n\n\tDel Toro, who won the Oscar for best picture and director for 2017’s “The Shape of Water,” will be honored with the fellowship at the annual BFI Chair’s dinner in May 2026. He will take part in a public career conversation at the BFI Southbank and will be celebrated with a retrospective of his films, in addition to programming his own film season at the BFI at a later date. A series of masterclasses will also be given by del Toro to aspiring filmmakers in the BFI Academy, a remastered 4K version of his 1992 debut “Cronos” will be rereleased by the BFI and he will make a visit to the BFI National Archive.\n\n\n\t“This is the honor of a lifetime and a thrilling moment in a storyteller’s life: to join a rarefied pantheon and to be recognized by the BFI,” del Toro said in a statement. “I have been greatly influenced by British film and have enjoyed a long and fruitful collaboration with great talent on both sides of the camera going back decades. I thank everyone at the BFI for this great distinction. I will endeavor myself to work hard to prove myself worthy of their faith in me.”\n\t\n\n\tAdded BFI chair Jay Hunt: “Guillermo del Toro is an extraordinary filmmaker with a long relationship with the BFI who has consistently championed British talent.  His collaborations here speak to the strength of our wider screen industries and the skilled people who power them.  His body of work is instantly recognisable as boldly imaginative and fantastical. In awarding a BFI Fellowship to Guillermo del Toro, we recognize his remarkable contribution to cinema and the inspiration and magic he has brought to filmmakers and audiences here and around the world.” \n\n\tDel Toro joins the ranks of previous BFI Fellowship honorees including Christopher Nolan, Tom Cruise, Spike Lee, Tilda Swinton, Martin Scorsese, Orson Welles, Elizabeth Taylor and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew Zealand-based sales outfit Black Mandala has secured rights to develop an animated series and action figure line based on “Guerreros del Manana” (Warriors of Tomorrow), the cult Argentine superhero toy franchise that launched in the 1980s.\n\n\tThe deal, closed during Ventana Sur, was signed with Guillermo Zanocco, who created the original toy line, and filmmaker Nicolás Onetti, who will direct the upcoming animated series.\n\n\n\tOriginally released during the same era as Mattel’s “He-Man” figures, the locally produced Argentine superhero toys have evolved into highly sought-after collectibles on the international market over the past four decades.\n\t\n\n\tBlack Mandala plans to unveil both the official series teaser and the first collectible sculpture at Argentina Comic-Con on Dec. 5 in Buenos Aires.\n\n\tThe animation project has assembled a creative team including Aníbal Morales as animation director, Luciano Onetti composing the score, and Germán Suracce handling sound design. Artist Martín Cardozo will create the new line of collectible sculptures.\n\n\tVeteran voice actor Ricardo Alanis, known for Spanish-language dubbing work on Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme films, as well as “Power Rangers,” will perform the teaser’s voice-over.\n\n\tMichael Kraetzer and Onetti founded genre specialist Black Mandala in 2017. Operating from Auckland, the company has built a catalog of more than 150 titles focused on independent horror and genre cinema, maintaining a presence at major film markets worldwide. \n\n\tThe company’s recent slate includes  “Nightfall – A Paranormal Investigation,” a debut feature from young Australian filmmakers Myles McEwen and Ripley Stevens; “Beyond the Drumlins,” directed by Dan Bowhers; Gene Dolders’ “The Blade Cuts Deeper”; and horror anthology “The Last Supper.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTusday night’s “Dancing With the Stars” special may be celebrating the holiday season with musical performances and festive routines, but co-host Julianne Hough is also celebrating Season 34 — and her long-running career on the show.\n\n\t“I feel like it’s just part of my DNA now, and I think that’s because I have been on the show for so many years in different roles, there’s almost a familiarity for other people as well,” she tells Variety.\n\t\n\n\tHough joined the series in 2007 as a pro dancer on Season 4, winning both her first and second seasons. She continued on the show through Season 8, leaving ahead of fall 2009’s 9th season. Over the next few years, she returned for specific dances and in 2013, became the first former pro to return as a guest judge, which she did for both Seasons 17 and 18. She then landed a permaneant spot at the table for five seasons between 2014 to 2017 (Seasons 19, 20, 21, 23 and 24) before exiting. With a few more guest judging spots through the years, she rejoined the show full time in 2023 as a co-host for Season 32 alongside Alfonso Ribeiro.\n\n\n\t“My whole life has been dancing, and ballroom dancing specifically. So I’ve been in roles to help the celebrity feel comfortable so that they can come to me for anything, and the pros too. I also know what the judges are looking for,” she continues. “I feel lucky that I’ve just been able to grow up with this show and have it raise me.”\n\n\tThe series hit new highs this season, with Season 34 receiving a record number of votes (72 million on the finale and nearly a billion throughout the season) and the finale raking in 9.24 million viewers, the largest finale since 2016. Many factors contributed to the rise, including TikTok and social media in general, but more than anything, the casting team weas able to find a diverse crowd that brought in muolitple different age groups.\n\t\n\n\t“Where we were 20 years ago, being a reality star was almost a bad taste in your mouth. It had this connotation. But today, with social media, everybody has a platform to show who they are,” says Hough. “It’s been more wildly — not just accepted, but embraced. It’s encouraged to show the authenticity of who you are. And I think the show is built on being vulnerable and authentic and showing progress and growth versus just showing the excellent results always.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJulianne Hough, Daniella Karagach and Jenna Johnson on the “DWTS” holiday special. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPersonally, it’s been a safe haven — pun intended — for Hough, no matter what is going on in elsewhere in her personal or professional life.\n\n\t“My whole life has been about pivoting and trying different things, moving out of the country and training. This has been the most consistent thing in my life, and it’s always been the thing that I’ve been able to come home to and still feel like I’m being challenged and accepted,” she explains. “It’s a place to still discover myself, but in a safe, contained environment where it’s all about growth and expansion through rhinestones and glitter.”\n\n\tAlong with the positive — massive ratings and viewership — comes the negative: criticism and online bullying led to multiple people speaking out, pros, celebrities and judges alike. And it’s hard to avoid.\n\n\t“What I’m realizing is everybody wants to be seen and everybody wants to feel significant and important. The only way to really do that is if you go viral. And the fastest way to go viral is, unfortunately, through negativity,” says Hough. “Negativity breeds negativity. Positivity breeds positivity. We have this magic sauce where this show is so positive, so it’s breeding positivity, but then it’s also activating people to have polarity, and that’s what creates tension… Everybody has a right to say how they feel. It’s just unfortunate when it’s not necessarily true, or they’re looking to tear somebody apart.”\n\n\tWhile polarity can be a positive thing — “If there’s no polarity, then things just kind of like fizzle out,” she notes — there must also be a line between sharing opinions and being harmful. “You don’t have to be really, really mean. It’s almost dangerous with some of the comments people have been saying.” \n\t\n\n\t“I’ve never had people talk to me like that,” she says of the personal mean comments she received this season, but knows that sometimes their remarks “are not wrong.”\n\n\t“I think that’s what kind of makes me charming and funny and real, is that I do mess up sometimes. Instead of being defensive, I either play along with it, or I just ignore it,” she says. Others have received more vitriol, she adds — and sometimes it gets too much to ignore, especially for the dancers.\n\n\t“It takes a toll, because not only are they just getting feedback from people. They’re pouring so much energy in day after day. They don’t get a day off, their bodies are exhausted,” she says. “When your body is exhausted, you are so much more vulnerable and emotionally raw, so you’re susceptible to getting your feelings hurt.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlfonso Ribeiro, Julianne Hough, Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhitney Leavitt, for her part, was arguably the best celebrity dancer on the season. However, when “Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” came out and revealed she returned to the reality show only to audition for “DWTS,” it appeared audiences turned on her and she was eliminated that week. Leavitt and partner Mark Ballas later went on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and revealed the awful bullying they were receiving.\n\n\t“I think everybody was shocked [by her elimination],” the host says, adding that she was extremely sad to see people tearing Leavitt down for “being ambitious” and following her goal. “This woman is a star, and this has been her dream. Don’t knock somebody for finding the way to make that happen. I get protective when people are tearing other people down.”\n\n\tHough says she feels for all the cast members — but really doesn’t understand those who complain about Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough’s judging. “This is their job,” she says. “Let them do what they do.”\n\n\tDespite it all, she agrees that this has been the most competitive season in years — something she’s thrilled is back. And with the camaraderie among the cast, it proves people can be both respectful and want to win at the same time.\n\n\t“There were a few seasons where the show was really nice, but where’s the competition? Life, society, and culture shifts and the pendulum swings. I think a few years ago, we were in the participation award for everyone era. I think the pendulum has come back a little bit. Now, it’s okay; we can all support each other, but also it’s a good thing to feel competitive, to want to win,” she says. “Winning is not about other people losing; winning is about giving it your all and feeling like you put everything out there and not feeling bad. So I love that you can feel the energy of competition in the show again, and still have everybody rooting for each other. We are rooting for people to do their best.”\n\t\n\n\t“Dancing With the Stars” holiday special airs on Tuesday, Dec. 2, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC and Disney+, streaming the next day on Hulu.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix is ramping up its investment in Southeast Asian storytelling with a comprehensive slate of industry initiatives unveiled at Indonesia’s Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival, including a two-year partnership with the Indonesian Producers Association (APROFI) and the debut of its Creative Asia program in the region.\n\n\tThe streaming giant’s expanded collaboration with JAFF, timed to the festival’s 20th anniversary, signals a long-term commitment to nurturing local talent and production infrastructure across Southeast Asia, where Netflix content is experiencing explosive growth. Global view hours of Southeast Asian titles surged nearly 50% from 2023 to 2024, with more than 40 regional titles charting in Netflix’s Global Top 10 in 2025 alone.\n\t\n\n\t“Even as the streaming world has changed, our support for this region has stayed consistent — and proudly local,” said Malobika Banerji, senior director of content for Southeast Asia at Netflix. “Our commitment isn’t just to the creators already in the spotlight. We care just as deeply about those who are still finding their voice — the next generation of filmmakers, storytellers, and crew who will shape the future of this region.”\n\n\n\tNetflix and APROFI formalized a two-year memorandum of understanding aimed at strengthening Indonesia’s production ecosystem. The partnership will fund workshops for above- and below-the-line talent, provide on-the-job training opportunities on Netflix projects, and foster industry dialogue. As part of the collaboration, the partners introduced Indonesia’s first national guidebook on production safety, designed to help productions operate more safely and sustainably.\n\t\n\n\tIrene Umar, Indonesia’s vice minister of creative economy, welcomed the initiative at the signing ceremony. “The Indonesian film industry is a significant engine of our economy. Netflix has played a major role in the global film and television ecosystem, and I truly appreciate its contribution to Indonesia,” Umar said. “Our gotong-royong (community driven) approach means in-depth collaboration across stakeholders — and here we see the clearest evidence of it with the film industry, associations, and key players like Netflix and APROFI coming together. I believe this MoU marks the beginning of a long-term partnership.”\n\n\tNetflix partnered with JAFF to bring Creative Asia to Southeast Asia for the first time, following the program’s 2024 debut at Busan International Film Festival. The initiative connects emerging filmmakers with established creators including Joko Anwar, Erik Matti, Kimo Stamboel, Kulp Kaljareuk, Carlo Ledesma and Indonesian author Dee Lestari.\n\n\t“I’m honored that JAFF is the next film festival to host Creative Asia, after its inaugural launch at BIFF in 2024,” said Ifa Isfansyah, JAFF founder and executive director. “What’s truly meaningful is that Netflix, BIFF, and JAFF all share a common vision: to nurture Asian cinema as a reflection of the dynamic and vibrant societies in our region.”\n\n\tProgramming included a creator conversation between Anwar (“Nightmares and Daydreams”) and Matti (“BuyBust”) on navigating creative risk and cultural specificity, plus a panel on Southeast Asia’s emerging zombie genre featuring Kaljareuk (“Ziam”), Ledesma (“Outside”) and Stamboel (“The Elixir”). The latter title recently ranked No. 1 among non-English films globally for two consecutive weeks and entered the Top 10 in 75 countries.\n\n\tNetflix hosted the second season of Reel Life Film Camp at JAFF, following a successful inaugural edition last year. The practical training initiative, supported by the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, received more than 800 applications across both seasons and hosted nearly 100 participants in intensive online, in-person and on-the-job training covering production, post-production, visual effects, editing and screenwriting. The streamer also launched a unit still photography workshop designed to help local photographers transition into new creative roles, and ran a second season of its Screenwriters Fellowship in collaboration with Soda Machine Films.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix offered a first look at its Southeast Asian pipeline, including behind-the-scenes footage from the highly anticipated remake of Thailand’s period drama “Ploeng Phra Nang.” Matti confirmed his upcoming Filipino series “BuyBust: The Undesirables” will stream next year.\n\n\tIn a major literary adaptation announcement, Netflix will partner with celebrated Indonesian author Dee Lestari to adapt three of her best-selling novels — “Rapi Jali,” “Aroma Karsa” and “Perahu Kertas” — into original series. The projects will be helmed by female filmmakers, with Sabrina Rochelle directing “Rapi Jali” and Kamila Andini tackling “Aroma Karsa.”\n\n\tThe festival also hosted the world premiere of “Lupa Daratan” (Lost in the Spotlight), an Indonesian comedy from writer-comedian Ernest Prakasa about an award-winning actor who loses his ability to act just as he’s cast to play the president of Indonesia.\n\n\tTo date, more than 100 Southeast Asian titles have appeared in Netflix’s Global Top 10, with regional content ranking in the Top 10 lists of over 80 countries this year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAll3Media International has teamed with Korean production companies Luyworks Media and Something Special to bring a local adaptation of the reality competition format phenomenon “The Traitors” to South Korea, with actor Cha Seung-won tapped to host.\n\n\tThe Korean version marks another significant expansion for the Dutch-originated format, which has become a global juggernaut since its 2021 debut on RTL 4 in the Netherlands. More than 30 territories across six continents have commissioned local versions, while over 50 territories have broadcast episodes through tape sales.\n\t\n\n\tCha Seung-won brings considerable star power to the project, having built a career spanning dramas, films and variety shows. His credits include dramas “The Greatest Love,” “Our Blues” and “The Tyrant,” films “Believer,” “Night in Paradise” and “Uprising,” and variety series “Infinite Challenge,” “Three Meals a Day” and “Korean Hostel in Spain.”\n\n\n\t“We are very happy to announce the production greenlight of ‘The Traitors’ Korea and working with the nation’s beloved actor Cha Seung-won as the host of the Korean version,” said Yul Han, CEO of Luyworks Media and executive producer of the Korean adaptation. “It is a tremendous honor to be working with actor Cha Seung-won, whom we have long considered the most fitting host for ‘The Traitors’ while producing the Korean version. Despite his busy schedule, he has shown such affection for the program that he has even proposed ideas unique to the Korean version.”\n\n\tJin Woo Hwang, president of Something Special, added that the collaboration represents an opportunity to showcase K-entertainment production values. “Working on a project with the top-notch production house Luyworks Media and actor Cha Seung-won are an opportunity that cannot be missed,” Hwang said.\n\t\n\n\tThe format’s appeal has proven remarkably durable across markets. Created and developed by IDTV and POSVIDEO in cooperation with RTL Creative Unit, “The Traitors” was named K7’s Format of the Year 2024 and has collected multiple Emmy, BAFTA and RTS awards, along with a Rose d’Or, Asian Academy Creative Award and Producers Guild Award.\n\n\tIn the U.K., the celebrity edition’s finale drew 15 million viewers to the BBC and has been renewed for a second season. The U.S. version, hosted by Alan Cumming, has earned five Emmy Awards including outstanding reality competition program and outstanding host. Both the U.K. and U.S. versions are produced by Studio Lambert, part of All3Media.\n\n\tTony Ziran Tang, VP of sales Asia for finished programs and formats at All3Media International, said: “His stardom now stands alongside Claudia Winkleman (U.K.), Alan Cumming (U.S.), and Karan Johar (India).

Ana's remains have never been found.\n      \n    \n          Massachusetts State Police Trooper Nicholas Guarino testified Tuesday under direct questioning that Walshe's laptop had viewed a pornographic video about a “cheating wife.\"\n      \n    \n          But, on cross examination, Walshe's defense attorney, Larry Tipton, got Guarino to admit that Walshe’s computer searches failed to show the user was specifically looking for smut films about a cheating wife.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Tipton indicated the laptop's user downloaded a video from Pornhub's vast library of erotic content and even suggested the user was searching for a specific porn star. Throughout his examination, Tipton was careful not to identify Walshe as the actual user of the laptop, instead referring to the person as a “device user.”\n      \n    \n          Guarino also testified that Walshe made numerous Internet searches about cleaning up and disposing of bodies, as well as searching for 1970's serial killer Patrick Kearney, better known as the \"Trash Bag Killer.\" After killing and dismembering his victims, Kearney would discard them in trash bags.\n      \n    \n          Day 3 of the trial continues tomorrow.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Brian Walshe\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

TMZ has learned, but some of his family members feel it was something more nefarious.\n      \n    \n          Multiple sources with knowledge of the investigation tell us POORSTACY shot himself Saturday morning in a Boca Raton hotel room, but initially survived. He was transported to a local hospital, where he died Monday, after being taken off life support.\n      \n    \n          Police have yet to officially release the cause of death, but we're told the rapper's family isn't buying it was suicide. One source connected to his family tells TMZ ... the family is disputing it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound ... and they suspect foul play.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          We're told POORSTACY had been staying at the hotel for about 10 days, after checking in with a woman and a toddler. Our source says POORSTACY was the child's father, and the woman is the mother.\n      \n    \n          It's unclear if they were in the hotel room when he shot himself.\n      \n    \n          We're told police released the room back to the hotel later Saturday to be thoroughly cleaned.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          We broke the story of POORSTACY's death, and at the time, there were unconfirmed rumblings it might have been suicide.\n      \n    \n          Sadly, that's what police believe happened to the 26-year-old artist, according to our sources -- but it sounds like his family members might demand further investigation.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

One player, dubbed the “Wingleader,” secretly ranks five cards pulled from across the first three Empyrean novels—Fourth Wing, Iron Flame and Onyx Storm—while the rest of the group, known as the “Iron Squad,” works together to guess the order. With categories spanning romance, rivalries, power struggles and fan-favorite riders, the set is designed to spark the kind of spirited debates already happening in book clubs and online fan forums. The first team to spell out PRIORITIES with earned cards wins.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“This game is for the readers who’ve stayed up way too late with these books and still want more,” Yarros said in announcing the release. “Priorities: Fourth Wing Edition is a way to dive back into the world with your favorite people and see just how well they really know you.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe bestselling romantasy book series, with a forthcoming Amazon adaptation in the works, is set inside the brutal world of Basgiath War College, where there is only one rule: graduate or die. Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was always expected to live a quiet life — but she’s sent on an entirely different path when her mother, a general in the military, orders her to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become dragon riders, the elite of Navarre.\n</p>\n<div><p>\n\tBuy the “Fourth Wing” card game <a href=\"https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_variety?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0F9PXYTGQ%3Ftag%3Dvariety0e8-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26language%3Den_US%26asc_source%3Dweb%26asc_campaign%3Dweb%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvariety.com%252F2025%252Fshopping%252Fnews%252Ffourth-wing-card-game-buy-online-1236537542%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2025%2Fshopping%2Fnews%2Ffourth-wing-card-game-buy-online-1236537542%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and the bestselling book series <a href=\"https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_variety?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFourth-Wing-Empyrean-Book-1%2Fdp%2FB0BVDJ293G%3Fcrid%3D2JR0N0V3X6RL%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EiOQBxySZI7jV617zicsBgks0iEaS5TNTZmpdzhhwX_gi04fyzE7CByOdvTrHvD3MnAuPVCZOgVx9heZHVeJ_WJjusPIpZLNGYxoMWJv3xLnBALmWfk0JJ2fdpLNdg5yGb73SXbywySoSamFyuEDjQxuN8XAXCifKM4uDWGkEVW7vb9sBvcU1zVwLGzkNxwUYzk0Pm9Y0T8Dvis0SLrEm76YIkXhlYPRIYeY-V09dGk.caaegmOa5gVDJEnQqK-zSSvRg8mp7IGU4PaSeftXcQA%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Dfourth%2Bwing%26qid%3D1759459474%26sprefix%3Dfourth%2Bwi%252Caps%252C142%26sr%3D8-2%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3Dvypinterest-20%26linkId%3D7d9325aaf47483105dc2c1b4bd1bd7a3%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl%26asc_source%3Dweb%26asc_campaign%3Dweb%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvariety.com%252F2025%252Fshopping%252Fnews%252Ffourth-wing-card-game-buy-online-1236537542%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2025%2Fshopping%2Fnews%2Ffourth-wing-card-game-buy-online-1236537542%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p></div>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ethan-slater/\">Ethan Slater</a> is in the calm before the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wicked/\">Wicked</a>” storm.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter a monthslong respite, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/broadway/\">Broadway</a> actor — who plays the Munchkin Boq in the screen adaptation — is preparing to embark on a publicity tour for “Wicked: For Good,” the second half of the two-part blockbuster. But before jetting off to London, Japan and other far-flung locales to promote the film that hits theaters on Nov. 21, he’s been in the rehearsal room for a very different theatrical project.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring his time away from the Land of Oz, he’s been workshopping a new play, “Marcel on the Train” — about Marcel Marceau —which will debut Off Broadway in early 2026. In addition to co-writing the show, he stars as the famous mime, who, long before he became known to the world, joined the French Resistance and saved Jewish children from the Nazis by smuggling them to safety.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I love film,” says Slater, a Tony nominee for the “SpongeBob SquarePants” musical. “But my first love was theater, and I hope I’m able to do at least one thing onstage a year.”</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat was it like to promote “Wicked” and then know you have to it all over again for “Wicked: For Good” less than a year later?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt’s a unique experience, and it’s happening again so fast. It never <em>really</em> ended, because then [the studio] rolled out the movie on Peacock. There were always little bursts. </p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow are you spending your downtime?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’ve been fortunate enough to be working on various things, like “Marcel on the Train.” And I got to spend many months in New York. For months at a time, I was flying around and was only able to be home three days a week.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tFor audiences who haven’t seen “Wicked” onstage, what are you excited for them to discover in the second film? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tAnyone who knows the Broadway show knows the first and second act are very different. There’s so much depth to everyone’s character; that’s been a real privilege about making two movies. Selfishly, I’m excited for people to see what happens with Boq and Nessa. We got to spend more time with them. It’s exciting to see how their relationship both blossoms and eats itself.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tCan you tease anything about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/wicked-for-good-soundtrack-new-songs-erivo-grande-schwartz-1236521696/\">two new songs in the secon</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/wicked-for-good-soundtrack-new-songs-erivo-grande-schwartz-1236521696/\">d</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/wicked-for-good-soundtrack-new-songs-erivo-grande-schwartz-1236521696/\"> film</a>?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tHere’s what I’m going to say: The new songs in the second movie are really good, and one of them is, like, my favorite song. [Composer] Stephen Schwartz is incredible. It’s cool that we get to have two songs that were written with Cynthia [Erivo] and Ariana [Grande]’s voices in mind.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat do you remember about your audition? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI made a self-tape with me prerecording the other voices in the scene. I was playing Glinda and Nessarose. And then I did the scene with myself. I remember being like, “Well, that’s the worst thing I’ve ever done.” And then two months later, I got a callback with [director] Jon Chu on Zoom.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t“Wicked” has been part of your life for years now. What will it be like to wrap it up? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt’s been a beautiful chapter of my life. I don’t think I’ll feel like I’m saying goodbye; one day I’ll just realize that it happened.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat was the first show you saw on Broadway? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt was either “42nd Street” or “Wicked.” I need to do the math. I was in awe. It’s this high-wire act. I was always a kid who was like, “I want to be up there.”</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat do you remember about your Broadway debut in “SpongeBob SquarePants”? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tIt was intimidating and scary. I remember being moved to tears. During previews, everyone kept on talking about opening night being the debut. But I’d already done 20 previews. Then opening night happened, and there was some switch. I can’t even say exactly what it was, but the energy of a Broadway opening is like nothing else I’ve experienced.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow do you manage to do eight shows a week?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tJust trying to not get injured and stay healthy. There’s this Danny Kaye joke: He has a character, Petrov the Thinker, who says, “How do you live to be 100 years old? You live to 99 and be very, very careful.” That’s what I think about.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow did “Marcel on the Train” end up on your radar? \t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI was researching Buster Keaton, which led me to Charlie Chaplin. Charlie Chaplin was, and I’m using air quotes, “accused of being Jewish.” So I was googling “Charlie Chaplin Jewish” because I’m Jewish. It led me to the story about Marcel Marceau — who loved Charlie Chaplin — and this anecdote about him saving Jewish children. It spoke to two things I really care about: One is physical comedy; second is the humanity of children. That’s something that we should all be able to agree on, and yet we don’t always.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe Thessaloniki Intl. Film Festival will pay tribute to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/isabelle-huppert/\">Isabelle Huppert</a> at its 66th edition, and present 15 of her films. The actress, who will be the festival’s guest of honor, will attend a series of events, screenings and talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Nov. 4, she will deliver a masterclass titled “From Screen to Stage,” delving into the differences and similarities in acting techniques between cinema and theater, moderated by the Greek writer Ersi Sotiropoulou.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, the actress will introduce several of the tribute’s films, including the comedy “Copacabana” (2010), directed by Marc Fitoussi, along with her daughter and co-star in the film, Lolita Chammah.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe festival will host a guided tour of historical monuments and landmarks of Thessaloniki for Huppert, and “initiate her into the culinary secrets of the city,” it said in a statement.</p>\n<p>\n\tHuppert has been nominated 16 times for a César Award, a record in the history of the awards. She is a two-time César winner, for “A Judgement in Stone” (1995) by Claude Chabrol and “Elle” (2016) by Paul Verhoeven, the latter earning her a Golden Globe and a best actress Academy Award nomination as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tHuppert won best actress at Cannes Film Festival for Claude Chabrol’s “Violette Nozière” (1978) and Michael Haneke’s “The Piano Teacher” (2001), at Venice for Chabrol’s “Story of Women” (1988) and “A Judgement in Stone” (1995), and at the Berlinale (along with film’s entire female cast) for François Ozon’s “8 Women” (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\tHuppert’s most recent film is Thierry Klifa’s political drama “The Richest Woman in the World,” which premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is loosely inspired by the notorious Bettencourt affair, one of France’s most sensational political scandals. Huppert delivers a commanding performance as Marianne Farrère, a wealthy heiress whose extravagant gifts to a much younger artist ignite public outrage.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe films screening as part of the tribute are Michael Cimino’s “Heaven’s Gate” (1980), Joseph Losey’s “The Trout” (1982), Chabrol’s “Story of Women” (1988), Hal Hartley’s “Amateur” (1994), Chabrol’s “A Judgement in Stone” (1995), Haneke’s “The Piano Teacher” (2001), Ozon’s “8 Women” (2002), Claire Denis’ “White Material” (2009), Fitoussi’s “Copacabana” (2010), Joachim Trier’s “Louder Than Bombs” (2015), Gillaume Nicloux’s “Valley of Love” (2015), Paul Verhoeven’s “Elle” (2016), Ira Sach’s “Frankie” (2019), Élise Girard’s “Sidonie in Japan” (2023), and Klifa’s “The Richest Woman in the World” (2025).</p>\n</div>",

But it is what she did with her platform at the BRITs and the Ivors that put her back in the spotlight at the inaugural Ivors Academy Honours Ceremony on Thursday, held at London’s Intercontinental Park Lane hotel.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHer tireless advocacy for songwriters to be better compensated for their craft recently won a major victory, when — as part of the U.K. government’s streaming remuneration working group — the three major labels agreed to pay a £75 ($100) per diem fee and expenses for songwriters attending their writing sessions, answering a call she first made in her Ivors acceptance speech in 2024.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t want to take more credit than is due,” she said of that triumph as she collected an award for her advocacy. “I know I’m being extremely annoying in all of my speeches, but… as long as God gives me a microphone to accept [an award] on a stage, I promise to keep fighting the good fight.</p>\n<p>\n\t“A really important next step is that we get together to eliminate the shadows in our contracts and the grey areas in which manipulation is allowed to occur,” she added, calling for writers to “stop fighting against each other and turn the good fight to the record labels that are going to have to understand that we’re not going to stop until songwriters are correctly compensated for their songs. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We need transparency,” she stressed, before quipping: “I’m pissing everyone off and I’m really not trying to do that – I just care about these things.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jon-Platt-L-Sir-Richard-Branson-R.jpg 3186w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jon-Platt-L-Sir-Richard-Branson-R.jpg?resize=103,150 103w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jon-Platt-L-Sir-Richard-Branson-R.jpg?resize=206,300 206w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jon-Platt-L-Sir-Richard-Branson-R.jpg?w=703\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jon-platt/\">Jon Platt</a> (left) with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/richard-branson/\">Richard Branson</a>. They didn’t call him “Big Jon” back in the day for nothing… (Photo by Dave Benett/Getty Images for The Ivors Academy)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDave Benett/Getty Images for The Ivors Academy\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tAnd this new addition to the Ivors programme, introduced by Academy bosses Roberto Neri and Tom Gray, is very much for people who care about those things – specifically compensation and respect for songwriters. Or, as another of the night’s winners, Sony Music Publishing CEO and chairman Jon Platt called it, people who go around “pissing people off and loving every minute of it.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his speech, Platt noted that he declines most awards that are offered to him but that, “When a songwriter organization reaches out, it’s a bit different. It’s not just an award, it’s an honor to be recognized by an Academy that fights so hard on behalf of songwriters.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPlatt – whose award was presented by Beyoncé co-writer Carla Marie Williams – was one of the few high-profile American execs to make the trip over (although he gave it a strong endorsement, noting: “Every time you go to an Ivors event, you think, ‘How can it top what you saw the last time?’ But already tonight is doing that”), but there was a strong turnout from UK publishers, songwriters, producers, labels, management companies and trade bodies to support the new event.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn recent years, the Ivors have transitioned from cosy industry bash to a high-profile magnet for A-list talent: U2, Bruce Springsteen, Brandon Flowers and Charli XCX all attended this year’s event.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut aside from Raye, artist-poet Kae Tempest and a hilarious presentation speech from Alison Moyet, the Ivors Academy Honours concentrated mainly on those behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo other winners included Catherine Manners, founder of classical music agency and publisher Manners McDade, and Sir Chris Bryant MP, one of the drivers of that government working group, who declared: “Every single songwriter is a miracle worker – and miracle workers should be paid properly”.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere were emotional scenes as a posthumous award for SESAC VP of international John Sweeney, who passed away earlier this year, was collected by his daughter May; while MOBO Group CEO and founder Kanya King, earned a standing ovation as she read a letter to her younger self and talked of her “challenging year”, having been diagnosed with cancer.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe headline act, however, also provided the light relief as Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, ran through a greatest hits of anecdotes from his time in the music industry, including fighting an obscenity laws court case over the Sex Pistols’ “Never Mind the Bollocks” album; passing out while smoking dope with Peter Tosh; and helping a naked Keith Richards avoid an angry, gun-toting husband whose wife had been dallying with the Rolling Stones guitarist.</p>\n<p>\n\tBranson’s award was presented by one of the acts he signed to his Virgin Records label, Peter Gabriel, who spoke affectionately of Branson’s “indelible impression on music and on the way music is made both here and around the world – by supporting the new, the rebellious and the outsiders, Virgin helped shaped British and then the world’s music”.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We had a blast with our time in the music industry,” Branson told Variety ahead of the ceremony. “We were there at such a great time, when an independent record company could sign a band like Culture Club or the Sex Pistols and make a real difference.”</p>\n<p>\n\tVirgin began as a curated mail order retail business (“So the people who were buying the music knew that the people selling the music knew what they were talking about”), before expanding into the Virgin Megastores chain. He then launched recording studios and a record label before later forays into radio (Virgin Radio) and the live business (the V Festival).</p>\n<p>\n\tIn every sector, he disrupted the established order, no more so than when he built the independent Virgin Records off the back of Mike Oldfield’s mega-selling “Tubular Bells” album.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We didn’t deliberately think, ‘How can we be different?’” he said, in the bar of the Shoreditch branch of one of his latest ventures, Virgin Hotels. “We were just young – we were the same age as our artists and we did it our way! We were having a lot of fun and we quite enjoyed it if the establishment attacked us for signing the Sex Pistols, or prosecuted us for the word ‘bollocks’ – it just helped build the reputation of Virgin. People like the Rolling Stones, David Bowie and Janet Jackson signed to us because we took on the establishment. We put the artists on the map and therefore put Virgin on the map.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBranson sold Virgin Records to EMI in 1992 (“A gut-wrenching day for us all”) and confesses he no longer keeps up with the day-to-day minutiae of the record industry, or even the fate of the Virgin music brand, which lives on under Universal Music.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I know the artists are having a tough time,” he said. “Some of the record companies seem to be doing very well but sadly it doesn’t seem to have those independent [companies]. When we were building our label, there was also Chrysalis, Jive, Island – it was a very exciting time for artists having all those independent companies competing and willing to step in when a major company didn’t. It sounds like that’s been lost somewhere today.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, despite the thrill of being amongst many old friends and colleagues at the Ivors Academy Honours ceremony, he said he doesn’t miss the music industry.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’d be a sad person if I said I missed anything, because my life has been so full,” he said. “I have massive happy memories from the days we were in the music industry, but I’m not somebody that will dwell on the past – I just look positively forward to the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t think it’s any less fun running some of the other companies,” he added. “But there was something about the music industry, it had a little more of the icing on the cake.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that serves as the perfect description of the Academy’s latest venture: The Ivors may remain the crème de la crème of songwriter awards ceremonies, but the Ivors Academy Honours were well worth the extra slice.</p>\n</div>",

    "description": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cillian-murphy/\">Cillian Murphy</a> won the best actor Oscar last year for his nuanced portra",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cillian-murphy/\">Cillian Murphy</a> won the best actor Oscar last year for his nuanced portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan’s all-conquering biopic. Incredibly, in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a> drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/steve/\">Steve</a>” — which starts streaming on Oct. 3 — the Irish actor manages to look more emotionally exhausted than a nuclear physician with the weight of global annihilation on his shoulders. It’s something he chalks up to a “very good hair and makeup team.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDirected by Tim Mielants, “Steve” — which was announced in the midst of “Oppenheimer’s” domineering awards run and was co-produced by Murphy through his recently-launched Big Things Film — is loosely based on Max Porter’s acclaimed novella “Shy,” set in the mid-’90s at a struggling and underfunded reform school for boys with societal and behavioral difficulties. But whereas the original story was told through the perspective of one of the pupils, for “Steve,” Porter — in his first screenplay — twisted it around to shift the focus on the school’s deeply empathetic but endlessly embattled (and very exhausted) head teacher, played by Murphy.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the actor, whose parents were both teachers, the film serves as a love letter to the profession. “They’re the custodians of the next generation, and nobody really talks about it,” he says.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJoining Murphy in the school canteen for “Steve” are Tracey Ullman, Jay Lycurgo and Simbi Ajikawo, plus Emily Watson, who reunites with Murphy after last year’s “Small Things Like These,” which was also directed by Mielants. </p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking to <em>Variety</em>, Murphy discusses honoring Ken Loach — his director on 2006 Irish war drama “The Wind That Shakes the Barley” — on “Steve” by stealing a couple of the iconic filmmaker’s techniques, why he didn’t make the leap from his “Oppenheimer” success to other major studio projects and confirms that no, despite online rumors, he’s not destined to play He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in HBO’s “Harry Potter” reboot.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tI understand you’re friends with with Max Porter. When you first read “Shy,” did you immediately have your filmmaker hat on and start thinking how it could be adapted for screen?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI was very lucky, I read a proof copy of the book before it came out. Myself and Max go back. This is our third project together. So he sent it to me, and I just read it, and it was magical and extraordinary. There are some books you read that you think, that’s a perfect little thing, and it’s unadaptable because it’s all set in this character’s head and it’s a stream of conscious, a first-person perspective. Why would you make a film of it? And then two years later, we had made “Small Things Like These,” and we loved the experience. And myself and Max were trying to dream up what the next project would be together. And he said, “How about we tackle ‘Shy’?” And I thought, “Well, I don’t know how you’re going to do that, because it’s all in Shy’s head.” And he said, “How about we split the narrative between the head teacher, who was a tiny character in the novel, and tell that overlapping story between Shy and Steve.” And I thought that was a brilliant idea. So we commission it and off he went and he wrote it really quickly. We sent it to Netflix and they said yes to funding it really quickly.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAll the performances in it are absolutely outstanding. Was it the case that some of the kids were actually untrained actors performing for the first time?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tA lot of them had some experience, but yeah, a few of them didn’t have any. But we saw 3,500 kids. [Casting director] Robert Sterne did an amazing job. We saw many, many, many kids and then we began to narrow it down to this kind of motley crew. And then our director Tim Mielants was in the room, workshopping with these actors. We discovered our Shy in Jay [Lycurgo], who had done work to date. He was just an instant casting consensus from all of us. So we went to workshop the boys in the location for like two and a half weeks. And we really made them feel like part of the fabric of this school and it came to a point where the kids were becoming the characters, and the characters were becoming the kids. It was a lovely process.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240605_Unit_01585_RT.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240605_Unit_01585_RT.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240605_Unit_01585_RT.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240605_Unit_01585_RT.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240605_Unit_01585_RT.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240605_Unit_01585_RT.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240605_Unit_01585_RT.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240605_Unit_01585_RT.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tracey Ullman as Amanda, Cillian Murphy as Steve. Credit: Robert Viglasky/Neflix</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRobert Viglasky/Neflix\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIt was great to see Emily Watson back again after her small but award-winning performance in “Small Things Like These.” She’s got more lines in “Steve” and is — thankfully — less terrifying. Has Emily become your secret weapon?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tListen, if I could work with Emily forever, I would. I’ve adored her work since I was a very young actor, probably since before I was an actor. I think I saw “Breaking the Waves” before I had ever done any acting. She’s one of my favorites.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAnd Roger Allam does a wonderful Tory minister, as only he can. I know this is set in 1996, but there’s a line about him having divided a country and perhaps a rumor about something sexual he may have done to an animal. I don’t think this is in the book. Was this perhaps a little comic reference to a former British Prime Minister?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’ll leave that to your readers. But it’s interesting, because Roger Allam actually played a terrible establishment figure in “The Wind That Shakes the Barley” as well. Again, he’s one of my favorite actors. So it was lovely to able to reach out to him after 20 years and say, “This is one day’s work, but we need someone who could do this properly.” And he came and just absolutely smashed it.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tSpeaking of “The Wind That Shakes the Barley,” there’s definitely a Loachian feel to this film. I can imagine it being something that Ken Loach would have loved to have made himself. You obviously worked with Ken a long time ago. Where you trying channel him when you made this?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tAbsolutely. There’s a few things I should share with you. The location was effectively one location, so I thought, why not shoot everything in sequence like Ken does? Because it’s very, very rare you get to do it. And when I did it on “Barley” like he does it for every film, it was life-changing because you just went on this journey with this character in order, and it was purely instinctual and you acquired the emotional information as you went along. And every scene was a rehearsal for the next scene. So I stole that technique from him.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd for the scene where the board come and tell them that they’ve sold the school, I had never met those actors before. The first time we encountered them was on camera. And that’s a technique that Ken used all the time, where they keep you separate from the antagonists in the film, so that when you actually came into the scene it’s fully charged with as much realism as you can muster, rather than, like, chatting about the weather by a catering truck. Ken’s a hero of mine. So I thought, why not try to use the techniques of his, given that we can.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tYou are superb as Steve, but the one thing I would say is that somehow you managed to look more haggard, more physically and emotionally exhausted, than I’ve ever seen you on screen before. Which is impressive given you quite recently had the weight of global nuclear annihilation on your shoulders. Was there an art to achieving this?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tHahaha. Well, I have a very good hair and makeup team. And also I wanted it to be believable, like he’s in one costume the whole time. So we spent weeks trying to get that one very ordinary costume correct because it’s all about signaling, you know. It can’t be too flashy, it can’t be too understated, it can’t be too bland, but it can’t yet be too personal. It can’t be too creased, but it can’t be too messy. You know, he can’t wear an earring because that’s too showy, but he can’t be clean shaven because he doesn’t have the time. It’s a process of elimination. And then he should start off in a state of exhaustion, and then become increasingly, increasingly, increasingly more exhausted. And also, he’s really struggling with addiction and so we wanted to in no way possible glamorize the real fucking horror of that disease. But what I have known from speaking to ex-addicts and from knowing them myself is that you can exist in a very high level and function at a very high level while being in a state of addiction. So there was a huge amount of thought and effort that went into it hopefully being invisible.\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240607_Unit_02470-_RT.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240607_Unit_02470-_RT.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240607_Unit_02470-_RT.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240607_Unit_02470-_RT.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240607_Unit_02470-_RT.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240607_Unit_02470-_RT.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240607_Unit_02470-_RT.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SW_20240607_Unit_02470-_RT.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Credit: Robert Viglasky/Netflix</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRobert Viglasky/Netflix\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThis film was announced in February last year, in the middle of the campaigning for “Oppenheimer.” I love the fact you followed that success and the Oscar win for such a blockbuster film with smaller indie projects. It almost feels like “Small Things Like This” and now “Steve” was a deliberate reaction to Hollywood. Was it?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo, not in any way. With “Small Things Like These,” the script was written and ready to go before I did “Oppenheimer,” and then “Steve” was ready and waiting to go until I’d finished. It was written and financed and ready to go. I just had to finish the awards run with “Oppenheimer.” I suppose it’s a 30-year evolution of taste and experience and trying to refine what the stories you actually want to tell are. The unprecedented success of “Oppenheimer” was this magical, extraordinary thing that happened, and I’m so grateful for it and so proud of it. But the types of films that I want to make and the types of stories that I want to tell haven’t been changed by that.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tIn the wake of the success of “Oppenheimer,” did you find yourself suddenly in hot demand to lead more big, studio projects?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo, because I had these other two films straight away. I just wasn’t available, so it didn’t happen. Maybe some day it will. Or maybe it’s too late.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAnother bigger studio film that you are in is “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” but your involvement has been kept quite secretive. Can you offer any clue as to what guise we might see you?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI cannot. But I will say that I think Nia DaCosta has made an extraordinary film, and it’s an amazing accompaniment to Danny’s movie. I’m only in it a tiny bit, but I’m really proud of it.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhen the trailer for “28 Years Later” came out, a lot of people thought that the skeletal infected seen emerging from a field was what remained of your character from the original. I hope you’re going to be a little more than a semi-naked infected?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThat’s very kind of you. I think I am more. But it’s all in the eye of the beholder.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tFinally, there has been some wild online speculation that you’re actually going to be playing Voldemort in HBO’s “Harry Potter” reboot, which I hear is sadly not the case.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo, no, no. It would be very hard to follow Ralph Fiennes.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThis is, of course, what anyone who was playing Voldemort would have been told to say.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tHa! No, I don’t play those games.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eugenio-derbez/\">Eugenio Derbez</a> has been a bankable comedy superstar in Spanish-language markets for more than 30 years. He’s known in the U.S. for his crossover work in such series as Apple TV+’s “Acapulco” and his supporting role in the Oscar-winning “CODA.” </p>\n<p>\n\tAlong the way Derbez has raised a large family, and most of them have become celebrities in their own right. His three adult children have amassed huge social media followings, just like their patriarch. Now, Team Derbez is going all in on a family production company to harness the power of their collective social footprint of more than 180 million followers.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Derbez family has pacted with 3Pas Studios to launch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/studio-drbz/\">Studio DRBZ</a>. The content banner will create original material for digital platforms with an eye on developing concepts and prototypes for movies, TV shows, live media, podcasts, e-commerce and more. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tDerbez already was a partner in 3Pas, which he founded in 2014 in tandem with producer Ben Odell, who  serves as CEO. 3Pas has produced such Eugenio Derbez-starrers as “Acapulco” and the 2023 coming of age indie film “Radical,” which had a strong run on the festival circuit. Javier Williams is a key player in his role as president of Spanish-language content for 3Pas. And the company also operates a busy Mexico-based production services unit dubbed Visceral.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Derbez family is accustomed to being in the spotlight as a unit thanks to the success of the unscripted reality series “De Viaje con los Derbez” that ran for six seasons on TelevisaUnivision’s Vix streamer in the U.S. and on Amazon Prime Video in Latin American markets.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tStudio DRBZ will be home to projects developed and produced by Derbez as well his wife, actress-singer Alessandra Rosaldo, and three adult children, Aislinn Derbez, José Eduardo Derbez and Vadhir Derbez. (The family also includes pre-teen Aitana Derbez, Eugenio’s daughter with Rosaldo.) </p>\n<p>\n\t“For years, our family has shared our lives and stories with audiences across Mexico, Latin America and the United States,” said Eugenio Derbez. “With Studio DRBZ, we’re taking the next step — building a home where our creativity can expand across every platform, from movies to digital-first series, always with our community at the center.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe social media followings of the Derbez family members give them a strong launch pad to reach Hispanic audiences in the U.S. and Latin America. The family members aim to work together and to develop projects on their own.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Studio DRBZ, Eugenio Derbez will serve as chairman while Odell steers as CEO. Williams will stay in his role as head of Spanish-language content and as CEO of Visceral. Leonardo Zimbrón is executive VP of feature films and Jordan Rubio, who is VP of comedy and family content. The company plans to appoint a leader for digital content soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe family’s impressive social stats, per the Studio DRBZ announcement: </p>\n<p>\n\t• Eugenio Derbez (90 million-plus followers) — Emmy and SAG Award winner, global comedy star, and one of the most bankable names in Spanish-language entertainment.</p>\n<p>\n\t• Aislinn Derbez (30 million) — Actress, entrepreneur and style/wellness influencer.</p>\n<p>\n\t• Vadhir Derbez (25 million) — Actor, singer and lifestyle creator.</p>\n<p>\n\t• José Eduardo Derbez (20 million) — Comedian and digital storyteller resonating with younger audiences.</p>\n<p>\n\t• Alessandra Rosaldo (15 million) — Singer, actress and TV host with a strong following around motherhood and everyday life.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Each of us has our own style, voice and audience — but when we come together, the impact multiplies,” the family said in a joint statement.</p>\n<p>\n\tOdell emphasized that the structure of Studio DRBZ was well suited to the way content is created and consumed in the social media age. During the past three years, the Derbez clan has driven 4.1 billion video views and 315 million engagements across multiple social media platforms, per the Studio DRBZ announcement.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“As media continues shifting toward digital-first consumption, Studio DRBZ is uniquely positioned to bridge traditional Hollywood storytelling with the immediacy, authenticity and community-driven power of social platforms,” Odell said.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>(Pictured top left to right: Aislinn Derbez, José Eduardo Derbez, Vadhir Derbez, Aitana Derbez, Eugenio Derbez and Alessandra Rosaldo)</em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“For years, people have asked me, ‘What’s your dream role?’” Kristin Chenoweth says. “‘Is it “Hello, Dolly!”? Is it “Gypsy”?’ And I’ve always responded, ‘It hasn’t been written yet.’” She pauses for dramatic effect, then says, “Well, it has now.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Chenoweth, bringing the story of Jackie Siegel to Broadway with “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-queen-of-versailles/\">The Queen of Versailles</a>” — about the socialite who built America’s most over-the-top McMansion — is an opportunity to look beneath her character’s manicured facade.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m not usually asked to dig this deep,” Chenoweth says from her dressing room at the St. James Theatre, which has been outfitted with cotton-candy-pink furnishings. “Jackie is complicated: Maybe she doesn’t make decisions that we would make, and maybe she spends her money in a way that we wouldn’t. But she also dealt with horrible losses in her life like the death of her 18-year-old daughter from a drug overdose.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat tragedy inspired Siegel and her mogul husband, David, to create a foundation focused on treating addiction and mental health issues. To Chenoweth, it’s a reminder that the Siegels deserve to be remembered for more than building a 90,000-square-foot pleasure palace in Florida (though the show details that conspicuous consumption too).</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond the headline-grabbing premise, theater fans are excited for “The Queen of Versailles” because it reunites Chenoweth with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/stephen-schwartz/\">Stephen Schwartz</a>, the composer of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/wicked/\">Wicked</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tChenoweth starred as Glinda in the original Broadway production, and it ranks as her greatest professional success.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Stephen knows my voice very well,” Chenoweth says. “He’s pushing me in this show. I told him, ‘Are you going to kill me?’ There’s a lot of belting. It’s just constant. It doesn’t relent because Jackie doesn’t relent.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTo pull off the demanding role, Chenoweth is embracing a monastic lifestyle offstage. “I love to<br />talk, but I’m about to become a mute,” she says, pointing to her voice box. “This is a muscle, and<br />you need to rest it. So I’m about to become very good at miming and writing things on a board<br />for my husband.”</p>\n<p>\n\tChenoweth has been involved with “The Queen of Versailles” throughout its development, including starring in last year’s tryout in Boston. But headlining a new Schwartz musical meant dropping out of “Death Becomes Her,” the critically acclaimed hit in which she was supposed to star as the vain actress ultimately played by Megan Hilty.</p>\n<p>\n\t“You can’t date two people; you’ve got to commit,” Chenoweth says. “It was tough because ‘Death Becomes Her’ is freaking great. I laughed my ass off when I went to see it.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Queen of Versailles” was a chance for Chenoweth to work with Michael Arden, who guided the 2023 revival of “Parade” and last year’s “Maybe Happy Ending” to Tony glory. As the project took shape, Arden kept seeing parallels between Siegel’s pampered lifestyle in a gated community in Florida and the rise of a new class of billionaires and tech bros, whose wealth has given them unprecedented power and influence in the Trump era.</p>\n<p>\n\t“On the one hand, Jackie is lovable and funny; on the other hand, she represents everything that is wrong with our culture,” Arden says. “We’ve elevated capitalism to the point where it’s basically a god, and we’ve shaped our society around money being our North Star.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCreating the show has made Arden think about his own relationship with success. “I’ve had to confront my own demons,” he admits. “You reach a peak and maybe you win an award or you get a high-paying job, but instead of enjoying it, you’re conditioned to keep thinking about the next mountain you need to climb. And that leads to disillusionment.”</p>\n<p>\n\tChenoweth had a chance to meet the real Jackie, and she used their time together to study<br />her body language and way of speaking. But when Siegel and her family came to a performance, Chenoweth took her aside beforehand, worried that watching her life dramatized might be too painful for a woman she had come to empathize with.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t want to hurt anybody,” Chenoweth says. “So I said, ‘Jackie, I just want you to know that some people might judge you, and I want you to be prepared.’ And Jackie said, ‘Kristin, play the part. I’ve been judged so much already.’ She gave me permission to play her honestly.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIndie U.S. distributor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/film-movement/\">Film Movement</a> has acquired North American rights to French-Tunisian director Erige Sehiri’s migrant drama “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/promised-sky/\">Promised Sky</a>” which looks at the lives of three undocumented Ivorian women in Tunisia and premiered this year in Un Certain Regard at Cannes.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Promised Sky” follows Marie, an Ivorian pastor and former journalist, who has lived in Tunisia for 10 years. Her home becomes a refuge for Naney, a young Ivorian mother seeking a better future, and Jolie, a strong-willed student carrying her family’s hopes. The arrival of a little orphan girl challenges their sense of solidarity in a tense social climate, revealing both their fragility and strength.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSehiri’s previous film, “Under the Fig Trees,” played in Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight in 2022, and was selected to represent Tunisia at the 2023 Academy Awards.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFilm Movement, which released “Under the Fig Trees” in 2023, has acquired Sehiri’s latest film for North American release. They are planning a theatrical rollout in 2026, followed by release to all leading digital platforms and the home entertainment marketplace, according to a statement.  </p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Promised Sky” deal was announced by  Film Movement president Michael Rosenberg and Jennyfer Gautier, head of international sales at Paris-based Luxbox Films, which is handling world sales on the timely title. The film’s producers are Didar Domehri for Maneki Films and Sehiri for Henia Production. The co-producer is France’s Canal+.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Erige Sehiri has once again demonstrated her extraordinary ability to tell deeply human stories with warmth, nuance, and compassion,” said Rosenberg in the statement. “Promised Sky is a film that resonates far beyond its borders, shedding light on the resilience of those living in limbo and the unbreakable bonds of solidarity,” he added. “We’re honored to bring this powerful work to North American audiences.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Variety</em> critic Tomris Laffly in her<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/promised-sky-review-promis-le-ciel-1236398617/\"> “Promised Sky” review</a> praised the film saying that it “adds up to something greater than the sum of its parts, becoming a unique drama about marginalized African immigrant women fighting for their dignity and place not in Europe (the usual setting for many similarly themed films), but on their own continent, Africa.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Promised Sky” acquisition adds to Film Movement’s growing slate, which includes Japanese auteur Chie Hayakawa’s “Renoir,” that launched from Cannes; Dominik Moll’s police thriller “Case 137,” also a Cannes title; and Chinese director Huo Meng’s Berlinale Silver Bear-winner “Living the Land.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tPatricia Routledge, best known for playing snobbish social-climber Hyacinth Bucket in beloved British sitcom “Keeping Up Appearances,” has died. She was 96. </p>\n<p>\n\t“We are deeply saddened to confirm the passing of Dame Patricia Routledge, who died peacefully in her sleep this morning surrounded by love,” her agent said in a statement to the PA Media news agency.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Even at 96-years old, Dame Patricia’s passion for her work and for connecting with live audiences never waned, just as new generations of audiences have continued to find her through her beloved television roles. She will be dearly missed by those closest to her and by her devoted admirers around the world.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBorn in the north of England near Liverpool, Routledge made a name for herself on stage in the U.K. and later the U.S., winning a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 1968 for “Darling of the Day,” following this up with an Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical for “Candide” 20 years later. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the actress and singer became best known for her performances in TV, especially her turn as the overbearing, flowery-dressed Bucket — which her character famously insisted was pronounced “Bouquet” — in “Keeping Up Appearances,” which ran from 1990 to 1995. </p>\n<p>\n\tDespite only running for five seasons, it would have a lasting legacy, and for a time was the most successful British show internationally. The comedy amassed huge audiences in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and in 2016 was named as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bbc/\">BBC</a> Worldwide’s most exported TV show ever. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1991, Routledge won a British Comedy Award for her portrayal as Bucket, and she was later nominated for two BAFTA TV Awards in 1992 and 1993. </p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing on from “Keeping Up Appearances,” Routledge led crime drama series “Hetty Wainthropp Investigates,” about a retired woman who has a knack for solving crimes. It ran from 1996 to 1998. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2017, Routledge was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II for her services to entertainment and charity.</p>\n</div>",

Discovery has not yet revealed a name, price or launch date for the new CNN streamer.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new service will be decidedly less flashy than CNN+, an attempt to win younger viewers that launched in March of 2022 and was shut down a month later, after Discovery Communications took control of the media assets once known as Time Warner.</p>\n<p>\n\t“CNN has benefitted tremendously from its two years of offering a live 24/7 feed of news to HBO Max customers,” CNN’s executive vice president of digital products and services, Alex MacCallum said Friday. “We learned from HBO Max’s large base of subscribers what people want and enjoy the most from CNN, and with the launch of our own new streaming subscription offering coming later this fall, we look forward to building off that and growing our audience with this unique, new offering.”</p>\n</div>",

The festival announced it will return to Art Basel this December for its fourth annual takeover, staging two nights of live music and screenings at the Miami Beach Bandshell.\n\n\tPresented by Google Gemini, the Tribeca Festival at Art Basel Miami Beach will run Dec. 5–6 and spotlight rising global talent across genres. Bogotá-based, Latin Grammy–nominated group Monsieur Periné will open the series on Friday, followed by a Saturday performance from Hermanos Gutiérrez, the Swiss-Ecuadorian duo known for their cinematic guitar instrumentals. More acts and guests will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\t\n\n\tTickets go on sale November 7 at 11 a.m. ET via tribecafilm.com/miami.\n\n\n\tIn addition to the live music slate, Tribeca is teaming with ESPN for an invitation-only preview of two new short films exploring the overlap between sports and the Latino experience, followed by a conversation with the filmmakers moderated by Emmy-winning documentarian Rudy Valdez — another nod to Tribeca’s continued expansion beyond film into culture-at-large programming.\n\n\t“Tribeca was founded on the belief that storytelling connects communities,” Vincent Cassous, the festival’s head of music programming, said in a statement. “At Art Basel Miami Beach, we’re celebrating the emerging artists and musicians who are reshaping the cultural landscape — and doing it in one of the most vibrant creative cities in the world.”\n\n\tThis year marks Tribeca’s fourth edition at Miami art week, which this year runs from Dec 4-7. In previous years, Tribeca has drawn marquee names including Robert De Niro, JR, Camila Cabello, Chance the Rapper, Flying Lotus, Yussef Dayes, Magdalena Bay and Eartheater.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tLee Tamahori, the New Zealand director behind acclaimed Kiwi drama “Once Were Warriors” alongside blockbuster Hollywood titles such as the James Bond film “Die Another Day,” has died. He was 75.\n\n\tTamahori’s family said the director passed away following a battle with Parkinson’s disease. \n\n\t“His legacy endures with his whānau, his mokopuna, every filmmaker he inspired, every boundary he broke and every story he told with his genius eye and honest heart,” the family said in a statement to New Zealand public service broadcaster RNZ.\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Wellington in 1950, and of Māori descent through his father and British ancestry via his mother, Tamahori made an immediate impact with his directorial debut 1994’s “Once Were Warriors.” An unapologetic and raw portrayal of Māori life, it became a landmark of New Zealand cinema and established him as an exciting new voice in the industry.\n\n\n\tHollywood soon came calling, and Tamahori later directed 1997 survival thriller “The Edge” starring Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin, following by 2001’s “Along Came a Spider.” Then in 2002 came his biggest feature, “Die Another Day,” the last of Pierce Brosnan’s Bond films that also starred Halle Berry (and had a cameo from Madonna). Although Tamahori’s direction was praised, the film received mixed reviews. But it still amassed $432 million at the global box office.\n\n\tTamahori’s following films — “XXX: State of the Union,” “Next” and “The Devil’s Double” — didn’t manage to achieve the same impact, with disappointing theatrical results. After a period of relative quiet, he returned to filmmaking in his homeland with 2016’s “Mahana” and “The Convert” in 2023.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThough published just five years ago, North Carolina author Mason Deaver’s debut novel “I Wish You All The Best” is already a frequent presence on banned-book lists, as its affirming portrait of a teen’s emerging nonbinary identity seems readymade for modern culture-war scolds. Otherwise, it’s been very well received — as should be Tommy Dorfman’s film adaptation, the writer-director’s first feature. \n\n\tThe pleasant, polished drama provides a compassionate take on a high schooler undergoing considerable change, its only debit being the arguably too-neat depiction of that transitional circumstance. But then, as a sort of YA movie, from a YA tome, it is primarily in the business of reassuring viewers, rather than scaring them with worse possible scenarios. Lionsgate is opening last year’s SXSW discovery in theaters nationwide on Nov. 7.\n\t\n\n\tIntroduced shaving off the bare trace of a mustache in a bathroom mirror, Ben (Corey Fogelmanis) is soon screwing up courage to tell their conservative evangelical parents (played by Judson Mills and “Transparent” vet Amy Landecker), “I want to talk to y’all about something.” That the pair do not take it well is immediately evidenced by the 16-year-old finding getting booted onto the streets in freezing weather, sans shoes or jacket. In desperation, Ben calls their older sister Hannah (Alexandra Daddario), despite scant contact since she got thrown out of the family home years prior. Now she lives in a nearby town with husband Thomas (Cole Sprouse), a high school chemistry teacher, and their newborn first child. \n\t\n\n\tDistraught Ben is welcomed into that home, accepting the blurted explanation “I came out to them, they freaked” to mean her little bro is gay. It takes a while — plus a first, bullying attempt at reconnection by their parents — to suss that the issue is something different, perhaps more complex. “I don’t even know who I am … being nonbinary makes me feel like nothing and everything all at once,” Ben tells another empathetic adult, Ms. Lyons (Lena Dunham), the art teacher at the new school where Ben also finds quick acceptance from self-identified cool kids Nathan (Miles Gutierrez-Riley), Sophie (Lisa Yamada) and Meleika (Lexi Underwood). More, Nathan soon promotes himself to the position of first-ever boyfriend for Ben — or non-gender-specific “B,” as they decide to be called henceforth.\n\n\tSet in a comfy suburbia, with no evidence of hostility or bias among peers in the protagonist’s new abode, “I Wish” does seem at times a bit heavy on wish-fulfillment. Nathan and everyone else here is ideally supportive; the sole negativity comes from the parents, who come off as rather one-dimensional caricatures of glint-eyed intolerance in their few scenes. \n\n\tOtherwise, the only source of significant conflict is internal, and that is not dramatized very vividly by either actor-turned-maker Dorfman or her star, who’s best known for a recurring role on the sitcom “Girl Meets World.” Fogelmanis’ B. grows peevish, snippy and resentful, testing viewer patience even as everyone around them is exceptionally patient. This moodiness shouldn’t surprise anyone at that age, considering the teen’s suddenly altered life circumstances. But the film could have done a better job making those emotional waves relatable, perhaps lending them some humor instead of a seriousness that lacks inquiring depth. External changes of increasingly androgynous dress and makeup are granted more detailed emphasis than the workings of B’s mind. \n\n\tSince nearly all the subsidiary figures gamely orbit that mercurial headspace, offering encouragement and sympathetic ears, “I Wish You All the Best” can feel like a glorified one-person show in which the principal is nonetheless a mite underdeveloped. It’s bracing when Brian Michael Smith, as a senior-center supervisor, delivers a tart speech informing derelict part-time worker B. that the entire world doesn’t revolve around their often sulky, withdrawn disposition. The film could have used more such moments of sharper insight for both protagonist and spectator.\n\t\n\n\tStill, Fogelmanis holds central focus strongly enough in most respects, and the supporting cast generally adds relaxed credibility to their parts. (An exception is the normally expert Dunham, who strains for effect in a contrived fairy-godmother-type role.) Dorfman lends the whole an attractive look and smooth pace. No design elements compel particular notice, but their combination lands a couple notches safely above the telegenically bland. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJane Krakowski felt a pang of jealousy the first time she saw “Oh, Mary!,” the hit comedy that imagines former first lady Mary Todd Lincoln as a deranged wannabe cabaret star.\n\n\tThe Tony-winning actor, best known for offbeat television roles on “30 Rock” and “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” remembers whining to herself, “Why didn’t I come up with that for me?!”\n\n\tShe sat in the “Oh, Mary!” audience another five times — since creator and original star Cole Escola departed the play, Mary’s bratty curls have been donned by Betty Gilpin, Tituss Burgess and Jinkx Monsoon — before becoming the latest boldface name to wear the heavy hoop skirt. Taking over the role has been a novel experience for the Broadway veteran of “Nine,” “She Loves Me” and “Company.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m having a lot of firsts in my career,” Krakowski says backstage at the Lyceum Theatre. “It’s the first time I’ve been on the poster and the marquee.”\n\n\n\tA source of familiarity has been her “30 Rock” co-star Cheynne Jackson, who plays Mary’s Teacher (if you know, you know) in the gonzo play set in the days before Lincoln’s assassination. Jackson, scrunched in the corner of Krakowski’s well-decorated dressing room, believes they make a good comedic duo because they share a passion for committing to the bit.\n\n\t“Tina Fey always used to say, ‘Comedy is serious business,’” Jackson says of their “30 Rock” boss. “People in comedies don’t think they’re in comedies. That’s what I love about Jane’s Mary and what I’m trying to do. Never wink.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJane, how did you get cast as Mary?\t\n\n\tKrakowski: I’m assuming they knew I was a super fan. I had just worked with the director Sam Pinkleton on Sondheim’s “Here We Are” in London. You know when someone is going to propose to you, and they ask around, like, “If I propose, would she say yes?” Sam gave me these eyes. I was like, “If you ask me, I would say yes.”\n\t\n\t\tCheyenne, how did you end up as Mary’s Teacher?\t\n\n\tJackson: I was about to do “La Cage aux Folles” with Sam at Pasadena Playhouse. He was like, “You should come see ‘Oh, Mary!’” I don’t do drugs anymore, but I felt like I was high after I saw the show. When Sam called me, I thought he wanted me for Abraham. When he said Mary’s Teacher, I was like, “Really?” Now it’s my favorite part I’ve ever done.\n\t\n\t\tWhen did you two first meet?\t\n\n\tJackson: We did the workshops of “Xanadu” before it went to Broadway [in 2007]. Then Jane got the pilot of “30 Rock,” so she couldn’t continue. But I was a fan. I loved her on “Ally McBeal.” I’d seen her on the West End.\n\n\tKrakowski: You did? Aw.\n\n\tJackson: It was an immediate comfort. I was a queer kid from a poor town in Idaho with no running water. As soon as I got into theater, I gravitated towards girls like Jane who were ballsy, witty and a little naughty.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCheyenne Jackson and Jane Krakowski on “30 Rock”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©NBC/Courtesy Everett Collectio\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow has your friendship informed your performances in “Oh, Mary!”?\t\n\n\tKrakowski: Cheyenne and I have shorthand. We’ve worked together many times, so we have an instant chemistry that is undeniable. [Laughs] Please put that in italics. The fast pace of this comedy is reminiscent of “30 Rock” in needing to be ahead of the joke. We eased into it very quickly.\n\t\n\t\tDo you see a connection between Mary Todd Lincoln and your “30 Rock” character Jenna Maroney?\t\n\n\tKrakowski: When the announcement came out, people were making references to Jenna being in “Oh Mary,” so I got the idea that’s people were seeing the crossover. I mean, Jenna is quite crazy and Mary is quite crazy in her wishes and dreams and desires, so I get that association.\n\t\n\t\tYou ad-lib a “30 Rock” reference in the show. Whose idea was that?\t\n\n\tKrakowski: It was mine. It’s a nice Easter egg for the fans, and Sam was cool with it. I had another one that didn’t make it. Sam said no. [Laughs]\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCheyenne, how did you memorize your character’s Shakespearean monologues?\t\n\n\tJackson: I’ve never done any Shakespeare, and I wanted it to be something I never had to think about. The moment I said yes to this, I wrote out in longhand — that’s how I memorize lines — and started drilling, drilling, drilling.\n\t\n\t\tJane, how do you prepare for such a physically demanding role? \t\n\n\tKrakowski: I added knee pads under Mary’s giant skirt because I’m up and down so much. The thing that surprises me every night is how heavy the dress is. We dance to Grace Jones and Ethel Merman to warm up, and it’s good to get used to the weight. \n\t\n\t\tHow do you keep up energy for eight performances a week?\t\n\n\tJackson: I don’t drink. I eat clean. I get as much sleep as I can. I take care of my body. Jane’s the same way; she’s hardcore. OK, maybe she has Champagne once in a while. \n\n\tKrakowski: At two o’clock in the afternoon, you feel like ‘there’s no way.’ And then suddenly you get here, and this energy kicks in knowing there’s 1,000 people waiting for this live performance. Applause and laughter helps.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Predator is on the hunt at the box office this weekend.\n\n\t20th Century Studios’ “Predator: Badlands,” the ninth movie in the franchise and the first theatrically released “Predator” movie from Disney, has made $4.8 million in previews at the box office.\n\n\tThe PG-13 film, another first for the traditionally R-rated action series, is on track to make $25 million to $30 million in its opening weekend. A debut in that range would make it the second-highest launch for a “Predator” movie, behind the 2004 sci-fi crossover “Alien vs. Predator” which opened to $38 million. That would also put it above the 2010 and 2018 pair of reboots, creatively titled “Predators” and “The Predator,” which both opened to around $24 million. With a $105 million budget plus marketing costs, Disney is hoping “Badlands” can use its broader PG-13 appeal to hunt down a profit after disappointing returns from last month’s “Tron: Ares” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.”\n\t\n\n\tFor the first time, a Predator protagonist takes center stage in “Badlands.” Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi plays Dek, an outcast Predator, who meets Thia (Elle Fanning), a damaged Weyland-Yutani synthetic from the “Alien” franchise, during a hunt for a deadly beast on an even deadlier planet. They’re both on the run from the ruthless synth Tessa (played by Fanning in a double role) and must reluctantly team up to better their chances of survival. Dan Trachtenberg directs after helming the 2022 prequel “Prey” and this summer’s animated spinoff “Predator: Killer of Killers,” both released direct to streaming on Hulu and Disney+.\n\t\n\n\t“Predator: Badlands” will easily top the charts after a disastrous October box office. Other new releases this weekend include Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson’s “Die My Love,” historical drama “Nuremberg,” Sydney Sweeney’s boxing biopic “Christy” and Amazon MGM’s inspirational true story “Sarah’s Oil,” but none are expected to surpass $5 million.\n",

    "description": "\n\tCreated by Liz and Jeff Astrof — and executive produced by Netflix’s “Cheer” star and retired cheerleading coach, Monica Aldama — NBC’s newest sitco",
    "body": "\n\tCreated by Liz and Jeff Astrof — and executive produced by Netflix’s “Cheer” star and retired cheerleading coach, Monica Aldama — NBC’s newest sitcom, “Stumble,” is a hysterical mockumentary about the high-stakes arena of junior college cheerleading. For viewers who adored the “Cheer” docuseries and Aldama’s no-nonsense approach to coaching, this light-hearted twist on that world introduces a cast of wildly colorful characters and a woman determined to win, no matter the cost. \n\t\n\n\tSet in the fictional Wichita Flats, Texas, audiences are introduced to Courteney Potter (a perfectly cast Jenn Lyon), one of the winningest coaches in college cheer history. A workaholic who lives and breathes the sport, Courteney is ready to go after her 15th championship and officially surpass the coach who made her life a living hell during her cheerleading days. Unfortunately, Courteney’s plot is thwarted when she is fired from Sammy Davis Sr. Junior College (SDSJC) for drinking with her team at their victory party and giving out awards for best booty. Courteney’s husband, Boone (Taran Killam), encourages her to use her newfound freedom to relax, but she just can’t let go of that elusive last championship. As a result, she finds herself taking a job 80 miles away in Oklahoma at Headleston Junior College, home of the Buttons. \n\n\n\tUnlike the award-winning SDSJC, now run by Courteney’s former assistant coach and newfound rival Tammy Istiny (Kristin Chenoweth), Headleston’s cheer program leaves a lot to be desired. Though the sole member of the squad, Madonna (Arianna Davis), is exceptionally talented, her narcolepsy means she often collapses on the mat at any moment. Still, not one to be deterred, Courteney presses forward and puts a squad together so Headleston can qualify for the Daytona Cheerleading Championships.\n\t\n\n\tAfter rounding up some cheerleaders made famous from a rather raunchy TikTok routine, pilfering one of Boone’s football players, Dimarcus (Jarrett Austin Brown), taking on Peaches (Taylor Dunbar), a kleptomaniac who Courteney caught breaking into her car and trying to convince SDSJC’s star flyer, Krystal (Anissa Borrego), to join the squad, the cheer coach finds herself with concepts of a team. However, making it to Daytona, let alone winning a championship, may remain well out of Courteney’s grasp. Still, she’s going to do everything she can to get Headleston there. \n\n\t“Stumble” stands out because the show knows exactly what it wants to be. The writers have mastered the cadence and comedic style that make series like “The Office,” “Parks and Recreation,” and, more recently, “Abbott Elementary” so beloved. Moreover, although the show features some familiar tropes and themes, all the characters are distinct and add a new dimension to the narrative and delights of this world. Steven (Ryan Pinkston) is a thirty-something car salesman who was on Courteney’s very first squad more than a dozen years ago. Sally (Georgie Murphy) is a terrible cheerleader with a tragic life story, and even Boone, a football coach, is as obsessed with his wife as she is with her job. \n\n\tLyon’s magnetism touches the entire cast, but her bits with both Killam’s Boone and Chenoweth’s Tammy really leap off the screen. Tammy is a thrilling foil for Courteney. Though the Headleston coach is all encouragement, professional blouses and high-heeled boots, Tammy dresses as if she’s still tumbling around the gym. From a full-fledged cheer outfit to bedazzled tracksuits and a plethora of thick 1980s-esque scrunchies, she is a pint-sized nemesis, barely able to contain her glee at Courteney’s misfortune and switching immediately into nice/nasty banter with her former boss. \n\n\tCritics received just two episodes for review. Yet, the pilot and Episode 2, “Media Day,” are full of sharp writing and details that someone who has long been immersed in this environment, like Aldama, would know to include. Viewers who have never watched “Cheer” will undoubtedly be able to follow the storylines. However, the added knowledge of the Corsicana, Texas-set docuseries might invite a sharper analysis and deeper understanding of the show. \n\t\n\n\tComedies can be tricky. Humor is subjective, and when the setting is as unique as junior college cheerleading, it can be challenging to craft a series with universal appeal. “Stumble” has none of these issues. With a highly talented cast who clearly know their characters and exceptional comedic timing, the show hits the ground running, and it can only reach new heights from here.\n\n\t“Stumble” premieres Nov. 7 on NBC with new episodes dropping weekly on Fridays.\n",

    "body": "\n\tItalian director Margherita Ferri, whose “The Boy With Pink Pants” was the country’s top local 2024 hit, is back behind the camera on “Piercing.” Her next film is a genre-bending feminist and queer fable with a cast including her “Pink Pants” protagonist. \n\n\tShooting started Monday in Bologna on “Piercing,” which is set in the city’s working-class Pilastro neighborhood. The plot focuses on an inseparable trio of 17-year-old friends — Gemma, Alex and Lauriana — “whose lives take an unexpected turn when a lip piercing seems to grant them mysterious superpowers,” according to the synopsis. \n\t\n\n\t“When Gemma gives birth, her mother insists on giving the baby up, convinced she cannot handle the responsibility. Refusing to accept this, the girls run away with the newborn, using their newfound powers to escape,” the description continues. “What begins as a reckless flight soon becomes a transformative journey, forcing them to confront the true weight of their powers.” \n\n\n\t“Piercing” features emerging talents Beatrice Savignani as Gemma, Alicia Edogamhe (“Those About to Die”) as Alex and Lisa Pires Lima as Lauriana. Rounding off the cast are Samuele Carrino, who played the lead in “The Boy With Pink Pants”; Andrea Arru (“The Boy With Pink Pants”); Barbora Bobulova (“A Brighter Tomorrow,” “Portobello”); Italian singer and actress Thony; and Francesco Colella (Netflix’s “The Leopard”).\n\n\tIn her director’s statement, Ferri said “Piercing” seeks “to break away from the canons of all the genres it draws inspiration from: Italian post-neorealism, superhero films, science fiction, queer cinema and European auteur cinema.” She added that “the most interesting challenge is maintaining the balance between the realism of the characters and the film’s supernatural element.”\n\t\n\n\tFerri continued: “The film’s events also stem from the many encounters I’ve had during my work as a documentary filmmaker and during film workshops in schools. From those experiences, I absorbed a bold view of the world; the beautiful recklessness of youth who feel invincible and fearless. This prompted the need to tell this story: an irreverent coming-of-age tale with a strong dose of girl-power, in which both daughters and parents find themselves on a journey of growth. The main theme, in fact, is the changing perception of femininity among the new generations.”\n\n\tFerri studied at the University of Bologna, at UCLA in Los Angeles and is also a graduate of Rome’s Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, where she trained with Paolo Sorrentino and Marco Bellocchio. Last year, she scored a surprise megahit with “The Boy With Pink Pants,” which depicts the harrowing true tale of a 15-year-old boy who took his own life after enduring bullying at school and online. The teen drama became the big box office winner in 2024, grossing more than $9 million and beating high-profile Hollywood titles such as “Wicked” and “Venom 3.” A U.S. remake is in the works to be directed by Nick Cassavetes.\n\n\t“I’m very happy to be able to return to the set with a story I wrote, after ‘The Boy with the Pink Pants,’ which I cherish as a wonderful experience and the relationships with some of the cast members who supported me on this crazy project: Samuele Carrino and Andrea Arru,” Ferri said.\n\n\t“Piercing” is being produced by Carlo Cresto-Dina’s Tempesta with RAI Cinema, in co-production with Switzerland’s tellfilm. RAI Cinema’s 01 Distribution will release in Italy. The film’s producers are Carlo Cresto-Dina and Manuela Melissano.\n\n\tCresto-Dina is known for shepherding works by young directors who have gone on to make a major splash, such as Alice Rohrwacher, all of whose works he has produced.\n\n\t“With ‘Piercing,’ our research continues towards a cinema that can appeal to a broad audience, without giving up on provocation,” the producers said in a statement. “In Margherita Ferri’s fantastic story, it’s the daughters who teach their mothers how to dare and win; how to rediscover the superpowers of the feminine within themselves.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBowing in Tallinn’s official competition, “Think of England” is the long-awaited sophomore pic of BAFTA-nominated British writer-director Richard Hawkins. If his directorial debut “Everything” (2004) was billed by Variety as a “forcefully executed, slow-burning thriller….a “no-frills, nine-day production,” his new endeavour is another tour-de-force. \n\n\tA thought-provoking exploration of truth and deceit, moral boundaries, a nod to acting, through a character-driven WW2 porn satire. All of it wrapped in 21 days, with on-screen production value squeezed to its upmost by seasoned producer Nick O’Hagan (“The Serpent Queen,” “The Good Liar”) and Poppy O’Hagan of Giant Films.\n\t\n\n\t“It takes a lunatic to make a film and I’m quite a good one! I realized how comfortable I am with making movies and how I love it,” Hawkins quips, commenting about his 11-year hiatus since his breakthrough pic “Everything” starring Ray Winstone, that segued from his acclaimed screenwriting debut “The Theory of Flight,” helmed by Paul Greengrass.\n\n\n\t“Yeah, I was for a while disheartened by the film biz that can drag you down if you don’t watch it, as you get a lot more rejection than you’ll get successes,” he tells Variety. “I wanted to do other silly crazy stuff, live in different places. But then I felt it was unfinished business with film.”\n\n\tAfter nearly two decades of stalling with the script and another project with Giant Films in the making – “The Most Dangerous Girl in the World” – Hawkins finally cracked it. “I couldn’t make it work the way I felt was right. It just didn’t feel relevant to today’s times, but now it does. I wanted to explore the fine lines that we draw in the sand to define our moral compass. What is right and what is wrong, how those lines get very quickly washed away and re-written, notably during war,” Hawkins explains.\n\t\n\n\tThe WWII satire is set in the run-up to the Allied invasion of France, when two British film projects are commissioned at the very highest level. One of them is a Laurence Olivier adaptation of Shakespeare’s “Henry V.” As the logline runs, “this is the story of the other project.”\n\n\tWe follow a group of disparate souls, sent to the remote Orkney Island off the northeastern coast of Scotland. Their mission: to make propaganda porn movies to up the moral of the British boys on the frontline. The group is made up of a seriously damaged former movie star, a celebrated German director, a munitions-machinist-come-aspiring-actress, an Etonian major from the Ministry of Information; an aging hair-and-makeup artist and a young trainee sound recordist. \n\n\tAnother person is on the island, watching. But when it’s time for the camera to roll, nothing goes as anticipated as tension creeps up, as does violence and the pressure of abiding to the contract of making porn.\n\n\t “Nothing chronicles the history of our moral structures more than film,” argues Hawkins, who cites some of the most iconic steamy scenes in film history: Hedy Lamarr walking naked in the woods in the 1933 “Ecstasy” and Burt Lancaster properly kissing Deborah Kerr on the beach in the 1953 “From Here to Eternity.” “U.S. politicians who were afraid that film would undermine the morality of society of the time, created the Hollywood Hays Code, but then WWII put an end to it.”\n\n\t“Yet two film taboos remain,” Hawkins continues, “and this is perhaps the epicentre of the movie. “There are two things you cannot act: actually having sex and killing someone. These lines can never be crossed in the real world. They have consequences.” As they have in “Think of England.”\n\n\tOn that point, Hawkins said his pic is also a nod to actors, the psychological, emotional, even physical pressure that comes with their craft, especially when they have to perform “uncomfortable” scenes. “With actors, we sometimes don’t consider what they go through in the act of pretending. There’s a huge emotional turmoil going on that fascinates me,” he admits.\n\n\tPushing further his reflection on reality and make belief, Hawkins also plays with the audience and our perception of truth in “Think of England” (plot twists are not disclosed here). “We’re in a world of fake news, authoritarianism creeping up; we’re starting to echo the mid-late 1930s with a threat to democracy. Before war comes propaganda and lies. In that sense, the film resonates with today’s reality. I wanted the film to be a reminder not to accept what we’re hearing,” insists the director.\n\t\n\n\tTo make the film, Hawkins relied on an ensemble cast including Jack Bandeira (“Happy Valley,” “Lockwood & Co”), Natalie Quarry (“Call The Midwife“) in the title roles, John McCrea (“Cruella”), Ronni Ancona (“Big Impression”), Ben Bela Böhm (“Angels & Demons”), Ollie Maddigan (“The Olive Boy”) and Oscar Hoppe (“Munich: The Edge of War”).\n\n\t“Our idea was to cast people that would just walk on set and be in 1943, but not A-list names that would undermine the kind of double identity that everybody has in the film.”\n\n\tAn intimacy coordinator was on set to help the actors feel safe and comfortable with the nudity and choreography of the sex scenes. “You could argue that this film goes back to the invention of intimacy coordination. We see the actress Holly Spurring spending a lot of time discussing with the director how she feels about being naked and having sex. Today, you have the intimacy coordinator filling that role, which is great as it’s an uncomfortable position for any director to have,” Hawkins observes.\n\n\tShot in 21 days on a shoestring budget – partly in Shinfield Studios in Reading and on location on Anglesey in North Wales – the pic also benefitted from the expertise of cinematographer Sarah Cunningham (“The Banishing”), production designer Chris Richmond (“The Amazing Mr Blunden”), costume designer Nadia Dunn-Hill (“Wimbledon”) and hair & make-up Designer Alexis Arenas (“Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”). \n\n\t“We shot in color and black & white on a Mitchell Standard 35mm camera and with shifting aspect ratios to tell the multi-layered narrative,” adds Hawkins who said early pre-production work was crucial to set the visual style and priorities.\n\n\tMade For Cinema\n\n\tThe O’Hagan father and daughter production duo said building trust with the cast and crew, making them feel “part of something unique” was quintessential.\n\n\tNick O’Hagan underlined that his production model for indie filmmaking is built on collaboration and sharing, including financially, with the crew being offered “a small profit share of the box office.”\n\n\tBacked by private investors, the pic was executive produced by Geoffrey Freeman, Andrew Wood and Lucas Wood-Oliván. Domestic distribution and international sales are yet to be finalised.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re looking for true partners, willing to take part in the film’s journey on screens and guarantee the pic’s long-tail theatrical release,” Nick O’Hagan explains.\n\n\tAs such, ”Think of England” is a blue print for the O’Hagan’s new Made for Cinema initiative, a movement “that supports and advocates for non-dependent filmmakers to get their work released theatrically across an extended window, connecting with audiences through events and stimulating conversations and community around provocative and ambitiously authored cinema,” says a statement, referring to a concept championed by indie production guru Ted Hope.\n\n\t“It’s about staying free from any constrains. This was the case with ‘Think of England’ and we will apply this vision for other filmmakers,” comments  Nick O’Hagan.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tHard as it may be to imagine in these genre-blurring times, four decades ago, music fans were as siloed and separated as the genre sections of a record store. Back then, a rock fan wandering into the country or “soul” section (and vice-versa) was often like wandering into a neighborhood where people would look at you funny. Even within rock, the subcultures were divided — and none more so than the punk and heavy metal crowds.\n\n\tOf course, it was absurd, because the genres were so similar — loud guitars and aggression — and because most of the musicians in both crowds initially started playing music because of bands like Kiss and Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. But for the most part, they hated each other like rival gangs: A punk musician joining a metal band would be mocked mercilessly by his former friends. It was actually a big deal when Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine had a Sex Pistols sticker on his guitar in the mid-‘80s, and when Metallica covered a Misfits song.\n\t\n\n\tBut those boundaries broke down quickly in the following years, and Soundgarden had more than a little to do with it: Their 1987 debut EP, “Screaming Life,” was the most vivid and convincing fusion of punk and hard rock that had come to date. Other bands had done it before (including pioneering Seattle rock band Green River, which split the difference by evolving into Pearl Jam and Mudhoney) and it would be the basis of the sound of the then-nascent grunge genre, but Soundgarden were the first band where it truly felt like both genres were proudly equal in their collective DNA.\n\n\n\tAlong with frontman Chris Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil is the only bandmember who was with Soundgarden for the duration. He, Cornell — who initially was the drummer and singer — and bassist Hiro Yamamoto formed the band in 1984. Eventually Cornell decided to become frontman, and after a brief stint with Scott Sundquist on drums — who played on the band’s recorded debut on the legendary “Deep Six” compilation — Matt Cameron joined in 1986 and remained from then on.\n\t\n\n\tSoundgarden’s initial run lasted for over a decade, until they decided to split in 1997, after releasing five albums, two EPs and a bounty of stray tracks. All four members worked on solo projects or in different bands, but they reunited in 2010 (with Cameron splitting his time between Soundgarden and Pearl Jam) and released another album, “King Animal,” in 2011 and toured regularly, until Cornell’s death in 2017.\n\n\tFive members of Soundgarden — Thayil, Cameron, bassists Yamamoto and Shepherd and, posthumously, Cornell — will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday. Variety caught up with Thayil last weekend during a break from rehearsals for the show. Cameron has posted photographs of the bandmembers rehearsing with members of Pearl Jam (who recorded the joint album “Temple of the Dog” with Cornell and Cameron in 1990) and Taylor Momsen of the Pretty Reckless, who opened for Soundgarden on their final tour, but everything else remains a surprise. (See also Variety‘s exclusive interview with original Soundgarden manager Susan Silver here.)\n\n\tI suppose we should start with the obvious question: How does it feel to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? \n\n\tIn the ‘80s or even in the ‘90s, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was not something that I saw as a legitimate consequence of my work or career. I didn’t see that as an objective, it wasn’t on my radar, and the subculture that we came from did not see it as a standard of excellence or a measurable quantity of accomplishment.\n\n\tSo how do you judge a career? We wanted to be the kind of band that would inspire people to pick up instruments and start writing and make their own original music, and hopefully to be innovative. We certainly didn’t want people to imitate us, and we had no interest in imitating anybody else. \n\n\tAll of us — I’m thinking mostly of Chris and Hiro and I, who founded the band — are outsiders, and we all think a little bit differently from each other and certainly from the mainstream. So our goal was to be honest as individuals and find that point in which the three of us shared a vision, and to develop it. And in doing so, you’re going to come up with something that’s different and unique, but also familiar because you’re young and you have certain reference points. That’s where Soundgarden’s identity was born.\n\t\n\n\tOne of the many objectives was to be the kind of band that we looked at, like the Ramones or Pink Floyd or the MC5 or Black Sabbath, and say, hey, thank you guys, and we’re going to pass it forward. I think we did that, and that’s the standard.\n\n\tBut it does make you ask, how do you quantify “fame” for the Hall of Fame? Is it sales, how often you were on MTV, how many top 40 hits you had? That wasn’t on our radar. But when you start seeing artists [inducted] for how they impacted younger musicians and up-and-coming musicians, then you start thinking, well, maybe they are getting something right — like when the Stooges got inducted.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThayil and Cornell at MTV VMAs, 1994 (Photo by Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRon Galella Collection via Getty\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen do you think that started to happen?\n\n\tI think my opinion of the Rock Roll Hall of Fame changed because of Chris’ experience, when he inducted Heart [in 2013]. Chris and Ben Shepherd attended that year, and they both came back with a positive experience. Chris communicated to me, “You know how we’ve always felt about the Hall of Fame and how it didn’t really matter to us? It matters to the fans.” He saw how Heart’s fans responded, how important and validating it was to them that an artist they care about was recognized as being important. Chris said that insight is what made him realize that this is a valuable institution. \n\n\tAnd he convinced me — we might have had a few different conversations about it, but I trusted Chris’ judgment and insight in that regard. I mean, we’re all close friends and I trusted his understanding and the way he shared it with me. \n\n\tI also feel like both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Grammys have gotten a lot better in the last 20 years or so. It seemed very stodgy, very rock and roll establishment, with Mick Jagger and [Rolling Stone founder] Jann Wenner and that sort of Boomer club. \n\n\t(Laughing) You said the first two names that would have popped into my head.\n\n\tBut it’s gotten a lot more open-minded, and I think the Grammys have as well. \n\n\tI think that’s spot on. Iit was very Rolling Stone, post-hippie-culture oriented, and the fucking Boomer soundtrack for every movie about the Vietnam War — that seemed to be the orientation. But they did change things, it went from being a white guys’ club that patted themselves on the back to actually recognizing what musicians listened to and how they were impacted.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSoundgarden in 2014\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tColin Young-Wolff for Artists Den Entertainment\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt seems like something that was key was when they brought in people like Tom Morello and Questlove, and almost immediately, you saw Kiss and Chic getting inducted — artists who were hugely influential on their generation, but the previous generation couldn’t see that.\n\n\tAnd that’s the point. Kiss were impactful — they didn’t just sell a lot of records, they convinced millions of kids to pick up a guitar and start bands. I mean, grunge, punk, thrash, so many aspects of American popular culture could trace back to little kids being like, “Wow, this is cool. I want a guitar!”\n\n\tAt the time of “Screaming Life,” we’d never heard a band that sounded like both Black Sabbath and the Butthole Surfers. Green River did to a degree, but at the time, punk and metal were worlds apart.\n\n\tI mean, I probably had the first two Sabbath albums and also the first two Butthole Surfers albums in my record collection, and they were probably both in Chris’ collection and in [Green River/Mudhoney singer] Mark Arm’s too, I guarantee it. \n\n\tWas that intentional, or did it just come out? \n\n\tIt’s like, “I love listening to both of these things, they’re both important culturally and they’re both important to my identity. I am going to be honest, and I’m going to play the music that’s in my head, and so are Hiro and Chris. And that intersection is who we are.”\n\n\tWe shared enough influences that we had a good base identity to begin with. I was 16, learning guitar, and then here come the Sex Pistols, here come the Ramones. I get these records, like, oh my God, not only is this my ability and aptitude as a guitarist, but it’s cool distorted chords, cool grooves, it’s all the good stuff. So then you get older and start realizing, there’s innovation here, and you’re growing up as the genre grows up, and then you’re in college and you put your childhood toys away, which includes your Kiss records.\n\n\tBut then at some point, you get together with friends and you realize, we were all weaned on this stuff, and if it’s important to who we are, then we’re being dishonest by not communicating that. I think we were of that cusp generation — us, the Green River guys, the Melvins, and then ultimately the Nirvana and Alice in Chains guys: “Here’s this new shit happening that we love, but we’re also raised on this other stuff. Do we deny that because we’re older and smarter and grown up? Or is there room for it in the way we make music?” I think there was a very honest allowance for that in our little pocket subculture in Seattle, an allowance for those kind of guilty pleasures, an allowance for the parody of the homage.\n\t\n\n\tI specifically said this to Chris and Hiro repeatedly: We don’t need to bend for the audience or bend for the market, we will bend the market for us. And I think we achieved that for many years. Of course, along the way, there are compromises where you have to accommodate to a market that is in some ways inflexible and institutionalized, and obviously, there are things that help those doors open and helped us bend the market, like the success of Nirvana and Pearl Jam. But certainly working with a manager, record labels and artists who were all in the same positions helped us redefine things.\n\n\tSo did it feel strange to have been so uncompromising in your music and then find yourself onstage at Madison Square Garden and stadiums all over Europe, opening for Guns N’ Roses?\n\n\tWe just thought, “We can headline shows ourselves and maybe never get to play in Kansas or Oklahoma or Nebraska, or we can play with Guns N’ Roses and hit all these markets, and we’re not being anyone we’re not, and can pick up some people who maybe would never have heard of us.” \n\n\tThat worked well, and it worked also because Duff [McKagan, Guns N’ Roses’ bassist] came from Seattle. He played with a band called Ten Minute Warning, which kind of did something similar to what Green River and Soundgarden and the Melvins were doing: They were born out of a few punk bands and also embraced these metal elements. But then Duff and [drummer] Greg Gilmore, later of Mother Love Bone and a friend of ours, took off for L.A. and eventually Duff joined Guns N’ Roses. Punk rock was very much part of what Guns N’ Roses were doing, as well as classic rock and arena rock.\n\n\tWas Duff a friend of yours before he moved to L.A.?\n\n\tNo, but we knew who he was. Hiro and I moved from the Chicago area in ’81, we were 20 and 21 respectively, so we were going to shows and would see Duff with the Fartz or the Fastbacks. And when Guns N’ Roses came out, it was like, “Hey, it’s that dude!” — they played a venue that we played with Soundgarden, the Guerrilla Gardens Rock Theater. There were a lot of people we knew of because you’d see them at shows with 100 or 150 people or less, so you knew everyone who was into Black Flag or the Butthole Surfers. It was a very small scene in Seattle.\n\t\n\n\tYou still haven’t really answered the first question: How does this feel to you? Does it feel validating or …?\n\n\tI think there’s some sense of validation in that we can share the acknowledgement with our peers and colleagues. The fact that we’re being recognized by an institution that also recognizes Pearl Jam and Nirvana and the Stooges, I think that’s a big deal. And I would hope that other bands like Sonic Youth and the Pixies and Motorhead and Iron Maiden and Alice in Chains would also be recognized. The community of peers and colleagues — that’s what makes it a positive acknowledgement. \n\n\tIs there anything you’d like to tease about the performance? We’ve already seen photos of you rehearsing with Pearl Jam and Taylor Momsen.\n\n\tThere’s one thing to be sure of: I will be attempting to play guitar again. And I think we all know that the spirit of this is the love we have for each other and the love that we all shared for Chris.\n\n\tSo what we do is in honor of our legacy, and in honor of Chris and how he loved us and his unmistakable imprint on that legacy.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Sub Pop Records\n\t\n\n\n",

In 2002, a woman named Angela Walker and her brother, Benjamin Humphrey, reportedly got into an altercation with Canadian tourist Derek Rogers on Old Orchard Beach -- a resort town in Maine.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          During the fight, Rogers allegedly hurled a Native American slur at Walker ... and Rogers was later discovered savagely beaten and suffocated with sand.\n      \n    \n          In 2003, Walker and Humphrey were convicted of killing Rogers after pleading guilty to manslaughter, according to the Bangor Daily News (BDN). Walker also pleaded guilty to perjury and was given a 10-year prison term, the newspaper said.\n      \n    \n          Fast forward to September 2025. After serving her prison time, Walker announced she was running for the Bangor City Council and gave an interview to BDN, addressing her manslaughter and perjury convictions.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          “That’s my past. I don’t live there anymore and I’m a different person,” said Walker, a 13-year resident of Bangor.\n      \n    \n          BDN learned there are no rules or laws in Bangor that prevent someone with a criminal record from running for office.\n      \n    \n          Walker also told the paper she has no party affiliation as she was running against 8 other candidates in Bangor. On Tuesday, Walker was elected to the city council, snagging one of three open seats.\n      \n    \n          Crime does pay!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

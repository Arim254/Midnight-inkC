    "body": "\n\tJavier Bardem is speaking out in support of Film Workers for Palestine.\n\n\t“Regarding the Film Workers for Palestine pledge, I want this to be very clear,” he said in a statement to CNN. “We do not discriminate against any person based on their nationality, race, religion, or gender. We of course believe discrimination of any kind is wrong and do NOT support that and have continued to reiterate this. We support holding companies and institutions all over the world accountable, NOT individuals, for their complicity and participation in the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza, and the illegal settlement of the West Bank.”\n\t\n\n\tEarlier in September, more than 3,900 industry leaders signed a pledge against working with Israeli film institutions and companies that are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” The list of signatures includes filmmakers and actors like Bardem, Yorgos Lanthimos, Ava DuVernay, Adam McKay, Emma Stone, Olivia Colman, Ayo Edebiri, Lily Gladstone, Mark Ruffalo, Hannah Einbinder, Peter Sarsgaard, Aimee Lou Wood, Paapa Essiedu, Gael Garcia Bernal, Riz Ahmed, Joaquin Phoenix, Nicola Coughlan, Andrew Garfield, Harris Dickinson, Bowen Yang, Rooney Mara, Guy Pearce, Jonathan Glazer, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Fisher Stevens, Abbi Jacobson, Eric Andre and Elliot Page.\n\n\n\tIn October, U.K. Lawyers for Israel sent a letter of warning to Netflix, Disney, Amazon Studios, Apple and Warner Bros. Discovery, among others, stating that the boycott violates the U.K.’s Equality Act and may impact financing and insurance.\n\n\t“[The Equality Act 2010] is the key legislation in the U.K. protecting against racism and discriminatory treatment,” states the letter, which has been seen by Variety. “If the U.K. television and film industry colludes with acts contrary to this legislation, organizations are themselves likely to be in breach. It also creates a dangerous precedent: one that condones the exclusion of individuals and/or organizations based solely on their nationality, ethnicity, and/or religion.”\n\t\n\n\tOn Friday, Variety exclusively reported Warner Bros.’s own statement against the boycott. The studio said it is “committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment for its employees, collaborators, and other stakeholders,” and that participating in the movement would most likely violate internal policies. \n\n\t“Our policies prohibit discrimination of any kind, including discrimination based on race, religion, national origin or ancestry,” said the studio. “We believe a boycott of Israeli film institutions violates our policies. While we respect the rights of individuals and groups to express their views and advocate for causes, we will continue to align our business practices with the requirements of our policies and the law.” \n\n\tBardem is one of Hollywood’s most outspoken voices against the conflict between Israel and Palestine. In the weeks following the release of Film Workers for Palestine’s pledge, he further explained to Variety on the 2025 Emmys red carpet his choice to join the cause. \n\n\t“Here I am today, denouncing the genocide in Gaza,” he said. “I am talking about the IAGS, the International Association of Genocide Scholars, who study thoroughly genocide and has declared it is a genocide. That’s why we ask for a commercial and diplomatic blockade and also sanctions on Israel to stop the genocide. Free Palestine.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“What else is left for them to do that they haven’t done yet?” asks resilient Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who was sentenced to six years in prison for “propaganda against the system” after planning a film about protests against the 2009 election. “Are they going to ban me from leaving again? Okay, let them ban me. That way, I have more time, and instead of traveling, I can write my next film. They want to throw me in jail? Okay, let them throw me in jail. Then I will find the topic of my next film.”\n\t\n\n\tAstonishing as it may seem, I have seen Panahi three times outside Iran in the last six months, first in Cannes, where he won the Palme d’Or — the top prize at the world’s most important film festival — for “It Was Just an Accident.”\n\n\n\tNext, I spotted him on the streets of Telluride. He’d traveled all the way to an old mining town high in the mountains of Colorado to receive the prestigious festival’s Silver Medallion. Though nothing is more important to Panahi than cinema, I doubt he can go two hours without a tobacco fix, and there he was, smoking a cigarette in front of the New Sheridan Hotel.\n\n\tJust this past weekend, I was invited to moderate a Q&A with Panahi at the Ojai Playhouse, two hours north of Los Angeles — a unique opportunity to interview a personal hero, who speaks through a translator. The way things are going, I expect we’ll next cross paths at the Academy Awards.\n\n\tIn any case, it’s surreal to encounter Panahi outside of Iran, since the defiant diretor of “This Is Not a Film” and “No Bears” has been under a 20-year ban from leaving the country — or, more to the point, from making movies — since 2010, when he was charged with “propaganda against the system” and sentenced to six years in prison for planning a film about protests against the 2009 election.\n\t\n\n\tPanahi has served about 10 months of that term: the first three while awaiting trail in 2010, and seven more, starting in July 2022, when he presented himself at Tehran’s Evin Prison to question the arrest of a fellow director, Mohammad Rasoulof (whose “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” suggests just how untenable Iran’s repressive regime truly is). Panahi was detained and locked up shortly before the death of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, which sparked the Women, Life, Freedom movement.\n\n\tAfter going on hunger strike in February 2023, Panahi was eventually allowed to return home, and though the authorities have strictly forbidden him from filmmaking, he did more than simply defy them. “It Was Just an Accident” is a direct response to time served.\n\n\t“If I hadn’t gone to prison, I would not have understood these characters, and perhaps this film would never have been done,” Panahi told me. “So I’m not the one who made this film. This film was made by the people who put me in prison.”\n\n\tIn the movie, a man haunted by his time in Evin is convinced that he has found his cruel interrogator, Eqbal, in the outside world. Though he never saw his tormentor’s face in person, the survivor recognizes the sound of Eqbal’s false leg. It’s like “Death and the Maiden,” played for absurdist comedy, as he kidnaps the one-legged stranger, then enlists three fellow survivors to confirm the inspector’s identity and decide what to do.\n\n\tWhen I complimented Panahi on his courage in telling a story so openly critical of his experience, he rejected that word. “To me, it’s really not ‘courage.’ This is the work I do. My work is cinema. In order to do my work and protect the beliefs that I have about cinema, nothing is important to me. We have accepted that where we live, anything you do comes with a price,” Panahi said.\n\n\t“You call me brave, but the truth is that many people are doing things that are way more important,” he continued in full sincerity. “I’ll give you a small example. I met people in prison who would go on hunger strikes for 20 or 30 days, and no one would find out about it, whereas if I stopped eating for two days, the entire world would find out. So, compared to them, my actions are not really being brave.”\n\n\t“It Was Just an Accident” is Panahi’s tribute to those people whose lived experience is reflected in the collection of characters who determine Eqbal’s fate in the film. For seven months, Panahi had been getting to know his fellow prisoners, talking and listening to their stories.\n\t\n\n\t“We were sharing these stories not because I had it in mind to make a film about them. It was just a matter of passing the time, to make the prison days easier. They needed to share their stories, and I needed to hear them,” Panahi said.\n\n\t“The moment I stepped out of prison, I turned around and I looked at those tall walls, and it hit me that my friends were left behind. And as days go by, it just eats you from the inside,” he explained. “So I said to myself one day, ‘I have to do something. What could I do? I don’t know anything other than cinema.’ And then it hits me that this is the language I can speak in — the language of cinema — and that became a motivation for work.”\n\n\tIn the film, Panahi was intentionally sparing with how much he shares about the characters’ backstories. We see that Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), who thinks he recognizes Eqbal (Ebrahim Azizi), is a simple worker. “Only because he had objected to the situation, they had thrown him in jail,” Panahi told me, though the detail had escaped me in the script. It’s clear that Shiva (Mariam Afshari), the pacifist wedding photographer, and the hot-headed Hamid (Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr) were in a relationship that did not last.\n\n\t“We know that Shiva was a journalist who wrote a piece about bogus drugs, fake medicine, and because of what she exposed, she went to prison,” Panahi said. “Eqbal, the interrogator, was humiliated in his childhood, and those acts of humiliation have affected him in a way that he has now come to power and is trying to prove himself.”\n\n\tThe details may be minimal, but according to Panahi, “I thought this much would be enough for us to be able to follow bigger conversations about the topic of anger, the topic of justice, the topic of forgiveness and, more important than anything, the topic of the cycle of violence and whether it’s going to continue in the future.”\n\n\tThat matters, Panahi believes, because such a system cannot continue indefinitely. The film illustrates as much: Sooner or later, the people will turn on their oppressors, at which point, the debate about what to do with Eqbal anticipates questions of how to handle those who were complicit in the old means of control.\n\n\t“This film is made for the post-Islamic Republic. So I am raising a question in the film: Have we prepared ourselves to do what we need to do for the day after the collapse of the regime?” Panahi said. “I do believe that the collapse is going to happen, but no one knows when — today, tomorrow, in a week, in a month, in a year. No one knows.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter the screening, Panahi admitted that his career had started in a very different vein, far removed from the kind of social consciousness the world first witnessed with “The White Balloon” in 1995 — ethical, ground-level stories about people Panahi lives with or observes on the streets. Before that, as a student, he’d been inspired by one of Hollywood’s greatest directors.\n\n\t“I learned the alphabet of cinema from Alfred Hitchcock. And it helped me later on, so that I wouldn’t have spelling mistakes in my films,” said Panahi, who was enterprising enough to secure a budget from the national TV to make a short film in the style of Hitchcock. “When I got to the editing process, I asked myself, ‘What nonsense have you made?’ The alphabet was correct, but the film had no soul.”\n\n\tIn his shame, Panahi went to the lab, stole the negatives and destroyed them. Afterward, he felt despondent for a time, unsure what kind of contribution he might make to cinema. And then he discovered Italian neorealism — “and especially ‘Bicycle Thieves’” by Vittorio De Sica, he beamed. “I realized that I love socially engaged cinema, but I’m wasting my time in another genre.”\n\n\tOver the course of his first few features, Panahi was content fighting for civil rights, pushing back on the oppression of women with films such as “The Circle” and “Offside,” or else exposing the cost of class differences in “Crimson Gold.”\n\n\tWhen Panahi first received his heavy sentence in 2010, he was reminded of how so many of his students had complained that they found it impossible to work within the Iranian system. Instead of adopting that same defeatist attitude, he thought: “Okay, the authorities have told me not to make a film, so I’m going to shoot something in my own apartment with a friend, and then at the end call it, ‘This Is Not a Film.’”\n\n\tIf he could not make films for a living, Panahi had to come up with another form of income. “The easiest thing for me would be to drive a taxi,” he thought. But even then, Panahi realized, “If I drive a taxi around, I’m still going to place a camera somewhere and tell the stories of my passengers.” That film, “Taxi,” won the Golden Bear at the 2015 Berlin Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tHe’s grown even more creative since. “When I was working with Mohammad Rasoulof in my apartment, we still did not have much experience, and that’s why they raided my place and took us to prison. We had not taken security measures,” said Panahi, who gradually realized what they needed to do: Now, he keeps his team small and avoids using large equipment, to minimize the attention drawn to his productions. At times, he and Rasoulof direct by proxy, while the crew pretends to be shooting a student film or commercial.\n\n\tCasting is clearly a challenge for Panahi’s movies, which are shot without permits in direct violation of the law (bypassing the obligation to submit his scripts to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance for approval). He asks potential actors to read the script at his place, then gives them 24 hours to decide if they want to be involved. In theory, their participation could result in punishment — the reason many Iranian films list “Anonymous” where names normally appear in the credits.\n\n\t“I really believe that everyone can act. What matters is that they are chosen correctly,” Panahi said. “The first thing I pay attention to is physical appearance, the body of a potential actor. When the physical characteristics are a match, as soon as you see that person on the screen, you’re halfway there.”\n\n\tPanahi writes the roles first, then looks for the right person to embody them. In “It Was Just an Accident,” the movie opens with Eqbal, which catches audiences off-guard, since they start to sympathize with him — a family man, driving with his young daughter and pregnant wife, who’s upset when a dog runs in front of his car— before meeting Vahid or hearing why he might have reason to hate Eqbal.\n\n\t“As you go through the film and you see the other characters in doubt about who this person is, you as the audience are also in doubt because you remember how distressed he was by having killed a dog,” Panahi explained. Prior to 2022, the filmmaker wouldn’t have dared target such a character — to make Eqbal a metonym for the regime.\n\n\t“When I was in prison, something happened which divided the history of the Islamic Republic into before and after: Women, Life, Freedom,” Panahi said. “Everything changed after that, and cinema could not be separate from it, especially this kind of cinema that claims to be socially engaged. Ordinary people had started to break the red lines. And now cinema also had to go past the red lines.”\n\t\n\n\tLooking back, Panahi recalled a startling experience from the year 2000, when he gave his script for “The Circle” to someone he wanted to work on the film: “When I went to speak to them two days later, they put the script in an envelope and gave it back to me very hastily. They told me, ‘Take this and don’t ever show it to anyone. … You might get stabbed on the street, and your intestines will fall out,’” he said. “Back then, ‘The Circle’ was one step ahead of the society. But since Women, Life, Freedom, cinema was falling behind. The society is now one step ahead of cinema, and we try to catch up.”\n\n\tThat explains something as simple as showing women without the traditional head covering. Before, it was a violation to film actresses without the hijab. But since those 2022 protests, many women have rejected the hijab. “Social cinema is not supposed to lie. If it does not depict these realities, does not stay truthful to this principle, the film will not be believable.”\n\n\tThis evolution in Iranian cinema, represented by Panahi’s latest and Rasoulof’s “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” before it, marks a shift for international audiences as well. Previously, it was easy to watch Panahi’s film with pity for those in what appeared to be a more restrictive theocratic culture.\n\n\tPanahi sees it the other way around, and has warned as much when he travels to other countries. “Unfortunately,” he said, “what we are living in contemporary Iran — what seems like the past — is the future of many places in which we see these signs.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFaced with further budget cuts following the Trump administration’s elimination of federal funding for public media, local public radio outlet KCRW has trimmed an additional 10% of its staff. Included in the cuts were several of the station’s most well-known music DJs, including Jason Kramer, Jeremy Sole and José Galván. Also as part of the changes, host Elvis Mitchell’s long-running interview series “The Treatment” will now run inside “Weekend Edition.”\n\t\n\n\tKCRW president Jennifer Ferro revealed some of the changes in a letter to the station’s subscribers and supporters on Friday.\n\n\n\t“Like so many other public media organizations, KCRW is restructuring parts of the organization in response to our new budget reality,” Ferro wrote in the memo. “The result of this restructuring is a 10% reduction in our staff. These decisions were made after careful consideration of how best to position us against the twin challenges of needing to adapt to how people consume media today as well as the loss of federal dollars.”\n\n\n\tFerro added: “While this moment is challenging, we believe these changes are necessary to ensure KCRW is positioned for the long term.”\n\n\tIn Friday’s letter, Ferro noted that “you’ll notice some programming changes too. Look for a new on-air music schedule in the coming weeks with new DJs and a new lineup.” She didn’t name the departing DJs by name, but Kramer, Sole and Galvan confirmed their exits on social media.\n\n\t“After 27 years, I have unfortunately been let go from KCRW. Along with some other of the best DJs in the world,” Kramer wrote. “The station will always have a place in my heart, and every artist that I play I will still be there in another way.”\n\t\n\n\tWrote Galván: “For the past 14 years, I have contributed my musical taste and unique perspective to KCRW. For the first six, I creared and curated a feature called ‘Pan Caliente’ on the music blog, and for the past 8.5 years I was lucky enough to be an on-air host. Growing up in LA, it was a dream come trye to be a part of the elite DJs of KCRW. Sadly as of this morning, I am no longer living that dream. I was let go, along with some other staples of the station. Throughout my time at KCRW, it was never lost on me that it was a privilege and a pleasure to be able to share music and artists with the world week after week. Radio is my passion, and there will be other opportunities for me to share my taste at better run institutions. Thank you to those who supported me on this particular journey… Stick a fork in me, I’m done at 89.9 FM.”\n\n\tAs for Sole, he wrote: “It’s with a heavy heart that I say this, but for the past 18 and a half years I’ve been most honored and grateful to share time and music with you every week on KCRW. Unfortunately that time has cme to an end, as of today. It’s been the highest honor of my life (so far!) to serenade you and hopefully to provide some semblance of soulful depth and some appreciation for the music of every culture on the planet. I’ve had the honor to sit in the same chair as some of the most dedicated and talented radio hosts and DJs, I’ve been able to break new and genius talent like Hiatus Kaiyote, Black Pumas, Michael Kiwanuka and so many others with their first radio plays on national radio. Thank you to Anne Litt for believing in me, bringing me in and training me. Luckily for me I have some other big projects in the works that I can’t wait to share, but in regard to future music programming, contact me if you know where I should go next. Onward and upward, brothers and sisters. It’s been an honor serving you the platters than matter, and the joints that anoint.”\n\n\tThe Santa Monica College-owned NPR station has gone through several rounds of cuts in recent years; last year, KCRW offered voluntary buyout packages as it faced a $3 million budget deficit. As a result, then “Morning Becomes Eclectic” co-host Anthony Valadez and “All Things Considered” host Janaya Williams exited the station and the program “Greater LA” was canceled.\n\t\n\n\tIn 2020, KCRW cut 20% of its staff, or around 24 people, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also led to a budget shortfall. \n\n\tHere’s Ferro’s letter:\n\n\tI’m writing with an update on KCRW.\n\n\tLike so many other public media organizations, KCRW is restructuring parts of the organization in response to our new budget reality. The result of this restructuring is a 10% reduction in our staff.\n\n\tThese decisions were made after careful consideration of how best to position us against the twin challenges of needing to adapt to how people consume media today as well as the loss of federal dollars.\n\n\tYou’ll notice some programming changes too. Look for a new on-air music schedule in the coming weeks with new DJs and a new lineup. You’ll now be able to hear The Treatment inside Weekend Edition Saturday, where Elvis was featured weekly in decades past.\n\n\tWhile this moment is challenging, we believe these changes are necessary to ensure KCRW is positioned for the long term.\n\n\tNo matter what, we will stay true to the essence of KCRW — playing a vital role strengthening community, connection, and being courageous and inspirational in light of the issues we all face in Southern California. KCRW remains strong with more members than we’ve ever had and sustained audience growth. We just launched our new app with new streams like Dance24 & Vintage24, and we’re very proud of new shows like ‘The Sam Sanders Show’ and ‘Question Everything,’ our podcast about journalism from Brian Reed, the creator of ‘S Town.‘\n\n\tMy deepest gratitude is to you for standing up for KCRW when we’ve asked, for showing up for our live events, our on-air programming, and connecting with us via our newsletters and on social media. We are here to serve, and we take seriously our responsibility to keep KCRW as strong as possible for today and the future.\n\n\tJennifer FerroKCRW President\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tWhen Michael Chernus signed on to ",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy,” now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tWhen Michael Chernus signed on to stand at the center of Peacock’s new anthology series “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy,” he wasn’t just landing another role. He was agreeing to be associated with one of the most vile, irredeemable killers in American history for the rest of his career.\n\n\n\tWhenever people Google his name now, it’s likely that his chilling, uncanny turn as Gacy — who killed more than 30 young men in the 1970s — will be among the first photos that pop up. (Though hopefully his fan-favorite turn as self-help guru Ricken Hale on “Severance” will make the cut as well). So Chernus didn’t take the job without considering all the implications, not only for himself but for the story being told. From creator Patrick Macmanus, the new series takes a decidedly different approach to a true-crime story, choosing to focus more heavily on a dozen or so victims than Gacy himself. Extended periods of time pass in the series without Gacy on screen, especially in the final episode, which has only one scene in which his face is visible.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Brooke Palmer/PEACOCK\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen he talks about the role now, a year after finishing filming, Chernus puts a self-imposed distance between himself and the process. “You know, I had the unfortunate duty of playing John Wayne Gacy,” he tells Variety.\n\n\tBut Gacy’s limited presence in the series had been made clear to him when he first discussed the role with Macmanus, and it’s one of the reasons he overcame his hesitation to sign on.\n\t\n\n\t“He said to me, ‘I have to warn you, you’re not going to be in every scene. This is not going to be about you, even though you are technically the lead of the show,’” Chernus says of his initial conversation with Macmanus. “I don’t know if he had met with other actors who had turned it down before me because they were upset about that or something, but that was a relief to me! With a person as despicable as Gacy, I don’t want to be in every scene and every frame of the show. And he shouldn’t be.”\n\n\tRather, he doesn’t deserve to be, Chernus adds. Also absent from the series is the signature clown makeup that may be the most well-known facet of Gacy’s story (he slathers it on once in Ep. 6, and never directly to camera). But the most important part of the story left unseen in the series is the gut-wrenching violence Gacy inflicted on his victims, both those who died and the few who survived. Flashbacks to the victims’ stories scarcely  references Gacy by name, nor the ways in which they eventually and fatefully intersect with him, instead depicting the lives they led before they were cut short. One notable exception comes in the sixth episode when Gacy lures his final victim, 15-year-old Robert Piest (Ryker Baloun), back to his home with the promise of a construction job, only to sexually terrorize him. The nearly 10-minute scene stops short of the killing, but it is nevertheless bone-chilling in how it depicts the predatory tactics Gacy deployed in finding, toying with and ultimately murdering his victims.\n\n\tBelow, Chernus talks to Variety about filming that particular scene, which he still has trouble watching; why his extensive research to prepare to play Gacy was still happening each day until he began shooting his scenes — and how he feels about Macmanus’ decision to cut nearly 25 minutes of footage he shot from the finale.\n\t\n\t\tYou have spoken about your hesitations in taking this part, in part because it’s challenging stepping into the mind of a serial killer. The series’ creative team did extensive research, but what did you do on your own to feel comfortable and educated enough to take this on?\t\n\n\tI still find that I’m doing research to remind myself of everything, and be able to answer questions about him now a year later. As you can imagine, the amount of information available is sort of endless. Once I got the job, I read every book I could find, I watched every documentary, I listened to every podcast and watched every bad and weird YouTube video there is. I really went down quite the rabbit hole. We also had an incredible amount of research available to us, because Peacock made a documentary about Gacy a couple of years ago. All this stuff that didn’t make it to the final cut of that documentary, NBC News also made available to us. Patrick also has his own researcher, so the cast members all had access to this dropbox full of stuff, including incredible academic studies of John Gacy’s speech pattern and word choice and syntax use, and a breakdown of the Chicago dialect and his Polish background. Then I took a trip to Chicago before we started shooting, and went to a bunch of places that Gacy frequented. Even though Chicago 2024 looks nothing like Chicago in the 1970s, it was still interesting just to see the distances he would travel on any given night to cruise or, for lack of a better word, hunt for his victims. \n\t\n\n\tEventually, it got to a point where Patrick was like, “You need to put down the books and start focusing on the scripts,” and he was 100% right. I think I could have stayed in the research realm forever. Our show is based on a true story, but it’s not a documentary. It’s a fictional retelling. So I kind of had to eventually just trust that the research was inside me and then let go of it. But on set every day, I would still listen to Gacy’s voice right before we would do a take. There isn’t a ton of video footage of him, but there’s this interview with Robert Ressler and some of that is in the Peacock documentary. I had the whole interview with Ressler and I would watch that a lot, just to sort of study Gacy — the way he talked and the way his face moved and his body moved. This is a long way of saying that I had this feeling there would never be enough research and I had to accept that this was sort of just going to be my own version of this guy. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael Chernus as John Wayne Gacy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Brooke Palmer/Peacock\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen you finally dug into it, how was it playing him?\t\n\n\tIn terms of the jobs within our crew, it sometimes felt like we were this theater company — a troop of storytellers coming together to shine light on some of these victims’ voices, which hadn’t been heard, and I just kept drawing the short straw of having to play the villain every night. I care deeply about this story, not about John Gacy’s personal story, but just about the larger story that we were telling. But it was hard to live with. I would come home and some nights, the Chicago dialect and the Gacy voice would kind of creep into my own speaking voice and my wife would be like, “Cut it out! He’s not allowed here.” A tricky part of it, too, was eventually having to commit to embodying him fully in order to tell the story completely. I didn’t really want to be him. That’s why I was hesitant in the beginning. I didn’t want to be in his skin or walk a mile in his shoes. I don’t have any empathy for him. But there came a point where Patrick was like, “In order for us to understand why some of those victims would get in his car or go back to his house or work at his construction company, you have to fully embody him, including the parts of him that were perceived as charming or harmless or even likable.”\n\t\n\n\tIn my first meeting with Patrick, he said to me, “I have to warn you, you’re not going to be in every scene. This is not going to be about you, even though you are technically the lead of the show.” I don’t know if you had met with other actors who had turned it down before me because they were upset about that or something, but that was a relief to me! With a person as despicable as Gacy, I don’t want to be in every scene and every frame of the show, and he shouldn’t be.\n\t\n\t\tWithout showing the violence, the show’s perspective of Gacy’s menace relies heavily on your physical performance of him. Your posture, and the way his demeanor and stare changes in an instant. Did you have to do multiple takes to get the right level of menace? Or was it all instinct?\t\n\n\tWe had to try a bunch of different stuff, and I was so grateful to have Patrick as our showrunner and the directors that we had for all the episodes because we were all on the same page that we didn’t want to do some hackneyed, mustache-twirling kind of serial killer. But at the same time, you needed to see these moments of menace. You needed to see the mask drop, and that was how we started to describe it. So we would just do a lot of takes where the director would say, “Now, let’s try one that’s a little bit more menacing. Or, now let’s do one without any of that.” We tried a bunch of stuff until we started to find a vocabulary and a shorthand, where I knew which version of him we were seeing at any given moment. I never felt like I was having to play the entirety of him all at once. It was always whatever piece he wanted you to see. But we have no footage of that version of him, when the darkness would come out, so I had no idea what that looked like. There are accounts of it from surviving victims who said it looked like his eyes were dead or that his eyes would turn black. I literally couldn’t make my eyes turn black, but I knew what that conjured in terms of an icy coldness. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRyker Baloun as Rob Piest with Chernus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Ian Watson/Peacock\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThere are very few moments in the series that show Gacy being violent with his victims. The longest and most horrifying scene is in Episode 6, when he lures his final victim, 15-year-old Robert Piest, back to his house, tricks him into handcuffs, threatens to rape him and then ultimately kills him. We don’t see the killing, but we see the terror he put that boy through in his final moments. How was it filming that scene when you had to play Gacy the predator?\t\n\n\tThat episode is really hard for me to watch. It’s the most we see John Gacy in the show, period. It’s the closest we get to seeing not only the violence that he committed, but the manipulation and grooming and gaslighting that he would inflict on these boys. The young actor — Ryker Baloun, who played Rob Piest — is so great. But that was a really difficult day. It’s a long scene, and we spent the entire day shooting it, which is a rare thing on TV. But I think everyone knew that it needed that kind of care and sensitivity. One of the hardest things for me as an actor happens in that scene, because it is the best example of John Gacy switching back and forth from these different kinds of masks and personalities. From all the accounts that I’ve read about it, he would sometimes surprise himself even. That’s not to let him off the hook in any way, but almost like he would black out to some extent for a minute. There’s this moment where the Rob Piest character turns John down for any kind of sexual activity, and I have say to something like, “Well, I’m just going to have to rape you.” Then I attack him, and pull his pants down, and when I’m sitting there on the ground looking at his underwear, I say, “Oh, God, what happened?” That kind of flipping back and forth between the realities of the different Johns, that was such a jarring thing to do as an actor. I can’t imagine what that would have been like for anyone who was alone with him in his home. It’s just such a terrifying thing to be confronted with.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPatrick Macmanus revealed to Variety that there was about 23 minutes of material you shot for the finale that he decided to cut, some of which showed Gacy in 1994 on the day of his execution. How did you feel about losing that from the last episode?\t\n\n\tI thought it was incredibly brave. Of course, it stung at first, just as an actor and for my own ego. But I understood. By that point, we were so far down the road together, Patrick and I really saw eye to eye on this, and we’re so in lockstep with each other that it made total sense to me. I know it was difficult for him, and difficult for me to digest. Now I know that it was absolutely the right decision. \n\t\n\t\tWas there anything you shot that you were particularly proud of or wish had made the final cut?\t\n\n\tI’m proud of all of it, but I don’t think it should be in the show. Purely as an acting exercise, it was interesting, because we saw an older Gacy at the end of his life in those scenes. It’s the version of him that we all kind of know because it’s from the time he did the only on-camera interviews that exist of him when he was on death row. He’s a more feeble man then, with shock white hair. But I think witnessing anyone on death row about to be executed, there’s some part of your humanity that might want to care for them or feel bad for them. But that was not the show we were trying to make. There’s a scene at the end of the whole series in the finale where the victims’ families didn’t get to witness the execution. That is a true story. They were brought out to the prison, but they had to sit in the basement and just watch the local news and they didn’t get to see it. They weren’t allowed in the execution room or to see him that day, so why should we as an audience get to see it?\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWant to see Emma Stone‘s new film “Bugonia” before its wide release on Oct. 24? The Yorgos Lanthimos-directed film is having an early screening in Los Angeles on Monday, Oct. 20, at 8 p.m. However, there’s a catch: in order to attend the screening at the Culver Theater on Monday night, all audience members must either arrive bald or with their heads shaved before entering the auditorium.\n\n\tDoLA posted the screening’s requirements on its Instagram page on Oct. 17, stating, “Are you bald, or willing to shave your head? On Monday, 10/20, head to the Culver Theater for a FREE advanced screening of ‘Bugonia’ – the new Focus Features fever dream from Yorgos Lanthimos, starring Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons.”\n\t\n\n\tThe post continues to note that a barber will be on-site starting at 6 p.m. to shave the heads of attendees who have hair. It also clarifies, “This is real. And yes, part of it will be filmed.”\n\n\n\tThough the screening is free for the hairless, tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis and require an RSVP. Audience members must be 18 or older to attend the event.\n\n\tThe peculiar requirement is an homage to Emma Stone’s character in the film, who is a bald-headed CEO who ends up kidnapped and suspected of being an alien. Alongside Stone and Plemons, the film also stars Aidan Delbis, Stavros Halkias and Alicia Silverstone.\n\n\t“Bugonia” premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in August and has since led a thorough festival run, playing at Telluride, San Sebastián, AFI, Busan and more ahead of its forthcoming release. It marks the fourth collaboration between Lanthimos and Stone following 2018’s “The Favourite,” 2023’s “Poor Things” and 2024’s “Kinds of Kindness.” Stone was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her performance in “The Favourite” and won Best Actress for her performance in “Poor Things.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Kathryn Bigelow’s nuclear countdown thriller “A House of Dynamite” premiered at the Venice Film Festival in early September, it was greeted with a chorus of praise. Just about every critic there called the movie tense, dazzling, nail-biting, and rhapsodized over what they saw as Bigelow’s stunning craftsmanship. It was clear to me that I had seen a totally different film — an overheated but “breathless” piece of doomsday pulp that repeated the same scenario three times (a rogue nuke speeding toward Chicago, where it’s set to drop and explode in 20 minutes), less effectively each time.\n\t\n\n\tTo me, “A House of Dynamite” didn’t feel at all like it was directed by the commanding filmmaker of “Zero Dark Thirty” and “The Hurt Locker.” This one felt like hyped-up TV, with too much caffeinated camera jitter, too many unconvincing but in-your-face “quotidian” moments, and too much hambone acting (I’ve never seen Jared Harris, who plays the Secretary of Defense, give this bluntly overstated a performance). The film felt to me like a schlock disaster movie taking itself seriously.\n\n\n\tBut that last element — the fact that it does take itself seriously — turned out to be the bait that hooked the critics. What the reviews I read, and the people I had conversations with, all seemed to be saying is that “A House of Dynamite” was a movie they watched with white knuckles, heart in the throat, and a prolonged spasm of dread because the film hit them with the force of a cathartic reality check. They hadn’t thought about the possibility of nuclear war in a long time. And this movie did more than just make you think about it. It demonstrated that the possibility was far more likely than any of us want to believe.\n\t\n\n\tBut does the movie, in fact, demonstrate that? Or does it merely assert it, with no evidence and with a scenario that strains belief because it makes almost no sense even on its own hair-trigger terms?\n\n\tIf you come out of “A House of Dynamite” thinking that a nuclear conflagration could be just around the corner, and that this is the movie that pulled the wool off your eyes, you could say that that makes it, by definition, an effective movie. But what I actually think that makes it is an exploitation film. “A House of Dynamite” works hard to churn up our anxieties, yet it does so more or less the same way the disaster films of the ’70s did: by serving up a sum-of-all-fears cataclysm as if it were “reality.”\n\n\tThe film’s nugget of apocalyptic narrative, which gets no more illuminated each time it’s retold, comes down to this: The rogue nuke, launched by we-have-no-idea-who, is rocketing toward the U.S., and despite all our advanced military defense systems there is no way to stop it. This, the film claims, is the real reality, the one that the powers that be want you to forget. The film suggests that our defense systems amount to a kind of Ponzi scheme, that the government has created a grand illusion of national security. But now, at last, watching this movie, the truth can be told: that it’s all 10 times more precarious than we thought. Sweet dreams!\n\n\tBigelow and her screenwriter, Noah Oppenheim, claim to have done their research and gotten the inside scoop on what a dangerous, scattershot, combustible world we’ve all fooling ourselves into believing we don’t live in. Bigelow used a retired three-star general as a consultant but, in general, stayed away from the Pentagon, refusing to seek its endorsement. She wanted to break free of the official bureaucratic party line. Okay, fair enough. But regardless of whether the film’s scenario is accurate, I’d be more satisfied than not if it simply felt accurate. Why doesn’t it? That comes down to how its key probability factor is totally at war with its central metaphor.\n\n\tLet me explain. In the first episode, we expect that U.S. missiles will be able to zap that rogue nuke right out of the sky. But what we learn — and what everyone in the White House Situation Room learns too, since it appears they’re as clueless as we are — is that the chances of a GBI (Ground-Based Interceptor) taking out that nuke are just 61 percent. This causes Harris’s Secretary of Defense to exclaim, “So it’s a fucking coin toss? This is what $50 billion buys us?” That’s quite a statement for the film to make, and it’s meant to leave us spooked.\n\t\n\n\tBut if that’s the reality, consider this. The film’s second episode, in which the characters try (without success) to figure out who launched the attack, is entitled “A Bullet Hitting a Bullet.” That sounds like some sort of poetic fancy, but in the course of the episode the phrase is used, quite specifically, to explain why our missile defense systems are so much less effective than you or I think. The film asserts that if a rogue nuke were speeding toward Chicago, the chances that one of our missiles could knock it out of the sky would be comparable to the chances of a bullet hitting a bullet.\n\n\tTo laymen, that image kind of makes sense. A nuke fired at the U.S. would be traveling really fast (like a bullet). A missile launched to neutralize that nuke would also be traveling really fast (like a bullet). So one bullet would have to hit the other bullet. Pretend that someone was shooting a gun and trying to do that. What are the chances of a bullet hitting a bullet? I’d say close to zero.\n\n\tBut wait a minute. I thought the movie just told us that the chances of success in this situation are 61 percent. (Not 60 or 62 percent. 61.) That isn’t the greatest of odds, but it’s not the worst either. Yet now the movie is telling us that the odds of success are virtually nil. So which is it? A fucking coin toss…or a bullet hitting a bullet? Do you see how little “A House of Dynamite” adds up? Besides, I’m no expert, but that’s not how heat-seeking missiles work.\n\n\tThere have been great movies built around the looming hair-trigger prospect of a nuclear attack. “Dr. Strangelove” is, of course, a visionary comedy, yet it’s framed as a grandly ominous countdown-to-the-apocalypse. “Fail Safe,” the great Sidney Lumet nuclear thriller, came out the same year as “Dr. Strangelove” (1964), only nine months later, and in many ways it’s an even more spellbinding movie. And 25 years ago, the historical political drama “Thirteen Days,” set mostly in the Oval Office (with a definitive performance by Bruce Greenwood as JFK), portrayed the inner workings of the Cuban Missile Crisis with a riveting psychology and an inside realpolitik that was hypnotic to behold. The film showed us just how close we came (much closer than was acknowledged at the time, or for years afterward).\n\t\n\n\tThose three movies are all, in their different ways, fearless cautionary works of art. But “A House of Dynamite” is so hyperbolic about pushing the alarm button, all in order to push our buttons, that the most dangerous possibility raised by the movie is that anyone would actually fall for it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe InterContinental Maldives Maamunagau Resort is trading tinsel for tridents this December, unveiling an ambitious holiday program inspired by the myth of “Atlantis: The Lost Kingdom.” The Indian Ocean property, already known for its overwater villas and cinematic sunsets, is transforming into an immersive “Celebration for the Oceans” —  a series of performances, residencies, and dining events designed to blend fantasy with environmental reverence.\n\n\n\tThe resort’s programming, running from Dec. 22 through early January, includes large-scale productions like “Poseidon’s Banquet,”  where guests dine over a reef illuminated to resemble a submerged palace, and nightly mermaid ballets staged in the infinity pool. The season’s finale, on New Year’s Eve, culminates in the dramatic “Trident of Light,” a rising ocean sculpture that ignites a fireworks display across Maamunagau’s lagoon.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMichelin-starred chef Tom Aikens headlines the culinary slate, with a 12-day residency featuring tasting dinners at The Lighthouse, cooking classes and a private yacht journey complete with caviar, champagne  and a stargazing session led by the island’s resident astronomer. UK artist Florence Super will host ocean-themed art workshops and exhibit sustainable works made from recycled materials during her residency, part of the resort’s ongoing emphasis on marine awareness and conservation.\n\n\tProgramming extends beyond fine dining and art: Santa’s island arrival, a kid-focused Pirate Cruise, and interactive experiences with British children’s entertainers Sharky & George round out the family offerings. Wellness guests can opt for Maldivian-inspired spa treatments, ocean detox rituals or sound healing sessions under the stars.\n\n\n\tOver the past few years, the Maldives has quietly become Hollywood’s favorite hideaway — a discreet but ultra-luxury alternative to the usual Aspen or St. Barts circuit. A-listers from Zendaya and Tom Holland to Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have been spotted on the archipelago’s private islands, often sharing sun-drenched glimpses of overwater breakfasts and bioluminescent lagoons. It’s easy to see the appeal: just a seaplane ride from Malé, the InterContinental Maldives Maamunagau Resort has positioned itself at the high end of this cinematic escape market, catering to those who prize privacy, design, and curated experience over overt opulence. The property, built across a 35-acre coral reef atoll, has earned a reputation for its immersive programming — from astronomy sessions and sustainability workshops to chef residencies and private yacht dining.\n\n\tThe destination’s rise coincides with a broader shift in celebrity travel, where the emphasis has moved from visibility to retreat. In the Maldives, anonymity becomes luxury’s final frontier — a place where global names can go offline without losing access to world-class cuisine or cinematic settings. The InterContinental’s “Atlantis: The Lost Kingdom” concept plays directly into that fantasy: a self-contained world that’s both exclusive and experiential.\n\n\tCheck out a full teaser of their festive programming below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnthony Boyle wasn’t too anxious about going full frontal for his role as Arthur Guinness in the new Netflix period drama series “House of Guinness.”\n\n\tThe only real bit of concern that the Irish actor did happen to have was his grandmother watching the scene.\n\n\tBut then he remembered, “She doesn’t know how to work Netflix because she doesn’t have the internet. She just watches ‘Coronation Street’ and other British soaps.\n\t\n\n\t “She keeps saying to me, ‘Stop doing shows that are only on the internet. Could you get on “Coronation Street” or “East Enders?”’ says Boyle, whose many streaming projects include “Masters of the Air,” “Manhunt,” “Tetris” and “Say Nothing.”\n\n\n\t“House of Guinness” follows the brewing dynasty — Arthur, Edward (Louis Partridge), Anne (Emily Fairn) and Benjamin II (Fionn O’Shea) — following the death of their father Benjamin Guinness in 1868. “I didn’t know too much about the Guinness family,” Boyle says. “I knew just as much as probably anyone in Ireland knows — they were a very rich family and they were very eccentric. But I didn’t know the extent of their wealth and all that they owned.”\n\n\tIt’s widely believed that Arthur was gay. The series portrays Arthur as someone who doesn’t actually hide his sexual orientation, even if he agrees to a “lavender marriage” to advance his political career. “There are so many clues that point to Arthur being gay,” Boyle says. “If we don’t follow these clues, then we erase gay people from history. It’s not like we were going to just say he was gay. There’s so many things that alluded to him being gay, which is why we felt we should portray him as such.”\n\t\n\n\tI caught up with Boyle over Zoom while he was in Vancouver, Canada filming “The Altruists,” Netflix’s upcoming series about Sam Bankman-Fried (Boyle), his girlfriend Caroline Ellison (Julia Garner) and the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about Arthur’s mustache. Comfortable or uncomfortable?\t\n\n\tI love it. I prefer to have the stache. I feel like I look 10 years old when I don’t have it. I love growing it and I love the little flicky bits at the side. I had this great makeup artist called Connie Daniels, who would come to me in the morning, and she would give me this mustache wax called Gentleman Stiffener. She would knock on my trailer, and she would say, “Ready for your Gentleman Stiffener?” She would give me the little brush and I’d comb and then I would be ready for the day with my Gentleman Stiffener.\n\t\n\t\tHow long did it take you to grow out?\t\n\n\tAbout two and a half months to grow it and then I had for about six months of shooting. It looks good in the show when you’re wearing a period costume, but when you’re wearing, like an Adidas jacket and you’re going out for a coffee, you just look like an out of work magician.\n\t\n\t\tWhen you Google your name, all results are about your full-frontal scene. Did you expect it to get so much attention?\t\n\n\tNo, I didn’t, because it was a very last minute sort of thing. I called the director the night before and said, I think we should do the scene with me coming out of the bath [instead of a dressing scene]. He said, “Yeah, fuck it. Let’s do it.” But I didn’t expect that. I didn’t expect people to talk about it.\n\t\n\t\tOnce the director agreed to it, did you have any second thoughts?\t\n\n\tNot really. I thought it was good for the character because I wanted to show him feeling like he owns the world, and he was completely unashamed of himself and his sexuality and that he doesn’t even view the servants as people, that they’re just there to serve him. He’s completely dominant.\n\t\n\t\tI binged “House of Guinness” in just a couple of days. What do you binge?\t\n\n\t“Love is Blind.” I started watching it with my sister and I can’t get enough of it. I just watched first episode of the new season with a friend last night. It’s so funny. I just love it. I just love Americans. I love that they’re two minutes into the first date, one person says, “I love my family.” And the other one says, “I love my family, too.” And then they’re both like, ‘We’re so alike. I love you.” It’s brilliant. It warms my heart and just tickles me in the right way.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNow that you’re playing Sam Bankman-Fried, do you understand how cryptocurrency works? I certainly don’t.\t\n\n\tI can act like I understand it. I can pretend as if I know what I’m talking about, but I knew very little. My father bought me “Cryptocurrency for Dummies” for Christmas, and that came in pretty handy. But what have I learned about cryptocurrency? I’ve been filming for like five months, so I understand it now, but it’s it is very complex.\n\t\n\t\tHow much did you know about the story before heading into it?\t\n\n\tJust as much as most people. I read a couple of articles on Sam, and was very interested in his sort of meteoric rise, and I was interested in FTX and then the scandal that followed, but I hadn’t done as deep a dive as I’ve done on it now.\n\t\n\t\tIs it easier to portray someone like Sam Bankman-Fried when there is so much information about him out there or when it’s someone like Arthur Guinness, who you may be able to play with a little bit more?\t\n\n\tI don’t know. I think I do my best work in a period piece. I’m very good with a lantern. I’m very good on a horse. Now I’m acting with a laptop and an iPhone. I’m lost. I’m sort of joking because it doesn’t matter if you’re playing a role in Shakespeare or a Greek play, and it’s 2,000 years ago, or if you’re playing someone now. You’re a human being and we haven’t changed. You read Shakespeare or an old play from hundreds of years ago, and we’re still feeling the same emotions, we’re still going through the same things.\n\n\t“House of Guinness” Season 1 is available on Netflix.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBlumhouse‘s horror sequel “Black Phone 2” dialed into $10.7 million across Friday and preview screenings, heading for a No. 1 opening. Meanwhile, Aziz Ansari’s comedy “Good Fortune” isn’t seeing much luck in a third place debut, as a sleepy October box office trudges towards the end of the month.\n\n\tUniversal has “Black Phone 2” in 3,411 North American locations for its opening weekend, projecting a three-day total of $24.4 million. That’d be within pre-weekend tracking estimates and a hair ahead of the original “Black Phone,” which debuted to $23.6 million in 2022. The sequel, which sees Ethan Hawke return as a serial killer known as the Grabber, also gets a grosses boost from nabbing some premium large format auditoriums — which carry higher ticket prices — from “Tron: Ares.”\n\t\n\n\tBlumhouse is looking for a box office bounce-back to end the year after fielding a disappointing 2025 slate of “Wolf Man,” “The Woman in the Yard,” “Drop” and “M3GAN 2.0” — each of which carried a modest price tag, but ultimately failed to break out in theaters. The R-rated “Black Phone 2” will easily notch Blumhouse’s biggest opening of the calendar, but the Scott Derrickson-directed sequel is also one of its costlier productions at a $30 million production budget.\n\n\n\tAfter this start, “Black Phone 2” will have to show staying power to end up a theatrical success. Critics and audiences are both positive, though slightly chillier than returns for the first entry. Audience survey firm CinemaScore polled a “B” grade among ticketbuyers, a tick down from the “B+” grade for the 2022 original. The first “Black Phone” was a sleeper hit, putting up a nearly 4x multiplier on its debut to finish with $90 million domestic. “Black Phone 2” will aim for a similarly long tail, positioned as the premier horror release through the rest of the Halloween season. As for Blumhouse, the banner still has one more sequel, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” coming in December from Universal.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Lionsgate’s release of “Good Fortune” is headed for the lower side of projections, forecasting an opening of $5.9 million from 2,985 locations. The Aziz Ansari feature, which the comedian wrote, directed and stars in, earned just $2.4 million across Friday and preview screenings.\n\n\tThat’s a muted kick-off for the $30 million production, which comes despite a starry cast of Keanu Reeves, Seth Rogen, Sandra Oh and Keke Palmer, plus solid reviews and positive buzz among audiences (Cinema Score turned in a “B+” grade). It speaks to the difficulty of opening an original R-rated comedy in the current theatrical landscape, though there was a feel-good story to start the year with Sony’s “One of Them Days” ($50 million domestic total).\n\n\tIn second, Disney’s “Tron: Ares” earned $3 million on Friday and is expecting a sophomore outing of $11 million for a 65% drop. North American total looks to hit $54 million through its first 10 days. After a disappointing domestic debut and meager turnout overseas, the sci-fi sequel is fading too fast to have any hope of recouping its $180 million production budget in theaters.\n\n\tIn a tight race for fourth, Warner Bros.’ awards favorite “One Battle After Another” is currently expected ahead after earning another $1.1 million on Friday, down 45% from its daily total last week. Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio’s very contemporary epic has shown good week-to-week holds, but the film has only earned $59 million in North America through 22 days of release. At a production budget north of $130 million, it’s estimated to lose around $100 million theatrically. \n\n\tParamount’s “Roofman” is falling to fifth place, earning $1.1 million on its second Friday. The Channing Tatum caper is looking at a $3.6 million sophomore outing, which would mark a 55% drop from its opening. Domestic gross is expected to hit $15.4 million through Sunday — a muted run, even against a slim $19 million production budget.\n\n\tAlso opening this weekend, Angel Studios has the World War II thriller “Truth & Treason” in 2,106 venues. The PG-13-rated drama earned $1.1 million on Friday and looks headed to a $2.8 million opening weekend to land in sixth on domestic charts. Cinema Score turned in a glowing “A” grade — par for the course for an Angel release.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Amazon MGM is expanding its R-rated campus drama “After the Hunt” to 1,238 locations after opening in New York and Los Angeles last weekend. The film earned about $650,000 on Friday and is headed for seventh place. Directed by Luca Guadagnino, “After the Hunt” sports a high-profile cast of Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri and Amazon gave it a presence at the industry gathering Cinema Con back in April. But negative reviews out of a Venice Film Festival premiere in August seem to have hobbled the film. Audiences don’t like it much at all, with Cinema Score turning in a “C-” grade.\n",

And Lilah, mom says, is also a huge Taylor fan.\n      \n\n          Taylor entered the picture last week after catching wind of Lilah's situation.

She then went under the knife to remove the tumor and the surgery proved successful.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          But, a few days later, Lilah was diagnosed with a rare aggressive form of brain cancer with only 58 documented cases last year in the U.S. The tot returned to the hospital for 3 months of chemo and 3 months of stem cell treatment.\n      \n    \n          Clearly, Lilah's backstory struck a chord in Taylor, who coughed up a pretty penny for her mom to help pay the medical bills.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Taylor Swift\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

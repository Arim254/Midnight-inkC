    "body": "\n\tMeet Paddington the Bear, the West End’s newest star.\n\n\tAs previews begin in London, “Paddington the Musical” has revealed a short teaser and first-look images showing a glimpse at how the iconic bear will come to life on stage. The life-like puppet is played by two people: James Hameed, who is an off-stage remote puppeteer, and Arti Shah, an on-stage performer. To know exactly how the bear works, “Paddington” fans will have to go to the show and see it for themselves.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJay Brooks\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe team behind the bear includes Tahra Zafar, Paddington Bear designer; Audrey Brisson, bear physicality associate director; Phill Woodfine, remote puppetry coach; and Annabelle Davis, Paddington Bear casting director. Alternate Paddington on-stage performers are Abbie Purvis and Ali Sarebani.\n\n\t“After many years of exploration and development, we are thrilled, alongside Studiocanal, to finally bring Paddington to life on stage,” producers Sonia Friedman and Eliza Lumley said in a statement. “It takes an extraordinary team to share this very special bear with the world — our amazing performers James and Arti, our brilliant alternates Abbie and Ali, and the incredible group of artists led by designer Tahra, alongside Audrey, Phill and Annabelle. Their collective creativity and vision are at the heart of our production, and it has been a true collaboration, helmed by Luke Sheppard, our creative, associate, stage management, production and development teams involved in supporting us in bringing Paddington to life in a truly beautiful and unique way. What we as producers always hoped to achieve was, quite simply, Paddington on stage — and thanks to the immensely talented artists, both on and off stage, we believe we’ve realized that.”\n\t\n\n\t“Paddington the Musical” is now in previews and opens on Nov. 30. Its run has already been extended to Oct. 25, 2026. \n\n\tWatch the teaser for “Paddington the Musical” below.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeow! Zohran Mamdani is even trying to get the feline vote in his campaign to become the next mayor of New York City.\n\n\tWith just days to go before the Nov. 4 election, the candidate stopped by a Bronx bodega to make an appearance on “Shop Cats,” Mad Realities’ show that features comedian Michelledonna “interviewing” bodega kitties.\n\n\tMamdani is seen meeting the bodega’s resident puss, a calico cat named Coca. “Coca is cute,” he says. “Coca wants to play. Coca wants to live in a city she can afford.”\n\t\n\n\tYes, he said that. No word if he has a policy statement on rent-controlled catios.\n\n\n\tAlso in the episode, Mamdani dances a few beats of the Dominican dance Bachata and says, “I love bodega cats. And I also love an egg and cheese on a roll with jalapeños.”\n\n\tThe episode is available on TikTok and Instagram at @shopcats.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Shop Cats” is a consistent viral hit with more than 793,400 followers on TikTok and 228,000 on Instagram.\n\n\tSeparate from the show, there also happens to be a Cats4Zohran Instagram account with about 11,000 followers. Its bio reads, “Cats catvassing for Zohran! A livable NYC = safer affordable homes + more treats!”\n\n\tIn comparison, a Dogs4Zohran Instagram only has 708 followers.\n\n\tMamdani is leading in the polls to win the three-way race for mayor against former New York governor and independent candidate Andrew M. Cuomo and Republican activist Curtis Sliwa.\n\n\tIn addition to “Shop Cats,” Mad Realities is also behind “Hollywood IQ,” an on-the-street trivia showdown for pop culture obsessives, rewarding the “human IMDbs” who can identify celebrity faces or match films to their box office grosses. \n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTchéky Karyo, the French actor who starred in the BBC’s “The Missing” and “Baptiste” and appeared in “La Femme Nikita,” “Addicted to Love,” “Bad Boys” and “GoldenEye,” died of cancer on Oct. 31, according to AFP. He was 72.\n\n\tBorn in Istanbul in 1953, Karyo’s family moved to Paris when he was young. There, he studied drama at the Cyrano Theatre and later performed as part of the Daniel Sorano Company. As a young man, he joined the National Theatre of Strasbourg and began acting in French films. He had notable early roles in Jean-Jacques Annaud’s “The Bear” and Luc Besson’s “La Femme Nikita.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the 1990s, Karyo started appearing in Hollywood movies. He played the title character in “Nostradamus,” a villain opposite Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in “Bad Boys,” an adversary opposite Jet Li in “Kiss of the Dragon,” a French officer opposite Mel Gibson in “The Patriot” and a Russian Defense Minister opposite Pierce Brosnan in his first turn as James Bond in “GoldenEye.” He also appeared in Ridley Scott’s “1492: Conquest of Paradise” and had a memorable role as a French restaurant owner in Griffin Dunne’s “Addicted to Love.”\n\n\n\tThroughout the new millennium, he acted in several American and French movies and shows. In 2014, he began portraying detective Julien Baptiste in “The Missing.” He played the central character for two seasons and then reprised the role for a two-season spinoff, “Baptiste” from 2019 through 2021. Earlier this year, he appeared in the French comedy film “Faster.”\n\n\tKaryo was also a songwriter and musician and had released two albums throughout his career. He was married twice, first to actress Isabelle Pasco. After their divorce, he married actress Valérie Keruzoré in 2002. They remained married up until his death.\n\t\n\n\tHe is survived by Keruzoré and their two children, Louise and Liv. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the main square of the Tuscan town of Lucca, Japanese games designer Hideo Kojima stands on the balcony and receives the kind of fevered welcome reserved for rockstars from the crowd below. Lucca Comics and Games, Europe’s answer to Comic-Con, is the final stop of Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding World Tour 2, promoting the release of “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,” the long-awaited follow up to the highly successful “Death Stranding.”\n\t\n\n\tSet 11 months on from the previous instalment, the new saga has players control Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) who crosses a post-apocalyptic Australia and connects survivors and colonies to the Chiral network. Kojima said that the game was conceived during the pandemic when he was rethinking the notion of connection. “In the 2000s, the internet became a normal thing, and we could now be connected in real time, anywhere, everywhere, and that connection was supposed to be a strength, but social media went in a different way, because it’s anonymous, so people say whatever they want. I am actually for this technology. However, I wanted to have everyone to experience the analog that we have as well. So ‘Death Stranding’ is actually not just about connection, but it’s about a loose connection. It’s not connection with headshots and shooting each other. We don’t actually do that here.”\n\n\n\tArt director and character designer, Yoji Shinkawa, was also in Lucca to shed light on his continued collaboration with Kojima. “I’ve been working with Hideo for quite a long time, and any conceptual art that I write, the first step is always a word from Hideo Kojima. There are sometimes hints or a strange wording, but that gives me a direction, because if you try to draw something from scratch, it’s very difficult. So this word from Mr. Kojima always kind of gives me the basic idea, so I kind of chew it over and draw the illustration and some characters and show them to him, and the biggest surprise is that he always tries to pull more things out of that drawing. So I rethink and do the drawing over again. I work with other directors or other projects other than games, but this is very unique with Mr. Kojima.”\n\t\n\n\tKojima spoke about the challenges of topping the original game: “In ‘Metal Gear Solid,’ every time I did a sequel, the game design was totally different. This time, it was a more normal sequel. I had to keep the best parts of ‘DS1’ to satisfy the people who loved it. But I also acknowledge that a lot of people didn’t play till the end, because maybe it was too tough for them to walk in the Stone Mountains or traverse a lot. Theme-wise it was totally 180 degrees different. But I also made it more speedy, more comfortable for the players, but also more playable and enjoyable, with more freedom. And as a result, I see that a lot of people have cleared a lot in ‘DS2,’ more than the first one. So I’m kind of happy that I hit the mark with this change in the game design.”\n\n\tKojima said that the music was important to the game but although he admitted to loving Joy Division – he’s often photographed sporting an “Unknown Pleasures” t-shirt – it wasn’t appropriate to the game. “In ‘DS2,’ we worked a lot with [French composer and musician] Woodkid. Of course, we worked with Ludvig Forsell as well. With Woodkid, we got quite close, and we exchanged a lot of ideas, and I found out our feelings, our way of thinking was quite close. So we got to know each other very well, and he came to the studio a number of times, and then he started to create something. And we went back and forth with feedback, and it’s almost similar to Yoji’s design of what he explained earlier. He stayed in an office, right next to my office.”\n\n\tWhat is his favorite character in the new game? “There was a character called Cliff, played by Mads Mikkelsen, and he was very popular. However, in the story of ‘DS1,’ he died, and I couldn’t bring him back in ‘DS2.’ So I thought about Neil. I’m a big fan of Luca Marinelli and I really wanted to work with him. But my favorite is Fragile, played by Léa Seydoux. You might think it’s Sam, but Sam is the main character. He’s the protagonist, but Fragile is actually one of the hidden main characters in ‘DS2.’ For Léa Seydoux, we brought up the technology level of capturing her so she’s more natural in how she says her lines and how she acts, which is beautiful. I also asked Woodkid to create a song dedicated to Fragile. So every time Fragile comes in the game, you can hear the theme running in the background. Overall, it’s a great character. If you haven’t played the game, you’ll be surprised at how good the acting and how good the character of Fragile is. Make sure you play until the end.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a recent interview with Bustle, Dave Franco, James Franco‘s brother, asserted that “no one was going to hire me just because I was James Franco’s little brother.” However, he did admit that having a movie-star sibling helped him get his foot in the door when he started his acting career.\n\n\t“If I sucked, I would’ve disappeared very quickly,” he said. He added of their relationship, “At this point, I think he’s excited just to see me trying new things and to see me grow.”\n\t\n\n\tDave Franco’s first notable credit was on a Season 10 episode of the WB drama “7th Heaven” in 2006. A year later, he broke into the movie business with a small role in Greg Mottola’s iconic coming-of-age comedy “Superbad.” His star rose in the early 2010s with supporting roles in “Fright Night,” “21 Jump Street” and “Now You See Me.” His more recent credits include “Regretting You,” “Together” and “Love Lies Bleeding.”\n\n\n\tJames Franco also broke out on the small screen, landing his first major role on Paul Feig’s cult classic TV show “Freaks and Geeks.” In 2002, he landed the role of Harry Osborn in Sam Raimi’s “Spider-Man,” solidifying the older Franco as a Hollywood mainstay. In the years following, his notable credits included “Pineapple Express,” “Milk,” “127 Hours,” “Spring Breakers,” “This Is The End,” “The Interview” and “The Disaster Artist.”\n\n\tIn 2019, James Franco’s career stalled after two members of his acting school filed a lawsuit alleging that he “engaged in widespread inappropriate and sexually charged behavior towards female students by sexualizing their power as a teacher and an employer by dangling the opportunity for roles in their projects.” In 2021, the lawsuit was settled for over $2 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe bubbles have settled after UTA‘s ZCON event and new Gen Z-taught lessons have, hopefully, been learned by old-guard executives looking to team with the next wave of movers and shakers in media.\n\n\tAnd plans have already started for ZCON 2026 — and more.\n\n\t“This doesn’t only have to live at ZCON. This idea that we need to be intergenerationally, intersectionally platforming creative voices and connecting brands to culture can exist everywhere, and ought to exist everywhere,” Ziad Ahmed, head of UTA Next Gen, told Variety as the two-day event, which ran Oct.22-23 at The Preserve in Hollywood, concluded. “And that UTA can really be this supercharged engine to accelerate that transformation in the marketplace is something that we’re really excited about, and why we chose to call UTA home. I think it says so much about UTA as a company that they’ve not only let us, but actively really encouraged us and helped us, continue to build ZCON in the same vision of what it has always been. And so we’re just excited to carry forward that energy.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSonali Ohrie and Nick Dybel\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSonali Ohrie and Nick Dybel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs to how other generations are responding to the event, Ahmed notes “my boss just called me, [UTA NY chief] Mr. Julian Jacobs, and was like, ‘This was everything and more. And I want to never stop doing this.'” “And folks of all generations and titles and backgrounds have given us that encouragement,” he says. “I think that it’s less about, for me, this one moment that’s two days in October and more about, what is this movement? And what is this energy, and how do we scale it? Because I think we all need it right now.”\n\t\n\n\tJUV Consulting, the company behind ZCON and more Gen Z-centered events and projects, was acquired by UTA’s marketing division a year and a half ago as part of the Hollywood talent agency’s efforts to focus more on the Gen Z audience in its entertainment and marketing partnerships.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSonali Ohrie and Nick Dybel\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSonali Ohrie and Nick Dybel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis year, ZCON teamed up with brands including Cosmopolitan and Coach, among others, as it hosted sessions and panels exploring how Hollywood is evolving, Gen Z’s relationship with beauty, health and Wellness, digital identity, and cultural and social impact.\n\n\tParticipating talent included Adam Faze, Hannah Broadhurst, Auli’i Cravalho, Chandler Kinney, Josie Totah, Michael Cimino, Ezra Frech, Claire Almond, Austin Maguire, Olandria, Anthony Po, Umar Issa, Cami Téllez, Ramisha Sattar, Nia Sioux, Zaya Perysian, Cheyenne Hunt, Andrew Chang, Ella Emhoff and Josh Colley.\n\n\t“I think there’s so many different platforms and stages that are trying to accomplish this in a lot of ways, and having similar conversations that we’re having at ZCON,” Olivia Frary, executive at UTA Next Gen, said. “But the feedback that we always get is that this just feels so authentic, and that this is truly a place where everyone is showing up as their true self, and no one is afraid to dance or belt their heart out or make a new friend and say hi to someone, give someone a compliment — hula hoop! We’re asking people to do pretty crazy things when they’re well-seasoned executives and folks with amazing careers who usually are in offices and on emails.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSonali Ohrie and Nick Dybel\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSonali Ohrie and Nick Dybel\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAhmed added: “And they really lean in and they do it with us!”\n\n\tFrary says the organizers behind ZCON looks to “lead by example and create a space that folks feel comfortable and safe doing that in.”\n\n\t“What we constantly are hearing and what we want to be able to accomplish is to create more spaces that feel that way and give people of all walks of life and all generations more permission to be their true self and have these types of experiences — but also come away feeling the way that people feel when they walk out of ZCON,” she said.\n",

Not as a costume, but as a statement.”\n\t\n\n\tOnassis was wearing the pink outfit on Nov. 22, 1963, riding beside her husband in a Dallas parade when he was shot. Images of Onassis crawling over the car with her husband’s blood soaking into her elegant attire have become harrowing relics of history. More notoriously, Onassis refused to change out of her clothes when standing next to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson during his swearing-in ceremony on Air Force One. She reportedly stated, “No, let them see what they’ve done to Jack.”\n\n\n\tIn her post, Fox says, “The image of the delicate pink suit splattered with blood is one of the most haunting juxtapositions in modern history. Beauty and horror. Poise and devastation.” She praises the First Lady’s decision to stay in the same clothes as “an act of extraordinary bravery. It was performance, protest, and mourning all at once. A woman weaponizing image and grace to expose brutality. It’s about trauma, power, and how femininity itself is a form of resistance.”\n\n\n\tNot everyone saw Fox’s outfit as a tasteful tribute, though. She received backlash for the controversial costume from many critics online, including Kennedy and Onassis’ grandson, Jack Schlossberg. Schlossberg wrote on Twitter, “Julia Fox glorifying political violence is disgusting, desperate and dangerous. I’m sure her late grandmother would agree.”\n\t\n\nJulia Fox glorifying political violence is disgusting, desperate and  dangerous.  I’m sure her late grandmother would agree.— Jack Schlossberg (@JBKSchlossberg) October 31, 2025\n\n\n\tThe real pink suit resides in the National Archives outside of Washington, D.C. It is being kept from public display until the year 2103, a century after it, along with Onassis’ other personal effects from the day of her husband’s death, were donated to the Archives. Onassis passed away in 1994.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn Vitaly Mansky’s arresting portrait of life during wartime, “Time to the Target,” he allows audiences to breathe, to absorb the smallest details and even, somehow, to laugh as his camera focuses on Lviv, in western Ukraine, a place once thought of as relatively safe.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe advent of Russian cruise missiles and Shahed drones have ended that illusion at this point in the three-year war on Ukraine, of course. But Mansky still presents daily life much as it’s always been – a military band practicing for a memorial, a wedding, a theater performance hastily ended for an air raid, a new mother whose baby was born just as the sirens died down.\n\t\n\n\t“This film doesn’t aim to convince or change anyone’s mind,” Mansky says. “It offers the opportunity to experience the war as it has become part of the fabric of civilian life.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Time to the Target”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Hypermarket Film\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor that reason, he adds, he’s comfortable with a film that runs three hours and won’t be for everyone.\n\n\t“I’m counting on audiences in the cinema who have consciously come to see this film. And most importantly, on viewers 30-50 years of age who (hopefully) have never had such an experience in their lives.”\n\n\tYet the daily rituals in “Time to the Target” are universal, while also being uniquely Ukrainian.\n\n\tGrieving families gather to honor a fallen father or son. But the gravediggers complain they have no more space at Lviv’s military cemetery, which contains the remains of soldiers from centuries of wars.\n\n\tOne digger worries that, if bode are really laid to rest until the Second Coming, as priests proclaim during burial, then how is that to be squared with this business of exhuming so many to make space for new burials?\n\t\n\n\t“This field has always been a military cemetery,” says Mansky of his home city. “During World War I, Austrian soldiers were buried there, and during the Second World War, Soviet soldiers. Now they’re being exhumed and, as far as I know, reburied.”\n\n\tLviv stands roughly 1,000 kilometers from the front line of the Russian invasion but that doesn’t allow much space for psychological relief from the war, as Mansky shows.\n\n\tSure, children play, go to school – “Our front it here,” a teacher tells ninth graders – couples fall in love and lives begin. But there are also the daily moments of silence at 9 a.m., when all stand still to honor the heroes.\n\n\tAnd commemorations fill the churches and the streets with processions. A day at the park is broken up by paint gun target practice at a portrait of Putin. And everyone in the military band has a story about a son burned in combat or about returning to service despite being retired.\n\n\t“No one believes that we would hold out for so long,” says one musician. Someone else bemoans the speed of military aid: “They give us weapons one teaspoon at a time. So as not to lose and not to win.”\n\n\tThe city has been irreversibly changed, somehow, even if daily life goes on as close to normally as possible.\n\n\t“I thought Lviv was an eternal city and that I knew it very well,” Mansky has said. “However, with the start of the first war in 2014, and later on, the full-scale war, when I was passing through Lviv, going somewhere else, I started to notice the gradual changes.”\n\n\tMansky, whose films have chronicled life in today’s Ukraine and the former Soviet Union, has taken on everything from Russian gas pipelines to Putin’s grip on power in his past films before directing “Time to the Target,” this time teaming with Czech documentarians and producers Vit Klusak and Filip Remunda.\n\n\t“Many films about Ukraine today are created as manifestos,” says Mansky. “This is understandable and important. Yevhen Titarenko and I also made such a film, ‘Eastern Front,’ in 2023. But these manifestos don’t allow the viewer into this tragedy. The viewer remains a spectator, even if the film shows them military clashes captured on GoPro cameras.”\n\n\tWhat Mansky was after with “Time to the Target” is a different shade of understanding. “Our film creates a space in which the viewers can live their own lives, feeling part of this catastrophe.”\n\t\n\n\tThus, the band practices, players share funny phone videos on the bus, the bass drum carrier feels the strain on his back, and there’s time to glimpse a little boy holding his dad’s military beret as the grave diggers shovel and shovel in the dirt.\n\n\tMansky’s frame is often broad, with locked down camera, long takes and deep focus, allowing people to continuously enter and exit the shot on many planes.\n\n\t“For me, the inspiration for working on the film was Bruegel’s paintings, where there is a larger foreground, for example, with hunters, and with musicians, and a very detailed background with everyday life from birth to death.”\n\n\tAnd through it all runs the constant strains of music – as often a pop ballad in the background or a religious chorus as a somber brass band recital. This, in “Time to the Target,” seems as eternal and death-defying as all the rest of it.\n\n\t“I met with the musicians almost every day,” Mansky says. “It wasn’t just a shoot anymore, but a kind of shared life. At least they no longer treated me like a stranger. For that, I’m very grateful.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn Chinese culture, “double happiness” refers to an ornamental design commonly found festooned across wedding ceremonies, formed by placing two copies of the Chinese character for joy next to each other. In doing so, it forms a kind of hybrid character, one that literally doesn’t mean anything, but is accorded a certain significance for how it handily represents the intended satisfaction of both bride and groom, and by extension their families. Such a conundrum is clearly on the mind of Taiwanese director Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu, whose film “Double Happiness” uses an absurd premise — a couple holds two weddings at the same time in order to appease the groom’s parents — as a means of bringing out all manner of familial tensions, with decidedly mixed results.\n\t\n\n\tTim Kao (Kuang-Ting Liu) is the high-strung head chef at the Grand Hotel in Taipei, who is about to be married to Daisy Wu (Jennifer Yu). Having experienced his parents’ divorce at a young age, he has constantly tried to appease and cater to both sides of his family for many years, which has resulted in his most ambitious and foolhardy plan to date. \n\n\n\tAfter Tim’s dentist father Frank (Chung Hua Tou) refuses to allow his ex-wife, successful CEO Carina Bai (Kuei-Mei Yang), to attend the wedding ceremony and reception, the groom resolves — with the extensive coordination of Daisy, her family, his coworkers and wedding planner Regina (singer-turned-actor 9m88) — to hold two weddings on the same day at the hotel, with bride, groom and father-in-law (Tenky Tin) shuttling back and forth between the two while the guests remain none the wiser.\n\t\n\n\tAside from a brief prologue establishing Tim’s first literal inklings of his love of food in the midst of his grief over his parents’ separation, this surprisingly long film takes place over the course of this single chaotic day. It initially operates in a pseudo-“Birdman” vein, using a percussive score and long tracking shots following people through hallways as they attempt to solve the latest crisis: the last-minute addition of a champagne tower, a typhoon delaying a key member of the wedding ceremony, and the difficulties of obtaining fresh cuttlefish ink, the pasta dish that initially brought Tim and Daisy together at his restaurant. \n\n\tHsu, who made his directorial debut with the well-received drama “Little Big Women” in 2020, handles the comparative frothiness of these scenes ably, though the constant introduction of new characters into the maelstrom tends to flatten them out into types rather than shedding additional light onto the supposed loved ones of the bride and groom.\n\n\t“Double Happiness” certainly has its share of more overtly manufactured acts of stupidity, though some of it can be chalked up to the film’s seemingly comic aims. Where it truly runs into trouble, however, is in its gradual infusion of drama until it completely overwhelms the proceedings. The memories stirred up by the momentous occasions of the day begin to manifest for Tim as flashbacks where he sees and interacts with his younger self (Robinson Yang), reliving an especially traumatic day when he went to the hotel and tried to pry his mother away from an important meeting. This heart-tugging mode quickly becomes the main emotional tenor of the film in its last 45 minutes, as Tim becomes more and more morose during the dueling receptions, with an especially ill-advised move into surrealism. \n\n\tThough Liu — who previously won a Golden Horse award for Chung Mong-hong’s melodrama “A Sun”(2019) — acquits himself in some of the comic setpieces, his screen presence is generally recessive in a way that favors drama, and the effort only serves to highlight how much Daisy’s role is ultimately downplayed in favor of Tim’s reveries and attempts to come to terms with his parental relationships.\n\n\tOne of the most interesting aspects of “Double Happiness” comes courtesy of its sometimescounterproductive yet cinephile-minded casting. Kuei-Mei Yang, one of Tsai Ming-liang’s greatest actresses, brings a natural, pained warmth to proceedings that counterbalances some of Liu’s more forced moments. Tenky Tin, so memorable in Stephen Chow’s “Shaolin Soccer” and “Kung Fu Hustle,” appears here as Daisy’s well-meaning, astrology-obsessed father. But the most significant of all comes in the form of the Grand Hotel itself which, in addition to its real-life glamor, is the workplace of the master chef father in the Yang-starring “Eat Drink Man Woman” and the site of the wedding reception in Edward Yang’s masterpiece “Yi Yi.” \n\t\n\n\tThe staircase used so prominently in that latter film — which also featured a pregnant bride, superstitions surrounding the day of the wedding, and a title formed by combining two Chinese characters — is seen time and again here, and the invocation of such a daringly modern film, one in which sentimentality is balanced by a rigor of form and lived-in portraiture of each generation’s failings and hopes, makes the plot machinations and attempted pathos of “Double Happiness” feel all the more limited by comparison.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNatalia Koniarz’s “Silver” has been named the winner of the Opus Bonum section at Ji.hlava Documentary Film Festival. The film also picked up the award for the best documentary film in the Visegrad region and best cinematography recognition for Stanisław Cuske.\n\n\t“Silver” boasts the acclaimed filmmaker Paweł Pawlikowski (“Ida,” “Cold War”) as an executive producer. “It’s a sensory and poetic experience. It brings images from the depths with remarkable clarity,” he said, calling the film “brutal, hypnotic and profoundly humane.”\n\t\n\n\tIt portrays Bolivia’s highest silver mine and the locals who live according to its brutal rules. Danger is ever-present, not just underground, and sometimes the only recourse is to pray to the devil, who’s supposed to keep them safe. \n\n\n\t“You live with these people, you become friends with them, you witness their suffering and violence, but you can’t change it or react. My reaction to someone else’s suffering could have consequences when I’m no longer there,” Koniarz told Variety. \n\n\t“I constantly confronted my own beliefs and prejudices in order to find an insider’s perspective.”\n\n\tYudi Zhu won the top prize in the First Lights section for “So Close, So Far,” while Sammy Baloji’s “The Tree of Authenticity” dominated the Testimonies category. Fredj Moussa was given the Fascinations’ main award for “Land of Barbar.” Finally, acclaimed director Vitaly Mansky was the Czech Joy winner with “Time to the Target.” A co-production between Latvia, Czech Republic and Ukraine, it depicts Mansky’s hometown of Lviv, disrupted by war. \n\t\n\n\tUnsurprisingly, the warmly received “Mr. Nobody Against Putin” by David Borenstein and Pavel “Pasha” Talankin walked away with the audience award. \n\n\tAlready noticed at Sundance, the film has been selected by Denmark as its entry for the best international feature film Oscar. It shows Talankin, a small-town teacher, quietly resisting – and filming – propaganda and militarization sweeping over his school after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He’s since fled Russia. \n\n\tDuring a Q&A with the audience, Talankin reveled at its success. “I got a call from the kids I used to teach when Denmark decided to submit the film. They said: ‘Just imagine if the best actor award goes to our teacher’!” \n\n\tHe said: “I was born in Russia; I grew up in it and grew up with my eyes open. I knew what was happening. Everything that comes out of Putin’s mouth when he’s on TV is a lie. It’s always a lie.” \n\n\tThis year’s edition also welcomed Tsai Ming-liang, back to present “Night Journey.” Last year, he picked up a Lifetime Achievement Award at Ji.hlava. \n\n\t“I was immediately drawn to the quiet atmosphere of the small town and the fog that shrouds its nights. The idea came to me to shoot a new ‘Walker’ film there,” he explained. Shortly afterwards, he was invited by FAMU to serve as a guest professor for the autumn semester.\n\n\t“My producer began planning a new project: to return to Ji.hlava a year later, filming with FAMU students before the next edition of the festival, complete post-production in Prague and hold its world premiere at Ji.hlava.”\n\n\t“The Walker” series began in 2012 and has continued for 13 years, with 12 films completed so far: “Walker in Spain” is still in post-production. \n\n\t“As long as Lee Kang-sheng and I are both still here, I believe the series will continue. I look forward to seeing how Lee might keep walking slowly into his sixties and seventies. Future plans include a ‘Walker’ in Jeonju [in Korea] and others in different cities,” said Tsai Ming-liang.\n\n\t“Whenever there’s an invitation and some funding, I will make another one.” \n\n\t“Ji.hlava proved to be the perfect place for ‘Night Journey’: it offered the right timing, strong institutional collaboration and external partnerships. I don’t think such a project could have happened this smoothly, or this quickly, anywhere else – even in Prague.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Time to the Target’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Ji.hlava Intl.

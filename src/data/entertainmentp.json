    "body": "\n\tIncline Studios, a new independent production company led by Benjamin J. Murray and Michael Christensen, has launched and is unveiling its first slate of feature films. The company is being formed with a goal to “create meaningful, contemporary stories while rekindling the timeless cinematic feeling that has become less present in today’s independent film landscape.” \n\n\tThe Incline team has provided production services over the past decade and has evolved into a creative studio.\n\t\n\n\t“Our goal has always been to bring audiences back to the feeling of discovery — to fall in love again with adventure, taking risks, and getting lost in imagination,” said Murray. “We want to make films that remind people why they fell in love with movies in the first place.”\n\n\n\tIncline’s debut slate spans multiple genres. The lineup includes “Red Ink,” a 1949 newsroom thriller that interrogates media propaganda, institutional power and exploitation amid the looming threat of a mysterious global outbreak; “Engaged,” an adventure comedy set in Malta that follows two best friends on a journey to break up a wedding that transforms into a whirlwind journey of love, adventure and self-discovery, produced in partnership with Cineloop; and “Blood Bank,” a darkly satirical vampire heist film about survival, misrepresentation and what it means to be human as an underground gang of dissidents attempt a daring raid on the city blood reserve. “Red Ink” is slated to shoot in Syracuse, N.Y. in January, with a cast to be announced shortly; “Engaged” is slated to shoot in Malta in summer; and “Blood Bank” is slated to shoot in the fall.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re drawn to stories that feel timeless but culturally urgent,” said Christensen. “Each project on our slate represents a step toward rebuilding the bridge between independent creative vision and widespread commercial reach.”\n\n\tThe New York–based company was also founded by Marty Lucero, Hamish Briggs, and Robert Goodwin. \n",

    "body": "\n\tI interviewed Rob Reiner twice in the last six months, both times about “Spinal Tap” — once solo and once with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer, his longtime friends and the actors/bandmembers in the film. While both of those interviews are excellent, funny and essential for fans of the film — their chemistry and occasional crankiness as septuagenarian-plus friends is palpable — it was a brief conversation we had before the solo interview that has resonated, even prior to his and his wife’s shocking deaths last week.\n\t\n\n\tWe started off talking about our fathers — we were on a Zoom, it was a beautiful Friday in late June, and Rob asked where I was calling from. I said my dad’s house, and mentioned that he’d just gotten home from work at his law firm, which he still runs at the age of 89.\n\n\n\tRob then told the story of how his father, legendary writer-director Carl Reiner, had passed away at the age of 98 immediately after having dinner with his best friend, Mel Brooks: They said “Good night,” Brooks heard a thump, and Carl had died instantly of a heart attack. I told Rob that my grandfather had passed away at 87, in his favorite chair, with a newspaper in his lap. We agreed that there are few better ways to exit this life.\n\n\tAfter we’d finished our interview I brought the laptop into the next room and introduced Rob to my dad. He was, of course, super-nice to my father and gave him props for his work longevity and added, “Well, your son comes to visit you, that’s a nice thing!” My dad was a little startled but pleased, and has mentioned it a few times since then.\n\t\n\n\tRob was exceptionally warm both times I spoke with him and, without being exploitative or morbid here, it’s so sad that he and Michele Singer, his wife of nearly 40 years, died in a way that was so far from the one we’d talked about. This is the story he told at the beginning of that first interview.\n\n\t“For years [after their wives had passed away], my dad and Mel Brooks would have dinner and watch TV, every single night — they were best friends. \n\n\t“On the night my dad died, Mel was leaving at the end of the night, and he said, ‘Goodnight Carl!’ And just as he was about to walk out the door, he heard a thud, and my dad just fell down — he was dead, like, immediately. I got over there about five minutes later, and he was gone. But, you know, it’s the best way to go: fast, and not have pain or linger.\n\n\t“And then Mel, even after my dad died, would come to the house very night, for months and months and months, by himself, and sit there and watch television and have dinner. Even long after my father died. And he said to me and my brother, ‘You’ve got to give me a little warning when you’re going to sell the house, you’ll want to tell me ahead of time.’ And I told him, ‘Well, Mel, maybe we’ll just stage the house with you in it and up the value!’ (laughter)\n\n\t“They were best friends. They loved each other, and I’m glad they had each other at the end of life. It’s good to have somebody that you can hang with.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCap is back — and he’s a dad!\n\n\tThe first teaser trailer for “Avengers: Doomsday” has revealed that Steve Rogers, the star-spangled Avenger portrayed by Chris Evans, will return in the next Marvel team-up adventure, set to release Dec. 18, 2026. In a twist, Captain America is the father to a newborn child.\n\n\tMarvel is building up to “Doomsday,” which hits theaters exactly one year from Thursday, with this Cap-focused teaser attached to screenings of “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” There will reportedly be more teasers that focus on other characters in the coming weeks.\n\t\n\n\tThis teaser, set on a peaceful farm, begins with Steve riding a motorcycle up to his home as a piano rendition of the “Avengers” theme plays in the background. His blue helmet is reminiscent of his Captain America costume, which he pulls out to reminiscently admire. He holds a newborn baby and looks proudly, as the teaser ends with “Steve Rogers will return for ‘Avengers: Doomsday.'” A countdown timer begins at the end that’s set to expire a year from now when “Doomsday” hits theaters.\n\n\n\tMarvel fans last saw Captain America, the founding Avenger, in the closing moments of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame.” After saving the world from the purple villain known as Thanos, Cap makes it his personal mission to return the missing Infinity Stones to their rightful places across time. After finishing his time-traveling mission, an elderly Steve returns to the main MCU timeline and passes down his red-and-white Vibranium shield to his former sidekick, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), upgrading him from the Falcon to the new Captain America. After bestowing his shield to Sam, Steve then goes back in time to reunite with his beloved Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell).\n\t\n\n\tAfter Steve went missing and was frozen in the ice in the original “Captain America” movie, Peggy grew old but never stopped loving him. Now with the Quantum Realm time-traveling technology, the two were able to get married and live out their lives together through the decades. \n\n\tDoes this teaser mean that Steve somehow returns to the main MCU timeline to rejoin the Avengers? Is this the same Cap, or is he a variant of the elderly hero from the finale of “Endgame”? And who’s the baby. Does he or she have super-soldier powers like Cap? \n\n\tTechnically, this isn’t Evans’ first time back in the MCU since “Endgame.” In 2024’s billion-dollar smash “Deadpool & Wolverine,” he returned for a hilarious cameo as the Human Torch, his original superhero role way back in Fox’s “Fantastic Four” movie from 2005.\n\n\tEvans isn’t the only original “Avengers” star who will be back for “Doomsday.” Robert Downey Jr. is returning, but not as Tony Stark. Instead, he is replacing his Iron Man armor to play the ultimate villain, Doctor Doom, in the multiverse-crossing movie. Other returning heroes include Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Mackie, Danny Ramirez, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Tom Hiddleston, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Simu Liu, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen and Lewis Pullman. From the “X-Men” universe, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Kelsey Grammer, Alan Cumming, James Marsden, Channing Tatum and Rebecca Romijn will cross over into the MCU.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Leavy, a longtime aide to Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, is leaving the company after more than two decades.\n\n\tLeavy announced his plans Thursday in a note to staffers. “When I first joined in 2000, Discovery was based in Bethesda, MD, as a small privately held cable company with a few networks and websites…but it did have really smart and dedicated people with very grand ambitions…and to witness the company’s extraordinary evolution and global growth over the past 25 years has been incredible,” he said. “That story continues to be written in real time with the next great chapter in ’26 and beyond.  I will be cheering loudly for the best outcomes for WBD with all the amazing stories it tells every day, and all the world-class people that work here.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring his tenure, Leavy managed communications for Discovery as it grew larger and more influential — first as a large purveyor of non-fiction, documentary and reality TV, and then as a bigger player in the media sector through its acquisitions of the former Scripps Networks and WarnerMedia. \n\n\n\tIn 2023, Leavy was dispatched to CNN, to oversee business operations under then-CEO Chris Licht, a move viewer as Zaslav growing more embedded in the news outlet’s operations. Leavy returned to corporate work on 2025, but in a less defined role.\n\n\t“David is both a great person and an outstanding executive, and I’m confident this is the right moment for him to take the next step in his career and life.,” Zaslav said. “Wherever he goes, he will bring leadership, strategic drive and just a collaborative spirit that always leads to good things happening.” \n\t\n\n\tLeavy will exit at the end of 2025. “As the company goes through its next iteration of structure and strategy, and after 25 years at this wonderful organization, it feels like the right time to do the same.” He expects to take some time off, then examine new opportunities  that could be tied to media, politics or something entirely different.\n",

He moans. He mourns. Lewis Pullman’s role in “The Testament of Ann Lee,” set for release on Christmas Day via Searchlight, is a physical and mental feat. He’s earned a place among internet boyfriends after his work in Marvel’s “Thunderbolts*” and the miniseries “Lessons in Chemistry.” But in “Ann Lee,” that handsome face is often contorted, devoid of vanity.It’s a performance that practically jumps off the screen. A similar restlessness drives the 32-year-old in plotting his next move. Contrary to getting typecast, it’s hard to pin Pullman down as any one thing. “A role can really speak to you one year, and then if it doesn’t get made, you can either become uninterested in the questions being asked within that character, or you have already answered them,” he says. “It’s about doing something I haven’t done before. Repeating the same notes in a song is not enjoyable for me as an artist, and I assume not very enjoyable for the audience either. Looking for that thing that spooks you a little bit and makes you question whether or not you’re capable of it is what ends up creating the pressurizer that pushes you to do something that surprises you. It makes you feel like you can sleep better at night knowing that you didn’t just surrender to the mundane.” Suffice it to say that the part of William Lee pushed him out of his comfort zone. In the expressive, raw musical, Pullman plays the brother of Ann Lee (Amanda Seyfried), the founder of the Shakers and a woman often driven to euphoric frenzy by her faith. The film demands plenty of its cast, including singing, dancing and getting caught in rapture, set to an unconventional soundtrack based on Shaker hymns by Oscar-winning composer Daniel Blumberg.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDespite his interest in the script, Pullman was initially hesitant to take on the role. “When I first spoke to Lewis about this part, he said, ‘Oh, I don’t really dance, and I don’t really sing, and the accents are challenging,’” Mona Fastvold, the film’s co-writer and director, says. “He was pretty intimidated by the task. So, I said, ‘Why don’t you spend some time with some of the material?’ I felt strongly that he could do it. I could see it. I thought there was this sweetness and tenderness to him that was really important for William.” \n\n\n\tFastvold’s vote of confidence gave Pullman the push he needed to dive into the unknown. “I’m not a great actor in solitude,” Pullman says. “I really rely on collaboration and direction, and I enjoy being dared to do something. The whole film was these little tiptoes into the water of trust with Mona and with Daniel.”\n\t\n\n\n\tThe spark of Pullman’s restless creative spirit began by growing up in what he lovingly describes as a “granola family.” The son of actor Bill Pullman and dancer Tamara Hurwitz, his upbringing — split between Los Angeles and Montana — was artistically inclined, punctuated by opportunities to travel when his father was shooting on location.Yet Pullman describes himself as a “socially anxious kid.” It was a fateful school production that allowed him to feel comfortable performing. “My whole family was always putting on little plays and shows and pageants,” Pullman says. “In high school, I remember a bunch of my friends going to audition for this play. I didn’t want to be the only one not doing it. ‘What else am I going to do this afternoon?’ So, I went and auditioned for it and ended up playing an old man with a cap and a candle. I had a couple of lines, but it was terrifying. It was so scary, and I was so embarrassed. What I realized was maybe everyone else wasn’t as embarrassed as I was. I remember feeling this levity afterwards. It was like I had been running with weights on, and then suddenly, life was easier. I ended up being really enticed by that and wanting to return to it.” After finishing high school and college, Pullman cut his teeth by acting in short films. He then had a flurry of roles in disparate films that introduced him to audiences in 2017, including the western “The Ballad of Lefty Brown,” the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring thriller “Aftermath,” the Andrew Haigh drama “Lean on Pete” and the ‘70s-set tennis chronicle “Battle of the Sexes.” As he kept working, Pullman kept ticking off genres, from slasher (“The Strangers: Prey at Night”) to noir (“Bad Times at the El Royale”), mystery (“Them That Follow”) to quirky dramady (“Pink Skies Ahead”). Then came a part as a flyboy in the blockbuster “Top Gun: Maverick.” While there is a world of difference between the scope of a Tom Cruise epic or a Marvel movie and some of the indies Pullman worked on, he says every production has its own unique challenges. “It’s different shades every time, which is part of what is so scary and so enjoyable at the same time,” he says. “I always feel like there are only so many variables that are the same and so many tools that work effectively for every single role. It’s this little treasure hunt each time, which can be scary when you have a ticking time bomb going to go off if you don’t find the treasure in time. But it’s also exhilarating because it’s not like you’re just going to the same pile of gold at the end of the same rainbow every time.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNo matter the project, Pullman has a reputation for taking preparation seriously. “Lewis wants everything from a process standpoint,” says Austin Peters, who directed Pullman in the 2024 thriller “Skincare.” “Anything I was thinking, any photos I was looking at that may be totally different, he wanted to take things from. He would pull from early interesting places that I wasn’t expecting at all, from interviews with celebrities on MTV in the early 2000s to art photo books I had been looking at. He was informed by all these different things. Then, any sort of homework I would give him, he would be super eager to do. Our collaboration was really exciting and satisfying.” Pullman cites an industry lesson he learned from his father, who he calls a “beautiful leader through example,” as the genesis behind his love of collaboration. “The people my dad connected with were not just actors; they were people from all different parts of the crew,” Pullman says. “It was always soul-based, finding those people that are your brother or sister from another life.” That collaborative spirit ended up including his family when preparing for “Ann Lee.”“We didn’t want someone to sound like they were a Broadway star,” Fastvold says. “We needed someone who sounded like a human being, just singing, untrained. It was exciting to hear that first little voice memo of him singing. He started doing some dance rehearsals with his mom, who’s an incredible dancer, and sent me some videos. We thought it was so beautiful.”\n\n\n\tIn addition to acting, Pullman is a drummer, recording albums with his country-tinged rock group, Atta Boy. It’s constructive to look at Pullman’s ease in different acting projects as a musician finding the tempo and adjusting to it. In fact, hearing him reflect on one of his first musical breakthroughs expresses so much of what makes Pullman a compelling performer. “Growing up, me and my best friend would spend hours and hours in the dark just playing music, nowhere to go, just improvising,” he says. “Listening to somebody and finding how often what’s most important is the silence in between. What’s most striking are those negative spaces in between, what’s not said.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs the world sees his work in “Ann Lee,” Pullman has much more work lined up, yo-yoing as usual in scope and genre. Two biggies come next: Reprising his role of Sentry in “Avengers: Doomsday” and starring alongside his father in the next chapter of Mel Brooks’ “Star Wars” parody, “Spaceballs 2.” But then come smaller projects, including a mystery and a rom-com, and surely plenty more additions to his already-sprawling IMDb page — despite his aversion to projecting a career path. “I was raised to keep your expectations manageable so your disappointment is manageable,” he says. “We weren’t a big manifesting, mood-board family. We were an ‘eat what’s on the plate in front of you and enjoy it’ kind of family. That’s not to say I don’t believe in setting out a mental path on your horizon and loosely following it.” But mainly Pullman, ever the chameleon, is ready to defy expectations once again. There’s a bit of irony that the superpower of his Marvel character is making people disappear; he’s getting pretty good at that himself. “I’m getting a little antsy playing roles that are closer to myself,” he says. “I’m boring myself, and I’m looking forward to doing more stuff that’s outside of me and pushing myself.”\n\n\t\n\t\tStyling: Warren Alfie Baker; Grooming: Christine Nelli;\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tOpenAI released Sora 2 in October, unleashing a flood of copyright violations onto the internet. But instead of suing the company, or even threatening to do so, Disney is now teaming up with it.\n\n\tIn a remarkable deal announced Dec. 11, Disney will allow millions of Sora users to do (almost) anything with 200 iconic characters, including Darth Vader, Elsa and even Mickey Mouse.\n\n\tThat’s the sort of abuse Disney seemed to be trying to prevent when it sued the AI studio Midjourney in July. Turns out the battle was never to stop AI, but rather to have some say in it. Disney’s choice is likely to have broad ramifications across Hollywood and tech.\n\t\n\n\t“Anytime the mega-mouse moves, markets react and people take notice,” says Adam Eisgrau, senior director at tech policy group Chamber of Progress.\n\n\tThe law is still unsettled about whether AI technology — specifically, copying and training on copyrighted work — is legal. But Eisgrau sees the deal between Disney and OpenAI as a tacit acknowledgment that it is — especially significant in light of Disney’s zealous defense of copyright.\n\n\t“It’s hard to see any scenario in which Disney would have opted to go this route without them first calculating that AI training was almost certainly going to be found to be fair use,” he says.\n\n\tThe creative community is not about to give up that fight. And it also found something to cheer in the deal: a recognition from OpenAI that it has to get a license to replicate Disney’s characters.\n\n\t“The market is beginning to speak, and it is saying that human art is valuable and artists must be paid,” says a spokesperson for the Human Artistry Campaign, a coalition that includes several Hollywood unions. The organization described the deal as “a meaningful step forward — and a warning sign blinking red to holdouts demanding the right to scrape the entire internet and use all of human creativity without permission or pay.”\n\t\n\n\tDisney appears to be of two minds on the issue. On Dec. 10, the company demanded that Google stop training its AI tools on Disney characters, saying it “will not tolerate” unauthorized uses. Yet it is tolerating the same conduct from OpenAI, which didn’t gain the right to train on Disney characters even while it is allowed to reproduce them. In fact, it isn’t merely tolerating it — it’s investing $1 billion in the company.\n\n\tThe Animation Guild has no jurisdiction over user-generated content, but expressed concerns about the deal. Disney said it would use OpenAI’s application interfaces “to build new products, tools, and experiences.” Steve Kaplan, the union’s business representative, says that raises alarms.\n\n\t“It’s vague yet alludes to the potential implementation of generative tools in the animation pipeline,” he says. “We will meet with Disney to discuss what ‘human-centered AI’ looks like and how they plan to respect creative industries.”\n\n\tThe union fought for tough safeguards against AI in its contract last year, but walked away with provisions that many felt were too weak. A militant faction has since pushed for more aggressive measures, including preparations for a strike.\n\n\tDisney had been in talks with OpenAI for months, but the announcement came as a surprise to the union. The most vocal AI critics saw that as vindication of their deepest concerns.\n\n\t“We were all blindsided,” says one such member. “We need to come out saying we’re launching a full investigation of this.”\n\n\tDisney also announced that some Sora subscribers will have their videos appear on Disney+. “So now you’re paying to make content for Disney,” says Sam Tung, co-chair of the union’s AI Task Force.\n\n\tThat content could end up as a testing ground for future storylines on Disney shows — or simply compete with professionally made work for viewers’ attention. Tung says he is both disappointed and baffled by Disney’s decision.\n\n\t“I’m an optimist. My glass-half-full response is that people hate AI,” he says. “I’ll be surprised if any of this hits. I’m doubtful it will prove to be as lucrative for them as I’m sure they’re hoping it will be.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tStarz has acquired exclusive U.S. rights to South African action series “The Nowhere Man,” starring Bonko Khoz (“The Woman King”) as a former Special Forces mercenary crippled by PTSD and Naturi Naughton-Lewis (“Power,” “Power Book II: Ghost”) as a woman named Ruby who helps him get his life back together.\n\n\tThe six-episode series, that is currently streaming on Prime Video in South Africa, will launch weekly on Starz starting Jan. 16, 2026.  International distribution is being handled by Prime Video and Canal+. \n\t\n\n\tIn “The Nowhere Man,” tormented ex-mercenary Lukas (Khoza) has turned his back on his violent past and is operating as a junk collector on the streets of Johannesburg. But when he witnesses a home invasion and intervenes, “he is dragged back into the world he’s spent years trying to escape,” according to the synopsis.\n\n\n\tBesides starring in “The Nowhere Man,” Naughton-Lewis — who is known for her long-running role as Tasha St. Patrick on Starz’s drama series “Power” and its spin-off “Power Book II: Ghost” — serves as an executive producer on the show.\n\n\t“The Nowhere Man’ represents an exciting evolution for me as both an actress and executive producer, and I’m thrilled to have my company, Take Two Entertainment, as part of this incredible team,” she said in a statement. “It’s especially meaningful to be reunited with my Starz family to tell a bold, action-packed, globally relevant story,” she added. \n\n\t“We’re thrilled to be reunited with Naturi, an extraordinary talent viewers know and love,” said Alison Hoffman, President of Starz Networks. “‘The Nowhere Man’ is a powerful addition to our action lineup, and with our audience eager for the next high-octane thrill ride, this show delivers.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Nowhere Man” was filmed on location in South Africa and created by Motion Story and produced by Phillip Wolmarans and Nick Keulemans. Fred Wolmarans and Gareth Crocker directed, with Crocker serving as showrunner. Additional executive producers include Chris Lawrance, Colleen Lawrance, Sean Mik’ael Butler, Naturi Naughton-Lewis and Two Lewis. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJessica Lacy, the top indie film sales and packaging executive at Range Media Partners, is is expected to depart the company next year, numerous sources told Variety. \n\n\tLacy joined the management firm in 2022 as a partner, to head up the speciality division Range Select. Insiders said the split was mutual, and Lacy will carry her existing team through the 2026 Sundance Film Festival market as she weighs her options. \n\n\n\tRange Media Partners had no comment on the matter. It’s unclear when Range will seek to replace her. \n\t\n\n\tLacy joined the upstart management firm after two decades at ICM Partners, where she worked with top filmmakers on titles that have competed in or sold out of prominent global festivals, including Sundance, Cannes, Tribeca, Berlin and SXSW.  \n\n\tHer notable career deals include the eye-popping $25 million Sundance sale of “CODA,” which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2022; Cooper Raiff’s “Cha Cha Real Smooth”; Regina King’s “One Night in Miami”; the 9/11 drama “Worth” starring Michael Keaton; and two of Karyn Kusama’s buzzy titles in “Destroyer” and “The Invitation.” \n\n\tRange Media Partners was founded in 2020, by a faction of top agents who pivoted to management following the WGA-mandated cease in TV packaging fees. Former eOne executive Pete Micelli and a list of cohorts, including former CAA agent Dave Bugliari and Jack Whigham, all have ownership stakes in the venture. \n\n\tRange also has a film production outfit in development on several titles, such as: a biopic of legendary musician and Velvet Underground co-founder Lou Reed, based on the 2023 biography “Lou Reed: The King of New York” by Will Hermes; a look at the screen partnership of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; and “Soul Train,” a movie adaptation of the upcoming stage musical about legendary producer Don Cornelius.\n",

The series also features some of the most trusted voices in women’s health, including physicians, researchers and leading menopause experts. \n\n\t“All women go through perimenopause, yet there’s so much confusion, misinformation and isolation,” said Milano in a statement. “‘BALANCE’ shines a light on a stage of life that deserves real understanding and real compassion.  This series gives women something they’ve been missing for far too long: information, knowledge and a much-needed sense of community.”\n\n\tThe docuseries is produced by Siddhali, Anubhuti, Zack Tzourtzouklis and Cesar Ramos-Ortiz.

    "description": "\n\tThe Kennedy Center is being renamed the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” after President Donald Trump ousted the previous Democratic board members and manage",
    "body": "\n\tThe Kennedy Center is being renamed the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” after President Donald Trump ousted the previous Democratic board members and management team and installed himself as chairman.\n\n\tThe unanimous vote on the naming decision by the Kennedy Center’s board members, whom Trump selected, came after the president announced in February that he was “unanimously” elected to lead the board of the Washington, D.C., cultural center.\n\t\n\n\tThe full new name of the institution will be “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts,” according to Kennedy Center PR.\n\n\n\tNews that the facility is to be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center was announced Thursday by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on X.\n\n\t“I have just been informed that the highly respected Board of the Kennedy Center, some of the most successful people from all parts of the world, have just voted unanimously to rename the Kennedy Center to the Trump-Kennedy Center, because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building,” Leavitt wrote. “Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation. Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”\n\n\tThe legality of the move was quickly questioned. “The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,” Joe Kennedy III, one of JFK’s grandnephews and a former U.S. representative from Massachusetts, wrote in a post on X. “It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter Trump took office for a second term in February, Kennedy Center president Deborah Rutter was fired. Trump then appointed as her replacement Richard Grenell, who was ambassador to Germany during the first Trump administration and was serving as Trump’s envoy for special missions. \n\n\tTrump had criticized the Kennedy Center for programming that is overly woke. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA — ONLY THE BEST,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in announcing Grenell’s appointment.\n\n\tFollowing Trump’s takeover of the Kennedy Center, Shonda Rhimes, the organization’s treasurer who had been appointed by President Barack Obama, immediately announced she had resigned from the board. In addition, singer Renée Fleming stepped down as artistic adviser to the center, and singer-songwriter Ben Folds exited down as artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra because of the president’s actions.\n\n\tOn Dec. 7, Trump broke with decades of tradition and hosted the 48th Kennedy Center Honors ceremony. This year’s honorees were Sylvester Stallone; KISS members Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss; singer-actor Michael Crawford; country superstar George Strait; and disco diva Gloria Gaynor.\n\n\tTrump told the crowd that he didn’t know why he decided to host. “I’m acting like Johnny Carson,” Trump said as he spoke from behind a podium with the Presidential seal, which was also a first for the ceremony. Highlights of the Kennedy Center Honors will be telecast Dec. 23 as a primetime special on CBS.\n\n\tAt the event, Trump also jokingly referred to the place as “the Trump-Kennedy Center,” then, waiting a beat for laughter, said, “I mean, the ‘Kennedy Center.’ I’m sorry. This is terribly embarrassing.”\n\n\tThe John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts made its public debut on Sept. 8, 1971, with a “gala opening performance featuring the world premiere of a Requiem mass honoring President Kennedy, a work commissioned from the legendary composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein,” the organization says on its website. President Kennedy had taken the lead to raise funds for what was originally called the National Cultural Center before it was renamed in his honor after he was assassinated.\n",

It's unclear who took the photos.\n      \n    \n          The photos are deeply disturbing ... though that's par for the course when it comes to these periodic releases by Congress, which have shown everything from Epstein's sex toys to the financier himself reclining in a bubble bath.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jeffrey Epstein\n              \n                          \n                Photo Galleries\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Harbour's going through a messy divorce with Lily Allen -- who seemingly spilled all the juicy details about their relationship on her recently released album \"West End Girl,\" including alleged sex toys she found which she claims he was using on someone else.\n      \n    \n          There were also rumors of Millie Bobby Brown filing a harassment report against Harbour for alleged abusive behavior on-set ... though Brown categorically denied the rumors and even lauded Harbour as an actor and collaborator.\n      \n    \n          And, we broke the story just yesterday ... Harbour was caught on video running down the street with a bar patron's hat in a weird altercation in Encinitas, California. He later threw the hat to the ground, asked the group about the Iraq War and then fell to his knees in prayer.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          A source with direct knowledge told us, \"David has always been honest about managing his bipolar disorder. Wouldn’t be surprised if that’s what he’s dealing with here after working non-stop all year and having his personal life under public scrutiny. That would be stressful for anyone but even more so for someone who is bipolar.\"\n      \n    \n          Worth noting ... Harbour isn't the only major cast member sitting out the event because series star Brown will also reportedly not be at the Paley Center this evening.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Harbour's rep ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                David Harbour\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Stranger Things\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

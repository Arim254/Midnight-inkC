    "body": "\n\tDan McGrath, an Emmy-winning writer for “The Simpsons” who wrote the classic Season 8 episode “Homer’s Phobia,” died on Nov. 14. He was 61.\n\n\tHis sister, Gail McGrath Garabadian, confirmed his death in a Facebook post early Saturday morning.\n\n\t“We lost my incredible brother Danny yesterday,” she wrote. “He was a special man, one of a kind. An incredible son, brother, uncle and friend. Our hearts are broken.”\n\n\n\tMcGrath wrote 50 episodes of “The Simpsons” from 1992 to 1994 and produced 24 episodes from 1996 to 1998. He won an Emmy for his work on the series in 1997, taking home the honor for outstanding animated program for “Homer’s Phobia.”\n\t\n\n\tThe episode features director John Waters as a gay antiques dealer befriended by Marge. When Marge brings him home to meet the family, Homer quickly dissociates and does everything he can to keep Bart away from his influence. \n\n\tSome of McGrath’s standout episodes include “Boy-Scoutz ‘n the Hood,” “The Devil and Homer Simpson,” and “Time and Punishment.”\n\n\tMcGrath got his break writing on “Saturday Night” from 1991 to 1992. There, he became a frequent collaborator with “SNL” legends Chris Farley and Adam Sandler. He earned an Emmy nomination for his work on the iconic late-night sketch show in 1992.\n\n\tHis other writing credits include “King of the Hill,” “Mission Hill,” “Sammy,” “The PJs” and “Muppets Tonight.”\n\n\tBorn in Brooklyn, N.Y., McGrath graduated from Harvard University, where he was the vice president of the Harvard Lampoon.\n\n\tMcGrath’s obituary reads, “His prodigious talents and singular personality will be missed by many devoted friends.”\n\t\n\n\tInstead of flowers, McGrath’s family requests donations be made to his alma mater, Regis High School.\n\n\tMcGrath is survived by his mother, Eleanor; his brother Michael and wife Caroline; his brother Peter and his sister, Gail.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie,” a synthetic holiday trifle whose chief asset is that it knows and even winks at how much it’s a synthetic holiday trifle, one of the more amusing scenes has the Jonas Brothers showing up at a hotel in Amsterdam to see a cabaret performance by Ethan, an old enemy of Nick Jonas’s portrayed by Andrew Barth Feldman. It seems that the two had been in a Broadway show together — a musical version of “Home Alone,” with Ethan as the Macaulay Culkin character and Nick cast as the dad. Ethan felt patronized by the pop star, and the two didn’t get along.\n\t\n\n\tThe reason the Jonases have shown up is that they want to hitch a Christmas ride home on Ethan’s private plane. (Their own tour jet blew up, because…well, we’ll get to that in a minute. It has something to do with meeting Santa Claus in a bar.) Ethan, scarcely hiding his contempt, calls Nick up onstage, where the two perform a duet from the show, a song that’s at once a pretty power ballad and pretty awful (“I will never leave you home alone ag-a-a-ain!”). But it’s just plausible enough to give you a chuckle. Then, at the song’s end, Ethan’s contempt for Nick comes pouring out, and Andrew Barth Feldman plays this with just enough mean-boy panache to raise your chuckle to a giggle.\n\n\n\tIf you like Christmas movies the way I do, you’ve seen the genre evolve, in a major way, over the last decade. It used to be that we got a handful of them each year in movie theaters. The small screen was reserved for what I thought of as Hallmark-type TV-movies, including the occasional kitsch Christmas cookie like “A Very Brady Christmas” (1988). But streaming changed all that. The small-screen Christmas movie is now an industry, with dozens of feel-good holiday entertainments coming out of the processor, almost all of them some combination of the following: wholesome, silly, romantic, artificial, fizzy, reverent, and too brightly lit, with the Christmas cheer poured on like eggnog spiked with even thicker eggnog.\n\t\n\n\tSo it says something that “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” feels like a disposable stocking stuffer even when compared to the G-rated Christmas-globe world of made-for-streaming holiday fare.\n\n\tThe movie casts the Jonas Brothers as genially stylized versions of themselves, and it sticks them in the middle of a “Can we make it home for Christmas?” plot that’s like “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” made on a streaming budget. As the movie opens, in London, Will Ferrell is taking his family to see the final night of the Jonas Brothers’ latest tour (the joke is that Ferrell loves the Jonases more than he does his own children). As they come offstage, we see that the three have been playing together for so long now (20 years!) that the thrill is kind of gone. They’re not teenage pop stars anymore. They’re grown men with families who’ve come to take their career, and each other, for granted.\n\n\tThat might be just what you’d expect. But Santa Claus (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), appearing incognito as a short-white-bearded eccentric who happens to be sitting next to Joe at a bar, gets an earful of Joe’s troubles and puts an instructional curse on the brothers: They will not be able to make it home for Christmas until they rediscover their bond and start appreciating each other again. Which they will do over the course of 80 minutes of haphazard road-trip-through-Europe adventure.    \n\n\tSome of “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” is standard holiday-special treacle, with all the dramatic richness of a fake fireplace log. But it’s broken up by musical numbers that go down easy, since a lot of them, as composed by Justin Tranter (and sung with sweet vibrance by the Jonases), come off like Michael Bublé heartwarmers. A few of them are staged with a wink; during a production number set in a train station, the brothers do a double take after the dancers perform a hands-under-the-knee homage to a move that became a meme from “Camp Rock.” And there’s a romance that wastes no time falling into cringe terrain: On the train, Joe, the swarthy womanizer of the group (he’s the only one who isn’t married with kids), just happens to run into…his old childhood crush (Chloe Bennet)! Who is now a thoracic heart surgeon! And has just broken up with someone!\n\t\n\n\tThe cringe factor almost works for the movie. Kevin, the one who has never left New Jersey, is the nerdish Ringo of the group, and he’s sitting on something he needs to tell the rest of them. We think he’s quitting the band, but it’s really just that he wants the chance to sing a lead vocal. And Nick, though he’s the youngest of the three brothers, acts like the oldest, organizing the tour details, redoing the set list, making it all happen…and no one appreciates him for this. “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” is a very white people problems movie.\n\n\tYet that’s all part of the mild guilty pleasure of it. The Jonas Brothers, in their straight-arrow Middle American dudes-with-purity-rings-all-grown-up way, are likable, in part because they’re always poking holes in each other’s egos. And the movie is willing to be daft and a bit loopy, as in the episode where they find themselves aboard a private plane and the pilot, after trying to take sexy selfies of himself, winds up knocked out cold on the floor, with the automatic-pilot mechanism turned off. It will take crash-landing in the snowy woods, and having to scream at a pack of wolves, to make the Jonas Brothers rediscover their love for each other.\n\n\tThey’re all quite comfortable in front of the camera, but to me the clear stand-out as an actor is Nick Jonas. What he has, that his brothers don’t, is the ability to hold an audience, curious and intrigued, even when he’s doing nothing — it’s just a vibe, a sense of things going on behind his lean, sly visage. I like the Jonas Brothers and hope they continue on, especially if they ever get it together to do another song like “Sucker,” their 2019 hit that’s the best track they ever recorded. (They perform it in concert during the closing credits.) But at this point, as “A Very Jonas Christmas Movie” more or less acknowledges, they’re an oldies act. The movie reaffirms their place in the pop firmament, but it also made me think: If they ever do start to get too old for this, Nick Jonas might have the big screen waiting for him.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Zucker, who directed the first two “Naked Gun” films, recently told “Woman’s World” he was not impressed by the reboot led by Liam Neeson and Pamela Anderson. He said the film “totally missed” the now-classic spoof style of comedy pioneered by Zucker, his brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams.\n\n\t“My brother, Jerry, and our partner, Jim Abrahams, started doing spoof comedies 50 years ago, and we originated our own style — and we did that so well that it looks easy, evidently,” Zucker explained. “People started copying it, like Seth MacFarlane for the new ‘Naked Gun.’ He totally missed it.”\n\t\n\n\tMacFarlane was one of the leading producers on the project and contributed “additional literary material,” according to IMDb. Lonely Island co-founder Akiva Schaffer directed the film and penned the script with Dan Gregor and Doug Mand.\n\n\n\tZucker also took issue with the production costs of the 2025 “Naked Gun.” The reboot carried a $42 million price tag, while Zucker’s 1988 original cost $14.5 million, according to AFI. However, when adjusted for inflation, $14.5 million comes out to roughly $38 million in 2025, which is not far off from the budget of the new “Naked Gun.”\n\n\t“You shouldn’t spend too much money on comedies, and one of our rules is about technical pizzazz,” Zucker said. “Big budgets and comedy are opposites, and in the new ‘Naked Gun,’ you could see that they spent a lot of money on scenes full of technical pizzazz while trying to copy our style.”\n\n\tThe “Airplane!” director added that he feels the new “Naked Gun” was made exclusively for financial reasons. Zucker asserted, “Everybody’s in it for the money now, and that feels like the only reason why they wanted to do a new ‘Naked Gun.'”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLionsgate is going with a smart awards strategy in hopes of becoming a dark horse Oscar contender.\n\n\tFrancis Lawrence’s “The Long Walk” will campaign its entire principal cast of boys — including Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson — in the supporting acting categories across all major awards bodies, Variety has learned exclusively.\n\n\tThe Lionsgate dystopian drama, adapted by JT Mollner from Stephen King’s early novel, hinges on the emotional dynamics among a group of teenage competitors forced to walk until only one remains. The filmmakers believe the film’s power lies not in traditional leads but in the collective experience — a choice they think is best reflected by submitting the ensemble together.\n\t\n\n\tThough Hoffman’s Raymond Garraty (No. 47) and Jonsson’s Peter McVries (No. 23) may appear to anchor the narrative, the film will place all nine boys in supporting categories across the Oscars, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, BAFTA and the Independent Spirit Awards. Judy Greer, who plays a pivotal adult figure in the story, will also be campaigned in supporting actress races.\n\n\tSubmitting the entire cast together highlights the filmmakers’ confidence in casting director Rich Delia, whose work stitching together a cohesive ensemble of emerging talent is expected to be a focal point of the campaign. The young actors deliver varied responses to the story’s brutal marathon.\n\n\tWith its ensemble-driven structure and bold category placements, “The Long Walk” joins the growing trend of awards hopefuls challenging traditional definitions of lead and supporting roles.\n\t\n\n\tAlong with the ensemble campaign, “The Long Walk” will compete in all major craft and above-the-line categories, including:\n\n\tBest Picture: Roy Lee, Steven Schneider, Francis Lawrence, Cameron MacConomy\n\n\tBest Director: Francis Lawrence\n\n\tAdapted Screenplay: Screenplay by JT Mollner\n\n\tSupporting Actor: Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson, Garrett Wareing, Tut Nyuot, Charlie Plummer, Ben Wang\n\n\tSupporting Actress: Judy Greer\n\n\tBest Casting: Rich Delia\n\n\tCinematography: Jo Willems\n\n\tCostume Design: Heather Neale\n\n\tFilm Editing: Mark Yoshikawa\n\n\tMakeup and Hairstyling: Doug Morrow, Zinka Tuminski\n\n\tProduction Design: Nicolas Lepage; Set Decoration by Scott Rossell\n\n\tSound: Supervising sound editors Jeremy Perison, Thomas Jones; production sound mixer Jeffrey Murias; re-recording mixers Jeremy Perison, Carlos Sanches\n\n\tOriginal Score: Jeremiah Fraites\n",

    "body": "\n\tGlen Powell is known for his confident charisma and star power, but early in his career, he found himself so starstruck by Dustin Hoffman that he bombed a script reading with the legendary actor.\n\n\tPowell recounted the humbling story during a recent appearance on “Hot Ones.” “My first week [in Hollywood], I found myself at a dinner sitting next to Dustin Hoffman,” he recalled. “He saw a movie I did called ‘The Great Debaters,’ and the fact that he saw this movie just blew my mind. I was like ‘This is the coolest moment of my entire life.'”\n\t\n\n\tHoffman complimented Powell on his acting and said, “I got something for you. Let’s keep in touch.” “The Graduate” actor followed through. “Literally a couple days later, I got a call at my house from Dustin Hoffman,” says Powell. “And I’m losing my mind. I’m like ‘This is the coolest thing,’ and [Hoffman’s] like ‘I’m gonna invite you to my office and I want you to read for something.'”\n\n\n\tPowell took up the invitation. He visited Hoffman and was presented with some pages to read with him, but the scene quickly turned sour. “I started reading them, but I was so in awe that Dustin Hoffman was sitting across from me,” said Powell. “He’s one of my favorite actors of all time. As I’m reading, I’m watching the life drain from his eyes, being like, ‘This guy sucks so bad.’ And I was like, ‘Oh no.'”\n\n\tThe situation progressed for the worse. “I’m watching him and I’m losing him,” continued Powell. “And then I’m being like, ‘Yeah, you’re losing him,’ and then I look back and I’m losing him even more. And I left so defeated.”\n\t\n\n\tPowell went on to explain that he was able to get over his starstruck tendencies in later auditions when he came to accept actors on all levels as players and performers in pursuit of something fun.\n\n\t“What you start to realize is that all this business is is play. You start looking at these guys as, like, legends, and then you start looking at them as collaborators who are just trying to make magic for audiences around the world, you know?” he said. “I think that’s the difference. I think the excitement of this business hasn’t worn off, but my perspective has.”  \n\n\tWhile Powell is yet to be in a movie alongside Hoffman, he became a recognizable face after sharing the screen with Tom Cruise in 2022’s “Top Gun: Maverick.” He has since starred in the hit romcom “Anyone But You” opposite Sydney Sweeney and the adventure summer blockbuster “Twisters.” He is currently starring in “The Running Man,” directed by Edgar Wright and adapted from a novel by Stephen King.\n\n\tWatch Powell’s full “Hot Ones” interview here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector S.S. Rajamouli has unveiled the title and first glimpse of his highly anticipated follow-up to the Academy Award-winning “RRR.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker revealed “Varanasi” at a launch event in Hyderabad, introducing the project that stars Telugu cinema superstar Mahesh Babu alongside Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Prithviraj Sukumaran.\n\n\tThe cool night skies above Ramoji Film City were rent with the roar of 50,000 full-throated Mahesh Babu fans chanting “Jai Babu, Jai Jai Babu,” as the title reveal event got off to a rousing start. \n\t\n\n\tActor-musician Shruti Haasan rendered the already immensely popular “Sanchaari” track from the film on stage, composed by M.M. Keeravani, Oscar-winner for “Naatu Naatu” from “RRR.” \n\n\n\tKeeravani also provided a musical introduction to the character of the main antagonist Kumbha, played by Sukumaran. Chopra Jonas plays a character named Mandakini. Mahesh Babu plays Rudhra. \n\n\tThe footage revealed was played on a giant LED screen, which took a couple of tries to get going, while the fans waited patiently. The film spans thousands of years, from ancient times to the modern day. One of the sequences is inspired by a chapter from Indian epic “Ramayana,” Rajamouli said. \n\n\t“I think that will be one of the most memorable sequences of my films,” Rajamouli said. \n\n\tChopra Jonas and Sukumaran also spoke during the occasion.\n\n\t“This is Indian cinema’s biggest brand, flexing his ambition and the team of technicians and actors going all out to make sure that he reaches that pinnacle he’s aiming for,” Sukumaran said. “This is S.S. Rajamouli once again, taking Indian cinema to the world, this time bigger, hopefully better and definitely more audacious than ever before.”\n\t\n\n\tChopra Jonas added: “Rajamouli-sir, all I will say is you are truly the visionary that has brought Indian cinema to the globe like no one else has before. So I thank you so much for choosing me as your Mandakini.” \n\n\tThe loudest cheers were reserved for Mahesh Babu who said: “I’ll make everyone proud. Most importantly, I’ll make my director the most proud. The whole of India will be proud of us.”\n\n\tThe project is being produced under the banner of Sri Durga Arts and Showing Business.\n\n\tWatch the first footage of “Varanasi” here: \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\n\t“The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” is ascendant in its sixth season, with each episode topping the last — the series has become must-watch live viewing. The Bravo show is on a years-long roll rarely seen on television. And arguably, that roll crystallized (to mix metaphors) in the show’s Season 4 finale, in which star Heather Gay unmasked fellow cast member Monica Garcia as an internet troll who’d harassed the women for years, providing the “Receipts! Proof! Timeline! Screenshots” that both rid them of Garcia, while also putting “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” in the Bravo Hall of Fame.\n\n\tThe BravoCon attendees have treated the women like royalty, and during Andy Cohen’s Nov. 13 taping of “Days of Our Wives” — in which veteran cast members from every city gathered on stage at Planet Hollywood — the “Salt Lake City” cast received the biggest roar from the crowd. Gay, who’s both an observer of Bravo and a star on the network, says, “it was incredible to feel that.”\n\n\tGay has written two bestselling books, 2023’s “Bad Mormon” and “Good Time Girl” the following year, in which she has continued publicly to reckon with having grown up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Her latest effort in that space is Bravo’s three-part docuseries “Surviving Mormonism,” which premiered on Bravo and Peacock on Nov. 11. In it, Gay uses the Leah Remini template from “Scientology and the Aftermath” to expose the abusive, corrupt practices within the Mormon church. She’s emotional as she does it; it’s personal to her. And in the end, she gives voice to her realization that she grew up in a cult.\n\n\tOn a lighter note! In recent episodes, Gay and her castmates merged with the “Below Deck: Down Under” crew for a yachting trip that was out of this world in every sense. But the trip culminated in a bizarre incident in Episode 9 (“Unicorn Overboard”) when Meredith Marks had some kind of freakout off-camera on the plane ride home. What led up to it is that Marks was angry, understandably so, that Britani Bateman had accused Seth Marks of having a mistress (she’d seen a TikTok?), and then claimed she was doing it for Marks’ own good. Well! That did not sit well with Marks, who allegedly began raging at Bateman at the airport and did not stop until they landed back in Salt Lake City many hours later. Bateman was so upset — nay, destroyed — according to the whole cast except for Marks, that she needed to be carried from the plane. Where the cameras were, and why no one pulled out their phones (that we know of), is a mystery for the ages.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBelow, from the pressroom at BravoCon, Gay addresses that question, delves into “Surviving Mormonism” and how difficult it was for her to call LDS a cult — and talks about why her new career in fiction-writing is a logical extension for her because as a Mormon, “you live in fiction.”\n\t\n\t\tI have to start with most recent episode of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.” I need to know everything. This is our Watergate.\t\n\n\tYep, absolutely. I understand.\n\n\t\n\t\tWe need to get to the bottom of it! In your words, what happened?\t\n\n\tI mean, what happened was everything I said in confessionals and in the show. And you’re going to see the aftermath of all that play out. But nothing more or less happened than what we all reported.\n\n\t\n\t\tWill it play out over the rest of the season?\t\n\n\tIt’s definitely wrangled with and worked out — not worked out! It’s definitely dealt with for the upcoming episodes. And I haven’t seen them, but I lived it, and I know what’s to come. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnd why did no one film it? Or record it?\t\n\n\tI mean, none of us thought to do it. \n\n\t\n\t\tEven Britani, who was recording things for no reason last season? \t\n\n\tI thought Britani maybe had. And maybe she did!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHuh.\t\n\n\tMaybe somebody did record it. We don’t know. There’s still a lot to be seen.\n\t\n\t\tDo you know, and you can’t say?\t\n\n\tI don’t know definitively. Honestly, I don’t know definitively.\n\t\n\t\tYou think someone recorded it!\t\n\n\tI think it’s going to be a really interesting rest of the season.\n\t\n\t\tAll right, all right. Seeing, or I guess hearing, Meredith in that state, what was that like? \t\n\n\tWell, I mean, she was upset. Seeing your friend upset — I’d never seen her up that upset before. And it felt like it was concerning, and it felt intense and it was dramatic. And it was, you know — heightened from what we’ve seen before.\n\t\n\t\tAnd your view is that Lisa was egging her on?\t\n\n\tI think Lisa was doing what she said: She was trying to support her friend, but you can’t support a friend when they are harassing someone! You know what I mean? I understand it, but it was a no-win situation for Lisa, and it could have gone better.\n\t\n\t\tDifferent topic! I loved “Surviving Mormonism.” How did it come about?\t\n\n\tWhen I wrote “Bad Mormon,” and saw the outpouring of support — and the resonance that the book had, and the community that really loved the book and rallied around me — I just wanted to further that experience and reach more people. I was really inspired by Leah Remini and her stuff on Scientology. I thought, I can use this pop culture platform in a way that’s really meaningful and important to me. \n\n\tA lot of times, reality television is trivialized, you know? But the platform and the reach is not. So it felt like an incredibly timely opportunity for me to use the platform in a way that would change lives and create space for people that I love dearly and have not had an opportunity to share their stories or be heard.\n\t\n\t\tYou come to the conclusion at the end in the third episode that you were raised in a cult. Can you talk about how you got there? \t\n\n\tI talk about how the word is so loaded, and so charged. And if it weren’t, it would be very easy for me to say that, because yes: The things that I did in the Temple and as a Mormon, confirmed to me that it is a cult. And that is very, very hard for me to say. And it’s something I’m still grappling with and working out, and redefining every day. \n\n\tAnd so I hate the word. I hate that it’s a lightning rod for defensiveness, and feels so attacking. But the truth is, it’s just a word. And if the word applies, by definition, to the situation, we should be able to use that word.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDid you waver on whether to come to that conclusion? \t\n\n\tYeah. I still waver right now.\n\t\n\t\tYes, I can actually see that as you talk about it.\t\n\n\tIt’s still very dear to me. It’s also the culture I live in, and my history and my life and my story and my identity. I don’t want to diminish who I am and what I’ve become. But saying that feels like I am.\n\t\n\t\tFrom the Us Weekly cover on down, “The Real Housewives Salt Lake City” is getting all of the praise. I’m sure you noticed at the “Watch What Happens Live” taping last night, with all the casts from all the cities, that you guys got more applause than any other show.\t\n\n\tI mean, it was incredible to feel that — and they were chanting Mary’s name. It was incredible, yeah.\n\t\n\t\tWhy do you think it is? \t\n\n\tI think because we’re all each other has, and we are in it together. And I think that we have a lot of fun together. And we have a lot of natural conflict, and that makes for magic.\n\t\n\t\tOther shows have fallen apart because the cast fights so viciously that they end up not being able to be in a room together. Like, for real — and that’s the end of the show. How do you look at someone in the face who’s said — or that you’ve said to them — terrible things, and move on? Let’s take the boat fight with Lisa Barlow….\t\n\n\tWe give each other a lot of grace, and we are growing and learning together. And as corny as that sounds, we push it to the limit. And I don’t want to wax philosophical, but like a lot of us are women that were never allowed to push anything to the limit. And so in this space with each other, we can. We make a lot of mistakes, and we push it too far. But I think that because of that, we give each other grace to retract and heal and be better.\n\t\n\t\tWhere are you and Lisa now?\t\n\n\tI consider Lisa a friend. Absolutely. And that doesn’t mean we’re not going to have continued hard conversations.  We’re not perfect friends. I’m not perfect, I’m a shitty friend, too!\n\t\n\t\tI mean, she’s getting the villain edit this season. \t\n\n\tIf she wants it to go differently, she can act differently. It’s pretty simple, you know? There’s a lot of range there. She can pivot.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of the villain edit: Jen Shah will be released from prison at some point. Would she ever be allowed to come back to the show?\t\n\n\tI mean, Andy said he never wanted to see her again, so he kind of answered that for all of us.\n\t\n\t\tThank God! So in terms of using your platform for good, what else do you have going on?\t\n\n\tI currently have a four-novella book deal with Podium Entertainment, and going straight to audiobooks. They’re all fiction. They’re all, like, 30,000 words. And I love it. I have a romantic thriller with Simon & Schuster right now that I’m working on; I’m currently doing the NBC football sports thing. And I’m working on a scripted version of “Bad Mormon.”\n\n\t\n\t\tHad you always written fiction?\t\n\n\tNo, but I was a Mormon, and you live in fiction. You know? It’s like building your life around Harry Potter. And I really think that by fictionalizing it, I can break through a lot of these internal barriers that keep me from being the writer I want to be. Because I just don’t want to be vulgar, I don’t want to be crass, I don’t want to be too sexual, I don’t want to be too dirty. It’s going to be an experiment.\n\n\tBut I love writing, and it’s what I want to do.\n\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLongtime “Grey’s Anatomy” star James Pickens Jr. says he’s been diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\n\t“It’s not the kind of news anyone wants to hear, but to be honest, prostate cancer has run through my family,” Pickens said in an interview with Black Health Matters. “My father had it. He had a lot of brothers; several of them had it. I would have been surprised if I hadn’t gotten it.”\n\n\n\tLuckily, Pickens has never known anyone who died from the disease. \n\t\n\n\t“I’ve got a 90-year-old first cousin, who’s still alive, actually; he had it,” he explained. “His son has it. A couple of his brothers had it. No one, as far as I know, has succumbed to it.”\n\n\tPickens has starred as Dr. Richard Webber across all 22 seasons of “Grey’s Anatomy.” His other TV credits include “The Conners,” “Roseanne” and “The X-Files.”\n\n\tAfter getting a routine PSA test (prostate-specific antigen), Pickens’ doctor sent him to get an MRI, which revealed “something suspicious.” A biopsy was then conducted, which revealed the tumor. It had not spread and was promptly removed.\n\n\t“We caught it really early, and so they thought that would be the best route to take,” Pickens said. “I do have a rare variant that you don’t see very often. They wanted to err on the side of caution and keep an eye on it. It was rare enough that they wanted to make sure that they were crossing all the T’s and dotting all their I’s. But they hadn’t seen one that was detected as early as mine.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHold onto your oil rigs: “Landman” is back for a second season!\n\n\tThe first season of the Taylor Sheridan drama, which he created with “Boomtown” host Christian Wallace, introduced the world to Tommy Norris, the titular landman played by Billy Bob Thornton. Tommy works for oil company M-Tex, keeping drilling operations moving along — despite constant danger in the oil fields, trouble from the cartels and legal woes. Along the way, we get to know his family — ex-wife Angela (Ali Larter), son Cooper (Jacob Lofland) and daughter Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) — and the economics of the oil biz, from the treacherous West Texas fields to the cutthroat boardrooms. Family matters will take center stage in this second season, as we finally meet Tommy’s father T.L., played by Sam Elliott.\n\t\n\n\tVariety spoke with several members of the cast before the Nov. 16 Season 2 premiere on Paramount+ to answer burning questions about the show’s biggest changes, relationship shifts and that viral moment from Season 1 that shocked the internet.\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat challenges will Tommy face in Season 2?\t\n\n\t“You’re going to see who he really is at the end of the day,” Thornton says. “He’s so busy in Season 1 that there wasn’t much time to take a breath. There are some very human moments in the first season, but this has more. You’re going to see how he deals with family, business, his own mortality, just everything: All the thoughts that go through all humans, and things that you have to go through. First season, Taylor had to set the show up and explain the oil business to the audience. He had to introduce all the characters. Now, you can settle back and really get to know everybody, the family relationships as well as business relationships and the dangerous relationships, all of it.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat will Angela’s journey look like this season?\t\n\n\t“The first season of our show set up oil and the danger and cost to all the families,” Larter says. “The second season, Taylor wrote it about the family. What you realize is that we’re the heartbeat of the show and everything goes around that. With Angela, you go from these dinner scenes, which is how she shows her love and she puts pressure on it. She does it the best she can because she wants everyone to feel it so hard. Then there’s the antics: Tommy is always is going to do something that sets her off. But where we’re going is that we sit on the floor together and the question is, ‘Who are we if we don’t do this? Do we have a real chance at this working?’ Taylor also wrote some really beautiful scenes of connection between Tommy and Angela.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBilly Bob Thornton as Tommy Norris and Ali Larter as Angela Norris in “Landman.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmerson Miller/Paramount+\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow will Ainsley’s role change this season?\t\n\n\t“We meet her when she’s 17 and we are seeing her in her most formative years,” Randolph says. “We are watching her figure out who she is. She has come to the realization that her parents aren’t always perfect. They don’t always know everything. We get to see Ainsley figure out her own identity, her independence, navigate attention, figure out how she wants to be seen in the world. I find that extremely fulfilling as an actress, because I get to grow with her, and I’m not playing a fully-formed person yet. So I get to throw in these little hints of realizations in these scenes. I look through the scripts to try to find those moments as much as possible, so that I can foreshadow her growing up.”\n\t\n\t\tIs the cast already talking about next season, even though it hasn’t even been confirmed yet?\t\n\n\t“I’m looking past Season 2 already,” Elliott says. “We’re here talking about Season 2, but it’s all been done. I’m thinking about what’s to come, and I’m excited about what’s to come. The audience is excited about what’s to come right now. I’m excited about what’s to come next season that we haven’t even done yet. Just having the opportunity to work with all of these cast members, it’s that and the fact that we’ve got this incredible crew — a lot of them are people I worked with before on ‘1883.’ I love going back to Texas and working. There are just so many positive elements to this thing, and it makes it a joy to go to work.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s Billy Bob Thornton’s all-time favorite Tommy moment?\t\n\n\t“There are so many of them, it’s hard to remember,” Thornton says. “But I think one of my favorite moments is when Ainsley, we’re at the football game and she’s got the boyfriend there. I’m, of course, a father to a 21-year-old daughter in college right now. So when I hear her say some of these things to me, you don’t have to act much. You just react to it. [Editor’s note: This scene is from the pilot, when Ainsley tells her father about her sex life with her boyfriend, noting that, “As long as he never comes in me, he can come anywhere on me.” Needless to say, this moment went viral.] Plus, Michelle’s as sweet as pie. When we hear that come out of her mouth sometimes… But one way or the other, she’s telling me what she will or will not let the boyfriend do, which I don’t want to hear anything about any of it. And I think maybe my best quote was a stare, and all I can think of to say is, ‘I’m going to go get a Dr. Pepper — you want anything?’ Because I can’t even let myself think right then, you know?”\n\t\n\t\tHow did Michelle Randolph survive shooting that now-viral scene?\t\n\n\t“We filmed so out of order because we had all 10 episodes, so that was midway through the season,” Randolph says. “That day was freezing cold. There was a whole storm. We had 10 minutes to get that shot, and there was a whole group of people behind us in the bleachers. All I could think is these people are hearing this dialogue, and none of them know what this show is about. So I was just honestly kind of mortified as myself, saying these lines out loud to these people. Billy had it easy because all he had to do was walk away, I’d say.”\n\t\n\t\tDoes Sam Elliott do anything to take care of his signature voice?\t\n\n\tNo! “It’s all natural,” he says.\n\n\tWatch the “Landman” Season 2 trailer below.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Landman” airs on Sundays on Paramount+. This interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOne couple was changed for good during “Dancing With the Stars” Wicked Night.\n\n\tThe Oct. 21 episode welcomed director John M. Chu as the guest judge as pairs danced to hit songs from “Wicked” — with some taking on Elphaba and some taking Glinda.\n\n\tThis week’s scores were combined with last week’s dedication night. Last week, Carrie Ann Inaba recieved a bit of backlash for her criticism on certain pairs, but this week, she gave the first 10 of the season. The score came for Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas’ quickstep. The other judges, with the exception of Derek Hough who went with a 9, agreed with Inaba. At the end of the night, Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sousa also received three 10s and one nine — Hough is saving his 10 paddle — for their stunning rumba.\n\t\n\n\tHough pointed out after Andy Richter and Emma Slater’s jazz routine that it’s the last week, “so we’ll see,” and ultimately gave him a 6. The other judges, however, were more impressed, with the rest giving him 7s.\n\n\n\tLast week, Inaba told Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov that their dances were starting to look the same. This week, she applauded Fishel’s courage and said this was her breakthrough dance. Bruno Tonioli said it was “the most difficult song to choregraph” and Hough complimented the difficulty of the routine, calling it “magnificent.” The scores of four 9s gave them a huge boost on the leaderboard. \n\n\tBut it was Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten’s contemporary routine to “Defying Gravity” that left everyone (including Bersten) in tears and on their feet. “I am 54, I am injured and I just did that,” she said after the dance through tears. She landed four 9s for the powerful routine.\n\t\n\n\tAfter all the dances and the scores combined from the last two weeks, Richter remained on the bottom of the leaderboard, with Leavitt returning to the top. Once the votes were added in — the show hit 100 million votes over the last two weeks —  Scott Hoying was sent home.\n\n\tHere’s a full list of scores from Wicked Night:\n\n\tScott Hoying and partner Rylee ArnoldDance: Contemporary to “The Wizard And I”Score: 28/40\n\n\tAlix Earle and partner Val ChmerkovskiyDance: Jazz to “What Is This Feeling?”Score: 35/40\n\n\tRobert Irwin and partner Witney CarsonDance: Jazz to “Dancing Through Life”Score: 36/40\n\n\tWhitney Leavitt and partner Mark BallasDance: Quickstep to “Popular”Score: 39/40\n\n\tDylan Efron and partner Daniella KaragachDance: Rumba to “I’m Not That Girl”Score: 32/40\n\n\tAndy Richter and partner Emma SlaterDance: Jazz to “One Short Day”Score: 27/40\n\n\tElaine Hendrix and partner Alan BerstenDance: Contemporary to “Defying Gravity ”Score: 36/40\n\n\tJen Affleck and partner Jan RavnikDance: Foxtrot to “As Long as You’re Mine”Score: 32/40\n\n\tDanielle Fishel and partner Pasha PashkovDance: Argentine Tango to “No Good Deed”Score: 36/40\n\n\tJordan Chiles and partner Ezra SosaDance: Rumba to “For Good”Score: 39/40\n\n\tThe next “Dancing With the Stars” episode will be Halloween night, airing Oct. 28 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC and Disney+, streaming the next day on Hulu.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKevin O’Leary delivered one of his first promotional plugs for A24’s “Marty Supreme” in typically business-minded fashion. The investor and “Shark Tank” host, who gives his debut feature film acting performance in the upcoming Timothée Chalamet vehicle, suggested that movies like his own could “save millions of dollars” by replacing background actors with AI-generated stand-ins.\n\n\tIn an interview on the Oct. 16 episode of The Hill’s “World of Travel: The Podcast,” O’Leary discussed his own investments in AI and used “Marty Supreme” as an example to discuss the technology’s potential implementation in the film industry.\n\t\n\n\t“Almost every scene had as many as 150 extras. Now, those people have to stay awake for 18 hours, be completely dressed in the background. [They’re] not necessarily in the movie, but they’re necessary to be there moving around. And yet, it costs millions of dollars to do that,” O’Leary said. “Why couldn’t you simply put AI agents in their place? Because they’re not the main actors. They’re only in the story visually. [You could] save millions of dollars, so more movies could be made. The same director, instead of spending $90 million or whatever he spent, could’ve spent $35 million and made two movies.”\n\n\n\tO’Leary also brought up the topic of Tilly Norwood, an AI “actress” unveiled via a comedic sketch at the Zurich Summit in September, with claims that Hollywood agencies were seeking to sign it. SAG-AFTRA swiftly issued a statement condemning the nascent product, saying it is “jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”\n\t\n\n\tIn his comments to The Hill, O’Leary erroneously referred to Tilly Norwood as “Tilly Norwell.”\n\n\t“She’s 100% AI. She doesn’t exist. But she’s a great actress. She can come in any age you want. She doesn’t need to eat, so she works 24 hours a day. The union is going out of their mind,” O’Leary said.\n\n\tO’Leary continued by bringing up The Velvet Sundown, a moniker that releases AI-generated music. Again, O’Leary made an erroneous reference, calling the fictitious band “Velvet Sunset.”\n\n\t“Velvet Sunset is a band that’s on the top 10% of all downloads right now. And it’s complete BS. They don’t exist. It’s just AI music,” O’Leary continued. “It’s coming. You can’t stop the advancement of technology, so I’m spending a lot of time investing.”\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” carries a production budget north of $60 million, making it A24’s most expensive feature ever. The film is a 1950s period piece that stars Chalamet as a rising, unshakably ambitious ping-pong prodigy. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his love interest, while O’Leary plays the husband to Paltrow’s character. It releases in theaters on Christmas Day.\n\n\t“I’d argue, for the sake of the art, you should allow [AI] in certain cases. An extra is a really good case, because you can’t tell the difference,” O’Leary continued. “You just put 100 Norwell Tillies in there and you’re good.”\n\n\tO’Leary also noted that he is using AI to make a facsimile of himself, and that he is seeking full citizenship in the United Arab Emirates as the industry grows abroad.\n\n\t“We’ve got AI Kevin now and we did it in Abu Dhabi. I’m going back there in a couple weeks. I’m going to train the model even more,” O’Leary said. “The challenges with AI is most people can distinguish now between what’s fake and what’s real, because of the voice. But there’s another iteration of the model coming in about a week — that’s how fast it’s advancing. This next AI Kevin, you will not be able to tell the difference.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore Ben Stiller made his mark on film, television and comedy, his parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, were an unstoppably uproarious duo. Over a joint career that spanned five decades, Stiller and Meara collaborated on several television shows, TV specials and recordings, making America laugh up until their respective deaths in 2020 and 2015. Now, Ben Stiller is further cementing their legacy by donating their career archive to the National Comedy Center ahead of the release of his documentary film “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” on Apple TV.\n\t\n\n\tStiller and Meara curated the archive themselves, preserving public and personal artifacts from their long careers and private lives. It contains artifacts from early improv sessions at Chicago’s Compass Players, love letters that they exchanged while dating, and handwritten drafts of iconic sketches that made it onto world famous stages, among them “The Ed Sullivan Show,” “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” and “The Carol Burnett Show.”\n\n\n\t“Knowing my parents’ body of work is preserved at the National Comedy Center means a great deal, because the material they left behind was not just a gift for my family, but for anyone who wants to understand comedy as a creative process,” Stiller said of the donation. “They would have been very proud to know that the National Comedy Center is bringing their archive to life in a way that can inspire and educate future generations.”\n\n\tHead of the National Comedy Center’s archive Dr. Laura LaPlaca adds, “Stiller and Meara’s archive contains tens of thousands of pages spanning a remarkable body of work. Their comedy was crafted to feel organic, but they were serial editors – sometimes carrying a single sketch across decades of iteration and refinement.”\n\t\n\n\tThe donation comes in tandem with the release of “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost.” Directed and produced by Ben Stiller, the doc chronicles his parent’s personal, professional and creative partnership and the lasting impact they had on American comedy. The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on Oct. 5 and releases on Apple TV on Oct. 26.\n\n\tSelect pieces of the Stiller & Meara archive will be on display at the National Comedy Center’s facility in Jamestown, N.Y.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMariska Hargitay appeared on Amy Poehler’s “Good Hang” podcast and revealed she auditioned and screen tested many times for “Friends” a few years before landing the role of Olivia Benson on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” Both shows are NBC staples.\n\n\t“I did a lot of comedy auditions,” Hargitay told Poehler (via The Daily Beast). “I did ‘Seinfeld’ and I did ‘Single Guy,’ and I tested for ‘Friends’ so many times. I think for Monica. I always thought I would end up being on a sitcom or doing comedy.” \n\t\n\n\tEven when more dramatic roles came her way, Hargitay said: “I was like, I want to do drama but it has to be funny because that’s what I felt like my gifts were… [I would tell people], ‘I’m going to be a comedian because I’m funny and I’m pretty.’”\n\n\n\tHargitay’s reveal may surprise some. The actor has been playing Olivia Benson on “SVU” for more than 25 years, which makes her the longest-running character in live-action primetime TV history. It wasn’t until Hargitay consulted with a psychic that she was confronted with the possibility that comedy might not work out.\n\n\t“I’m in L.A., [a] struggling actor [wondering] what am I going to do?” Hargitay said. “I came to New York, which I did three times a year to see theater. And then I met with this psychic. Everyone said to me, ‘Oh my gosh, Mariska, you have to meet with this psychic. He’s amazing.’ … I drove out somewhere on Long Island to this man and I went there and he started saying all this amazing stuff to me.”\n\n\t“I was listening to him really intently like this. He said to me… ‘You see that face you’re doing right now? You see that face?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ He goes, ‘You’re going to be famous for that face. You’re moving to New York and you’re gonna be famous for that face,’” Hargitay continued, noting she still wanted to land a network sitcom role at the time. “I said, ‘Uh, no.’ I live in L.A. and I’m going to be a comedian. Six months later, swear to God… I got ‘SVU.’”\n\t\n\n\tWatch Hargitay’s full interview on the “Good Hang” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Tokyo International Film Festival has revealed that veteran Japanese director Yamada Yoji will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at its 38th edition, recognizing a career spanning more than 60 years and 91 films.\n\n\tYamada’s latest work, “Tokyo Taxi,” starring Baisho Chieko and Kimura Takuya, based on the 2023 French film “Driving Madeleine,” will screen as this year’s TIFF Centerpiece and receive theatrical release on Nov. 21. The director will also participate in a talk session with “Kokuho” director Lee Sang-il at the TIFF Lounge.\n\t\n\n\tAs previously announced, legendary Japanese actor Yoshinaga Sayuri will also be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award. \n\n\n\tSince his 1961 directorial debut with “Nikai no tanin,” Yamada has created films deeply rooted in Japanese culture and everyday life. His most celebrated work remains the “Tora-san” series (“Tora-san, Our Lovable Tramp”), which ran to 50 films beginning in 1969 and earned Guinness World Records recognition. \n\n\tThe director shifted to period films in the 2000s with significant international success. “The Twilight Samurai” (2002) swept 15 categories at the Japan Academy Film Prizes and earned an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film, as the category was known then. “The Hidden Blade” (2004) competed at Berlin and won top honors at the Zimbabwe International Film Festival, while “The Little House” (2014) took home the Silver Bear at the Berlinale.\n\n\tYamada’s recent work includes “Tora-san, Wish You Were Here” (2019), which marked the series’ 50th anniversary, followed by “It’s A Flickering Life” (2021) and “Mom, Is That You?!” (2023).\n\t\n\n\t“Yamada Yoji has long observed the realities of Japanese society with a discerning yet compassionate eye, crystallizing them into numerous cinematic masterpieces over the decades,” said TIFF chair Ando Hiroyasu in a statement. He noted Yamada’s support of the festival since its inception and his recent service as chair of the Kurosawa Akira Award Jury.\n\n\tThe director’s honors include Japan’s Order of Culture (2012), recognition as a Person of Cultural Merit (2004), and designation as an Honorary Citizen of Tokyo (2014).\n\n\tThe 38th Tokyo International Film Festival runs Oct. 27-Nov. 5 in the Hibiya-Yurakucho-Marunouchi-Ginza area.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn the wake of the Trump administration’s defunding of public broadcasting, local stations PBS SoCal (KOCE and KCET) are planning a telethon next week from the PBS outfit’s Burbank Studios home. “We ❤ Public Television!” is billed as a live, three hour telethon “honoring 55 remarkable years of public television – America’s trusted, free public media service that reaches every city, town and rural community across the nation.​.. This program celebrates the extraordinary musical artists and personalities who have graced PBS stages and screens, showcasing the cultural richness that public media and local PBS stations offer all Americans.”\n\t\n\n\tSet to take place on Saturday, Nov, 8 at 4 p.m. PT, Rickey Minor will serve as music director for the telecast. Guests right now are scheduled to include Josh Groban, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ken Burns, Ziggy Marley, Lily Tomlin, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Marlee Matlin, Nicholas Ralph, Noel Paul Stookey, Rick Steves, David Foster and Katharine McPhee, Adam Arkin, Courtney Vance, Martha Plimpton, Joe Bonamassa, Sheléa, Jesse Cook, Judy Blume, Celtic Woman, Sarah Silverman, Mychal the Librarian, Lindsey Stirling and more. \n\n\n\tThe telethon will also feature performances from Nashville PBS including Kathy Mattea, Sierra Hull, Molly Tuttle and Ketch Secor.  \n\n\tAfter its initial broadcast on PBS SoCal, “We ❤ Public Television” will air on PBS stations across the country on Thursday, Nov. 27 (Thanksgiving night).

    "body": "\n\tFreestyle Digital Media has acquired the North American rights to “Yes Repeat No,” a drama exploring Israeli-Palestinian identity. The film releases Nov. 11 on North American VOD platforms and DVD. \n\n\t“Yes Repeat No” follows the story of three actors who are auditioning to play Juliano Mer-Khamis, a Palestinian-Jewish actor and activist who was assassinated in 2011 on the steps of the theater he founded in Jenin. Born to an anti-Zionist Jewish mother and a Palestinian Christian Communist father, Mer-Khamis became an internationally acclaimed actor who appeared in films including “The Little Drummer Girl” and “Miral,” and later began a career as a director, theater founder and a political activist.\n\t\n\n\t“Yes Repeat No” stars Salome Azizi (“The Director”), Mousa Kraish (“Arab Juliano”), Adam Meir (“Public Juliano”), and Karim Saleh (“Israeli Juliano”).\n\n\n\t“Because we made this film before October 7th, we could examine our collective, fraught history with nuance and compassion, without clinging to ‘sides.’ We want to build bridges rather than fan flames, and to challenge our viewers’ understanding of the conflict,” said filmmaker Michael Dahan. “By weaving direct quotes from Palestinian, Israeli, Arab and American leaders throughout the dialogue the film reveals how the meaning of words spoken by political figures such as Arafat, Netanyahu, and others have shifted over time. In a time of conflict, ‘Yes Repeat No’ insists on imagining a better future and encourages its audience to feel more understood and less alone.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film is written and directed by Dahan, who also serves as the film’s producer alongside N. Braxton Pope and Sarah Szalavitz.  \n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Yes Repeat No” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Sinners” is determined to bring the blues to the Oscars.\n\n\tWarner Bros. has officially submitted two original songs from Ryan Coogler’s genre-defying “Sinners” for consideration in the original song category at the Oscars, Variety has learned exclusively.\n\n\tThe first track, “I Lied to You,” is written by Raphael Saadiq and Ludwig Göransson and performed by rising star Miles Caton. The second, “Last Time (I Seen the Sun),” is a soulful duet performed by Alice Smith and Caton and co-written by Smith, Caton and Göransson.\n\t\n\n\tWhile it’s still early in Oscar season, many awards prognosticators expect one — or both — of the submissions to make the Academy’s shortlist of 15 original songs, expected in mid-December. From there, five will be nominated, as selected by the Academy’s music branch.\n\n\n\tUnder Academy rules, a film may submit up to three original songs for consideration. While all three may be shortlisted, only two can ultimately receive nominations. For “Sinners,” the creative team and strategists have opted not to over-submit — a move that comes with both risks and rewards. Consider the case of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” which successfully submitted three songs: the Oscar-winning “What Was I Made For?” by Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell, the also-nominated “I’m Just Ken” and Dua Lipa’s “Dance the Night.” All three made the shortlist, but Lipa’s track did not make the final five nominations.\n\n\t“Sinners” is widely regarded as Coogler’s most personal film to date — a sweeping narrative that weaves together Black history, the migrant experience and the director’s own lineage into a powerful cinematic tapestry. Written and directed by Coogler, the film’s ambition has been embraced by both critics and audiences.\n\t\n\n\tCaton, who stars as young preacher Sammie Moore — a.k.a. “Preacherboy” — is considered a strong contender in the supporting actor category, alongside co-stars Delroy Lindo and Jack O’Connell. With the addition of a songwriting credit, Caton could follow a rare Oscars pathway of earning nominations in both acting and original song. Only four people have ever achieved that feat: Leslie Odom Jr. with “One Night in Miami” (2020) and “Speak Now,” Mary J. Blige with “Mudbound” (2017) and “Mighty River,” Lady Gaga with “A Star Is Born” (2018) and “Shallow,” and Cynthia Erivo with “Harriet” (2019) and “Stand Up.” Gaga remains the only winner for original song among them.\n\n\tThe ensemble cast also includes Michael B. Jordan, Hailee Steinfeld, Wunmi Mosaku, Li Jun Li, Omar Miller, Jayme Lawson and blues legend Buddy Guy.\n\n\tOn the technical side, “Sinners” boasts an Oscar-winning team behind the scenes. Two-time Academy Award winner Göransson — honored for “Black Panther” and “Oppenheimer” — is also a contender for original score. A third win in the category would place him among legends such as Maurice Jarre and Max Steiner — and make him the only composer to achieve three wins from just three nominations in that category. Göransson was also previously nominated in original song for the chart-topper “Lift Me Up” from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” which he co-wrote with Coogler and Rihanna.\n\n\tThe film could also make history in several crafts categories. Production designer Hannah Beachler, the first Black person to win her category (for “Black Panther”), is again in the conversation, as is two-time costume design winner Ruth E. Carter — currently the only Black woman to win multiple Oscars. Another milestone looms for cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw, who could become just the fourth woman ever nominated in the category — following Rachel Morrison (“Mudbound”), Ari Wegner (“The Power of the Dog”) and Mandy Walker (“Elvis”) — and potentially the first to win.\n\n\tThe studio will submit “Sinners” in all major Oscar categories, including best picture (Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian and Ryan Coogler), original screenplay and directing for Coogler — who, notably, would be vying for a spot in two categories that remain stubbornly underrepresented. Only one Black filmmaker — Jordan Peele for “Get Out” — has ever won for original screenplay, and no Black director has ever taken home the directing Oscar in the Academy’s 98-year history.\n\t\n\n\tThe song submissions add to the growing momentum for “Sinners,” which has been steadily building awards buzz since its premiere in April. The film recently received the Ensemble Tribute at the Gotham Awards, and Coogler was named the recipient of the Director Award at the Critics Choice Association’s Celebration of Black Cinema & Television. Jordan will be honored with the American Cinematheque Award on Nov. 21, followed by a career tribute at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in February.\n\n\tIf “Sinners” makes good on its campaign promise, it could make Oscars history.\n\n\tThe full list of “Sinners” submissions is below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSINNERS, Michael B.

    "body": "\n\tJoe Hill‘s ambitious new novel — the 900-page killer dragon epic “King Sorrow” — is inspired by love.\n\n\t“I knew it was going to be the first book I was going to dedicate to my wife,” Hill says. “I think I wanted to impress her, and you know the trouble a man can get into when he tries to impress his best girl. So I began piling everything into it that I thought Gillian would love, and it would be fun to read.”\n\n\n\tWhile the novel is a present to Hill’s wife, the editor and publisher Gillian Redfearn, his fans are in for a big adventure as well, as “King Sorrow” hits bookstores today from William Morrow. In the novel, six friends must make sacrifices through the years for the titular dragon after they call upon it for protection. From there, Hill dips into several different modes of storytelling.\n\t\n\n\t“You have one part of the story which is a mini-air disaster novel set on a 747 flying from New York to London, and there’s a dragon outside the porthole window off in the thunderclouds,” Hill says. “Another part of the book is an ‘Indiana Jones’-style plunge into a troll’s trap-filled cave. At one point, a couple of people are kidnapped by a for-profit paramilitary organization, and they’re forced to tell everything they know about the dragon, King Sorrow. There’s a desperate attempt to rescue survivors from a collapsed building. There’s a drunken brawl on roller skates. I just kept piling it on because there seemed to be so much story there.”\n\n\tThe book’s release is coming as “Black Phone 2,” the sequel to the film based on Hill’s short story “The Black Phone,” sits at the top of the box office. While that movie is perfect spooky season fodder thanks to Ethan Hawke’s portrayal of the villainous Grabber, Hill was inspired to write his newest book because he loved his scaly antagonist.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m a guy who thinks Smaug from ‘The Hobbit’ is my favorite fictional character,” Hill says. “I think I like Smaug even more than Sherlock Holmes. I also think that a lot of times horror novels are only as good as their antagonist. So having a really great 4,000-ton, 70-foot-dragon with a nasty sense of humor feels like a stable thing to build a book around.”\n\n\tAlong with the plot inspiration, Hill amps up his prose, making for a distinctly cinematic reading experience.\n\n\t“For something on the scale of ‘King Sorrow,’ the language has to be fairly lean, mean, clean and direct,” he says. “You want elegance, but you also want zip.”\n\n\tBetween the plotting, pace and Hollywood’s love of adapting Hill’s work, it’s easy to imagine a deep-pocketed streamer taking on “King Sorrow” as a limited series. Luckily, he’s been pleased with the other interpretations of his work.\n\n\t“I’ve been really lucky because no one’s made an out-and-out stinker,” Hill says. “All the adaptations that have been made of my work, I have generally thought they were pretty fun, and I found things to admire in them. I love when someone reads something and says, ‘Oh, this is fun. I want to do this as a TV series,’ or ‘I want to do this as a film or comic book.’ Then you get to see what they found interesting in it, and how they take that and make it their own, make it personal, expand upon what elements of the books they always wanted to explore more.”\n\n\tOf course, Hill has the unique vantage of seeing decades of his father Stephen King‘s work adapted in ways ranging from brilliant (“Stand By Me”) to noxious (“Thinner”).\n\n\t“When the adaptations are really successful, it’s because they’ve captured something about his voice and his unique view of an artist in the world we live in,” Hill says. “The relationships between men with other men and women with their society and married couples. When you hear the characters talk, it’s like reading the dialogue in the book. It has that sound, that music which is unique to my dad’s work.”\n\n\tDespite coming from a legendarily spooky family, leading the box office with a supernatural killer and touting a book with a deadly dragon, Hill says that his home will not be decked out with seasonal Halloween gear — for good reason.\n\n\t“I wish I could tell you the house is draped in cobwebs, and the ‘Addams Family’ music is echoing through the halls, and kids creep up to the front door to get candy and the door swings open of its own volition and I lurch forward out of the dark in fright makeup, and they run screaming before they can get their candy,” Hill says. “That would be terrific, but it’s not like that at all, and here’s why: Because I’ve been writing horror fiction for 20 years now, and Halloween is when I have to work. I’m like Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, so I’m not doing trick-or-treating or diving into the pleasures of the season. I’m usually out there with a book or a film or a TV show or something, trying to find subtle, clever, charming ways to say, ‘Buy my stuff.'”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

CBP agents entered the El Paso residence with consent from the homeowner. While they were inside, the owner's dog, named Chop, \"aggressively charged [at] the agent\" and \"fearing for his safety, the officer discharged their firearm.\" DHS says its is currently reviewing the matter.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Through his attorney, Chop's owner, Seth Daw, says he's absolutely heartbroken over the sudden death of the family's 7-year-old Rottweiler because he believes the killing was \"senseless, cruel, and entirely avoidable.\"\n      \n    \n          The attorney, Marisa Ong, says \"Border Patrol agents entered a private home under the pretense of an investigation, took advantage of the homeowner's cooperation, and shot a restrained, non-threatening dog.\"\n      \n    \n          Ong also claims Seth warned the Border Patrol agent about Chop, and the agent put the canine in the bathroom for its own safety while the feds searched the rest of the home.\n      \n    \n          But, Ong says, Border Patrol dismissed the warning and opened the bathroom door, letting Chop out to get shot by the agent. CBP agents reportedly visited Seth's house after they received a tip about the home's previous owner.\n      \n    \n          Seth is now gearing up to file a lawsuit against the federal government over the death of poor ol' Chop.

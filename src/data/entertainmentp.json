    "body": "\n\tThe series adaptation of the Carl Hiaasen novel “Skinny Dip” is on the move — with a major star attached. \n\n\tVariety has learned that the project is now in development at Amazon Prime Video with Amanda Seyfried attached to play the lead role. It was previously reported that a series take on the novel was in the works at HBO Max (then just Max), though no actors were attached at that time. \n\n\n\tAdam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis remain onboard as writers and executive producers, with Bill Lawrence also still executive producing via Doozer. Seyfried will executive produce in addition to starring, with Jeff Ingold and Liza Katzer of Doozer executive producing along with Hiaasen. Warner Bros. Television, where Doozer is under an overall deal, is the studio. \n\t\n\n\tThe logline for the one-hour dramedy states that it tells the story of Joey Perrone (Seyfried), “whose second anniversary didn’t go quite as planned. She expected earrings, but instead, her husband Chaz had, shall we say, alternate plans. After unexpectedly finding herself on the other side of those plans, she vows to get revenge. Teaming up with a disgraced ex-cop, Joey sets out to make Chaz pay.” \n\n\tSeyfried has established herself as one of the most popular actresses of her time across film and television. After early breakout success in films like “Mean Girls,” she has gone on to star in films like “Mank,” which earned her both an Academy Award and Golden Globe nomination. Her other film roles include the “Mamma Mia!” movies, “Les Misérables,” and “In Time.” She won both an Emmy and Golden Globe for her starring role in the Hulu limited series “The Dropout” and has also been in shows like the revival of “Twin Peaks” at Showtime and “Long Bright River” at Peacock. \n\t\n\n\tLawrence, a longtime fan of Hiaasen, is currently the creator and showrunner on the series adaptation of Hiaasen’s “Bad Monkey” at Apple TV+. That show debuted at Apple in August 2024 and was renewed for a second season in December of that year.\n\n\tHorowitz and Kitsis are best known as the creators of the popular ABC series “Once Upon a Time,” which ran for seven seasons and over 150 episodes at the broadcast network. They were also previously executive producers on the hit ABC series “Lost” and have worked on shows like “Felicity” and “One Tree Hill.” In film, they are known for writing the screenplay for “Tron: Legacy,” which grossed over $400 million worldwide upon its debut in 2010.\n\n\tSeyfried is repped by Innovative Artists Entertainment and Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz. Horowitz and Kitsis are repped by WME and attorney Jared Levine. Lawrence is repped by CAA, Yorn Levine Barnes, and Mortimer PR.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s hard out here for a rapper trying to be taken seriously as an actor — but that’s changing.\n\n\tThe line between the recording studio and the silver screen has never been thinner. This year, a new generation of rappers is proving that musical talent and acting chops aren’t mutually exclusive, delivering performances that have critics buzzing and Oscar voters taking notice.\n\n\tLeading the charge is Teyana Taylor, whose turn as Perfidia Beverly Hills in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” has positioned her firmly near the forefront of the supporting actress conversation. Taylor plays a French 75 revolutionary member who runs away from her family and maternal responsibilities, bringing a raw vulnerability to the role that showcases her dramatic depth.\n\t\n\n\tThis isn’t her first rodeo — she demonstrated her range in the indie drama “A Thousand and One” (2023), where she portrayed a struggling mother with heartbreaking authenticity. The multi-hyphenate artist is also celebrating her first Grammy nomination for best R&B album for “Escape Room.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvia Instagram\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA$AP Rocky is having an impressive year, with not one but two notable turns. In Spike Lee’s “Highest 2 Lowest,” the A24-Apple crime thriller that reimagines Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 film “High and Low,” Rocky tackles the role of Archie/Yung Felon, lending street-level intensity to Lee’s characteristically bold vision. He follows that with a supporting turn opposite Rose Byrne in Mary Bronstein’s dark comedy “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” where he plays motel superintendent James, expertly balancing the film’s dark themes with unexpected humor.\n\t\n\n\tThe three-time Grammy nominee is building buzz not only for his acting but also for his highly anticipated fourth studio album, “Don’t Be Dumb,” set for release in January. Rocky’s chameleon-like ability to shift between genres and tones suggests an actor who understands that less is often more, letting silence speak as loudly as any verse.\n\n\tTyler, the Creator rounds out this year’s standout trio with his role in Josh Safdie’s anxiety-inducing “Marty Supreme” for A24. Credited under his birth name, Tyler Okonma, the 34-year-old plays Wally, a taxi driver and friend to Timothée Chalamet’s titular character, delivering a naturalistic performance that feels effortlessly lived in.\n\n\tThe two-time Grammy winner also is nominated for five Grammys, including album of the year and rap album for “Chromakopia.” His approach to acting mirrors his musical evolution: He’s unafraid to be strange, vulnerable and utterly himself.\n\n\tThese performances build on an overlooked legacy of rappers transitioning successfully to the silver screen. Ice Cube made waves in “Boyz n the Hood” (1991), establishing himself as a serious dramatic actor before building a comedy empire. Queen Latifah earned a supporting actress nomination for “Chicago” (2002), where she brought showstopping charisma to the role of Mama Morton. Will Smith won an Oscar for “King Richard” (2021), while Eminem received the original song trophy for “Lose Yourself” from “8 Mile” (2002), along with praise for his acting work. Ludacris won a SAG Award as part of the “Crash” (2005) ensemble. Donald Glover took home an Emmy for “Atlanta,” revolutionizing television comedy in the process, and Mark Wahlberg, who began as Marky Mark, earned a supporting actor nomination for best picture winner “The Departed” (2006).\n\n\tWhat’s different about this moment is the volume of talent making the leap, creating a critical mass that’s hard for the industry to ignore. The stigma that once followed rappers into audition rooms seems to be evaporating, replaced by excitement about what these artists bring to the table. They’re not abandoning music for Hollywood — rather, they’re expanding the definition of what it means to be an artist today.\n\n\tHip-hop’s brightest stars aren’t just dropping bars. They’re raising them.\n\t\n\n\tThis week’s Oscar predictions are below.\n\n\t*** = PREDICTED WINNER(All predicted nominees below are in alphabetical order)\n\t\n\t\tOscars Predictions Tracking(Dec. 11, 2025)\t\n\n\tBest Picture“Bugonia” (Focus Features)“Frankenstein” (Netflix)“Hamnet” (Focus Features) “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)“Marty Supreme” (A24)“One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) ***“Sentimental Value” (Neon)“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)“Train Dreams” (Netflix)“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures)\n\n\tDirectorPaul Thomas Anderson, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.) ***Ryan Coogler, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)Jafar Panahi, “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)Joachim Trier, “Sentimental Value” (Neon)Chloé Zhao, “Hamnet” (Focus Features)\n\n\tActorTimothée Chalamet, “Marty Supreme” (A24) Leonardo DiCaprio, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)

    "body": "\n\tGov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday signed two bills backed by SAG-AFTRA that will regulate the use of “synthetic” AI performers in New York.\n\n\tOne bill will require disclosure when an AI performer is used in advertising, while the second will forbid the use of a dead performer’s likeness to create a deepfake without the estate’s consent.\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA pushed for similar legislation in California last year, winning approval of a law that protects dead performers from AI replicas. \n\t\n\n\tThe New York legislation goes further on the advertising front, requiring advertisers to “conspicuously disclose” when a synthetic performer has been used. A synthetic performer is a digital character generated by artificial intelligence that does not resemble an actual person. Requiring such disclosure could protect the jobs of human commercial actors.\n\n\n\tHochul signed the bills Thursday at a press conference at SAG-AFTRA’s New York headquarters. In a statement, she said the bills aim to “ensure we are fully transparent when using images generated by artificial intelligence.”\n\n\tDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the executive director of SAG-AFTRA, said that the union is working with legislators to confront the “very real and immediate risks posed by unchecked AI use.”\n\n\t“This is smart, forward-looking legislation that will have national impact,” Crabtree-Ireland said.\n\n\tThe digital replica bill applies to performers who lived in New York at the time of their death. It updates the state’s post-mortem right of publicity to explicitly forbid digital recreations using AI. The law carves out a significant exemption, however, for non-consensual replicas used in fictional and non-fictional entertainment, docudramas, news programming, satire, and other such works. For example, a show like “For All Mankind” would not be required to get permission to reanimate historical figures like John Lennon and Ronald Reagan.\n\t\n\n\tThe advertising disclosure bill likewise includes an exception for advertisements for films or TV shows that feature synthetic performers. Such carve-outs are intended to satisfy First Amendment concerns.\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA continues to push for a federal law, the No Fakes Act, that would bar non-consensual deepfakes of performers and non-performers alike.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen Jim Belushi was playing Ken Kesey — a literary giant gone to seed — in “The Chronology of Water,” he’d hear Kristen Stewart calling out from behind the camera with one consistent note.\n\n\t“Drunker!” she’d yell.\n\n\tAnd Belushi, who is nothing short of a revelation in Stewart’s feature directing debut, would adjust his register, finding the sadness drowning in a sea of booze and revealing the struggling family man hiding behind the prankster persona.\n\t\n\n\tStewart, whom Belushi describes as having “the mind of a writer, the heart of an actress, and the soul of a director,” created space for him to improvise, to breathe, to live inside Kesey’s skin. \n\n\n\t“I studied Ken Kesey for three months,” Belushi says. “But I don’t do imitations. I can’t. My brother John was brilliant at it. I just try to get the essence.”\n\n\tThat essence, it turns out, is grief.\n\n\tBelushi is one of two surviving members of a family of seven. The death of his brother — celebrated comedian John Belushi — of a drug overdose at 33 left a crater that took decades to navigate. When Stewart’s script — a meditation on survival and connection after unthinkable loss — landed on his desk, Belushi found himself in familiar territory. The story’s central line, “Nobody is big enough to hold what happens to us,” became his North Star.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I forgave all my ex-wives,” he says, “because what happened to that character and Ken and what happened to me is so deeply sad and troubling that you resent people for not understanding.”\n\n\tBelushi plays Kesey with a devastating tenderness, channeling personal grief into a performance so raw it feels less like acting and more like exorcism. Stewart created space for him to improvise, to breathe, to live inside Kesey’s skin.\n\t\n\n\t“For me, there was no acting required,” Belushi says. “I just never felt more present and so connected.”\n\n\tThere’s a central paradox to Belushi’s career: He’s worked with Michael Mann, David Lynch, Woody Allen and Oliver Stone — yet somehow remains perpetually underestimated, even dismissed. He’s the guy from “According to Jim.” John’s little brother. The jokester who lands the punchline but never gets the chance to break your heart.\n\n\tUntil now.\n\n\tBelushi not only gives one of the richest performances of his career in “The Chronology of Water,” but also steals scenes as a kindhearted small-time manager in Craig Brewer’s “Song Sung Blue,” which hits theaters on Christmas Day. What emerges in both roles is something Belushi has been chasing his entire career — what he calls “the magic.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKristen Stewart directs ‘The Chronology of Water,’ picked up by the Forge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMARK CASSAR\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s that moment onstage or on camera when preparation dissolves into pure presence, when the audience connects with something ineffable in his performance. The irony isn’t lost on him that it took a 35-year-old first-time director to unlock what Hollywood’s been missing.\n\n\t“I don’t know if they’re boxing me in as much as they just don’t understand me because I am kind of all over the place,” he reflects. “I’ve done some independent films where people went, ‘Oh my God, I didn’t realize you could do that.’”\n\n\tBut he’s done it all along. From his film debut in Mann’s “Thief” to “Salvador” with Stone to his delightfully unhinged work in Lynch’s “Twin Peaks,” Belushi has been delivering complexity in plain sight.\n\n\tIf “Chronology” is steeped in sorrow, “Song Sung Blue” gives Belushi a different emotional register — one tinged with gentleness and the hard-won peace of a man who’s survived the whiplash of showbiz cycles.\n\n\tNow, finally, people are looking. And what they’re finding is an actor who never stopped believing in the craft, who studies for three months even for small parts, who understands that talent doesn’t diminish with age — it deepens.\n\n\t“There’s this moment when you’re performing and you connect with the audience,” Belushi says. “It’s magic inside your body. And all I do is chase the magic.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Forge\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHe’s reflective now, but not sentimental. He speaks openly about regret, and about the time it takes to heal.\n\n\t“I wish my recovery time was a little quicker,” he admits. “You either fall apart or you find a way through it.”\n\n\tHis relationship with grief — his own and the pain others share with him — is almost pastoral. He says he still dreams of his brother frequently. “I have dreams once in a while where he and I are acting at Second City,” he shares. “We were on stage together, and he was so funny that I cracked up, eating the scene in front of everybody. I got so mad at him, because that’s the worst thing you can do, is break character, right? But he was just so funny, and he goes, ‘Ah, come on, kid!’ He was sweet to me. So, I still get little visits.”\n\n\tBelushi says people have approached him for years, quietly confiding, I lost my brother too.\n\n\t“They want to know what to do,” he says softly. “And I went, OK, I see. I see now. Some of my purpose is to help guide others.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLola Petticrew is the latest addition to the cast of Netflix‘s live-action “Assassin’s Creed” series, Variety has confirmed.\n\n\tPetticrew will star alongside previously announced cast member Toby Wallace. Exact character details are being kept under wraps.\n\n\tThe official logline for the show states that it is “centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind’s future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity’s destiny.”\n\t\n\n\tThe “Assassin’s Creed” games explore the war between the rival secret orders of the Assassins and the Templars as they use advanced machines to access the genetic memories of Assassins in different periods of the past to track down powerful artifacts called Pieces of Eden.\n\n\tPetticrew recently starred in the FX drama “Say Nothing” and the Channel 4 series “Trespasses.” Her other TV credits include “Three Families,” “Anne Boleyn,” and “Bloodlands,” while she has also starred in films such as “Tuesday,” “Wolf,” and “Dating Amber.” \n\n\tPetticrew is repped by CAA, Range Media Partners, B-Side Management, and Sloane Offer. \n\n\tRoberto Patino and David Wiener serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers. Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, and Genevieve Jones of Ubisoft Film & Television serve as executive producers, as does Matt O’Toole.\n\n\tThe first “Assassin’s Creed” game debuted in 2007 and became an instant hit, with over 230 million copies of the various titles in the franchise having been sold to date. There have been 14 installments in the main franchise so far, with the most recent being “Assassin’s Creed: Shadows,” released in 2025. A film adaptation starring Michael Fassbender was released in 2016.\n\t\n\n\tDeadline first reported Petticrew’s casting. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector Carl Rinsch was convicted Thursday on charges of defrauding Netflix out of $11 million during production of the never-completed sci-fi series “White Horse.”\n\n\tRinsch faces the threat of many years in prison when he is sentenced on charges of wire fraud, money laundering and making illegal transactions. His sentencing was scheduled for April 17.\n\n\tThe director, 48, took the stand in his own defense on Tuesday, chalking up the dispute to a misunderstanding. He has maintained that he completed principal photography on the first season of the show and needed the money for pre-production on Season 2.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix never ordered a second season and has said that the first was far from complete. In closing arguments on Wednesday, prosecutors argued that Rinsch had deliberately concealed his motives for obtaining the money before going on a lavish spending spree — and that to believe otherwise would require ignoring all the evidence in the case.\n\n\n\t“This isn’t a movie script that Carl Rinsch and his lawyers can edit,” said prosecutor Adam Sowlati. “This is reality.”\n\n\tSeveral Netflix executives were called to testify during the one-week trial in Manhattan federal court. Prosecutors also introduced bank records and emails to show that Rinsch quickly funneled Netflix’s money into a brokerage account.\n\n\tAt the time, the COVID pandemic was beginning to spread around the globe. According to the prosecution, Rinsch gambled millions on Gilead, a pharmaceutical company he believed could cure the disease, ultimately incurring steep losses. He also spent heavily on luxury cars, antique furniture and high-end mattresses, among other extravagances. Daniel McGuinness, Rinsch’s defense lawyer, argued that the luxury purchases were a red herring that had “no bearing” on the case.\n\t\n\n\t“Please don’t get fooled, ladies and gentlemen,” he said.\n\n\tMcGuinness also challenged the testimony of Cindy Holland, then the head of original content at Netflix, arguing that Holland’s memory of a verbal agreement could not be relied upon.\n\n\t“He had a state of mind, they had a state of mind,” McGuinness argued. “And the government has turned this into a nefarious fraud conspiracy.”\n\n\tIn a court filing in August, the defense signaled it would argue that Rinsch was in a “state of psychosis,” and that his mental health issues were exacerbated by prescription drugs and the stress of the pandemic. But his lawyers did not raise that defense at trial.\n\n\tInstead, Rinsch testified that his purchases were entirely legitimate — and that the Rolls-Royces, for instance, were needed for the show.\n\n\tProsecutors urged the jury not to buy it.\n\n\t“He lied to you,” said prosecutor Timothy Capozzi. “He thought he could trick you just like Netflix.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tChanel opened the doors of its Rue Cambon headquarters this week for a private screening of “Coutures,” Alice Winocour’s drama  starring Angelina Jolie in a poignant role as a filmmaker juggling a contentious divorce and a cancer diagnosis while trying to direct a film in a foreign country.Set against the tumultuous backdrop of Paris Fashion Week, “Coutures” is the first fiction film allowed to shoot inside Chanel’s tailoring workshops and to access the Haute Couture salons and the iconic staircase (pictured above) on Rue Cambon.Winocour tells the story of three women whose lives intersect: Maxine (Jolie), an American director who discovers she has breast cancer while filming and bonds with a colleague on set (Louis Garrel); Ada (Anyier Anei), who came from South Sudan to make her modeling debut; and Angèle (Ella Rumpf), a makeup artist working behind the scenes on the catwalk. “Coutures” bowed at the Toronto Film Festival and played in competition at San Sebastián.The screening, part of Chanel’s Cinema Rendez-Vous series, was introduced by the house’s global director of cinematic relations, Elsa Heizmann, who positioned “Coutures” as a project closely aligned with the house’s creative DNA. “This film is one we truly care about and have supported from the beginning,” she said, before adding that “Coutures” won’t be released until February 2026. “It’s a real gift from the production and distribution,” she added. The film was produced by Charles Gillibert’s CG Cinema and Closer, and will be released in France by Pathé.Clément Geray, head of cinema-relations projects at Chanel, highlighted the degree of access given to Winocour, a well-known screenwriter and director whose previous films include “Proxima,” starring Eva Green, and “Paris Memories,” with Virginie Efira. “It’s the very first fiction film shot right here at Rue Cambon, in the ateliers,” he said. “There have been documentaries, but never a narrative feature in these sanctuarized spaces.” He recalled that Chanel began collaborating with Winocour more than a year before shooting started. “She met many of the people here tonight. They explained their work, their daily routines. Alice has a near-documentary approach, always striving for the most accurate depiction of reality,” he said.For one of the film’s final scenes, Chanel also collaborated with Pascaline Chavanne, the multi-César-winning costume designer whose credits include “Nouvelle Vague” and “8 Women,” to design the silhouettes inspired by the house’s collection.\n\n\t“This project created a real synergy between haute couture and cinema,” Geray said. “It was an opportunity for many of our teams to collaborate directly with a filmmaker.”The screening was followed by a conversation with Alice Winocour, as well as Marillier and the film’s breakout, Anei, who made her acting debut in “Coutures” and had her real-life runway start last year for the Fall-Winter collection.“Coutures” was the “second-to-last screening” of the year for Chanel, Heizmann said, before teasing next week’s presentation of “Arco,” Neon’s Golden Globe-nominated animated feature directed by Ugo Bienvenu and produced by Natalie Portman and Sophie Mas.\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s (still) good to be the Kings. \n\n\tRobert and Michelle King have renewed their overall deal with CBS Studios, their creative home for nearly 20 years. Under the deal, the Kings and their King Size Productions banner will continue to create and produce shows for streaming and broadcast. Robert will also direct under the deal. Liz Glotzer, president of King Size, executive produces all their projects. \n\n\n\t“For over 15 years, Robert and Michelle have been an integral part of the CBS Studios family, creating smart, provocative, and often prescient series that elevated a genre and redefined what television could be,” said David Stapf, president of CBS Studios. “Their ability to blend sharp insight with heart and humor, while creating deeply rich, complex characters and worlds is unmatched. We’re honored to continue building with them, and can’t wait to see where their creative curiosity and bold writing take audiences next.” \n\t\n\n\tKeeping the Kings under the CBS Studios banner comes as little surprise, even with the recent closing of the Paramount-Skydance merger. Although David Ellison’s new regime has made a number of changes and shakeups within their TV and studio businesses, the Kings have a proven track record of turning in hit shows that achieve the rare mix of high viewership and critical acclaim. \n\n\tThe Kings most recently created the CBS series “Elsbeth,” which recently premiered its third season. They are also currently prepping the legal drama “Cupertino” starring Mike Colter for the 2026-2027 broadcast season, which the Kings will co-showrun and Robert will direct the pilot. Outside of CBS, they are developing the drama “Vatican City” at Hulu. \n\t\n\n\t“We’re proud to continue our partnership with CBS Studios because we’ve had so much fun working with George Cheeks, David Stapf, Amy Reisenbach, Bryan Seabury, and all of the teams at the studio and network,” the Kings said. “And we can’t wait to do the same with the new team at Paramount+. There’s nothing better for a writer/producer than having smart, creative collaborators that you trust, and having them trust you. It allows you to take chances you wouldn’t normally take. So here we go.”\n\n\tThe Kings other series include dramas like “The Good Wife” and “Braindead” at CBS, “The Good Fight,” “Evil,” and “Happy Face” at Paramount+, and “Your Honor” at Showtime.They are repped by UTA and Del Shaw Moonves. \n",

His stand-up special on YouTube, “Randomly Selected,” has racked up 16 million views. And he boasts more than 25 million followers and subscribers across social platforms. He specifically has a large footprint in India, which accounts for 32% of his global audience. With 12 sold-out shows in the region, the Iranian American funnyman is the highest ticket-selling international comedian in India.\n\t\n\n\tOutside of stand-up, Amini is the founder of Abstraction Media, a production banner under which he has directed and developed film, TV and documentary projects. In 2022, he directed the narrative feature film “James the Second,” a coming-of-age drama about a teenage boy with a rare disorder that prevents him from feeling pain. And he helmed the docuseries “Diaspora,” an anthology spotlighting the personal experiences of influential immigrants from around the world. Amini also directed Enissa Amani’s Netflix special “Ehrenwort” and spearheaded the car-focused reality series “MaxWheel” and a 24-episode talk show for Voice of America titled “Minutes With Max.”\n\n\n\tHis acting credits include NBC’s “Heroes” and Rob Schneider’s Netflix sitcom “Real Rob,” on which he played Stalker Steve across nine episodes. Ten years before he released “Randomly Selected” on YouTube, Amini put out the special “Authentically Absurd,” which was directed by Schneider.\n",

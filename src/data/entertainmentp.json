    "body": "\n\tIn support of the World Food Programme’s (WFP) emergency response in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, WFP Goodwill Ambassador Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye is donating $350,000 from his XO Humanitarian Fund. This donation will support WFP as it scales up operations to reach up to 200,000 Jamaicans as they recover from the disaster.\n\n\tHurricane Melissa impacted almost six million people across the Caribbean islands at the end of October, with Jamaica bearing the brunt of the category 5 storm. WFP has been working alongside the Jamaican Government to assist the worst-affected families to meet their urgent food needs. So far, more than 9,000 people have been reached with food kits containing rice, lentils, canned fish and meat, and vegetable oil. Across Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti, WFP has reached 254,00 people with emergency food distributions, according to the announcement.\n\t\n\n\t“We are grateful to The Weeknd for his generous support for WFP’s urgent relief efforts. His compassion will provide much needed comfort and resilience to Jamaicans as they navigate this crisis,” said Barron Segar, World Food Program USA President and CEO. “When it comes to humanitarian disasters, WFP is among the world’s first responders. But our work is only possible through the generosity of our private sector donors and global partners.”\n\n\n\tEvery contribution helps WFP deliver food, hope, and resilience to families facing hunger and displacement. To join The Weeknd in supporting WFP’s hurricane response, donate at www.wfpusa.org/helpjamaica. \n\n\tWorld Food Program USA, a 501(c)(3) organization based in Washington, D.C., supports the mission of the United Nations World Food Programme by mobilizing American policymakers, businesses, and individuals to advance the global movement to end hunger. The World Food Programme is a 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and a leading humanitarian organization.\n\t\n\n\tIn partnership with World Food Program USA, Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye launched the XO Humanitarian Fund in 2022 to support the World Food Programme’s efforts to combat the global hunger crisis. The fund is fueled by proceeds from his “After Hours Til Dawn” stadium tour. Since then, the fund has contributed and pledged more than $6.5 million to provide food and support to millions of people experiencing severe hunger across the globe, including $4.5 million toward WFP’s emergency response in Gaza and $2 million to support WFP’s emergency food assistance for women and children in Ethiopia. In the aftermath of the Los Angeles wildfires, the fund donated $1 million to support Los Angeles County firefighters and impacted residents.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Mad Men” is coming to HBO Max on Dec. 1.\n\n\tThe beloved series starring Jon Hamm will also be available in 4K for the first time ever, for premium subscribers.\n\n\tBefore it launches on HBO Max, “Mad Men” is not currently available to watch on a major streamer. The Lionsgate series is on AMC+ and is available on ad-supported platforms.\n\n\n\t“Mad Men,” which is set in one of New York’s most prestigious advertising agencies in the 1960s, won four consecutive Emmy awards for best drama, among 16 total wins and 116 nominations. Created by Matthew Weiner, the show ran from 2007 to 2015 on AMC.\n\t\n\n\tHamm played Madison Avenue’s biggest ad man (and ladies’ man) Don Draper, starring alongside Vincent Kartheiser, Elisabeth Moss, January Jones, Christina Hendricks, Rich Sommer, Aaron Staton, Kiernan Shipka, Jessica Pare and John Slattery.\n\n\t“’Mad Men’ is a great addition to the HBO Max library of iconic content,” said Royce Battleman, EVP of global content acquisitions at Warner Bros. Discovery. “We are thrilled that HBO Max will provide fans the opportunity to enjoy the series in a fresh way with an enhanced 4K viewing experience.”\n\n\t“’Mad Men’ continues to show truly remarkable staying power with audiences a full decade after concluding its network run, and we couldn’t imagine a better home for it than HBO Max,” added Jim Packer, president of worldwide television distribution at Lionsgate. “HBO sets the bar for premium entertainment, making it the perfect place to celebrate one of television’s defining series while introducing ‘Mad Men’ to new viewers and reintroducing it to longtime fans in 4K.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThomas Coesfeld will become the new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Bertelsmann in 2027, the company’s supervisory board announced early Thursday.\n\n\tThe 35-year-old Bertelsmann executive board member will officially succeed Thomas Rabe on January 1, 2027, after Rabe’s contract expires on December 31, 2026, marking the end of his 15-year tenure as Chairman and CEO. Coesfeld has been CEO of the BMG division since 2023 and a member of the Bertelsmann Executive Board since 2024.\n\t\n\n\tThe supervisory board has also appointed Clément Schwebig to the Bertelsmann Executive Board as the future CEO of RTL Group, effective May 1, 2026.\n\n\n\tBertelsmann Supervisory Board Chairman Christoph Mohn said: “On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to congratulate Thomas Coesfeld on his appointment as the next Chairman and CEO of Bertelsmann. As both an entrepreneur and a manager, he has all the qualities needed to lead Bertelsmann successfully and ensure the company’s continuity. Over the past ten years at Bertelsmann, I have come to know Thomas Coesfeld as an entrepreneurial leader. In recent years, he has taken the music company BMG to significantly higher levels of revenue and earnings and positioned it even more firmly for the streaming age. His appointment marks a generational change in Bertelsmann’s leadership. I wish him every success and a steady entrepreneurial hand.”\n\n\tRabe added: “I am very pleased with the Supervisory Board’s decision and congratulate Thomas Coesfeld on behalf of the entire Executive Board. We have worked closely and with great trust for many years, and I will do everything possible to ensure a smooth transition. Bertelsmann’s leadership will be in excellent hands with him and his team.” Thomas Coesfeld, CEO of BMG and future Chairman and CEO of Bertelsmann, said: “I would like to thank the Supervisory Board – and in particular its Chairman, Christoph Mohn – for the trust they have placed in me. I am very much looking forward to assuming responsibility for leading Bertelsmann. It is a challenge I will take on with the full support of the Executive Board, top management, and all employees.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore “Wicked” landed on the big screen a year ago, Universal told cinema owners of its simple goal for promoting the movie musical. It planned to be, per chief marketing officer Michael Moses, “just short of obnoxious.”\n\n\tSure enough, the studio behind the pink-and-green publicity machine delivered an epic onslaught of all things Oz. A $7 million Super Bowl spot. Starbucks themed drinks and partnerships with 400 other corporate brands. A splashy stop at the Paris Summer Olympics. Scores of magazine covers. And a press junket for the ages (almost 12 months later, we’re still “holding space” for the lyrics of “Defying Gravity”).\n\t\n\n\t“They needed to hit people over the head,” says one executive at a rival studio.\n\n\n\tThat’s because Universal was establishing “Wicked,” based on the Broadway smash, not as a fizzy musical for moms and daughters, but as a four-quadrant extravaganza on the scale of “Barbie.” The efforts paid off: “Wicked” launched with $112 million and set a box office record for stage-to-screen adaptations with $756 million globally. The film became a juggernaut on digital platforms and scored 10 Oscar nominations. Cultural ubiquity achieved.\n\n\tWith “Wicked: For Good,” which drops into theaters on Nov. 21, Universal is aiming for a slightly subtler approach. It’s relative, of course: Still everywhere. Less “obnoxious.” Though marketing efforts never really faded — Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande performed at the Academy Awards in March — the studio waited until summer to officially ignite the second movie’s promotional blitz. (“You can’t miss us if we never go away,” Moses told Variety last November.) In comparison, the first film began its rollout at the Super Bowl, eight months prior to release.\n\t\n\n\t“One of the words to describe the marketing of the new release would be ‘restraint.’ The studio has pulled back,” says Jason Squire, professor emeritus at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. “We’re not inundated like we were on the first movie.”\n\n\tUniversal has good reason to make the adjustments. After all, “Wicked” is a known entity this time around. And there’s a risk of consumer fatigue in trying to keep it in the zeitgeist for two years. With that in mind, Universal did extensive exit polling to assess the audience’s tolerance for all the pink-and-green goodness. Research found that fans didn’t mind the deluge because the inescapable campaign made “Wicked” feel like a leave-the-home-worthy event.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCynthia Erivo performs during the two-hour NBC special “Wicked: One Wonderful Night” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©NBC/Courtesy Everett Collectio\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThough a commercial gamble, there were cost-saving advantages to scheduling a yearlong intermission. Marketing executives usually need to spend big bucks to reintroduce a property after lengthy gaps. That wasn’t necessary here since “Wicked” never left the public consciousness. The studio shelled out roughly $90 million on global promotional efforts compared with the initial film’s nearly $150 million marketing budget.\n\n\t“By having the movies one year apart, you can leverage the residual goodwill and profound marketing expenses from the first film to the second,” Squire says. \n\n\tCenterpieces of the “For Good” campaign include the two-hour NBC musical special “Wicked: One Wonderful Night,” a “Dancing With the Stars” episode takeover and a behind-the-scenes podcast hosted by Vanity Fair’s Chris Murphy. And, of course, there are brand partnerships galore: Dunkin’ is offering “Wicked” green matcha, pink refresher and Munchkins (duh), American Girl has Glinda and Elphaba dolls, while Procter & Gamble created a head-spinning array of household products with Swiffer, Secret deodorant and Cascade. All told, Universal partnered with 400 brands, only 165 of which were repeated from the original campaign.\n\n\tLike the first film, “For Good” is backed by NBCUniversal’s Symphony marketing push, in which various divisions of the sprawling media company work together to promote a project. Those outsize efforts, including a “Wicked Week” takeover on “Today” and “The Tonight Show,” as well as custom promo on NBC and Peacock series like “The Traitors” and “Real Housewives,” are separate from the film’s marketing budget.\n\t\n\n\tUniversal is eschewing a press junket and making the A-list ensemble — including Grande, Erivo, Jonathan Bailey, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh, Bowen Yang and director Jon M. Chu — available for fewer interviews. Instead, the stars are gathering for fan-centric events in cities like São Paulo, Paris and London before the North American premiere in New York City.\n\n\tIt’s too soon to rejoicify, but “Wicked: For Good” is tracking a bigger opening than its predecessor. A question is whether this entry will enjoy the same kind of staying power as the initial film. There’s commercial concern because the second half of “Wicked” is much darker than the stage show’s fizzy first act.\n\n\tHowever, box office analysts predict the fantasy musical will endure in theaters because there’s not much else geared toward females (that’s the demographic likely to drive the repeat viewings) for the rest of the year. And it isn’t a sequel, meaning its existence wasn’t simply a cash grab to capitalize on the original’s success. Audiences are returning to find out how the story ends — and how Elphaba and Glinda’s journey down the Yellow Brick Road ties into “The Wizard of Oz.”\n\n\t“The first movie was about priming the pump,” says an executive at another rival studio. “Now they don’t want to let air out of the tire.”\n",

This one in particular targets a very large younger demographic, as the kids’ gaming app boasts nearly 60 million players worldwide.\n\n\t“With music at its core, this collaboration invites our players to explore courage, self-expression and friendship in a way that feels magical and uniquely their own,” Toca Boca’s head of creative and brand Mathilda Engman said. “Whether it’s navigating friendships or figuring out who you want to be, ‘Wicked’ taps into themes that resonate deeply with the way tweens play and create in ‘Toca Boca World’ and what Toca Boca has always championed: the power of being exactly who you are.”\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tLouis Partridge almost gave up the chance to star as George Wickham in the upcoming Netflix series adaptation of “Pride and Prejudice.”\n\n\t“I think I’m quite young for Mr. Wickham,” he told me Tuesday at the premiere of his new movie “Jay Kelly.”\n\n\tIn fact, he revealed, “When it first came round, I didn’t actually audition because I thought I was too young for it. Then it came around the second time and you think, ‘This time I have a bit of spare time on my hands, I’ll give it a go.'”\n\t\n\n\tThe cast also includes Emma Corrin as Elizabeth Bennet, Jack Lowden as Mr. Darcy and Olvia Colman as Mrs. Bennet. The six-episode series was written by Dolly Alderton and directed by Euros Lyn.\n\n\t“Dolly Alderton is the perfect person to adapt this, and Jane Austen is somewhat timeless. Dolly’s got a finger on the pulse,” Partridge said of the latest adaptation. “It’s connected to the history of all of that and what came before, and I think the actors that they’ve chosen will bring their own thing and it’s a testament to the good writing. It’s like doing Shakespeare… You can throw loads of different ideas in there, different people, different casting and it will still work. It will still make sense.”\n\n\tEarlier adaptations of “Pride and Prejudice” include a 1940 film with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier and another in 2005 starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. A 1995 BBC series starred Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Retellings include “Pride, Prejudice and Zombies” (2016) and the gay romantic comedy “Fire Island” (2022).\n\t\n\n\tThe actor admitted he wasn’t too familiar with the classic novel before signing on for the project. “All of the women in my life said, ‘You have to do this, you have to, you must,’” he said. “I’m so grateful I did because I read it and I responded to it. It’s brilliant, brilliant writing and a timeless story.”\n\n\tIn September, Partridge toplined the Netflix series “House of Guinness,” about the Irish beer-making dynasty. He’ll also reprise his role as Tewkesbury in “Enola Holmes 3” opposite Millie Bobby Brown. A release date has not been announced.\n\n\tWatch the video at the top of this storry to find out what Partridge told me about working with George Clooney in “Jay Kelly.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNicolas Cage (“Longlegs,” “Pig”) is set to star in upcoming crime epic “Gambino” from director John Woo (“The Killer,” “Silent Night”), reuniting the pair almost 30 years since cult action hit “Face/Off.”\n\n\tWoo will direct from a script written by “Bad Boys” scribe George Gallo and Oscar-winning “Green Book” writer/producer Nick Vallelonga, with the package launching at the AFM with WME Independent handling sales.\n\n\n\tThe title follows Cage’s Carlo Gambino, a butcher’s son from Sicily, who ruled New York’s underworld with quiet authority. But when his death sends shockwaves through the city, Pulitzer-winning journalist Jimmy Breslin follows the trail he left behind to uncover the man beneath the legend. As the synopsis reads: “Through the voices of those who loved him and those who feared him, Breslin peels back the composure that masked Gambino’s ruthlessness, revealing how this outsider rose to redefine power, loyalty, and the American dream.”\n\t\n\n\tCassian Elwes (“Dead Man’s Wire”), Edward Zeng (“Following Harry”) of NextG Films, Robert Daly Jr., and David Lipper of Latigo Films (“Not Without Hope,” “The Neglected”) will produce, with NextG Films financing. Cage, Gallo, and Vallelonga will also produce.\n\n\t“At NextG Film, our vision is to unite the finest creative talents of Hollywood with the bold entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley,” said Edward Zeng of NextG Film. “Together, we aim to deliver an epic cinematic experience that brings audiences back to the theater again and again—an experience that not only entertains, but inspires people to reflect on the world we live in today. Humanity stands at a crossroads. Through powerful storytelling and innovative artistry, we hope to remind everyone that the future is ours to shape, and it is our shared responsibility to make it better.”\n\t\n\n\tNews of “Gambino” will likely reignite excitement that Cage and Woo may soon embark on a sequel to “Face/Off,” the hit 1997 action thriller that pitted Cage’s terrorist-for-hire against John Travolta’s FBI agent. Paramount revealed in 1999 that it had plans to remake the movie with a new cast, but in 2021 it was reported that Adam Wingard would direct a film that would instead be a sequel to the first.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHasan Piker is about to prove his point.\n\n\tFor weeks, the wildly popular Twitch streamer and leftist commentator has been following the online discourse surrounding the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The topic is personal for Piker, who was scheduled to debate Kirk at Dartmouth College 15 days after the right-wing political activist was gunned down on a Utah campus. Authorities charged college student Tyler Robinson with the crime, but lately, a civil war has erupted among conservatives over conspiratorial claims that the Mossad had a hand in the murder. “You would be surprised at how many people believe that stuff,” he says as he mulls the menu options at a crowded Chelsea restaurant on a brisk October morning.\n\t\n\n\tWhen our waiter arrives, Piker turns to the 20-something hipster. “Can I ask you a question? Who is the most likely person that killed Charlie Kirk?” he asks. “I think it was Israel. It seems like an inside job,” the server replies hesitantly before heading back to the kitchen for Piker’s cold brew.\n\n\n\tThe answer comes as a shock to me. But it’s no surprise to the extremely online millennial who acknowledges that he is fascinated by conspiracy theories.\n\n\t“I watch every Candace Owens,” Piker says, referring to the new-media star of the far right who has fanned the flames of the Israel theory. He nods in the direction of our waiter: “It’s the reason why I know exactly where he is coming from with the Charlie-Israel thing. For me, no matter how far-fetched the conspiracy is, if it is getting 2 million views in 24 hours, that means a lot of people are tuning in to it. That means a lot of people are paying attention to it. And in this day and age, I think a lot of people are believing it.”\n\t\n\n\tPiker feels no allyship with Owens even if they share the belief that Israel is a malignant force. He is merely a student of the attention economy, a space in which he is thriving. With nearly 3 million followers on Twitch and 1.75 million YouTube subscribers, the 34-year-old influencer seems like a possible answer to the question of when the left will find its own Joe Rogan. As the next generation turns more conservative and alpha males like Andrew Tate ascend, Piker offers an alternative vision and the rare ability to sway an election. As an early and enthusiastic supporter of Zohran Mamdani, Piker played a key role in helping catapult the New York mayoral candidate to Gracie Mansion by spreading the Democrat’s socialist message to his legion of fans.\n\n\tWith our waiter out of earshot, Piker drops his voice discreetly. “Israel did not kill Charlie Kirk. That is insane!” he says. “I did that for you because you were shocked.” When the waiter returns with our order, he tells Piker that he is comping the cold brew. “Wait, why?” Piker asks. “I just like your vibe,” the server says.\n\n\tA lot of people like Piker’s vibe. His brand — a two-fold critique of Israel and the billionaire class — has made him a multimillionaire. And a foil. Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt has accused him of using his platform to promote “toxic anti-Zionism.” Andrew Cuomo invoked Piker’s name repeatedly along the campaign trail in an effort to smear Mamdani.\n\n\tOn this morning, Piker has just arrived via red-eye from his home in Los Angeles for an appearance at the New Yorker Festival; his inclusion in the lineup already sparked a wave of outrage. Wearing a no-logo sweatshirt, sweatpants, a “Free Palestine” wristband and an Apple watch and carrying a small Gucci bag that holds his Zyn supply, Piker signals a cross between conspicuous consumption and Bernie bro. Lurking beneath a camo hat emblazoned with the word “Thieves” is a mind that poses one of the biggest PR threats to the pro-Israel set. The Jersey-born, Istanbul-raised, Rutgers-educated provocateur has no plans to back down.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“These last two years, I’ve been called antisemitic. I abhor antisemitism, and I’ve spent my entire professional media career combating it. I just happen to be anti-Israel, and that makes me a far greater threat than the likes of Nick Fuentes because they know he’s a Nazi,” he says, referring to yet another polarizing figure in the ongoing schism within the far right. “I don’t find kinship with the right because I think there are some on the right that just use Israel as a new opportunity to cut through the noise.” \n\t\n\n\tHis voice, famous from 2,674 livestreams — or 18,624 hours in front of a camera — since he started on Twitch in 2018, is steady and evokes the East Coast liberal arts poli sci education he received. “Maybe they see kinship with me, but I’ve been there for decades,” he says. “Because this is a problem that predates Oct. 7. That’s why a lot of people in the know shortly after Oct. 7, myself included, were like, ‘This is horrifying.’ But the reasons as to why this is happening is because of 75 years of apartheid at that point, the genocide that was the inception of the Israeli nation-state. And most people were just so oblivious to that reality. They were like, ‘How dare you say something so barbaric? How dare you say something instead of just sitting there silently and mourning?’ But there has never been a moment in my life where I ever considered Israel to be anything but a criminal enterprise.”\n\n\tHanging with Hasan plays out a bit like one of his marathon streams on Twitch, a hybrid of live television and social media that allows creators to interact with fans via chat. The hours float by as he flits from one topic to the next, a mix of politics and pop culture. \n\n\tHe’s disgusted by Hollywood’s treatment of pro-Palestinian voices who have lost career opportunities, such as “Scream” actress Melissa Barrera (whose firing from the franchise happened, he says, at “the peak of the panic”). Some have been dropped by their agencies, including Susan Sarandon (“Love her”) by UTA, or their labels, like Roger Waters (“He’s awesome”), over their Israel critiques. More recently, British punk rap duo Bob Vylan was cut by UTA for leading chants of “Death to the IDF” during a performance at Glastonbury Festival.\n\n\t“I don’t think that is necessarily going too far,” Piker says of Bob Vylan’s actions. “I think the moment that you start talking about Jewish control or the Talmud is when people go too far. As a Muslim who sees so much Islamophobia, I’m very tuned in to that dog whistle, like the overemphasis on sharia.” (The notion that Mamdani would impose sharia law on New York was indicative of the tenor of the final stretch of the mayoral race.) “They do it to Jewish people as well in a similar vein. I think that’s when people go too far.”\n\t\n\n\tFrom Piker’s perspective, Amy Schumer should have been canceled for social media posts she made in the wake of Oct. 7. “Amy was going crazy — and no punishments there. She was just straight-up being like, ‘They’re all rapists, barbaric monsters. They’re head choppers. We got to deal with them.’” (Piker appears to be referencing an illustration Schumer shared and then deleted on Instagram that depicted pro-Palestinian supporters holding signs with such slogans as “Gazans rape Jewish girls only in self defense” and “Proud of our rapist martyrs.”)\n\n\tDespite calls for his cancellation for his criticism of Israel, Piker has withstood the heat. “WME didn’t drop me, which I think is very interesting,” he says. \n\n\tHe was told to tone it down, but he’s vague about exactly who told him.\n\n\t“‘He’s getting a little too hot’ is what I heard,” he says. Did he heed that warning? “No, because I’m very stubborn, and if something is wrong, I’m going to call it out, and if I can’t call it out, then I can’t do my job. That’s my job. That’s what I do. So yes, I’ve gotten warnings, and I’m not oblivious.”\n\n\tJournalist Taylor Lorenz, a friend of Piker’s who has covered the subject of internet harassment for 15 years, says that he is unique in the breadth of his haters, from Vice President JD Vance to Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres.\n\n\t“Hasan has a very particular strain of politics, which is leftism that is attacked by both mainstream centrist Democrats, bad-faith left-wing actors, the right wing and just internet trolls,” Lorenz says. “And he’s on the most dramatic platform possible, Twitch, which has the most parasocial fan base of any platform. He gets the entire internet weaponized against him. He is the only straight man I’ve ever seen that has been Gamergated.”\n\n\tEarlier this year, Mamdani’s mother, director Mira Nair, signed a petition calling for the Academy to rescind its invitation to Gal Gadot to appear at the Oscars for “her support for Israel’s military actions against Palestinians.” Given that Gadot’s comments throughout the conflict have centered on releasing the hostages, I ask Piker if such a campaign was fair.\n\n\t“I think she should be banned from the Oscars for being a dogshit actress. I think she has no business being there for the crime of what she has done to not only the DC franchise, but really any movie she’s been a part of,” he says of the “Wonder Woman” star. “All jokes aside, Gal Gadot serves an important role in normalizing Israel as not a fascist ethno-state, but instead a place where a lot of beautiful women come from. And those beautiful women happen to serve in the IDF, because there’s also this weird sexualization of the forces as well that takes place, and it plays another role in normalizing Israel and its activities and actions, and whitewashing it.”\n\t\n\n\tBy contrast, Piker appreciates the work of Natalie Portman, who is Israeli but never served in the IDF like Gadot.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Doperalski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“If Gal Gadot could act like Natalie Portman, there’re probably less people yelling at her. Natalie Portman has made statements about Israel that are middle of the road, but ultimately nobody holds that against her. Because she can act her freaking face off, all the way back when she was like a teenager. Oh my God, ‘Léon: The Professional.’”\n\n\tGadot may have ruined the DC franchise for Piker, but James Gunn is redeeming it. When “Superman” opened on July 11, Piker made viral the idea that the fictional nation of Boravia is a stand-in for Israel. In the film, Boravia, backed by U.S.-made weaponry, drops bombs on and oppresses its desert neighbor, prompting Superman to intercede. Gunn has since denied that the plotline has “anything to do with the Middle East.” \n\n\t“James Gunn is a lot more woke than he lets on. And he lets on how woke he is all the time,” Piker says, still certain of the director and DC chief’s intention all these months later. “Come on, man, you made the [Boravian leader] look like David Ben-Gurion. He just straight-up looks one-to-one like the first prime minister of Israel. We don’t even care what you say about this. We know exactly what we’re looking at.”\n\n\tTo take the allegory a step further, Palantir, BlackRock and Raytheon are LuthorCorp.\n\n\t“Lex Luthor is cutting a direct contract with Boravia to extract natural resources and then also have a testing ground for their weapons,” Piker says. “I mean, that’s literally what we do. Gaza is a weapons laboratory. That’s how imperialism works.”\n\n\tApropos of something, Piker then gives a thumbs-up to the actor who suited up as the latest Man of Steel. “David Corenswet, from what I understand, is Jewish, and he’s very cool. He’s not like pro-Israel or anything like that either, as far as I’ve seen,” he notes.\n\n\tWith that, Piker is ready to move on to cross-Burbank superhero rival Marvel. But there’s little for him to mine on that front. “I’ve always been a Marvel fan growing up, but I cannot stand the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” he says.\n\n\tPiker’s intensity is palpable as he chases a double espresso with a 6 mg Zyn pouch. All that’s missing is the scroll of chat comments accompanying his musings. Instead, swooning fans enter the real-life frame to express their gratitude. A woman dining with her son approaches our table. “No, no, it’s impossible. He lives in L.A.,” she says, beaming. “And then I kept looking and looking and … it’s him! I absolutely love your work.” \n\t\n\n\t“Being a Twitch streamer is a lot of that,” he says of his exchange with the server. “I have my ear to the ground all the time. A lot of people in legacy media, traditional journalists, are so out of step with the average person around them, even in their immediate vicinity.”\n\n\tStill, Piker allows the rich and powerful to occupy plenty of space in his head. Bari Weiss, the recently installed editor-in-chief of CBS News, gets a bashing. “Bari Weiss is everything that I despise about access journalism brown-nosing to institutionally powerful people and a major advocate for Israel as well. A person that has spent her entire career decrying woke or identity politics while simultaneously using her identity as a shield,” he says. “Like, ‘I’m a lesbian woman. I can’t be intolerant.’ And also even using your identity as a Jewish woman to say, ‘Identity politics sucks unless we’re talking about Jewish people.’”\n\n\tPiker scoffs at the idea that CBS News was biased before Weiss arrived.\n\n\t“There’s not enough pro-Israel voices in major news? Come on. That’s ridiculous,” he says. “Yet she’s been rewarded handsomely for it — $150 million for her shitty Substack that no one cares about or knows about. It’s very obvious why that happened. The Redstones [the seller] and the Ellisons [the buyer] wanted to make CBS more pro-Israel. Shari Redstone was willing to hand off CBS to the Ellisons because she thought they would do a better job of making it more pro-Israel.” (When the Paramount deal was announced in August, Redstone said Ellison “has a clear strategic vision and the resources to take [the studio] to its next stage of growth.”)\n\n\tSince the deal closed, the studio has made a series of moves that bolster Piker’s contention that Paramount is now more Israel-friendly. In September, it denounced a petition signed by celebrities including Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. Last month, “CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil interviewed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.\n\n\t“Bari Weiss was being packaged as someone who could bring top talent. Wow,” Piker says. “Benjamin Netanyahu never gives interviews anymore to American news? He talks to American news more than he does the Israeli news.”\n\t\n\n\tPerhaps it’s Piker’s complete lack of filter that makes him so attractive to his growing fan base. Most influencers with a red-hot career are careful not to bite a Hollywood hand that could feed them. As a result, these aspiring stars tend to punch down. Piker is willing to punch way up. All the way up to Larry Ellison, the second-richest person on the planet, who backed his son David’s successful bid to buy Paramount and also has a stake in TikTok. Piker is trying to explain the craven flip of the once-liberal tech titan to the Republican side.\n\n\t“When Larry Ellison first made that big donation to Marco Rubio [for his presidential run in 2016], people were actually a bit confused. I think he’s gay. Maybe in the closet. I don’t know. I hope he doesn’t laser me down for speculating,” he says with a laugh about the Oracle co-founder. (Larry Ellison has been married to six women and is currently wed to Jolin Zhu.) “But there are [hacked] emails that show Larry Ellison vetted Marco Rubio for fealty to Israel. And as secretary of state, Rubio played a role in the TikTok talks and steered the company towards Ellison.”\n\n\tPiker doesn’t seem too concerned about the prospect of getting “lasered down” by any vengeful oligarch. \n\n\t“I’m also not a stranger to super powerful social media platform-owning billionaires directly hating me and making it a personal vendetta and their life’s mission to destroy me somehow,” he says.\n\n\tIn the wake of the Kirk assassination, Elon Musk took to his X to call for Piker’s cancellation, dredging up past comments that walked up to the line. Musk even tagged Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (Amazon owns Twitch). Piker notes the irony that he’s not even banned on X, never mind Twitch, because he’s a power user and drives engagement.\n\n\t“A lot of these guys are very thin-skinned, and I think the gravest mistake of my career was when I had [Musk’s ex-partner] Grimes on my show and she talked about how buff I was, and then I talked about how Tesla was shit,” Piker says. “That man has never lived it down.”\n\n\tGrimes wasn’t exaggerating. Piker is hard to miss with his muscular 6-foot-4 frame. He works out one to two hours a day, a regimen that includes playing basketball. If he ingratiated himself better with the oligarchs, he would be courted by mainstream Hollywood. He’s already heard the siren call and turned it down. His manager, former WME agent David Huntzinger, fielded a $1 million offer from one popular betting platform to run a ticker ad during just one stream on election night 2024. Piker said no.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m not the easiest client. And not even because I get into trouble,” Piker explains. “I say no all the time to a lot of deals, like a lot of money. And that’s why I really respect David, because throughout our entire professional relationship, he has probably said no to tens of millions of dollars. Starting number was $1 million, which means they could have probably gone up.”\n\n\tHe’s happier helping the Mamdanis of the Democratic Party and sticking a thorn in the side of the Cuomo types. \n\n\t“He brought up my name next to Hamas. He said [during a debate with Mamdani], ‘Why don’t you denounce Hamas? Why don’t you denounce Hasan Piker?’” Piker says of the former Democratic governor turned Independent mayoral candidate. “I’m very similar to Zohran in many respects, and the same reasons why they would be resentful of Zohran or fearful of Zohran is the same reason why they despise me.”\n\n\tWith the election just 10 days away, Piker is keeping a low profile with the Mamdani campaign. “I’m in a holding pattern right now” he says, a hint of sadness creeping into his voice. “I don’t want to be too prominent in and around the Zohran stuff at the moment because I don’t want them to use it as a line of attack over and over again.”\n\n\tWhat the Cuomo campaign used was a sound bite of Piker saying, “America deserved 9/11” during a 2019 stream. “I was talking about blowback, a theory that has academic consensus at this point, that our meddling in the affairs of the Middle East has led to the blowback of 9/11,” he explains. “This wasn’t to say 9/11 is good. It’s a horrifying act of terror where 3,000 New Yorkers were slaughtered and even many more with the first responders that tried to save as many people as possible. Yet it was, of course, weaponized against me.”\n\n\tBut as election night swung Mamdani’s way, Piker wasn’t keeping a low profile but toasting the millennial mayor-elect with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Brooklyn Paramount victory party. There he offered no mercy for Cuomo. \n\n\t“What happened? I thought the ‘Hasan loves 9/11’ was a successful campaign strategy?” he said in a video that ran on his YouTube channel. “Andrew Cuomo, fuck you. Suck my dick.”\n\n\tBefore the Mamdani win becomes a reality, however, Piker can only hope the polls are accurate. But he’s feeling confident as we walk along a busy stretch of 10th Avenue. An older man wearing a bandanna and hoop earrings stops in his tracks and claps as he recognizes Piker. It’s a sign that the streamer’s message about Mamdani and/or Israel is resonating. Then, it hits me that Piker has no security detail as he mingles with the masses. Post-Kirk, that seems unwise. \n\t\n\n\t“I make it a point not to have bodyguards when I’m around the people,” he says. “I think it was, was it Fidel Castro or Che Guevara who said, ‘I have a moral vest’?”\n\n\tIt was Castro.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom the start, “The Hunger Games on Stage” feels dystopian. Taking place in Canary Wharf, London’s ultra-modern financial district, the stage adaptation of Suzanne Collins’ beloved novel is the antithesis of a West End production with its historic, ornate theaters. In fact, it’s hard to even single out the brand-new, purpose-built Troubadour Canary Wharf Theatre from the rest of the warehouse-style buildings on the canal — until you spot a large, bronze Mocking Jay on its roof.\n\t\n\n\tMatthew Dunster, the Olivier- and Tony-nominated director known for his work on the West End’s “2:22 A Ghost Story” and Broadway’s “Hangmen,” always wanted it to be this way. “You’re in the Capitol,” he tells Variety over Zoom the day before “The Hunger Games on Stage” officially opens. “It adds to it. And I just think you don’t expect to find a big, creative, artistic project in that place. Even where it is, hidden behind Dishoom and next to the canals, you’ve gotta find it.” \n\n\n\tAfter scanning their tickets, audience members are assigned a district between 1 and 11 — the stage serves as district 12 — and embark on a maze of sorts to find their appropriate section. To get to district 5, I walked up a staircase, down a hallway, past the bar and through another dark passageway before locating my seat. The theater itself is set up like an arena, with the show performed in the round and all seats raised above it — as if the audience is truly watching children fight to the death live. During certain scenes, the seats at either end of the stage move to allow set pieces and actors through, and when a tribute from your district dies, the corresponding section of the audience flashes red. On a lighter note, the layout also encourages audience participation when zany Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman takes the stage, with exclamations like “laughter,” “awww” and “boo” displayed on screens and willingly shouted by viewers.\n\t\n\n\t“We wanted to make people implicit, whether that’s in a fun way or a way of making them really think about what it is they’re watching,” Dunster says of the theater’s set-up, which was designed by Miriam Buether, who also worked on the recent West End and Broadway production of “Stranger Things: The First Shadow.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohan Persson\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIndeed, it’s not every day that a theater is built specifically for a production. The 1,200-seat Troubadour Canary Wharf Theatre started construction just eight months ago and was, Dunster admits, barely finished by the time of the first preview on Oct. 20. All together the show and theater cost £26 million ($34 million), giving the creative team the freedom to go all-out — and they did, with several risers bringing sets and actors up from the floor, aerial stunts, pyrotechnics and two huge screens used to project graphics and video.\n\n\t“I mean you can’t do that anywhere else,” Dunster says, calling the process “thrilling” and “once in a lifetime.” “‘Hi, Matthew! Do you want us to build you a theater?’ How many times is that going to happen?”\n\n\tBut the strength of a show is often only as strong as its lead, and Dunster had huge shoes to fill in finding a Katniss to embody Jennifer Lawrence’s sharp, spunky heroine — and take on both the dialogic (Conor McPherson’s script sticks to Collins’ original first-person narrative) and physical demands of the show. “It’s like Hamlet,” Dunster says of Katniss’ role. “It’s just a massive, massive part.”\n\n\tEnter Mia Carragher. The 21-year-old, who is making her stage debut with “Hunger Games,” stood out to Dunster at the first auditions, which were dance-focused. The next round was combat, and Carragher shined again. “She was fierce,” Dunster recalls. “I was like, ‘Oh God, I hope she can act.'” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohan Persson\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHe was in luck: Carragher trained at the Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in England before setting off to New York City at 18 to attend the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, known for its Method acting education. “That’s the kind of young woman she is,” Dunster says. “She’s just got all the tools, and it’s very rare to find that in someone who is very young.” \n\n\t“The Hunger Games” play sees Carragher run laps around the stage, climb scaffolding, soar into the air and, of course, employ Katniss’ signature bow-and-arrow skills. Good thing she comes from a family of athletes — her dad is football analyst and former Liverpool player Jamie Carragher, her mom a marathon runner and her brother a professional footballer.\n\t\n\n\t“That was really reassuring. I just thought, it will be in her DNA,” Dunster says. “She’s never complained once about an injury or tiredness. She just gets up, does it, and gets up and does it again. I’m a big fan.”\n\n\tCarragher’s Katniss leads an ensemble of 21, mostly made up of young people aged 18 to 24, many of whom play multiple parts. “I wanted you to fall in love with the performers for all that they can do, all their brilliance, so that when they are slaughtered that it’s even more devastating,” Dunster says. \n\n\tThere is something that feels even more brutal about seeing “The Hunger Games” play out on stage — and in an arena setting, where it feels like a true exhibition that audiences are actively taking part in. Dunster says this is the whole point. \n\n\t“I want people to be thrilled by the spectacle, but in terms of the message, it’s so simple. It’s just three words: don’t kill kids,” he says. “And that’s still happening all over the world. They’re being starved, they’re being killed, there’s a kind of ‘Hunger Games’ going on. So it felt like a real responsibility to be making the show right now.”\n\n\tOne character viewers don’t see on stage is President Snow, played by a stoic John Malkovich. Instead, the Oscar-nominated actor appears on the stage’s large screens to deliver several speeches and interact with Katniss. \n\n\t“You go to any inauguration, most people witness the president or whatever on a screen. You go to the Oasis concert, most of you experience Liam Gallagher on a screen,” Dunster says. “So we associate it with power and scale and presentation.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohan Persson\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis also helped the production to snag a star in the booked-and-busy Malkovich, who was on Dunster’s mind because he’s appearing in his friend Martin McDonagh’s next film. “I knew he’d seen a show of mine in New York a few years ago; I just thought let’s aim high. And he said yeah,” Dunster says. “We did a day’s filming with him and he turned up and knew every line.”\n\n\tAs “Hunger Games on Stage” prepares to officially open on Thursday night, Dunster acknowledges that the show’s previews have been a learning process. The team has had to do a fair amount of cutting, he says, taking the play from nearly three hours to two hours and 15 minutes. The first preview on Oct. 20 was particularly difficult, when a cast injury delayed the show’s start — leaving some audience members queuing in the rain — and unfinished construction on the building led to complaints about accessibility. Some even took to social media, leading to a mild controversy.\n\t\n\n\t“I take some responsibility for that first preview. When we were discussing whether to do the show or not — I mean, I didn’t know this would mean leaving people outside in the rain — I said, ‘I just feel that we’ve got to do it,'” Dunster says, pointing out that he knew some people were traveling to London just to see it. “The show’s not ready, we’ve had an injury, the building definitely wasn’t ready — but if it’s safe, we should do it. And it was safe, but it wasn’t accessible. And that’s really sad.” \n\n\tDunster adds that by the second preview, the accessibility issues had been sorted. “It took one day. So maybe we should have opened the second day, but some people would have missed out,” he says. “And because we made that decision, it just meant that there were problems.” (For the record, when this journalist saw the show on Nov. 11, it was smooth-sailing despite a lingering new-paint smell.) \n\n\t“The Hunger Games on Stage” is already extended through October 2026, with shows through the end of the year running low on tickets. So would Dunster direct further installments of Collins’ series for stage? \n\n\t“I can’t imagine, if it’s a success, that people wouldn’t want to do the other books,” he says. “For me as an artist, it would be, do I think I could do anything different with the other stories? Or would I be more excited about passing the baton on? I think it could be really cool if it was in the same space but a different creative team made the next one.” \n\n\tBroadway ambitions may be more up Dunster’s ally, even if the show would have to adjust to fit into a theater on the Great White Way. “I would like to be part of, certainly at the beginning, adapting it for a more conventional place if we needed to do that in any territory,” he says, though he later adds: “If we did go to America, it would seem a shame not to build something really fucking cool in Brooklyn.”\n",

Inevitably, he ended up in a bear hug from one of the guards.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The crowd cheered during the wild incident ... and one spectator couldn't help but take a jab at the Clippers' defense for not being as sharp as security.\n      \n    \n          \"Why don't the Clippers play better defense like that?!\" the guy yelled.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          They probably wish they did -- they let Nikola Jokic drop a season-high 55 points in their 116-130 loss.\n      \n    \n          At least Clippers fans finally saw some defense -- courtesy of arena security.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Nikola Jokic\n              \n                          \n                Los Angeles Clippers\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Denver Nuggets\n              \n                          \n                NBA\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

While Dunne was over the moon for her man ...

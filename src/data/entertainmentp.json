    "body": "\n\tRithy Panh can credibly hold the title of both Cambodia’s most important film director and one of the greatest documentarians alive. A survivor of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime that claimed the lives of his family members, he began studying filmmaking in France before returning to his native country in the late 1980s. His nonfiction output largely focuses on the aftermath of the Cambodian genocide and moves fluidly between brutally direct vérité (“S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine,” 2003), archival material (“Irradiated,” 2020) and, in the case of the his most celebrated film “The Missing Picture” (2013), claymation. With his most recent film, “We Are the Fruits of the Forest,” Panh opts for a more restrained but still incisive approach to the plight of a specific group of downtrodden people in his nation’s present.\n\t\n\n\tAfter a brief drone shot over the trees, “We Are the Fruits of the Forest” begins with Panh’s main recurring formal gambit for this particular project: a split screen presentation of silent black-and-white archival footage. The subject in both that found material and his film at large is the Bunong people, an indigenous ethnic group living in the highlands of northeastern Cambodia. Historically, they have grown large-grain rice in mountain forests, clearing sections of trees to create fields according to their ancestral ceremonies and offerings. By the 21st century, the Bunong have become beholden to the demands of companies seeking to access their cultivations, forcing them to harvest and clear forests at a much more rapid pace and take on additional products like cassava, rubber and honey.\n\t\n\n\tPanh’s contemporaneously shot footage forms the bulk of “We Are the Fruits of the Forest,” remaining focused on the inhabitants of what appears to be one unnamed village as they cycle through the various duties needed to maintain their already precarious status. Though there are scenes reflecting a more relaxed way of life, including a few of the village children watching an action movie on a cellphone, the vast majority of sequences take place without any obvious visual signifiers of a more putatively modern world.\n\n\tTo convey that, “We Are the Fruits of the Forest” relies equally on extensive voiceover. Though no specific credits are provided, it seems that one single male voice is used to represent the anxieties of his village, if not his entire people as a whole. It is his words that are used to contextualize the images of work on screen, explaining various customs and the animist beliefs that govern their society. Also addressed are the various classifications of forests that the Bunong may or may not work in, the increasingly predatory bank loans that they must rely on as their crop yields become ever poorer, and the racist insults that wider Cambodian society uses to refer to them. The man occasionally mentions his father, but his words are generally used in an explanatory manner, informed by a deserved pride in his people’s work and understandable concerns about their future.\n\n\tSuch a monovocal approach, especially considering that little of the frequently heard dialogue between the village people is actually subtitled, does run the risk of being repetitive, as the same problems surrounding each facet of the Bunong people’s lives are evoked again and again. But there’s an elegance to Panh’s rhythms and his focus on the many faces of the village that continually proves of interest. Even as this might be Panh’s first nonfiction film to avoid even a glancing reference to the Khmer Rouge, the numerous references to modern capitalism’s erosion of Bunong customs (including some of their people’s adoption of Christianity) ensures that this new focus for Panh is by no means a lighter or less urgent topic.\n\n\tAll this, of course, is tied back into Panh’s use of archival footage. While past and present are juxtaposed less frequently than might be expected, the material is used in an overtly poetic manner, offering brief glimpses of a previous way of life. Most strikingly, the same image is often displayed in both frames, as if to suggest a double vision that seeks to divine a greater understanding of these long-gone figures and landscapes. Woven throughout “We Are the Fruits of the Forest” is an image of a topless Bunong woman, often shown in a brief flash that intrudes into the present. Whether this is meant as a literalization of the spirits of the forest or (as suggested by the voiceover) a bad omen is left up to interpretation, but it captures the vivid past and present lives of these people, and how quickly modern forces can cause them to fade away.\n",

    "body": "\n\tYash Raj Films is bringing a treasure trove of Bollywood classics to Netflix in a major partnership that will make the storied studio’s catalog available to streaming subscribers worldwide.\n\n\tThe collaboration will see YRF titles released in strategic phases tied to festivals, special occasions, and cinematic milestones, allowing fans across the globe to access beloved Hindi films from home.\n\n\n\tThe rollout kicks off Nov. 1 — timed to Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan‘s birthday — with nine of the superstar’s most iconic YRF films, including “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” “Mohabbatein,” “Dil Toh Pagal Hai,” “Veer Zara,” and “Chak De India.”\n\t\n\n\tAdditional classic titles such as Sridevi starrer “Chandni” and “Lamhe,” Amitabh Bachchan’s “Kabhi Kabhie” and “Silsila,” and Anil Kapoor’s “Vijay,” will become available starting Nov. 14.\n\n\n\tThe holiday season will see a daily release schedule, with 34 films — including “Bunty Aur Babli,” “Hum Tum,” “Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic,” “Mujhse Dosti Karoge,” and “Ta Ra Rum Pum” — premiering two per day from Dec. 12 to 28. Three Salman Khan blockbusters — “Ek Tha Tiger,” “Sultan,” and “Tiger Zinda Hai” — will stream Dec. 27 in honor of the actor’s birthday.\n\n\tThe partnership extends into 2026, with a Valentine’s week collection launching Feb. 7 featuring eight romantic titles including “Saathiya,” “Ishaqzaade,” “Bachna Ae Haseeno,” and “Salaam Namaste.” Popular franchises are also part of the deal, with the “Dhoom” trilogy, the third part of which is headlined by Aamir Khan in a dual role, streaming from Nov. 28 and Rani Mukerji’s “Mardaani” series arriving Jan. 22, 2026.\n\t\n\n\t“This partnership marks a milestone for Indian cinema on Netflix,” said Monika Shergill, VP, India Content, Netflix. “For nearly a decade, we’ve been proud to be the home of India’s finest stories. From the beloved docu-series ‘The Romantics,’ which offered an intimate glimpse into the legacy of Yash Raj Films, to now bringing these timeless blockbusters to our members, we’re deepening our commitment to championing the depth, diversity, and emotion of Indian storytelling.”\n\n\t“This collaboration brings together YRF’s rich heritage and Netflix’s unparalleled reach to celebrate Indian cinema in all its glory — not just in India, but globally,” she added. “As these films arrive on Netflix, fans can relive the magic of iconic stars and the nostalgia of eras gone by, while new audiences discover their timeless charm for the first time.”\n\n\tAkshaye Widhani, CEO of Yash Raj Films, said: “For over 50 years, Yash Raj Films has been fortunate to help shape the heart and soul of Indian cinema through its iconic stories. We are deeply humbled by the love and trust that audiences have showered on our movies. Bringing this remarkable cinematic legacy to Netflix allows the world to experience the color, music, and magic of India and Indian cinema that YRF has always celebrated.”\n\n\t“Our library is more than a collection of iconic films; it’s a gateway to five decades of culture, creativity, and passion,” he added. “We’re thrilled that this legacy will now find new audiences and speak to new generations globally on Netflix.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Reel World Entertainment has unveiled the teaser for “Chatha Pacha: The Ring of Rowdies.”\n\n\tThe teaser offers a glimpse into the film’s chaotic world centered on the southern Indian state of Kerala’s WWE-style wrestling culture. Headlined by Roshan Mathew (Busan winner “Paradise”) and Arjun Ashokan (“Bramayugam”), the ensemble cast also features Vishak Nair (“Officer on Duty”) and Ishan Shoukath (“Marco”).\n\t\n\n\tFirst-time director Adhvaith Nayar helms the project, with creative producer Shihan Shoukath leading the charge under the Reel World Entertainment banner alongside Ritesh and Ramesh S. Ramakrishnan.\n\n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew, including director of photography Anend C. Chandran, action choreographer Kalai Kingson, lyricist Vinayak Sasikumar, and composer Mujeeb Majeed. Sanoop Thykoodam penned the screenplay, with Praveen Prabhakar handling editing.\n\n\tIn a significant coup for the film, celebrated Bollywood composer trio Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy are making their Malayalam cinema debut with the soundtrack, with music rights held by T-Series.\n\n\tThe film, which is in the Malayalam language and will also release in several other Indian languages, has secured an expansive distribution network. In Kerala, Dulquer Salmaan’s Wayfarer Films will handle the release. PVR Inox Pictures has come aboard for Tamil Nadu and Karnataka distribution, while leading players are reportedly in final negotiations for Telugu and Hindi language rights. The Plot Pictures will manage international distribution.\n\n\t“We’ve spent the last two years building ‘Chatha Pacha’ from the ground up, and in that time, it’s grown from a scrappy underdog idea into a full-blown world we’ve poured our hearts into,” said producer Shihan Shoukath. “It’s loud, chaotic, full of emotion, and rooted deeply in the culture we love, but it’s also wild and genre-bending in a way that hopefully feels new.”\n\t\n\n\tRoshan Mathew added, “‘Chatha Pacha’ is unlike anything I’ve done before. The best part is, I think that’s true for most of us who are part of this film. It really is a uniquely mad idea.”\n\n\tWatch the teaser here:\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tA music documentary built entirely around one song sounds like a precious affair, but it can be a tantalizing one if the song is right. The one-song doc has now emerged as a genre, and in a small way it’s an exciting one. I dug “The Greatest Night in Pop” (2024), about the creation of “We Are the World” (though that was obviously an anomaly of a song), and also “Hallelujah: Leonard Cohen, a Journey, a Song” (2021), which explored how a tune that wasn’t even all that wonderful in the original recorded version could evolve, over time, into a transcendent global hymn.\n\t\n\n\tThe latest one-song music doc, Rick Korn’s “Harry Chapin — Cat’s in the Cradle: The Song That Changed Our Lives,” feels like it was influenced by the Cohen film. It, too, captures a song that became a hymn, one that grew larger than the artist who recorded it ever imagined, becoming part of the story of its time.\n\n\n\tYet the film’s title throws down a bit of a gauntlet. Was Harry Chapin’s “Cat’s in the Cradle” really the song that changed our lives? Having seen the movie, my short answer is yes. I mean, it’s not the only song that did that. Looking back, though, I think it changed mine, and I think it changed a lot of people’s. But not because we thought of it that way. It changed our lives because its message, for a pop song, was so original, so tender yet searing, so defining of the experience of both parents and children that you drank in the song’s plainspoken beauty, you thought about the story it was telling, and it had this weirdly large effect. Even if you first heard it as a teenager, as I did, it made you say two things to yourself: that I’m going to be a better parent than that; and that maybe I won’t. That’s the song’s enticing double meaning.\n\t\n\n\tIn 1974, Harry Chapin was an internationally known folk-rock singer with a nimbus of wavy thick hair and a cleft chin and a handsome geek grin and the voice of a romantic minstrel. He looked more like a ’70s movie actor, or the lost bohemian Kennedy brother, than a pop star (and, in fact, Chapin had worked in movies, getting nominated for an Oscar for “Legendary Champions,” a 1968 documentary about boxing that he directed). Chapin sang story-songs, drawn from his experience, that he presented as parables — like his first hit, “Taxi,” about driving a cab and picking up an old flame from his youth as a fare, and in six minutes that encounter becomes a journey through his life that’s worthy of James Joyce, or at least a great acid trip.\n\n\tChapin was earnest to a fault, but his brainy charisma made him a sexy troubadour. He was something old and new at the same time: a folk singer, but one who’d come up through the paradigm shift of the singer-songwriter boom, so his populist music was infused with a very particular sort of 1970s therapeutic confessional spirit. “Cat’s in the Cradle” was the lead single off his fourth album, “Verities & Balderdash,” and it took two months to become number one in the country. It struck a chord. In “The Song That Changed Our Lives,” we hear testimonials from an array of musicians who talk about their experience of it, from Darryl “D.M.C.” McDaniels to Billy Joel to Judy Collins to Pat Benatar to Dee Snider, who grew up as the ultimate head-banging delinquent and makes a funny point of saying, “I hated acoustic. I hated anything mellow.” But Harry Chapin spoke to him.\n\n\t“Cat’s in the Cradle” is built around an incredibly subtle and powerful psychological insight: that what we pass on to our children, the good and the bad and everything in between, happens in a karmic way. We don’t control it. Yet maybe we can guide it, even as it’s guiding us. The song tells the story of a father who has a son, who looks up to him and wants to spend time with him (“I’m gonna be like you, dad, you know I’m gonna be like you”). But the father never seems to have the time, and that’s how their relationship goes. A few verses later, the son is grown, and the father asks to see him, only now the son doesn’t have time for him. The key lines in the song would seem to be, “And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me, he’d grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.”\n\t\n\n\tYou could say the message is: As a parent, you reap what you sow. Yet part of the spellbinding quality of “Cat’s in the Cradle,” apart from what Chapin’s musician brother Steve calls the “Appalachian” modalities of its opening chords (he’s right — the song seems to emerge from some ancient folk wilderness) as well as the lyricism of the melody, is how Chapin’s voice somehow expresses both points-of-view at once. It has an edge of wounded defiance (the son wanting to know why his father wasn’t there for him). At the same time, there’s a sadness threaded through it, a stoic heartbreak that unites these two more than the time they should have spent together.\n\n\tThose of us who grew up with fathers who weren’t there for us tended to feel, at the time, like we were the only ones on the planet who had this problem. But “Cat’s in the Cradle” blasted a message out into the world: “No, children of the ’70s with daddy issues, you are not alone. And part of the club you’re in includes…the daddies themselves.” That was the mind-blower.\n\n\tIt will come as a revelation to many who watch “The Song That Changed Our Lives” that the groundbreaking lyrics of “Cat’s in the Cradle” were written by Chapin’s wife, Sandy, who is interviewed in the film (she’s a feisty 91). But, in fact, this was something Chapin talked about effusively at the time, to the point that it almost seemed part of the politics of their relationship. He was a loving husband and, back then, a “new male.” It’s not just that he gave credit; I think it was his way of acknowledging that there was something different about the song’s vantage. I wish the documentary had made more of a point of this — of exploring how and why this particular insight into fathers and sons came from a woman. I also wish the movie had mentioned how the villain of the song, if you really look at it, might be late capitalism. The father isn’t a bad guy; his son isn’t a bad guy. But no one has the time! That’s partly because, increasingly in our society, no one did (or does).\n\n\tBut, of course, that’s only part of the meaning, because the real meaning is that as a parent, even as you feel that you don’t “have the time” to be spending enough time with your kids, that is always a lame excuse. As the Beatles taught us, the love you take is equal to the love you make. As Harry and Sandy Chapin taught us, the time you have for your kids is the time you create out of your desire to be with them.\n\t\n\n\tEven Harry himself didn’t always have the time. The film kind of buries the lead by saluting his extensive charity work, then sneaking in the point that he was doing 100 benefits a year, in addition to 100 shows of his own, which meant that he was away from Sandy and his five children (two with Sandy; three adopted from her previous marriage) two out of every three nights of the year. It’s sure nice talking to you, dad! Yet the documentary demonstrates that Chapin’s kids adored him (they’re all interviewed in the film). And the fact that Harry Chapin, who died at 38 in a freak car accident that he nearly prophesized, was a less-than-perfect and even absentee father only completes the cycle of the song. The movie includes a number of YouTube reaction videos, with younger people listening to “Cat’s in the Cradle” for the first time, and their tearful responses tell the song’s real story: that when it comes to parents and children, none of us may ever feel we give enough time, and that that feeling is timeless.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“South Park” got meta on its Oct. 31 Halloween episode, as Stan voiced the dissent of some fans by saying “‘South Park’ sucks now because of all of this political shit,” referring to recent White House storylines. Of course, being that this is “South Park,” his solution was to create South Park Sucks crypto and send Kyle’s cousin Kyle Schwartz to ask Trump for protection for this memecoin scheme.\n\n\tThis led to an intersecting plot in which Trump holds a seance, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, to help rid himself of a behatted entity that’s haunting him in the White House — also known as his wife, Melania. Also spotted haunting the halls of the White House is FCC chairman Brendan Carr, wcho appeared as a Mummy after “losing his freedom of speech,” according to Stephen Miller, referring to an intentional injury Carr suffered in an earlier episode.\n\t\n\n\t“South Park” came two days late this week to deliver a Halloween special edition. The Friday night episode was titled “The Woman in the Hat.”\n\n\n\t2025’s round of “South Park” episodes has experienced several delays, date changes and even a sudden Season 28 premiere. However, future episodes are expected to resume the biweekly release schedule, with dates set for Nov. 12, Nov. 26 and Dec. 10.\n\n\tLast week’s episode continued the saga of Trump’s failing relationship with his pregnant partner, Satan. It also tackled the viral “6-7” TikTok trend, which enveloped South Park Elementary and sent Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel on a search for the Antichrist.\n",

The cast features Kuan-Ting Liu, known for his work in “A Sun” and “Old Fox,” alongside Jennifer Yu (“In Broad Daylight,” “Sisterhood”) and veteran actress Kuei-mei Yang, whose credits include “Vive L’Amour” and “Eat Drink Man Woman.”\n\t\n\n\tClifford Miu produces the project, which centers on a wedding that descends into chaos when a soon-to-be-married man discovers both of his long-separated parents have independently organized his wedding reception for the same day at the same venue — without either knowing about the other’s plans.\n\n\n\tMoebius Entertainment CEO Fred Tsui expressed enthusiasm about reuniting with Miu after they previously worked together on “American Girl.”\n\n\t“Clifford’s films have a rare blend of humor, empathy, and cross-cultural resonance,” said Tsui. “‘Double Happiness’ captures the chaos and warmth of modern Asian family life in a way that feels both universal and deeply personal. We’re excited to introduce it to distributors across the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] region.”\n\n\tThe sales agreement was finalized at the Tokyo festival, marking another step in Moebius’s expansion at international markets as the company continues emphasizing quality filmmaking from Asian directors.\n\n\tThe company is currently handling worldwide sales for Chinese title “Wild Nights, Tamed Beasts,” which secured a direction award for Wang Tong at the Rome film festival after previously winning the jury grand prize and best actress for Regina Wang at the Shanghai International Film Festival, plus best script and best actor at the First Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\tMoebius’s roster includes Peter Chan’s “She Has No Name” and “She Has a Name,” Philip Yung’s “Papa,” Jame Hung’s “My First of May” and Nick Cheung’s “Peg O’ My Heart.”\n\n\tThe Hong Kong-based operation focuses on bringing auteur-driven and commercially viable Asian films to international buyers, building bridges between regional filmmakers and worldwide audiences through strategic festival programming and market positioning.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBarunson E&A, the production and distribution studio behind “Parasite,” reaffirmed that sharply rising production costs and slowing film revenue in Korea are driving local producers to pivot towards global co-production.\n\n\tYoonhee Choi, CEO of Barunson E&A, noted the challenge facing the industry at a seminar on international co-production at TIFFCOM, the market arm of the Tokyo International Film Festival. \n\n\n\t“In Korea, the film industry has been struggling, and at the same time, the production costs have risen significantly,” said Choi. “As labor costs and general prices have gone up, average production costs have increased across the board. Since the profit from films has decreased, these investments are becoming more difficult.”\n\t\n\n\tThe studio has expanded its business into international markets, with a slate of completed films from Taiwan (“Miss Shampoo”), Vietnam (“Don’t Cry Butterfly”) and Indonesia (“Rangga & Cinta”).\n\n\tOf particular interest to Barunson E&A is the Indonesian market.\n\n\t“The country we have been working with the most recently is Indonesia. The reason is that Indonesia is currently the fastest-growing country in the world, and it still has a lot of room for further growth,” said Choi.\n\n\t“Many talented new directors are emerging in Indonesia. In the past, the genres of successful films were limited to horror, religious dramas, and so on, but recently there is a demand for diverse films, and new talented directors who bring us such projects,” she added.\n\n\tTo solidify its commitment, the company recently signed a two-year slate deal with acclaimed Indonesian director Joko Anwar. Barunson E&A is handling overseas sales for the director’s upcoming “Ghost in the Cell.”\n\t\n\n\tTogether with fellow panellist, Japanese producer Kawai Shinya (“Ring,” “Yi Yi”), Choi also offered insights into the sophisticated campaign strategy that propelled “Parasite” to become the first non-English-language film to win Best Picture.\n\n\t“From the start, we chose overseas distributors that could participate in the Oscar campaign, companies with the experience, the passion and the will to somehow elevate this film,” said Choi. “After winning the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, we immediately started the Oscar campaign in collaboration with the U.S. distributor Neon.\n\n\t“The Academy campaign is almost like an election campaign. We constantly had to create a justification and basis for Academy to vote for this film. At the time, there was a great drive towards diverse films in the U.S., and director Bong Joon Ho ran a very compelling campaign targeted at Academy members, which I believe contributed to the success.”\n\n\tKawai offered a stark counterpoint, reflecting on the inexperienced mistakes that led to the failure of the Academy Awards campaign in 2000, for Edward Yang’s “Yi Yi: A One and a Two,” which had won best director at Cannes.\n\n\tDespite the film’s critical acclaim, Kawai realized too late that the film was ineligible for the Academy Awards.\n\n\t“After we won best foreign film from the LA Film Critics Association, I looked at the Academy Award requirements and found a stipulation that a film must be screened for at least two weeks in its home country by the end of December,” said Kawai. “It was already late when I found out, but we decided to try anyway. We hastily screened Edward Yang’s film for one run in Shibuya in December.”\n\n\tDespite the effort, the film failed to be nominated for the Academy Award because of another technicality.\n\n\t“We had considered it a co-production, and since the producer was Japanese and most of the financing was Japanese, we thought it would be defined as a Japanese film,” continued Kawai. “However, ultimately, because the director was Taiwanese and most of the locations were in Taiwan, it was judged to be a Taiwanese film. Since it had not been screened in Taiwan, it was deemed ineligible.”\n\n\tKawai also had choice words for Japan’s unique Production Committee (seisaku Iinkai) financing system, where committees of companies with gather to invest and share risks.\n\t\n\n\tKawai was a lead producer for the 2004 film “Rikidozan”, which was planned as a JPY700 million ($4.5 million) co-production evenly split between Japan and Korean investors.\n\n\t“As the script was being developed, one of the five companies in the Japanese Production Committee said the story was bad. The biggest investor said they absolutely couldn’t do it and pulled out. When one member of the Production Committee pulls out, everyone else pulls out. I felt terrible for the Korean side at that time, but all of Japan’s half of the money ended up being covered entirely by the Korean side, CJ.” said Kawai.\n\n\tHe lamented the inability for quick decision making under the Production Committee system.\n\n\t“You need the ability to immediately answer, a producer who can make a judgment. The Production Committee system, on the other hand, requires unanimous agreement to move forward. It has its advantages, like risk hedging and using your own media companies for promotion, but when working with overseas partners, issues like speed always arise.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSchuyler Weiss opened his masterclass at an MPA event during the Tokyo International Film Festival‘s TIFFCOM market by tackling the most frequently asked question in his career: What does a producer actually do?\n\n\tComparing himself to “a sort of cartoon sheepdog, endlessly moving the flock forward together, unrelentingly driven, but always relentlessly positive,” Weiss emphasized the protective nature of producing. “Above all, protective of the group, and most importantly, protective of the entire creative endeavor,” he said during the session.\n\t\n\n\tThe producer, who has worked with Baz Luhrmann for approximately 20 years, described filmmaking as an exercise in balance and tension. “The most quintessential tension of all in show business is probably between art and commerce,” Weiss said. “You can’t have one without the other. You can’t tell stories for no one, and yet to try and convene people together to watch a movie that has no art and has no soul, has no story at the center of it is a hollow exercise.”\n\n\n\tWeiss began his film career as a production assistant at the Australian Film Television and Radio School, landing his first job by signing up on a clipboard. His assignment: defending 20 parking spaces during peak hour on a Sydney street corner at 4 a.m., armed with parking cones, an orange vest and a clipboard. “From that moment on, I was hooked,” he said, watching the film crew assemble around him piece by piece.\n\n\tWorking on “Australia” with Luhrmann provided his comprehensive education in filmmaking, from script development through global marketing. The experience included memorable moments like karaoke with Hugh Jackman and the local Fox distribution team at 2 a.m. after the Tokyo premiere. “Unfortunately, I don’t have a photo of that,” Weiss said.\n\t\n\n\tThe journey convinced him he “never wanted to just go back to one part, one slice” of the filmmaking process. To achieve this goal as a producer, Weiss moved to New York City and started making low-budget independent films. “When you have no money, you have to just work it out,” he said of making ultra-low-budget movies in the U.S. independent system.\n\n\tHe produced approximately half a dozen indie films, several premiering at Sundance, including “Piercing,” based on a Japanese novel by Murakami Ryu. Weiss described his career philosophy of alternating between different types of challenges: “Pushing yourself to keep up with a fast moving herd with great experience and great power” versus having “no one with whom to keep up, no one even noticing whether you’re going to succeed or fail, except yourself.”\n\n\tAbout capturing musical performances on film, Weiss detailed the extensive preparation required for “Elvis.” The team began recording with Austin Butler in Nashville’s RCA studio — where Elvis himself recorded — approximately a year before shooting began in Australia. “We’re not big believers in capturing music performances live on set,” Weiss explained. “Preparation is everything. You really have to take some big leaps, because you’re committing to creative decisions about the music well before you film anything.”\n\n\tThe production created a hybrid musical language blending Elvis’s original vocals with Butler’s voice. For 1950s material, recorded in mono and unsuitable for modern Atmos theater sound, the production used exclusively Butler’s vocals. For later concert footage with multi-track Elvis recordings, they often blended both voices. “Focus 100% of your energy on set to capturing the visual side of that performance, and then you can continue to build on it in the post production process, musically,” Weiss advised.\n\n\tThe approach proved so successful that Weiss applied similar techniques to his subsequent film “How to Make Gravy,” a sub-$10 million independent Australian production starring Daniel Henshall. For a prison choir sequence, the team pre-recorded complex arrangements that would have been impossible to capture live on set.\n\n\t“Elvis” faced unique challenges filming during the pandemic, particularly recreating a performer whose “signature move is to get down from the stage in the audience and kiss just about every member of the audience you can find.” The production invented solutions including an “extras antibacterial mouthwash station.” Weiss credited closed borders with creating unexpected benefits: “There was something about making a film in this kind of perfect isolation and perfect focus that I think produced an extraordinary result.”\n\t\n\n\tThe marketing challenges extended beyond production. As the then-head of Warner Brothers marketing told Weiss, “he was going to be damned if he was going to make Austin a star with this movie and then have the next guy reap the benefits when Austin became a star.” The strategy succeeded, placing Butler on the cover of every major magazine worldwide before release. “He was a household name by the time we rolled out the movie,” Weiss said. The film earned a standing ovation at Cannes and grossed over $300 million globally.\n\n\tWeiss previewed “EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert,” a documentary culled from approximately 60 boxes of never-before-seen footage from Elvis concerts between 1970 and 1972. Luhrmann traveled to Wellington to work with Peter Jackson on restoration, syncing lost audio from work prints. The documentary features approximately 40 minutes of previously unheard Elvis dialogue. “Baz committed himself to having Elvis narrate the film. So it really is Elvis singing and telling his own stories,” Weiss said. The Imax-finished film releases worldwide through Universal Pictures and Neon in late February.\n\n\tOn artificial intelligence, Weiss revealed the “Elvis” team used machine learning techniques approximately a decade ago, before the term AI became common. To insert Butler into classic Elvis films, they partnered with the University of Adelaide’s technology lab rather than major VFX companies, who “weren’t really thinking along those lines.” “We weren’t calling it AI, and we had to look outside our own business to do it,” he noted.\n\n\tToday, Weiss and Luhrmann use AI as a creative tool for concept imagery and iteration, though never in finished film products. “Baz knows the difference between creative and generative, and AI is just a derivative tool that can collage a seemingly infinite, but actually finite bunch of stuff. That’s not creativity.”\n\n\tLooking ahead to Luhrmann’s “Joan of Arc” biopic starring 18-year-old English actress Isla Johnson, Weiss positioned the project as a response to uncertain times in Hollywood. “The only way to continue to do that is to come back to where we began: to believe in original storytelling and believe that, that will win the day,” he said.\n\n\tThe story of a 17-year-old girl in a “fractured and devastated world, her country on its knees, and the future for young people completely uncertain,” with her fate “held tightly in the knobbly fingered grip of a bunch of the entrenched powers,” feels timely. “Her ability as a 17-year-old girl to break that world wide open and recapture the future for France at a time of change and peril, feels like a story that people might see something in today.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production aims to begin pre-production next year, with shooting by mid-2026. Weiss acknowledged budget negotiations with Warner Brothers are ongoing, joking that if they don’t reach agreement, “we’re going to be making the 1928 ‘Trial of Joan of Arc.'” The 1928 silent film by Carl Theodor Dreyer remains “one of the most poignant and poetic tellings of the story,” Weiss said, adding “we carry the spirit of that in our hearts as we try and make our own” version.\n\n\tOn IP dominance in contemporary cinema, Weiss drew historical parallels. “There was a time, if you can believe it, when the most sure fire commercial kind of movie that you could make was a Western,” he noted. “Taste is a funny thing that way. The IP boom in the Marvel comic book sense definitely seems to be waning.”\n\n\tWeiss sees opportunity in the current transitional moment between commercial trends: “If we are truly finding ourselves in that slightly liminal state between big commercial trends, that’s a great opportunity in which I think original storytelling can really flourish.”\n\n\tAfter “Elvis,” Weiss recommitted to working in Australia and collaborating throughout the Asia Pacific region. Bazmark is developing projects with an animation company in Tokyo and a record label in Seoul. “The more that we can connect the dots between what we do in the Gold Coast, Australia, all throughout this region, we feel like we are so excited to play even a small part in the enormous global cultural potential of the APAC region,” he said.\n\n\tOn distribution challenges for smaller films like “How to Make Gravy” — based on a popular Australian song but difficult to sell internationally despite featuring Hugo Weaving — Weiss acknowledged the landscape has changed. “We’ve broken down a lot of the old systems for disseminating and distributing independent cinema around the world,” he said. “We’re in a challenging spot right now.”\n\n\tHowever, Weiss encouraged emerging filmmakers to embrace democratized tools. “The barrier to entry for so many different things is sort of reduced almost to the floor,” he said, noting that Hollywood studios spend millions trying to optimize what individuals can accomplish through Instagram and TikTok. “You have all the same tools that Warner Brothers has in terms of communicating their movie through digital marketing.”\n\t\n\n\tOn cultural authenticity versus internationalization, Weiss advocated for leaning into specificity. “The stories that lean into greater authenticity and are less concerned as to whether a broad international audience is going to pick up every single reference” succeed globally, he argued, citing Korean cinema and the Australian animated series “Bluey.” “People readily consume content that wasn’t necessarily made with an international audience in mind, and people like it all the more for it,” Weiss concluded.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIs there such a thing as… an intimate arena? That may seem like the type of oxymoron that could only belong to the show-biz hype lexicon. But plenty of southern Californians would swear that it’s true, once they’ve been to the Acrisure Arena in Palm Desert, which in its three years open has turned into a sort of destination venue for music fans who like to see a superstar tour in a venue that’s just a little less than super-sized. That holds true not just for the local population of Coachella Valley residents but concertgoers from Los Angeles and even farther afield who, for now, consider it an almost well-kept secret of an alternative venue for certain tours. It’s worth a couple of hours on the freeway, for some, to see a Paul McCartney in a place where no seat counts as a nosebleed.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s kinda like the three little bears,” says John Page, senior VP of Acrisure Arena and the Coachella Valley Firebirds, the hockey team that plays there when Blink 182 isn’t. At a concert capacity of about 10,000 — about a third bigger than the Greek, but smaller by at least a third than the Forum, Crypto, Intuit Dome or Hollywood Bowl — “it’s not too big and it’s not too small.”\n\n\n\tBut what’s in it for the artists who deign to perform a show there, in addition to the larger SoCal markets? For starters, there’s just the ability to squeeze in one that’s just far enough from L.A. to not fall afoul of radius clauses for those other arenas. But more significantly, for some artists, there’s the ability to start a tour there and have rehearsals for days ahead of time in a place that — to borrow the three bears language, again — is not too far away from but also not too close to the watchful eyes of Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tSome of that was coming into play in September when the Acrisure Arena had a busier-than-usual period of what it called its “magnificent seven.” Over a two-week period, the venue put on what was the official tour opening for McCartney and the official tour closing for the Who (the latter’s final U.S. show ever, supposedly) in a matter of three days, providing strong evidence that the Palm Springs area offers the kind of creature comforts that make it appealing to hang around either right before or right after a major tour. In that same two-week time span, the arena also was the home for two Blink 182 concerts, a Maroon 5 show, a pre-season game for the Los Angeles Lakers, and the home season opener for the Firebirds, who are effectively the house band for the venue.\n\n\tIn attracting top-name talent for a venue just a little off the beaten track, it has not hurt that one of the principals in this Oak View Group development is veteran manager-mogul Irving Azoff, whose early bookings of a couple of his own clients there  — the Eagles and Harry Styles — surely acted as bait for other A-listers to know that they could do potential sellouts there, too.\n\n\tOn the night of McCartney’s show at the Acrisure, Azoff is holding court with a reporter alongside the backstage mini-mini golf course that is part of the Silvercrest Artist Compound lounge, which basically is this arena’s equivalent of the Forum Club. He’s explaining the origins of the place.\n\n\t“I’ve had a house here for many, many, many years and own a golf course with my partner here, and it’s been my winter place,” Azoff is saying. “So I know it well, and it just felt like the Coachella Valley was underserved. There became an opportunity to do something with the American Hockey League team, the B-team for the Kraken, who have been wildly successful. I think we’ve been pretty much the highest-grossing and attended American Hockey League team for three straight years. So the market supports it. The Lakers love to come down here for preseason and it sells right out. We do college football in November — Michigan State, Arizona, that rivalry. And then for concerts, you don’t make as much money here as you might at a stadium in L.A., but it’s a great stop for people. The building looks great, it sounds great…\n\t\n\n\tHe is interrupted by a visitor — his client, John Mayer. The rock star, suddenly aware that it’s an interview situation he’s stepped into, just takes over as formal interlocutor for a minute.\n\n\t“To what do you attribute this success right now you’re having at the arena?” Mayer asks, playing reporter. “It’s not in L.A. Do you think that Coachella has had something to do with sort of priming people’s minds? Has the Coachella trip sort of embedded that in the culture, coming out to Palm Springs to see a show?”\n\n\tAzoff is too amused to answer until Mayer takes his leave, but yes, he agrees, the answer was embedded in the musician’s question, or at least part of it was. “We get people from L.A., and San Diego’s just as close, as you know, and we get some Phoenix…” And beyond. “People like to travel, as the phenomenon people traveling for a Taylor Swift show proved, that the fans will come to you. And first of all, it’s the best winter weather in the country here, so people who come for a concert aren’t all coming just to go to a concert. There’s a lot to do down here.”\n\n\tPage, interviewed separately, says the geotargeting can be wildly different from show to show (or sporting event to sporting event). “It varies. The first show that we really dug into on this was Harry Styles. When we pulled our purchase metrics, I think it was between 3-5% of the purchasers for the two shows were from the Coachella Valley. And then the balance were from all over the place. We had 3-5% international buyers, as well.” On the opposite end of that scale, “certain events like our Latin/Hispanic shows are, I would say, 90% local.” \n\n\tWhat’s the attraction for out-of-towners, besides the chance to budget time to stay over one or two nights at a place with a nice pool (and maybe  a date shake at Hadley’s on the way)? Even for those who plan to make the trip from the greater L.A. area or back without a hotel stay — maybe most of all for those who don’t have a mini-vacation as part of the plan — there’s just the mere fact that a tour that may be sold out or only have terrible or pricy seats left “in town” may have better and more affordable tickets in Palm Desert. \n\n\t…And, that once inside, first-timers are inevitably surprised by how un-vast the auditorium feels, compared to Crypto, Intuit, et al. Describing it as living-room-like might be a stretch, but there’s no doubt that everyone who enters who’s used to the size and scope of major tours in L.A. knows they are benefitting from being in a secondary market that’s thisclose to a metropolis.\n\t\n\n\tThe difference in scale is part-real, part illusory. The Acrisure Arena has the same basic footprint as those bigger arenas. It just basically has what you’d consider the loge level as the only level, above the floor. (There’s a row of suites on top that has its own concourse and dining and seats 800 high-rollers, but it’s almost easy to miss.)\n\n\tAzoff explains how this size and shape came to be, partly out of practicality for this being a smaller market, and partly for other reasons.\n\n\t“There’s not a bad seat in this house,” Azoff explains, “because, ostensibly, it’s two-thirds of an arena. It’s just that we didn’t put the third deck on, because we didn’t think the demand was there. Well, we couldn’t have gotten permission to, anyway,” he adds, slightly correcting himself, “because it’s in a flight lane. Unless we wanted to dig the building down, that’s as high as we could build.” One man’s zoning restriction is another man’s intimacy-maker.\n\n\tIt would stand to reason that, with attendance necessarily cut down by a third or more from the biggest venues in L.A., tickets might need to cost more for everyone to meet their nut. But looking at ticket prices doesn’t necessarily bear that out. At least, there can be a lower-get-in-the-door cost than at L.A. shows, even if things tend to even out up top. One factor cited by some sources is a lack of union costs that affect ticket prices in major markets. There’s also a desire to look at the wide range of working-class to upper-upper-class residents in the Coachella Valley and have a price point for everyone, to fill the seats.\n\n\t“Even though we’re smaller,” says Page, “sometimes we have more price levels than some venues of our size just because they want to make sure that there’s enough pricing disparity to cover the people from Indio or Coachella as well as the people that are living in some of these country club communities in Indian Wells, La Quinta and Rancho Mirage. Everybody has really gathered enough information, now that we are going into our fourth year, so that they can create the right pricing dynamic so that everybody wins and, at the end of the day, everybody has an opportunity to get a fair-price ticket to see a first-rate artist. … You’ve got tremendous wealth in many cases (in the area). And then you’ve got an incredible blue-collar workforce that just loves to have an arena in their marketplace where they don’t have to drive two hours to see first-rate entertainment or sporting events. So, we punch above our weight in ability to take a gross to make sure that we can take care of a Harry Styles guarantee or a Paul McCartney date or the Who or having two Blink 182 shows.”\n\t\n\n\tLatin-focused entertainment, which, as noted above, draws more significantly from the Valley than most other types of shows, is a significant draw.\n\n\t“We just had Ana Gabrielle last month, second time through the marketplace, and she sold more tickets this time than the first time,” says Page. “We’ve had Peso Pluma two times. We just put Ricardo Arjona on sale. We’ve had a wide variety of Latin artists, some that of that new genre of music coming up, and then some of the older artists that have got such a tremendous following, like Los Tigres Del Norte.” Palomazo Norteño just performed, and the schedule for upcoming shows includes Jorge Medina and Josi Cuén.\n\n\tIt also includes Duran Duran, Cardi B, Tate McRae and “Gabby’s Dollhouse Live.” And hockey. Lots and lots of hockey.\n\n\t“Hockey in the desert” was considered a folly by some prior to opening, but as it turns out, there are a lot of “snowbirds” from Canada as well as the northern U.S. who are happy to buy season tickets and get cold for just a couple of hours a night and that’s it. (Beyond all the aforementioned demographics, the arena’s operators also count on drawing patrons from Riverside and the Inland Empire, who, faced with the choice of driving an equal distance to L.A. to the west or Palm Springs to the east, might favor the show or game with the least traffic at the point of destination.)\n\n\tProof-of-concept came when the arena did $36 million in gross ticket sales in its first six months after opening in December 2022.\n\n\tSays Page, “Our first three seasons, we’ve been the leader for the most part in most of the metrics that the American Hockey League recognizes — season ticket revenue, paid attendance. We’ve been number one or two in total attendance from the start and the inception of this team. But we’re constantly changing and evolving as well. For most (locals), we were starting to really understand that their threshold was coming to 36 games. So we made some really nice changes for our fans, like having intentional game plans. We’ve made some adjustments on our parking prices. We’re actually going to a 6:30 p.m. start for our weekday games, to really kind of give the families an opportunity to get here early and get home so they get their kids to bed, or, if you’re from an older demographic, you can get home before 10 now.”\n\t\n\n\t“Our analysis from a hockey perspective” was valuable for overall planning, says Page. “If you look at just the static population here between the nine communities, it’s approximately 500,000. And when you compare us to the rest of the American Hockey League, we’re the third-smallest market. But from 500,00 permanent residents, this market doubles to north of a million people once you get into the end of October through the 1st of May. So summertime’s slow, but even then there’s still this great core people that are desiring entertainment, and we’re providing that. But when it swells, it’s a completely different animal. It truly morphs for that five- to six-month period. So it’s a real interesting market that we’re constantly learning more about all the time.”\n\n\tThe off-season is when it’s best for someone like a McCartney to come in and build in time for set-up and rehearsals for an entire tour. He’s not the first to do so; Olivia Rodrigo did the same, rehearsing and starting her first arena tour here at the beginning of 2024. The building isn’t so busy, if hockey isn’t around, that they can’t turn the venue over to a superstar for a bit for whatever they need to do, in a lot of cases. \n\n\t“When we began discussions a couple years ago about the potential to have Sir Paul here at the building, we went through all the amenities and providing enough time for them to come in and do technical rehearsals, band rehearsals, whatever it may be,” Page says. “We carved out a full week, and even a couple days after the date, just so that they could have enough time to do what they needed on the front end and take their time on the back end, whether that was loading trucks or going through some of the technical aspects of the tour so they could have everything buttoned up before they went onto their next stop. So, we want to accommodate as much as we can.”\n\n\tAzoff also emphasizes what a nice landing spot it makes for artists about to go visit an intinerary’s worth of places with fewer creature comforts to come. “As a manager,” he says, “I just give everybody the building to rehearse. If the days are dark, just take it. Costs here are way lower, and the ambience is great. Even though it’s a smaller building, you can hang your full production. Like, Paul’s production is the same production he’ll hang in Vegas at Allegiant Stadium a few nights later. So it’s a great, great place to start.” \n\t\n\n\tAs for the Coachella connection… there isn’t one, apart from, as Mayer said, getting all of Los Angeles and its surroundings used to the driveability of the area. They’d like to change that, down the road.\n\n\t“Our biggest issue with respect to radius clauses is the two Coachellas and Stagecoach,” says Page. “We get into that time period now that they’ve announced the Coachella and Stagecoach participants. We try to kind of counterprogram around that. We’d love to do more with Paul Tollette and AEG on that. But, you know, it is what it is. We understand what they’ve created, and we want to be here if they want to look at putting something in here as well during that timeframe.”\n\n\tAlthough the venues aren’t on the same scale, there is casino competition, particularly from the Yaamava’ midway between L.A. and Palm Springs in Highland, which offers a really intimate experience for fans of some of the acts who play arenas, with limited enough seating that the get-in-the-door price can be more daunting. Says Page, “We firmly believe that you can play a Yaamava’ Theater and then play the Acrisure Arena as well. It’s one plus one is three in my mind, for the artists that can do two (extra) play dates and not skip a market. Those are things that, going into our fourth year, we will continue to push and explain to people and hopefully get them on board with their routing and touring programming.”\n\n\tAzoff wishes the area around the Acrisure had more of the development they foresaw, but there have been snags in that. “There’s been a couple false starts on people building sound stages down here, and recording studios. It’s really hard to develop stuff down here. There’s real problems getting power and infrastructure, because it’s exploded. There’s been an inability to develop around the arena because you can’t get entitlements here because there’s flood plane issues, there’s power issues. You know, we would’ve built more. There should have been a hotel here already, and we would’ve built out rehearsal spaces.\n\n\t“But,” he says, not to complain, “this thing’s here to stay. It’s great.” And if there’s a lack of development immediately surrounding the arena, still? It only makes it seem more oasis-like, which is the feeling a lot of desert travelers will have once they step inside from the heat to see a Beatle in a very sub-Shea Stadium situation.\n",

We built the costume together — a little father-son Halloween teamwork.\"\n      \n    \n          But it's pretty clear Justin is giving a nod to Katy ... he mentioned he's \"to his left\" and the left shark was the one most folks remember from her Super Bowl performance.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Bonus points for the homemade costume and the throwback pop culture reference!!!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Katy Perry\n              \n                          \n                Justin Trudeau\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Super Bowl\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Halloween\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\t“We might be small, but we’re quick, flexible, and deeply committed, and that approach makes us truly competitive”,” said the Estonian Film Institute CEO Edith Sepp, as more than 1,700 accredited guests from over 50 countries are pouring into town for the biggest film bash of the year – the Black Nights Film Festival and Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event.\n\n\tSepp is particularly proud of her country’s post-production facilities and crew, “highly skilled, inventive and a pleasure to work with,” she says. “The facilities in Tallinn can handle everything from sound and color to visual effects and the quality is world-class. Our competitiveness is best illustrated by our company Frost FX, which received an Emmy Award for special visual effects in the HBO series “The Penguin,” a great example of how Estonian talent continues to shine globally,’ she insists.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the Estonian Film Institute, the cash rebate, notably to post-production only, is a unique advantage, perhaps not so well-known abroad.\n\n\n\tTo access post-production support, submissions must be made via a local company. The minimum spend is €30,000 ($34,000) to benefit from a 20% tax rebate on eligible production costs, €50,000 ($57,800) for that rebate to reach 25% and €80,000 ($92,000) to be eligible for the maximum 30% rebate available, according to Film Estonia guidelines.\n\n\tRecent projects that have used solely Film Estonia’s post-production incentive include the Finnish crime show “All the Sins” (Seasons 1, 2, 3) produced by MRP Matila Röhr Productions. Post-services carried out ranged from offline editing by Tambet Tasuja, visual effects by Frost FX, and trailers and creation of promo clips and trailers by Tallinn Postworks, according to Estonian co-production outfit Taska Film.\n\t\n\n\tAnother beneficiary was the Icelandic film “Driving Mum” by Hilmar Oddsson, co-produced by Estonia’s Alexandra Film, which hired Estonian sound designers, editor Hendrik Mägar (also attached to Anna Hinds’ Sundance winner “Smoke Sauna Sisterhood”) and composer Tõnu Kõrvits. The latter scooped best original score for the film at the 2022 Black Nights Film Festival where “Driving Mum” scored the Grand Prize.\n\n\t“Post has become the talk of town and separating it from production spend at home, to access foreign incentives, is becoming widespread,” said film commissioner Nele Paves who handles Film Estonia’s total €6.2 million ($7.1 million) annual cash rebate.\n\n\t“We are super quick, transparent and flexible. We offer auditing after the production, giving rebates then, so that producers don’t have to wait for the last bits of post-production. Decisions and rebates can be obtained within a month, which is unusual for a public fund,” she stressed.\n\n\tShe is now lobbying the Estonian government to up the 30% cap cash rebate, and to open it up to national productions. “We need to keep our talent, and make our incentives even more competitive. Politicians need convincing but we’re hopeful for 2026,” she said.\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe second season of German romance series “Maxton Hall — The World Between Us” has hit the No. 1 spot globally on Amazon Prime Video, just days aft",
    "body": "\n\tThe second season of German romance series “Maxton Hall — The World Between Us” has hit the No. 1 spot globally on Amazon Prime Video, just days after its launch.\n\n\tAccording to data from FlixPatrol, after Season 2 launched on Nov. 7, “Maxton Hall” became the top series in 42 key markets including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Australia, Italy, Spain and Canada. It has been the top show in the U.S. every day since Sunday, and also entered the top three in 51 markets. This marks the best performance for a returning season within three days since the Season 3 debut of fellow Prime Video hit “The Summer I Turned Pretty.”  \n\t\n\n\t“Maxton Hall,” produced by Fremantle‘s UFA, follows Ruby Bell (Harriet Herbig-Matten), a scholarship student at elite private school Maxton Hall who witnesses an explosive secret between her professor and the sister of wealthy heir James Beaufort (Damian Hardung). James tries to silence Ruby, but their clash turns into an unexpected romance that is complicated by social status and family drama. The series is directed by Martin Schreier, with UFA Fiction’s Markus Brunnemann and Ceylan Yildirim executive producing alongside producer Valentin Debler. Based on Mona Kasten’s bestselling novel series “Save You,” “Maxton Hall” is written by Yildirim with Juliana Lima Dehne and Marlene Melchior in the writers’ room.\n\n\n\t“This season explores the universal longing for connection — not only through Ruby and James but also through Lydia’s search for love with Graham Sutton and the intertwined stories of our ensemble. Some characters will face challenges that push them to their limits, revealing new facets of their personalities,” Yildirim tells Variety. “Martin Schreier’s direction brings this vision to life with breathtaking sensitivity. His aesthetic, combined with the dreamlike imagery of our DOP Martin Schlecht, creates a magnetic pull that draws audiences deep into the emotional landscapes of our characters. Every frame, from sweeping cinematic moments to intimate close-ups, reflects the heart of this story: resilience, vulnerability and the courage to love. My hope is that the series reminds viewers that love is always worth fighting for — even when the world around us begins to falter. I’m proud and thrilled that the second season resonates just as strongly — if not even more — as the first.”\n\t\n\n\tSeason 1 of “Maxton Hall” became a global sensation, leading to an immediate Season 2 greenlight (the show was also renewed for a third season ahead of Season 2’s launch). According to Amazon data, “Maxton Hall” had the largest first week of global viewership for an international original in Prime Video history. Since Season 1 launched in May 2024, “Maxton Hall” has charted as the No. 1 show on Prime Video in 82 countries and within the top 10 in 112 countries, according to FlixPatrol. It has also been in the Prime Video top 10 every day in at least one country, including over 500 days in the top 10 in its home of Germany. \n\n\t“The great deal of commitment and passion from many highly creative, highly motivated people at Prime Video and UFA Fiction, and of course from our talented cast and team is truly overwhelming,” Brunnemann said. “We are very much aware of the responsibility that comes with it: the second season was expected worldwide, and we didn’t want to disappoint any of the fans. That’s why we remain true to the core while also sharpening what the series stands for: great emotions, passion, heart and a consistently cinematic look. This is for all those who love ‘Maxton Hall – The World Between Us.’ And we are now very happy that our second season is being so well received worldwide.”\n\n\tThe success of “Maxton Hall” Season 2 follows a particularly fruitful period for Fremantle, with a string of hits including “Hotel Costeria” starring Jesse Williams on Prime Video and Netflix series like Stefano Sollima’s “Monster of Florence” and Chad Michael Murray drama “Sullivan’s Crossing” — all of which reached the No. 1 spot on their respective streamers. \n\n\t“I am extremely proud of our recent results across our drama slate,” said Andrea Scrosati, group chief operating officer and CEO of continental Europe at Fremantle. “The global successes of ‘Maxton Hall’ from UFA Fiction and ‘Hotel Costeria’ from Lux Vide on Amazon Prime; alongside ‘Monster of Florence’ from The Apartment and AlterEgo and ‘Sullivan’s Crossing’ on Netflix is a testament to the Fremantle business — all our teams, and our creatives who imagine, create and deliver a diverse range of content designed to connect with audiences across the world. The audience reaction and appreciation are ultimately the most important matrix to our success — reaffirming our strategy and the direction in which we are heading.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscar winner Michelle Yeoh will be awarded an honorary Golden Bear at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\tThe “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Wicked” star will be lauded at the fest’s opening ceremony on Feb. 12 for her contributions to cinema. Yeoh served on the Berlinale international jury in 1999 and has presented several films there, including “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” (2000) and “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022), which won her the Academy Award for best actress.\n\t\n\n\t“Berlin has always held a special place in my heart,” Yeoh said in a statement. “It was one of the first festivals to embrace my work with such warmth and generosity. Returning after all these years, in recognition of my journey in cinema, feels truly meaningful.” \n\n\n\tAdded festival director Tricia Tuttle: “Michelle Yeoh is a visionary artist and performer whose work defies boundaries — whether geographic, linguistic or cinematic. Her commanding presence, fearless artistic choices and unmistakable style have left a lasting impression on generations of filmmakers and fans at the Berlinale and across the globe.” \n\n\tYeoh first earned recognition for Hong Kong action films like “Yes, Madam” (1985), “Magnificent Warriors” (1987), “Police Story 3: Super Cop” (1992) and “Wing Chun” (1994), in which she performed all her own stunts. She broke through globally in 1997 with her role as secret agent Wai Lin in the James Bond film “Tomorrow Never Dies” alongside Pierce Brosnan and continued to captivate audiences in Ang Lee’s epic martial arts romance “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” in 2000. After supporting roles in films like the megahit “Crazy Rich Asians” and Marvel’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” Yeoh became the first performer of Asian descent to take home the Oscar for best actress with “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” \n\t\n\n\tYeoh is currently gearing up to reprise her role as Madame Morrible in “Wicked: For Good,” which releases in theaters on Nov. 21. Up next, she will lead the “Blade Runner 2099” series for Amazon Prime Video. \n\n\tBerlin Film Festival is set to run from Feb. 12 to 22, 2026.  \n",

    "body": "\n\tIn recent years, Estonia has been solidifying itself as a key destination for international productions in the Baltics. The country, alongside neighboring Latvia and Lithuania, first introduced filming incentives about a decade ago, with Estonia setting itself apart from many competitors with a 30% cash rebate targeting post-production. Notable projects to hold post-production in the country include Christopher Nolan’s epic “Tenet” and HBO’s “The Penguin,” which earned an Emmy for Estonia’s leading company Frost FX. \n\t\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety, Frost FX founder Marko Post says that, although volumes have gotten smaller since COVID, the industry in Estonia “has definitely changed” since then. “It has gotten more dynamic in the sense that U.S. clients are more open to outsourcing from Eastern Europe, and I feel the perception of our studios has gotten better internationally,” he says. “In terms of demands, there has been a huge change in the rise of social media and new formats.”\n\n\n\tUku Toomet owns Orbital Vox Studios, dedicated to audio, film, dubbing, VFX and general post-production work. With a quarter of a century of experience, Orbital is the most established studio in the country and, earlier this year, inaugurated another location to attend to growing demand. “The premises we just moved into can meet the expectations of any project from anywhere, be it from a logistical or technical point of view,” says Toomet, adding that he and his peers are hopeful post-production will continue to grow in Estonia. \n\n\t“The new studios have amazed foreign producers,” he adds, saying there has been an increased interest from international players to visit facilities in Estonia. Earlier this year, Variety reported on how Estonia is paving the way in terms of studio facilities in the region. The $25 million Tallinnfilm, funded by the Cultural Endowment of Estonia, will be Tallinn’s first world-class studio. With three studios covering 38,000 sq. feet, the space is aiming to be ready in early 2027. In Eastern Estonia, the $18.2 million Ida Hub studio complex is due to open early 2026 and will include a 21,000-square-foot soundstage and a smaller multifunctional studio. It will also house production training facilities.\n\t\n\n\tSound designer Tanel Kadalipp, also the director of the Audio Engineering department at Baltic Film, Media and Arts School, notes Estonia has traditionally “had a lot of great sound editors working internationally, and their contacts have accelerated our industry.” Working in direct contact with the new generation, Kadalipp says professionals are “getting better every year.” \n\n\t“Technology has grown a lot and made things much easier to access and learn,” he adds. “Last week I did ADR with a team in the Netherlands, and the projects were synced digitally. The team was sitting in the studio in the Netherlands, seeing everything and directing, and we were here in Estonia working together. It is very easy to work internationally today.”\n\n\tPost echoes that thought, emphasizing his U.S. clients have often praised the “efficiency” of Estonian teams, as well as the ease of access to team leaders. “A long chain of communication is a very annoying and normalized thing in the U.S. when a shorter communication line is much more efficient,” he adds. “Of course, there is the problem of the time zones, different currencies and some companies not being registered in the U.S., but we are working to make these things easier.”\n\n\tTalking about making things easier, the Emmy-winning professional is at the forefront of AI, a technology he not only staunchly defends but actively promotes to possible clients. “In today’s post-production timeline, I see a lot of points where AI can help, but I also feel there is this old mentality where people don’t want AI to tell them what to do,” he points out. “I see AI as a collection of our knowledge, not something to be afraid of. It’s a library, but you still need domain and knowledge to use it efficiently.” \n\n\t“My goal has been to package AI with visual effects services because you can go to a lot of different countries for VXF now, but when it comes to AI, a lot of people are still so far behind Estonia,” continues Post, saying he recently welcomed the president of an international advertisement agency who visited his facilities and said he “expected Estonia would merge traditional crafts with nuanced technology” and be one step ahead of fierce competitors. \n\n\tWhen it comes to competition, a key element is cash rebates and incentives. With countries near and far upping their offers, Estonia is looking to keep itself competitive. “The popularity of the rebate is huge,” mentions Toomet, adding that the government is thinking of raising the rebate from 30% to 40% in the near future. \n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been involved personally as a post-production producer and service provider for great projects like ‘Tenet,’ and we are actually part of the rebate,” he adds. “So it’s great that we can provide our services with that level of help. And it has also helped my studio, so I hope we will get better percentages soon because there is high competition with neighboring countries pushing those as well.” \n\n\tOn top of highly-skilled professionals, a favorable currency and a growing tax rebate, what else attracts major productions to Estonia? Sound designer Matis Rei, who has worked on major projects such as Todd Field’s “Tár” and Rose Glass’s “Love Lies Bleeding,” says Estonians are “very hard-working and trustworthy people” who are “open to learn and adapting to new systems very easily.” Kadalipp adds that his countrypeople are “very strict and work to an exact timeframe.” “No matter what, the work should be there.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the beginning of the year, Selin Murat left her role as markets manager at IDFA to take on the position of executive director of the IDFA Bertha Fund. She stepped into big shoes, taking over the position from Isabel Arrate Fernandez, one of the fund’s founders and its executive director for a whopping 23 years. Fernandez moved chairs herself, becoming IDFA’s artistic director while maintaining her deputy director role in a part-time capacity to oversee strategic filmmaker support activities. \n\t\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety ahead of her first edition of the Dutch festival in her new position, Murat says she thought the idea of being a funder for the first time “to be interesting” after over 15 years in the field as a producer and industry programmer. “I was in the industry working with filmmakers, producers, professionals and funders who were all trying to do the same thing, which is to make independent documentary films together,” she says. \n\n\n\tThe first few months on the job were “like being underwater,” adds Murat. “This year, we did four rounds of funding, so I spent a lot of time reading and inviting selection committee members.” In 2025, 16 IBF-supported films are also playing IDFA, including Massoud Bakhshi’s “All My Sisters,” María Silvia Esteve’s “Mailin” and Vladlena Sandu’s “Memory.” On top of the volume of work, there are other major challenges in the industry, from the struggle documentarians face to make a living through their work to how key documentary filmmaking is in times of sociopolitical unrest. \n\t\n\n\tCommenting on the former, Murat says documentary filmmaking is “consistently in crisis.” “Many filmmakers are working under really hard conditions, whether it is financially or related to conflict, war, oppression and freedom of speech. We are in this beautiful niche part of the overall film industry, the most valiant in a way. I’ve been in the industry my whole life and sustainability has always been difficult. Every decade brings a new challenge. It’s been all the more amazing to be where I am because I get to work closely with filmmakers and we can work for solutions together. Then, on top of that, we as a fund can at least give straight financial support.” \n\n\tAs for supporting filmmakers during wartime, the fund has launched special funding initiatives for Ukrainian and Palestinian filmmakers in recent years, which directly speaks to its mission of “strengthening independent, author-driven documentary filmmaking in regions and communities where access to funding and distribution for independent creative documentary film is structurally challenging.” Today, the fund supports projects across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean and Oceania. \n\n\tMurat says independent documentaries from countries like Ukraine, Palestine, Congo and Sudan defy “easy consumption.” According to her, these are films that “have been made over a long period of time with a lot of thought and bring out the complexity of the human experience from the ground with narrative sovereignty.” Such films are the reason “why everyone should be watching independent documentaries,” adds the exec.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Mailin,” courtesy of IDFA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of IDFA\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWith such urgent projects in need of funding, how does IBF choose which ones to go for? “The selection committees ask: What is the mandate of the fund? What am I looking for? We try as much as possible to think about artistry,” she says. “Some funds are about impact, some are specifically about socipolitical issues. For the moment, the mandate of the IBF is to support independent filmmakers making films from their own perspective. That’s what we try to stick to when making decisions.”\n\n\tWith her first year on the job soon coming to an end, Murat is reflecting on some of her main goals with the fund. Amongst her main objectives is to have the fund support not only projects and filmmakers but also to foment the “structures” that surround them and create sustainable communities. She recalls when one of the founders of the Palestine Film Fund told her they could use funding for “knowledge sharing so we can have another entity set itself up sustainably in the future.” \n\t\n\n\t“I would love to keep doing that in all the regions that we serve,” she says. “Projects will always be really important; it is always going to be about the independent filmmaker, but also the idea of fostering a healthy community. At IBF, we are three people; we can’t know how all the communities function. We don’t know what is most important in a local community or territory and don’t speak all the languages of the countries we support. I would like for us to be connected sustainably with local, independent, like-minded communities that are doing that work on the ground. If we can support that, that would be really cool.” \n",

If found guilty, Wen faces a fine of up to fined up to S$2000 ($1,540). Local media has reported that Wen intends to plead guilty.\n\t\n\n\tThe 26-year-old Australian, who goes by Pyjama Man on Instagram, often posts on social media about getting close to celebrities at events and premieres. He has previously found his way on stage at the concerts of Katy Perry, the Weeknd, the Chainsmokers and others. On his Instagram story on Thursday, Wen posted that he was “free after being arrested.” \n\n\n\tWen’s charging at Grande caused a social media uproar, with his post about rushing the red carpet — which is captioned “Dear Ariana Grande Thank You for letting me Jump on the Yellow Carpet with You” — flooded with disapproving comments. “Oh wow so you do this a lot… how aren’t you in jail?” one user commented, while another said: “There needs to be an action done against him as this is clearly a criminal offense.” \n\n\tGrande, Erivo and the rest of the “Wicked: For Good” cast are currently embarking on a world tour to promote the musical film, which releases on Nov. 21. The next and final stop is in New York City on Monday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBuenos Aires-based FilmSharks has expanded its AFM slate, kickstarting world sales on Cristian Bernard’s “Under Your Feet” at the Los Angeles event ahead of its Nov. 15 world premiere at the Tallinn Black Nights Festival.\n\n\tStarring Maribel Verdú (“Pan’s Labyrinth,” “Y tu mamá también”) and Sofia Otero, a Berlinale and Goya winner for “20,000 Species of Bees,” the fantasy thriller by Bernard, known for hits “76 80 03” and “Echoes” (“Ecos de un crimen”), was produced by Carlos Juárez (“The Platform”) of Basque Films and FilmSharks’ Guido Rud, with the participation of Netflix Spain and Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.\n\t\n\n\tThe story follows Isabel (Verdú) who moves with her two kids into a fancy apartment building that has a strange way of choosing its tenants — yet the rent is surprisingly low. After they’re accepted and settle in, three elderly neighbors from the floor below begin to upend their lives.\n\n\n\t“This is a remarkably exquisite and visually sophisticated cinematic gem that aims to target fantasy/adventure lovers, especially audiences that are looking for stories that resemble the cinema we all fell in love with, like ‘The Goonies,’ ‘Super 8’ and [series] ‘Stranger Things,’” said Rud, who noted that its remake appeal is high.\n\n\t“We truly found in Bilbao and its architecture an ideal setting to tell this very atmospheric, classic horror story,” said Juárez of the shoot, which took advantage of the Basque city’s generous tax credits that can reach up to 70%. The once grey industrial city has been transformed by the presence of the Guggenheim Museum and now boasts one of Spain’s most expansive filming incentives.\n\t\n\n\tTalks are underway with buyers from Latin America, the U.S., Japan, Korea, Russia/CIS, France, Taiwan and German-speaking territories, with some deals expected to close shortly.\n\n\tTheatrical distribution in Spain is still under discussions but target release is for the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\tFilmSharks recently closed world sales rights to “Torment” (“Tormento”), a genre thriller set in a morgue that is tipped as one of TelevisaUnivision’s biggest box office bets of the year in Mexico. It also began sales at the American Film Market to “Torment,” which is written and directed by Olallo Rubio whose 2012 doc feature “Gimme the Power” screened at SXSW.\n\n\tIn October, FilmSharks secured all rights — including derivative IP — to Colombian project in development “Insurrección.” The political action-thriller stars renowned Colombian actor-producer Marlon Moreno (“El Capo,” “Dog Eat Dog”).\n\n\tPenned by Colombian screenwriter Mauricio Marulanda González, “Insurrección” is in development with plans for both Spanish and English-language versions.\n\n\tAFM runs thru Nov 11- 16.\n",

    "body": "\n\tI tend to shy away from the term if I can, but there’s no denying that Keeper, the new movie directed by Osgood Perkins (“Longlegs,” “Monkey”), is an experimental horror film. That’s what’s good about it, and also what’s not so good about it. In theory, making an experimental movie is a bold creative act (though I wouldn’t score their success rate at too high a percentage). Two years ago, there was a radical experimental horror film that was nothing short of amazing — Kyle Edward Ball’s “Skinamarink,” which used a fragmentary narrative to touch the uncanny.\n\t\n\n\tBut in “Keeper,” a serial-killer drama with a handful of honestly creepy moments, the mood is low-key and naturalistic, yet a streak of trippy weirdness keeps intruding. And here’s the thing: The weird parts don’t add up. That’s likely by design, but that doesn’t make it good. There’s probably a great serial-killer movie to be made using experimental film language (to touch the core of their bloody psychosis), but the “impressionistic” dream logic of “Keeper” just leaves you feeling that Osgood Perkins has seen too many movies and that he wants to project the random horror mixtape of his brain onto the screen.   \n\n\n\t“Keeper” has a canny and disturbing opening sequence, and it got me hooked on the film’s possibilities. We see, entirely from the main character’s point-of-view, a montage of the women he has dated and dumped. As his pattern of behavior becomes clear, it hits a note of social familiarity — we’re seeing the diary of a serial monogamist, a phrase that’s a contradiction in terms (he’s monogamous! Until he cuts you loose to be with someone else), and also one that has that telltale overlap with “serial killer.” The message: When it comes to men, serial is probably a problem.\n\t\n\n\tLiz (Tatiana Maslany, from the TV series “Orphan Black”), who is sharp and urban and confused about her life, is about to head upstate with her boyfriend of one year, Malcolm (Rossif Sutherland), to stay in his family’s cabin. “Cabin” is a modest rustic word, but this place is pretty posh. It’s an elegant two-story wood house, with high ceilings and large open windows, all renovated, so that it looks like the perfect nook-and-cranny hideaway for a killer to take his victim. But is Malcolm a killer?\n\n\tHe sure seems like he could be. He’s a physician, nerdish and unsmiling, played by Rossif Sutherland (the son of Donald Sutherland), who’s hidden behind a morose beard and has a quirky monosyllabic passivity. Why is she even with this guy? We may not fully buy it, but he’s at least got a surface normality, and that’s the point. (A slight joke, intentional or not: In a country as snarky as America has become, Rossif Sutherland’s dour Canadian earnestness plays as a red flag.)\n\n\tMalcolm has told Liz that she’s “not like all those other girls,” a line that lets you know she’s exactly like those other girls. We’re braced to ride out his descent into madness, but here’s what happens instead. Malcolm’s cousin comes over — a super-skeevy bro named Darren (played by Birkett Turton like a depraved Carson Daly), who brings along an Eastern-European-model-who-speaks-next-to-no-English named Minka (Eden Weiss). This comes under the category of “realistic horror,” but here’s what doesn’t: Minka points to a cake box that got delivered by the caretaker and says, “Tastes like shit.”\n\n\tLater on, Malcolm offers Liz a piece of the chocolate cake, and she eats it (a suspenseful scene), and it tastes…fine. But then, in the middle of the night, she goes down to the kitchen and gorges on the entire rest of the cake. And it seems to start giving her visions: of ghostly gray humanoids, of the ex-girlfriends who have been killed, of steam rising from two piles of rocks in the woods — and, bizarrely, of a flashback to many years ago when the cousins, as boys, held muskets and killed a woman in the woods who looked just like Liz. Then Malcolm has to return to the city to attend to a patient, and Darren stops by again, this time going into the kitchen to get a butcher knife (is he the serial killer?), all of which comes to…nothing.\n\t\n\n\t“Keeper” is well shot (the cinematography, by Jeremy Cox, has a woodland austerity that’s classier than the slapdash flamboyance of “Longlegs” and “Monkey”), but for the audience it’s a two-hour exercise in figuring out what in the actual fuck is going on. The film is dotted with serial-killer tropes (heads dunked in gooey dissolving fluid, etc.), but if you listen to the music cues, like Peggy Lee singing “I Don’t Want to Play in Your Yard,” or Mickey & Sylvia’s version of “Love Is Strange,” or Elvin Bishop’s “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” playing over the closing credits, you get the feeling that Perkins thinks he’s making a movie about the place where serial homicide meets lack of commitment. Actually, it’s Osgood Perkins who can’t commit — to a filmmaking style that isn’t based on the next damn thing that comes into his head.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOne of the most coveted European programs for post-supervisors and producers on the nuts and bolts of post-production, the Creative Media-supported ApostLab is being held for the first time as a two-city event, between Helsinki and Tallinn.\n\n\tBacked by the Finnish Film Institute and the Estonian Film Institute, the project-based program rolls out Nov. 13-19, three days in each capital city, with the Tallinn-based training being showcased at Discovery Campus, part of the Black Nights Film Festival’s Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event.\n\t\n\n\tMauricio Romero Tunaroza, ApostLab managing director said organising the first two-city workshop between Finland and Estonia felt “natural” considering the neighbouring countries’ proximity (just two hours by ferry), and strong industry ties.\n\n\n\t“APostLab is quite a unique workshop in its approach to film making,” said the Finnish Film Foundation CEO Lasse Saarinen who supports up to two international industry training gigs a year. “Because of the technical changes in post-production, a sector constantly in transition, it made sense for us to be part of it, also most importantly because it connects producers to post production.”\n\n\tThe Estonian Film Institute honcho Edith Sepp concurred with him. “It’s really important for us to be part of APostLab. Estonia’s film industry is small, but it’s full of creativity, and we grow through collaboration. Working together with our Finnish partners through APostLab brings people closer; it’s a space where experience moves freely across borders. “I love that it connects our professionals and shows how strong we can be, especially when we Finno-Ugrians work together,” she added. “It also reminds others– across the Nordics and Baltics – that Estonia has a lot to offer, not only creatively but also technically.”\n\t\n\n\tCommenting on the reshaping of post in the digital and the AI age, Sepp said: “The industry has changed so much; everything moves so fast, budgets are tighter, technology keeps evolving. Producers and post-pro supervisors are really the backbone of production, and they need the confidence but also skills to manage all these new demands. Training and exchange programmes like APostLab are invaluable because they don’t just teach. They create new meaning, connect people, build trust. It is also important to highlight that they help create a shared language between creatives and technicians in the region. That’s how the regional industry grows stronger and becomes visible to the world,” she noted.\n\n\tDuring the six-day residential workshop, the 20-plus participants will hone their skills in all technical, financial, and creative aspects of post-production, in a European, international co-production environment. In sought-after sessions, producers will work hand in hand with post-supervisors, to design a tailored post-production workflow, schedule, and budget for a specific project. Separate sessions will deal with sound & design, VFX and AI.\n\n\tAt Tallinn’s Discovery Campus, two sessions will be jointly hosted with Industry @Tallinn & Baltic Event. On Nov. 19, former Netflix technologist and colour-grading specialist Edmond Laccon will deliver a talk, Visual Development, and about the importance of establishing a good communication with heads of departments (HODs) prior to the shoot, while Remus will focus on cutting corners for micro-budgets.\n\n\t“There are always options to cut corners, but again, like with a script, people really need to know what they are doing, not to damage the quality of the project. First comes a clear understanding of the schedule, the budget and only then can you think about how to cut. Cutting corners first, then figuring out how to make it work is a recipe for failure, frankly,” Remus warned.\n\n\tEstonian Way\n\n\tDiving into the specificity of post-production in smaller markets, Remus said “those tend to have smaller post-vendors and infrastructure, although often quite qualified, as in Estonia.” He underscored the need for public bodies to make it mandatory for foreign producers, accessing tax rebates, to spend a significant share of their production spend in local post-production to safeguard freelancers. “Otherwise a lot of good talent will just go elsewhere.”\n\t\n\n\tThree ApostLab participants shared their first-hand experiences and the pros and cons of post-producing in Estonia.\n\n\t“Estonia has an impressive and still somewhat undervalued post-production capacity,” reckoned Moonika Raidan, post-supervisor and editor of two features showcased at Black Nights’ Baltic Film Competition – “Fränk” and “New Money.” “The industry is cost-efficient, flexible and known for its solution-oriented mindset. Local VFX companies like FrostFX have achieved international recognition – with an Emmy this year for HBO’s series “The Penguin” – and continue to push technical boundaries. While there are only a few professionals working solely as post-production supervisors, the talent and infrastructure are in place, and there’s real potential for growth in this area,” she said.\n\n\tUp-and-coming producer Inger Põder (“Homeless Bob”), who attends APostLab with Teresa Väli’s directorial debut “White Ship,” fully concurred with Raidan on the country’s competitive outfits, but also lack of specialized post-supervisors. “I have done this job myself in the past as in-house production coordinator, and that experience opened my eyes to how much more specializing this job needs. That’s why I think it’s great that APostLab offers more focus on Finland and Estonia paying more attention to the job.”\n\n\tHeavyweight Estonian producer Jevgeni Supin, at fast-expanding Zolba Productions, credited for the international historical series “Von Fock” and anticipated Estonia-Ukraine drama “My Dear Mother,” said wearing different hats – from floor manager to set assistant, editor and director –  has helped him become a better producer. “I’m acquainted with all post-production aspects and it’s been a huge benefit for me because I understand how much time everything takes, what are the shallow waters and where could be the problems. But in recent times,” he added, I’ve aware that it’s not enough. Working on international projects, with bigger demands, require more fine-tuned and different skills. This is why APostLab is the right place to learn.”\n\n\tSupin said his first choice, for every project, is to try to stay local with post, also because of language. But availability of top crew and talent can be an issue. “Estonia being a small market, we need to plan ahead as the best professionals – not only in post – are in high demand. It is a blessing and a curse that Estonia and the Baltics have become hot shooting destinations,” he observes.\n\t\n\n\tAt APostLab, Supin will bring his high-end TV project “Let It Snow,” co-produced with Finland’s Take Two Studios. The producer and former head of Baltic TV Beats Forum hopes the crime show ordered by the Baltic streamer Go3 will start rolling later next year. The light crime comedy tells of a kind-hearted but eccentric Estonian family man who accidentally becomes the sole leader of the whole cocaine trade in Helsinki.\n\n\t“I need an assessment from a qualified post-supervisor on the concept, and the script,” Supin said. “We don’t need a lot of obvious effects, complicated set pieces to create the world, but there will be a lot of action, clean-ups, and we’ll need support to find different visual solutions, perhaps also with animation for fast-montage scenes. We need to understand which way is more financially reasonable to go with.”\n\n\tTips\n\n\tSummarising to Variety the key facts that producers should keep in mind regarding post-production, Remus offered three tips:\n\n\tGet familiar enough about post-production, to have an eye-level conversation about the creative goals of any project with everybody involved, and talk to everyone in pre-production and the financing stage.Find good partners and experts, not just people who fit the bill because they have an address in a place where you want to spend your money. Find them early, involve them in the planning to balance your resources properly.\n\n\tGet to grips with the fact that post-production is an essential part of storytelling. Therefore do engage with post experts as early as possible and be involved when post is being executed.\n\n\tNeeltje van der Heijden, ApostLab program manager and post-production supervisor, added: “Our motto is ‘post before you shoot!’ And that’s the core of it. Of course, it’s key for producers to hire post-experts as this benefits the entire process, including the budget. But I would also add: Think of pre-production, production and post-production as one holistic thing. Connect all departments, value everyone’s expertise and communicate effectively.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSoviet Bombs fall on Helsinki. This is 1939. Best-selling Finnish novelist Mika Waltari (“The Egyptian”) fights with his typewriter to create true lies for the Finnish Propaganda Unit to deceive the enemy. Meanwhile war correspondents, including one of the greatest – the American Martha Gelhorn, Ernest Hemingway’s wife to be – chase the truth. Side by side, propagandists and reporters find shelter at Helsinki’s grand neo-Renaissance Hotel Kämp.\n\t\n\n\tThese engrossing true events will be dramatized under the pen and direction of AJ Annila (“Shadow Lines,” “Peacemaker”) in the series “Helsinki 1939,” to be pitched at Tallinn TV Beats Co-financing Market Nov. 17.\n\n\n\tThe six-part series produced by Take Two Studios’ Eero Hietala and Sara Norberg, has landed an order by leading streaming service Elisa Viihde for Finland and Estonia.\n\n\n\tAnnila, whose career kicked off with the genre pics “Jade Warrior” (2006) and “Sauna” (2008), has made a name in recent years with high-end character and visually-driven series such as the period piece “Shadow Lines,” sold by About Premium Content to a raft of key territories including Sundance Now for the U.S., Canada and UK.\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety ahead of TV Beats, AJ Annila said he literally fell in love with the “Helsinki 1939” concept when producer and Take Two Studios CEO Eero Hietala first pitched it to him in 2024. The latter had heard about the Finnish war propaganda unit set up to fight the Soviets during the Winter War from his friend-author and former crime detective Kimmo Nokkonen who “has a good nose for exciting historical stories.”\n\t\n\n\t“He had stumbled on the topic, which proved to be a Pandora’s box of incredible real-life characters,” Hietala enthused. “The fact that Mika Waltari was leading the propaganda unit added to my interest. He’s the most legendary, albeit at times troubled, Finnish author.”\n\n\tAlthough Annila had a feature film in mind after three series in row – “Peacemaker,” “Shadow Lines” and “Codename: Annika” – he said. “Helsinki 1939” was a story and TV show that he had to put his stamp on. “We’ve had a lot of great films about the Winter War, but frankly the classic takes were getting a bit boring. By telling the 105 days of war through the amazing true and colorful stories that unfolded at Helsinki’s Hotel Kämp, you have a fresh angle. On top of that, a very topical subject matter which is propaganda.”\n\n\t“Look at the story of the Ghost of Kyiv, about the Ukrainian pilot who supposedly had shot down Russian planes,” Annila continues, bringing the topic back to Russia’s current war in Ukraine. “That pilot never existed. But the question is: Did that fabricated story actually help or harm the cause of Ukraine? I find this question of war-time propaganda fascinating!”The beating heart of the show will be the luxurious Hotel Kämp – still standing – a microcosm from which the fate of one nation was shaped, a buzzy temporary home to more than 40 war correspondents, Finnish information officers, on top of other rich and famous and hotel staff members. Digging into the tone, Annila said the character-driven show will be “colorful, emotional, brave, dark and light.” “I will contrast the lavish lives of the hotel dwellers, partying and dining with the horrors of war. A bit like in ‘Titanic,’ you will see the band playing until the end, while the world around is sinking.”\n\n\tCommenting on their latest event series order, Elisa Chief Content Officer Ani Korpela said: “We’re thrilled to collaborate with AJ Annila again. He previously directed the Elisa Viihde original series “Shadow Lines” [Season 1 in 2018, Season 2 in 2020], a Cold War era spy thriller that became a domestic hit in Finland and was widely distributed internationally. ‘Helsinki 1939’ continues that trajectory, a truly authentic international project designed to resonate with audiences in Finland and around the world.”\n\n\tElisa executive producer Sari Lampiänen said: “What could be a better combination than AJ Annila’s unique vision and bold, fun cinematic style paired with world-changing events that still resonate today? For us, it’s essential that our original series are both entertaining and meaningful, reflecting the world around us. The way the information we’re exposed to, starting with traditional news, shapes how we see the world, in times of crisis or otherwise, remains one of the most relevant questions of our time.”\n\t\n\n\tHietala said the show has received development support from leading Helsinki-based fund management IPR.VC, as part of a multi-title slate, which takes in as well the anticipated crime series “Hildur.” At Tallinn’s fifth TV Beats Co-Financing Market, Take Two Studios will be looking for co-pro partners, gap financing, and distributors. \n\n\t“Helsinki 1939” is one of seven high-end international series competing in Tallinn for the coveted Council of Europe Series Co-Production Development Award, worth €50,000 ($58,600).\n\n\tThe TV Beats Forum runs Nov. 17-18 in Tallinn as part of the Black Nights Film Festival’s Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event confab. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter failed attempts in both Italy and Barcelona, Woody Allen is now planning to make his next movie in Madrid. The 89-year-old director has secured €1.5 million ($1.7 million) from the Madrid Regional Government, according to the Spanish outlet El Pais.\n\n\tWhile €1.5 million is a significant chunk, it’s certainly not enough to finance an Allen movie, though the director likely has some backers in place. He’s producing the film through his banner Gravier Production and Spain’s Wanda Vision (“Petra”).\n\t\n\n\tUnder the agreement with the Madrid Regional Government, which was posted online and quoted by El Pais, Allen will need to include Madrid in the title of the film. The amount will be divided into three payments contingent on the movie’s international career as it stipulates that a portion of the financing will come after the film world premieres at a major festival like the Berlinale. The investment is described on the portal as a “sponsorship by the community of Madrid of the promotional campaign for a feature film provisionally titled ‘Wasp 2026.'” Wasp actually stands for Woody Allen Summer Project.\n\n\n\tThe contract also states that “Woody Allen is one of the most versatile contemporary artists on the film scene,” and says that “the advertising and promotion of destinations through film has been a branding tool throughout the history of cinema.”\n\n\tAllen has shot several films in Spain, most famously “Vicky Cristina Barcelona,” which he filmed in the Catalan city with Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in 2008. For that movie, he had also received €1.5 million from the regional body. Most recently, Allen returned to Spain with “Rifkin’s Festival,” shot in San Sebastián. The controversial director last made “Coup de Chance,” a romantic thriller set in Paris which marked his 50th movie. It world premiered at Venice Film Festival in 2023, where Allen managed to avoid any questions about the sexual abuse allegations made against him by his daughter, Dylan Farrow. \n\t\n\n\tIn an exclusive interview with Variety at Venice, Allen talked about his love for French cinema classics and addressed his difficulties in raising funding stateside due to the controversies, suggesting “Coup de Chance” may be his last film. \n\n\t“I have so many ideas for films that I would be tempted to do it, if it was easy to finance,” he said. “But beyond that, I don’t know if I have the same verve to go out and spend a lot of time raising money.”\n\n\tRepresentatives for Allen, Gravier Production and Wanda Vision did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBowing Nov. 3 with Movistar Plus+ and Arte France’s event historical drama “The Anatomy of a Moment,” Barcelona’s Serielizados festival is making a splash for its 12th edition, with a bolstered industry section and a robust series program to cater for their 10,000+ on-site and 200,000+ online Spanish fan base.\n\n\tOn the industry front, more than 250 decision-makers (150 from Spain) will be on hand at the Serielizados Pro Industry Day, Nov. 6, such as Arte France’s Alexandre Piel and Movistar Plus+’s Susanna Herreras who will discuss ‘Arte and Movistar: a Co-Production Love Story,’ a session moderated by Variety’s John Hopewell.\n\t\n\n\tOther industry highlights include case studies on the HBO Max Catalan upcoming shows ‘Ravalejar,” “Pubertat” (“Puberty”) and the Icelandic/French “The Danish Woman” (RÚV/SVT/Yle/Arte France). The State of Distribution will be unpacked by Mediapro Studios’ Javier Esteban, BBC Studios’ Rebecca Ransley, Beta Film’s Christian Jockel, while 3Cat’s Pío Vernis, Yle’s Jarmo Lampela and RTVE’s Alberto Fernández will speak on the panel Pubcasters Collaborating and Making Series.\n\n\n\t10 standout European series will be pitched at the inaugural ‘Mind the Gap ‘co-production session, and star showrunners Alan Ball (“Six Feet Under,” “True Blood”), Henriette Steenstrup (“Nepobaby,””Pørni”) Benedikt Erlingsson, (“The Danish Woman”), Leticia Dolera (“Pubertat”), will deliver masterclasses. Other stars expected include Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, Trine Dyrholm, Javier Cámarra, Joaquín Reyes, Emma Vilarasau.\n\t\n\n\tOn the festival front, 52 fresh shows will bow onsite in Barcelona, where the festival runs Nov. 3-12, and around 30 online (Nov. 10-23) via the Spanish streamer Filmin, of which six will run for best international series (“The Danish Woman,” “A Better Man,” “A Life’s Worth,” “Reykjavik Fusion,” “Empathy,” “Riot Women”) and four for best Spanish series (“The Anatomy of a Moment,” “The 39,” “Jakarta,” “Argi Gorriak”).\n\n\tAhead of Serielizados, co-founders Víctor Sala and Betu Molero tell Variety how the festival has grown from a university project into a fully-fledged international festival, online magazine, talent lab and podcast showcase for Catalan – and Spanish – viewers.\n\n\tThis year you are ramping up your international lineup and reach. Could you first tell us how Serielizados was born and what is the festival’s DNA?\n\n\tBetu Molero: We started as an online magazine in 2013 as a final year of university project. The original idea was to have an online magazine focused on TV series, with small events, masterclasses etc so that showrunners could come and introduce their shows. Then we decided to get to know our online audience through a festival. That’s when Victor and I co-founded Serielizados.\n\n\tAt the time, there was no Netflix, Prime Video, HBO in Spain. We didn’t even know that other series festival like Series Mania existed. In 2015 we invited Dan Harmon [“Rick & Morty, “Community”]. That was a turning point for us as we attracted a lot of media attention and audience awareness. Then Netflix landed in Spain late 2015 and HBO a year later. Today, we collaborate with every platform in Spain, offering a curated indie program of series for people to sneak peek physically during the festival and a few days later online via Filmin.\n\n\tVíctor Sala: It’s important to highlight that we’re offering much more than just premieres, masterclasses and Q&As. We showcase a wider program of classics, docu series, on top of podcasts as our goal is to elevate TV series to the category of high culture.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBetu Molero and Victor Sala\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCould you detail your selection process and partnership with Filmin?\n\n\tSala: One of the key criteria is for the shows to have a Spanish – or Catalan – premiere for the national series, and international shows need to have been distributed in the domestic country within a year. We pick the best of the best shows from around the world, with a special attention to storytelling, whatever the genre, and visionary works.The selection is made hand-in-hand with broadcasters/platforms to promote upcoming shows and build the word of mouth. But we also pick up series that don’t have distribution in Spain. This year, two of the international series in competition have been acquired for Spain. Filmin bought “A Better Man” and AMC “Reykjavik Fusion.”\n\t\n\n\tMolero: Our collaboration with the streamer Filmin started in 2020 because of COVID. We wanted to make sure that the festival would continue to exist despite the pandemic. Thanks to Filmin, we discovered a new way to run a festival – both on site and online – not only for people in Barcelona, but everywhere in Spain. We soon became one of the biggest festivals in Spain, with more than 205,000 online viewers, on top of around 9,000 onsite.Sometimes it’s hard to bring the audience to a cinema to watch two episodes of an unknown Danish or South African show. The Filmin partnership has allowed us to make bolder editorial choices.\n\n\tSala: The online showcase has been a beautiful way to democratise the festival.\n\n\tYou seem to have a special taste for Nordic content as four out of six competing international shows – “The Danish Woman,” “Reykjavik Fusion,” “A Better Man” and “A Life’s Worth” – are either fully or partly Nordic.\n\n\tSala: Last year we had three Nordic series in competition and “Pressure Point” from Sweden won best series. After Thomas Vinterberg last year, we’re happy this year to have masterclasses with Benedikt Erlingsson [“The Danish Woman”] and Henriette Steenstrup whose series “Nepobaby” is screening at the out-of-competition Panorama section. We are also pleased to organise the Mind the Gap co-production pitch in collaboration with the Göteborg Film Festival, the Swedish Institute, and Swedish Embassy in Spain.\n\n\tHaving Alan Ball in a masterclass is quite a coup…\n\n\tSala: Yes, it’s an absolute pleasure and honor, especially to mark the 20th anniversary of the finale of “Six Feet Under.” The invitation was shared with the Geneva International Film Festival. We make a point of working closely with other European and Spanish film and TV festivals.\n\n\tWhat can you say about your Spanish lineup?\n\n\tSala: During Serielizados’ early days, our focus was on international shows and showrunners. We were very lucky to host Dan Harmon, David Simon, Vince Gilligan and Jesse Armstrong. But now that Spanish drama has grown exponentially in storytelling and visually, it’s key for us to focus as well on Spanish content.\n\n\tMolero: Netflix’s phenomenal “La casa de papel” (“Money Heist”) was a turning point in 2019. After that, we just followed the spectacular growth of Spanish series.\n\t\n\n\tSala: This year we have selected 10 Spanish shows and four are in the Spanish official competition. We wanted to open with “The Anatomy of a Moment,” a very stylish political biopic which mirrors the very successful partnership between Arte France and Movistar Plus+ that has brought us so many good series in recent years. Then “Jakarta” originates from one of our favorite showrunners: Diego San José. He won Best Screenplay here last year with “Celeste.” We are closing with “Sense FilTRES” (3Cat) a young adult Catalan show that centers on the life of a young trans man, his physical identity and self-realization, using social media or videogame avatars.\n\n\tAnother novelty this year is the presence of two Basque series, showcasing the effort from the regional broadcaster EITB and the fruitful results of the Basque region incentives. We are world premiering “Argi Gorriak” (with Itziar Ituño from “Money Heist”) in a quirky comedy about a dubbing professional, and screening “Zeru Ahoak” (“Mouths of Sky”), after San Sebastian.\n\n\tI believe documentaries also have a special place at Serielizados…\n\n\tSala: Yes the focus on docu series has grown at the festival. It reflects the growing appetite for the format on the streamers. We will highlight five titles: “The Agent” (NRK), “The Black Swan” (DR), “La Fugida” (3Cat), “Nazi Cartel” (Sky Showtime) and “Missing in Murcia” (Movistar Plus+).\n\n\tYou are broadening the scope of your industry strand Serielizados Pro with the first Mind the Gap co-pro pitch session. What triggered this decision?\n\n\tSala: Our ambitions with Serielizados are two-fold: on one hand, we want to grow the number of people attending the festival physically and enjoying them at home on Filmin. Our other goal is to be more relevant for the Spanish – and Catalan – audiovisual industry.\n\n\tMolero: The Catalan government has increased funding for Catalan series and co-productions [ as reported by Variety]. We felt it was an opportunity to build on this momentum and create not a Series Mania type of gigantic event, but a tailor-made boutique Pro-event to allow people to develop quality conversation.\n\n\tSala: Unlike other territories in Europe and even in the U.S. where Originals have dropped by 20% or more, in Spain, we’re still enjoying a boom. It’s interesting to see for instance HBO Max teaming up with 3Cat for three new Catalan shows: “Ravalejar,” “Pubertat” and “In Vitro” [currently filming].Another specificity about the Spanish market – which will be discussed by Spanish commissioners at the Pro-industry day – is co-productions between the national station RTVE and regional stations. At our festival, two years ago we had “This is Not Sweden” [co-produced with Catalonia’s TV3 – now 3Cat]. Last year we had “Dieciocho” [co-produced with Valencia’s À Punt Media and the Balearics’ IB3] and this year, we’re showcasing the Basque series “Zeru Ahoak.”\n\t\n\n\tWhat’s the next step for Serielizados?Molero: Our next step might be getting into production. We do have projects in mind, including documentaries. It’s still early days.\n\n\t(This interview was edited for clarity)\n",

    "body": "\n\tSales agency Sola Media has closed the first distribution deals on CGI animated feature “Monster Mia,” which has a production budget of €9 million ($10.4 million), as it prepares for next month’s American Film Market in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe film has already attracted buyers in several territories, including Poland (New Horizons), Greece (Tanweer), Bulgaria (Pro Films), Mongolia (Filmbridge) and the former Yugoslavia (Karantanija Cinemas).\n\t\n\n\tIn Germany, Plaion Pictures is planning a theatrical release for the Halloween season in October 2026.\n\n\n\tSet in the seemingly perfect town of Primrose, “Monster Mia” follows the story of Mia and her scruffy pet rat Quentin. After being expelled from school, Mia is sent to the mysterious Rotwood Academy — a place that immediately gives her the creeps as she’s the only human among a class full of monsters.\n\n\tWith the principal Van Vlad hosting a deep dislike for humans, Mia must join forces with her monstrous classmates to stop his plans — before it’s too late.\n\n\tProduction is led by Austria-based animation studio Arx Anima in collaboration with Germany’s Arx Anima MD and Peng! Boom! Tschak! – Films and Spain’s Arxlight Pictures. Arx Anima’s recent credits include co-producing the animated feature “Rabbit Academy,” “The Super Elfkins” and the hit series “Talking Tom and Friends” (Seasons 1–3), which has amassed over 17.5 billion views across platforms.\n\n\tM.A.R.K. 13, the animation studio behind Peng! Boom! Tschak! – Films, brings two decades of industry expertise to the project and is known for its work on “Vic the Viking and the Magic Sword” and “Maya the Bee.”\n\t\n\n\tSpanish producer Nicolás Matji of Arxlight Pictures adds further weight to the team, having produced the “Tadeo” franchise and “Capture the Flag.”\n\n\t“When we first read the script about the charismatic ‘Monster Mia,’ we were immediately captivated by the story,” producer Dunja Bernatzky, managing director of Arx Anima, said. “It offers an abundance of humor and entertainment, both in terms of its characters and its setting – the monster school – but also delivers the emotional depth of an important message. Themes of self-acceptance, discovering one’s true potential, the power of friendship, and embracing the unknown are all wrapped in a quirky, adventurous comedy. What’s not to love?”\n\n\tSolveig Langeland, managing director at Sola Media, added: “ ‘Monster Mia’ delivers top-quality visuals and finely crafted storytelling that blends humor with meaningful values like confidence and positivity. It’s a cool, spooky adventure — perfect for Halloween — in a fun, family-friendly way that’s both entertaining and educational for all ages.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe line between historical recreation and genre reimagining has seldom been as effectively blurred as in Mariana Rondón and Marité Ugás‘ “It Would Be Night in Caracas.” A pacy thriller, based on Karina Sainz Borgo’s novel, the film mines pulpy pleasures from an apocalyptic vision of Venezuela’s 2017 riots. Those unfamiliar with the nation’s recent (and ongoing) unrest can simply enjoy an expertly tooled dystopian rollercoaster ride. But planted deep within the taut setpieces and propulsive plotting, there’s grief of a subtler, agonizingly relatable kind: for a country turning so hostile against its citizenry that fleeing becomes the only option. Home is sometimes where the heartbreak is. \n\t\n\n\tAdelaida (an excellent Natalia Reyes), her heart already cracked, her expression dazed and numb, is picked out by Juan Pablo Ramírez’ impressively dynamic yet controlled camera through a chanting throng of protesters waving flags and fists in the air. She barely notices the clamor; she is waiting to accompany her mother’s coffin to its final resting place. At the cemetery, she drives past an anarchic biker gang funeral, where liquored-up women writhe and grind on a comrade’s casket. The dissonance between their bacchanalian ritual and Adelaida’s silent, solitary suffering is marked, and the disrespect for the dead further underlined when a gravedigger tersely shoos her away from the graveside, reminding her that the area is unsafe, especially at nightfall.\n\n\n\tAdelaida holes up in her mother’s apartment, unable to bring herself to pack up or even sort through her things, ignoring the banging and shouting from the street below. But after one of her infrequent forays into the neighborhood — for basics that are in scant supply on the balding shelves of the few stores that remain open — she returns to discover that a faction of the self-ordained resistance militia, headed by the fearsome Mariscala (Sheila Monterola), has simply commandeered the flat. Added to the trauma of grief and sudden eviction under threat of reprisal, Adelaida has to endure seeing the sacred mementos of her mother’s life trashed by the thuggish new squatters. \n\t\n\n\tShe can’t bring herself leave the building, nor has she anywhere else to go. So she seeks refuge in a neighbor’s apartment, only to discover the occupant dead on the kitchen floor. For perhaps the first, but definitely not the last time, Adelaida’s opportunism surprises even herself when she chooses to take advantage of this convenient tragedy. She stealthily moves into the dead woman’s space — into her life, really — spying on the interlopers across the hall and biding her time until they get bored and leave, or maybe until they kill each other in some internecine power-grab or other. It’s a lonely vigil, with only flashback memories of her mother and an old lover (Edgar Ramirez) to keep her company. But then Santiago (Moisés Angola), the brother of a friend whom she had believed incarcerated, shows up and Adelaida reluctantly shelters him.  \n\n\tFor a thriller so nervily edited by Soledad Salfate and so atmospherically shot — Ramirez’ camera is especially eloquent in low-light and night-time situations, when the line between reality and nightmare gets fuzzy — it is surprisingly ambivalent about the politics of this specific moment in Venezuela’s recent past. That might frustrate viewers looking for a more straightforward arc of political awakening leading to some self-sacrificing action heroics on Adelaida’s part. But Adelaida is not interested in being a hero. Broken heart or no, she is interested in surviving.\n\n\tThere is nuance, too, in the odd phrasing of the title, with that “would be” making the whole narrative feel conditional, allegorical, symbolic. At the same time, it suggests a certain wistfulness, as though Caracas were just an idea, a place that no longer exists, or that exists solely in the musings of exiles sitting in far-off time zones, looking out into the daylight and imagining the night-sky stars of home. \n\n\tTo be clear, there is no sense that Rondón and Ugás are defending the old guard or suggesting that a docile, starving population pinioned under the grip of a dictatorship is big-picture preferable to a rebellious insurgency. But their pacy storytelling does give us a first-person, on-the-ground experience of how terrifying it can be when nominal allies reveal themselves to be as petty, cruel and corrupt as the powerholders they oppose. Sometimes, the righteous fury of an oppressed population is unleashed, only to find that there is nowhere for it to go, except to turn savagely in on itself. In such cases, solidarity and compassion themselves might seem like luxuries next to the all-conquering, primally selfish urge to save your own skin. Before you judge Adelaida too harshly, remember it’s a choice that far too many of us, in collapsing communities and besieged cities across the world, may soon face.\n",

    "description": "\n\tIndonesian auteur Kamila Andini’s latest project “Four Seasons in Java” won two prizes at the inaugural Tokyo Gap-Financing Market Awards on Friday.",
    "body": "\n\tIndonesian auteur Kamila Andini’s latest project “Four Seasons in Java” won two prizes at the inaugural Tokyo Gap-Financing Market Awards on Friday. \n\n\tThe TGFM is part of TIFFCOM, the Tokyo International Film Festival‘s market arm. “Four Seasons in Java” won TGFM’s top prize, the Tokyo Projects Award, carrying a JPY2 million ($13,225) cash prize, and the Kongchak Award from Cambodia-based Kongchak Studio, offering sound post-production services valued at $25,000.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is a magical realist drama that confronts the dark underbelly of progress and power in contemporary Indonesia, is in post-production and was previously at the Venice Gap-Financing Market. It follows Pertiwi, a woman who returns to her village after more than a decade in prison for killing a young man while defending herself from attempted rape. Her homecoming coincides with the arrival of electricity to the remote community, setting up what Andini describes as a collision between modernity and personal trauma that she sees “repeating in our daily life.”\n\n\n\tTGFM jury member and festival director and programmer Paolo Bertolin, said while announcing the award: “TGFM 2025 would like to acknowledge the striking overall quality and diversity of the lineup, which put us through a real challenge in selecting one and only project for this award. More specifically, we would also like to draw attention and commend the selection of Southeast Asian projects. Reflecting different creative approaches and scopes of production. These projects chart the exciting geography of a region brewing with talents and cinematic vitality, and indeed, the project we selected for Tokyo Project Award 2025 hails from this region, and offers a powerful statement of maturity from a filmmaker tackling sensitive and relevant topics with dedication, sincerity and vigorous cinematic storytelling.” \n\t\n\n\tThe Asian Gen-Z Award worth JPY500,000 ($3,305), determined by a selection committee of five film students aged 20 to 28, went to Filipino filmmaker Don Josephus Raphael Eblahan’s sci-fi western “Hum.”\n\n\tIn the film, after a devastating earthquake, a young veterinarian works at an evacuation center to treat injured farm animals. While caring for them, her professor discovers something extraordinary: her student can “speak” to animals. As she learns to harness this gift, she realizes that the creatures can sense and even predict aftershocks. Using this newfound connection, she helps her cowboy friends and family prepare for what’s to come. But her world is shaken once more when another person with the same ability appears… a man who police believe is responsible for causing the earthquake that destroyed their town. Upon his mysterious arrival, she attempts to unravel his mystery by interrogating him in the secret primal language that only the two of them speak.\n\n\tThe Asian Gen-Z Award special mention went to Andrea Benjamin Manenti’s debut feature “I Have to Fuck Before the World Ends,” a cross-cultural coming-of-age comedy set between Italy and the Philippines. The film follows Ren, a 16-year-old Filipino-Italian teenager trapped in his mother Mia’s possessive love, who must break free during a three-day Filipino wake as Typhoon Edith approaches Manila. When news arrives that Mia’s mother Moini is dying in the Philippines, mother and son return to Manila, where Ren finds himself enchanted by Jolina, his cousins’ babysitter, and coached in the art of love by his eccentric cousin Monique. As Typhoon Edith nears and family dysfunction brews, Ren must claim his independence.\n\n\tThe White Light Award from Thailand’s White Light, providing post-production services valued at $25,000, went to Japanese-Taiwanese co-production “Polaris,” directed by Seta Natsuki. It unfolds over one winter night at a bar in Ni-chome. Based on the novel “The Night of the Shining North Star” by Li Kotomi, the film centers on women of different ages, nationalities and sexualities who gather in the titular establishment, sharing drinks, laughter and fragments of their lives under soft blue light. As their stories intersect like stars in a constellation, the film explores themes of self-identity and human connection before the women part ways at dawn.\n",

    "description": "\n\tIn documentary “Writing Life – Annie Ernaux Through the Eyes of High School Students” Claire Simon takes on the work of the French Nobel Literature ",
    "body": "\n\tIn documentary “Writing Life – Annie Ernaux Through the Eyes of High School Students” Claire Simon takes on the work of the French Nobel Literature Prize winner – but not the writer herself.  \n\n\t“The point was to tell this story without Annie Ernaux, only using her books,” she explains to Variety after showing the film at Ji.hlava Intl. Documentary Film Festival. “I don’t like so-called portraits of artists. I find them very boring, because you never see the art. Here, you can really focus on her sentences.”\n\t\n\n\tErnaux, who often writes about her own life, is the author of “The Years” and “A Girl’s Story.” “Happening,” detailing her abortion, was adapted into a Venice-winning film directed by Audrey Diwan. \n\n\n\t“I was sure young people would respond to her writing,” says Simon, calling it “very modern.” In “Writing Life,” she shows students reading and discussing Ernaux’s books, taken – or even shocked – by her honesty.\n\n\t“She talks about everyday life. Hearing ‘A Girl’s Story’ [about a difficult sexual encounter in Ernaux’s youth] being read by the girls gives these words so much power. That’s the best ‘adaptation’ you could hope for.” \n\n\tAlthough her film – produced by Emmanuel Perreau for ​Rosebud Productions and sold by Brussels-based Be For Films – is distinctly Ernaux-free, the writer ended up joining Simon in Venice for the world premiere. \n\n\t“It was a different experience, but she wanted to support the film. Also, people love fame and celebrities, and Annie Ernaux is just like George Clooney,” she says. \n\t\n\n\t“That being said, documentaries are the movies of the people. You don’t need to be rich and you don’t need a star either. Now that fascism is everywhere, it’s important for young people to realize they are free to make films. Cinema isn’t just reserved for Cannes.”\n\n\tIn her film, Simon emerges as a champion of youth. \n\n\t“I was very happy to visit these schools, because nobody else does. The students trusted me because they realized I was genuinely interested in what they thought. It’s really that simple,” she admits, also recalling previous doc. \n\n\t“There was this boy in ‘Young Solitude’ [set in the Paris suburbs]. He was crying, but I kept filming. When I showed him the footage, he said: ‘I trust Claire.’ I was very surprised, but he accepted everything because he trusted me. Maybe it was because I paid attention to him and every other kid. That’s the thing about documentary filmmaking, and women. We listen. It’s an incredible power.” \n\n\tSimon, a prolific filmmaker, isn’t interested in pulling the truth out of her subjects. \n\n\t“People tell me that I make positive films. I’m like all these painters, like Renoir or Monet, who also loved their models. Unlike Picasso,” she smiles. “I don’t exploit the people I film. Never. My art is about loving the people I film.” But finding her footing as a female director wasn’t always easy. \n\n\t“I remember when I made a film with Nathalie Baye [‘God’s Offices’]. I said to her: ‘I feel bad, because I’m a woman and I can’t even flirt with you.’ She replied: ‘I hate it when directors flirt with me.’ When Tonie Marshall was making a film with Catherine Deneuve, they asked the producer – a man – to have dinner with her every night. We used to think it was necessary!”\n\n\tThese days, she has faith in young people – including those she shows in her latest film. \n\n\t“At one point, before #MeToo, I thought: ‘Oh my God, we’ve lost. We won’t achieve equality.’ Then things changed,” she says. “These young people, these girls, are clever and strong. They will never surrender. They’ll never let those guys win.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJi.hlava fest audiences who packed the cinema at the Czech Republic’s doc showcase to see “Power Station” found themselves feeling unexpectedly upbeat, they said following the film about taking on climate change one street at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe 29th edition of the fest is showing off its usual rich selection of progressive programming to be sure, but in terms of emotion, one viewer told co-directors Hilary Powell and Dan Edelstyn, films here are usually more about getting angry or perhaps somber.\n\t\n\n\tBut laughter and spectacle – along with impressive civic organizing – are the trademarks of this bickering, hustling married couple, as they’ve shown off in their past films.\n\n\n\tThe two managed to revive a Soviet-era distillery that had been seized by the state in Ukraine in their 2012 doc “How to Re-Establish a Vodka Empire,” before moving onto “Bank Job” in 2021, in which they bought up and forgave $1.5 million in predatory loans – naturally by blasting a golden van sky high.\n\n\tSo it seems what the dueling duo actually create are as much caper films as docs.\n\n\tThis time around, in “Power Station,” competing for the main doc prize at Ji.hlava, the two decide to take on the U.K.’s growing energy crisis, in which more and more of the populace is struggling to pay their monthly power bills.\n\n\tCut to Lynmouth Road, Walthamstow in London’s northeast: As 39% of the United Kingdom populace struggles to heat their homes, Edelstyn and Powell huddle under blankets themselves, trying vainly to warm up with endless mugs of tea.\n\t\n\n\tThey hustle to feed the household, make it to school pickups and juggle Zoom calls for civic organizing, meeting with the likes of political economist Ann Pettifor, and, um, oh yeah, launch a green energy movement to power their entire neighborhood – and hopefully the rest of England eventually with those free solar panels.\n\n\tSince even the most progressive party’s elected leaders clearly aren’t up to that task, it falls upon communities to show it can be done, Edelstyn says. Hopefully, when enough people see green energy working with their own eyes, the state will finally catch on.\n\n\tBut first we’ll need some compelling characters, weighed down by the dropping temperatures and rising bills, Edelstyn decides.\n\n\t“Actually, it helps the hero,” he assures Powell after filming unwashed dishes, “to be unable to keep up with all this stuff. To have vulnerabilities.”\n\n\tShe’s not impressed with the pitch, she lets him know.\n\n\tBut Edelstyn’s case is clear: “What are they doing with our taxes?” he asks. “The government should be giving everyone solar panels.”\n\n\tAnd if they won’t, these artist agitators will.\n\n\tThis time, it may take camping out on their rooftop in record cold winter, blasted by winds and at one point iced over to raise the funds for their neighbors’ panels.\n\n\tBut if so, Edelstyn and Powell are more than willing to endure the soaked bedding in the dark.\n\n\tAnd what audiences soon realize is, they’re not just watching two unlikely characters launching a movement – they’re actually seeing them construct the film.\n\n\t“You bastard,” Hilary cries when filmed brushing out tangles in her hair. “Stop it!”\n\n\t“You’re like very public and you’re sharing every feeling and emotion and I’m like what the fu…?”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Powell puts together remarkably detailed charts of plans, spreadsheets, models and, eventually, an elaborate form of local currency.\n\n\tPowell finds her partner’s narrative style a major pain, at times, she says, asking him, “Can you stop presenting? I think you’re the worst documentary maker in the world.”\n\n\tThey confer with Tom Ruxton of the HEET Project to learn that 27% of the population of Walthamstow Forest is now considered fuel poor, the second highest rate in London.\n\t\n\n\tEdelstyn makes the case that if the government would actually turn “every home in this country…turn it into a power station, the cost of that would be paid for by the sun itself within about a 10-year period. So it’s just absurd that that’s not happening. So why don’t we make it happen?”\n\n\tNext step, going door to door and offering people free solar panels. But this is London, of course – will they even open the door?\n\n\tSoon enough, Edelstyn gets to actually know his neighbors, including a woman born in the 1920s whose knees have gone “a bit wobbly” from lack of getting out during the shutdown and a Pakistan-born man whose walls are deteriorating because he devotes all his earnings to his children’s education.\n\n\tJust convincing the neighbors that a shared energy system is a realistic solution is half the battle, it turns out.\n\n\tBut in the grand tradition of protest art, the two win over even the most cynical in their community, winning media coverage and eventually an energy company sponsor, and the solar panels begin going up.\n\n\tWorking with the U.K.’s Optimistic Foundation, the couple are now sharing their organizing template – which they say has become effective at giving local schools solar too.\n\n\t“Power Station” builds on laughs tinged with poignancy to show what an assortment of struggling neighbors can actually do to turn things around.\n\n\t“We are trying – through the story telling of one street, all of the different characters and history of this one place – to show, actually we can have the power to make change,” as Powell puts it.\n\n\t“Power Station,” a production of Dartmouth Films and co-produced by Powell and Edelstyn, is now screening in U.K. cinemas.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAdded time for script delays, differing ideas of days off and additional cost of crew. Producers of “Blood & Sweat”, an upcoming eight-episode crime series produced by Japan’s AX-ON and Finland‘s ICS Nordic, offered a candid look at real-world challenges facing international co-productions, at a TIFFCOM seminar.\n\n\tTIFFCOM is the market arm of the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\n\tThe series, starring Anne Watanabe (“Cube,” “Stay Mum”) and Jasper Pääkkönen (“BlacKkKlansman,” “Vikings”), follows two detectives from opposing cultures, jointly investigating a series of murders.\n\t\n\n\tThe nine-month script development process required intensive back-and-forth between writers and producers. According to AX-ON producer Daniel Toivonen, episode screenplays were first written in English, translated into Japanese, and then had to undergo further reviews to make sure the dialogue was culturally specific and appropriate.\n\n\n\t“Initially the script is written in English, and we had that translated, but directly translated word for word, and then we had the actors speak those lines, to see if there was any discomfort and we rewrote from there, which took time,” said Toivonen.\n\n\tDifferent working culture and styles also posed problems during filming. According to Toivonen, Finnish crews operate under strict union rules with a priority on work-life balance, in sharp contrast to Japanese filming practices. The cost of labor in Finland is also higher than in Japan.\n\n\t“We were very strict about time management. In Japan, going over by a couple of minutes is fine, but in Finland, the camera shuts off on time time, sharp,” said Toivonen.\n\t\n\n\tUnder Finnish laws, the filming schedule was capped to a maximum of four 12-hour days per week. In practice, this meant shooting Monday through Thursday, followed by a prep day on Friday.\n\n\t“Four days a week in Japan does not work, so we would maybe work six days out of the week, or have a longer work day,” explained Toivonen. “And also with Finnish crew and a Finnish director [shooting in Japan], we needed more staff members who could speak English, and so that meant more budget.”\n\n\tCreative decisions are also more devolved in Finnish production culture as compared to their Japanese counterparts. According to Toivonen, Finnish directors tend to devolve greater decision making to department heads than Japanese directors. When asked about costume ideas, for example, a Finnish director working on the series reportedly responded, “This is Wardrobe’s job, and so I want to respect her thoughts.”\n\n\tSeparately, the seminar also introduced Local Content Bank (LCB), an initiative to help centralize and streamline Japanese content for the global market.\n\n\tLed by regional broadcaster Miyazaki Telecasting Company, the online platform allows Japan’s multitude of small and regional television stations to upload their extensive library of programming, which is then broken up and re-categorised (via AI) into individual pieces of content.\n\n\tOther users of the platform can then re-format and aggregate this content for new programming and long-form playlists.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDocumentarian Maximilien Dejoie confesses he was feeling the stress while following his subject for Ji.hlava doc fest main competition title “Everything Works Out (in the End).”\n\n\tHis road movie account of an American artist who moves quickly from a career as a stripper to would-be boxer to writer/musician while literally (in her view) fighting off demons, was challenging to capture, especially working solo with a handheld camera.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s kind of liberating,” Dejoie says of making the doc this way, allowing him to follow Katelyn Louise Doty – or just Kate more usually – wherever she goes…even when she reverses course on a life direction, sending the film plot into question.\n\n\n\tAs audiences learned following Dejoie’s screening at the Czech Republic’s top doc event, he followed Doty from Chicago across the northeastern U.S. for months and was rarely given a second chance if he missed something.\n\n\t“I had to compose my camera and my microphones in a way that I could handle it at any time,” he says. “You have to think about composition and focus and this and that all the time…I think the most challenging thing at that time was to capture the moment – because Kate did not wait for me.”\n\n\tInvariably Doty would say compelling things when not on camera and if Dejoie ever asked her to revisit that while he was rolling, the answer would be pitiless.\n\n\t“She would say, ‘No, I said it. The moment is gone.’”\n\n\tDejoie acknowledges the shoot was also tough on Doty, who hosted him in her living space and essentially lived on camera during the shoot while going through titanic personal changes.\n\t\n\n\t“I was very interested in how she was describing the strip club life,” the director says, “in a very non-victimizing way.” If anything, Doty seemed empowered by her work in a rowdy rock club, married to musician Chip Z’Nuff.\n\n\tRaised in a traditional Catholic home, Doty, out of economic necessity, had decided to pay off her debts by working in the adult entertainment industry, hoping the job would just be a temporary solution. But years later, when she felt the work had become a defining chapter in her life, she decided to change things up and reconnect with her faith.\n\n\tShe began working in a retirement home for aging Catholic priests and devoted herself to creative pursuits: recording her first album, writing a book, and, somehow characteristically, then deciding to take up boxing.\n\n\t“I shot a lot of material I didn’t end up using,” says Dejoie, who thought once Doty stepped into the ring he would have a compelling plotline for his film. But the phase passed and turned out not to be the answer she was looking for in life.\n\n\tIt wasn’t the first curveball he was thrown while shooting. Shortly after he arrived in the Chicago area to begin the project, Doty informed him, as he puts it, “that she was possessed by a demon” and would need an exorcism.\n\n\tAs for his own thoughts on the question of demons and exorcism, Italian-born Dejoie says he personally has trouble believing such things are real – but admits that sometimes when around Doty, that position can be challenging to maintain.\n\n\tAt one point, he says, Doty finally allowed him to film her praying – something she had refused to agree to up to then.\n\n\tAfterward, Doty said to him, “If you have questions, you can ask them now. Because I’m not going to allow you to shoot this again.”\n\n\tWhen Dejoie needed a fresh data card for the camera, he began rolling again — and found himself accidentally recording over the praying shots. It was something he’d never done before as a veteran camera operator and director.\n\n\tShe tells me, “Well, there you go. The demons don’t like you photographing this.”\n\n\t“Even though I’m not a believer, in that moment, that circumstance, for a moment I thought…uhhh.”\n\n\tThe exorcism experience led Doty to what he calls “a meditation on faith and redemption.”\n\t\n\n\tFeeling the need to reconnect with her roots, she left Chicago and hit the road, crossing the United States towards her hometown in Massachusetts, during the last days before the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\tIt was during this more contemplative phase of Doty’s life, which the director filmed with a slower pace, leaving both the audience and his subject with space to breathe, that Dejoie realized he had his story.\n\n\tHe knew the film would close on this return to a quieter life, in which Doty says what she wants most after everything is the chance “to be nobody.”\n\n\tDejoie says he knew he could finally put the camera down and the film would arise from whatever it was the two had just recorded together over so much space and time.\n\n\tHe told himself: “It’s going to just see her going back home and I’m going to build it from what I have.”\n",

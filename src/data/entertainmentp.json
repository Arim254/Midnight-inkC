    "body": "\n\tYes, Theodore Shapiro — the American composer behind the popular music for Ben Stiller’s multiple award-winning series “Severance” — is well aware of the recent Saturday Night Live sketch where Amy Poehler and Bowen Yang bring up his popular theme song. In fact, the composer is generally aware, and grateful for, the popularity of his work for the series, calling it “wonderful.”\n\n\t“One of my great heroes is John Williams,” he said while speaking at a roundtable at the Film Fest Ghent’s World Soundtrack Awards, where he is nominated for Television Composer of the Year for his work on the Apple TV show. “I think about the incredible themes he’s written and have become very pervasive in the culture. To have an experience where you’ve written something that is suddenly on ‘SNL’ or ‘The Tonight Show’ is crazy. I’ve felt like I might be in the middle of a dream that is about to end. I worked on Season 2 for probably two and a half years. To work so long and hard on something and have it come and have people respond positively was really thrilling and satisfying.”\n\t\n\n\tAsked if the popularity of his music adds any pressure for the work he’s currently conducting on Season 3 of “Severance,” Shapiro jokingly said, “Thank God the main title theme will be the same.” “I do feel some pressure,” he added. “I feel some pressure to keep making it interesting, keep evolving while staying rooted to what has been before. That is going to be the challenge.”\n\n\tSpeaking about his collaborative process with Stiller, Shapiro said the conversations between the two ahead of the new season were “more about some of the specific places that the story was going to go.”\n\t\n\n\t“In the second season, we talked a lot about episode four, the one that takes place in the forest,” he added. “We also talked about Ms. Cobel a lot. We don’t so much talk conceptually about where the music is going to go. That’s not really Ben’s thing. He has incredible instincts about music, so it was more about trying stuff out and trying to find those sounds that were going to help define the new places the story was going to.”\n\n\tShapiro was joined on the roundtable by fellow WSA nominees in Martin Phipps, nominated in the same category for “Black Doves”; Camille, nominated for Best Original Song for “El Mal” from “Emilia Pérez,” and Composer of the Year for the same film; and Robin Carolan, nominated for Discovery of the Year for “Nosferatu.”\n\n\tCarolan is yet another composer already looking ahead. The British musician is already working on his next collaboration with Robert Eggers, “Werwulf.” While he couldn’t go into much detail about the film, which is currently in production, Carolan praised the director’s “obsession with detail,” stating that being on one of his sets is great inspiration for composing.\n\n\t“In his sets, everything is period correct,” he said. “One day I was on set [for ‘Nosferatu’] and they were filming a scene and I immediately started getting ideas. Because Rob is so obsessed with everything feeling very authentic, even though you are on a set, you can very easily lose yourself in that space. That inspires me with what I’m doing.”\n\n\tThe one challenge that comes with this level of authenticity, at least music-wise, is that all instruments used for the score in Eggers’s films must match the time in which they were made. That was not as challenging in “Nosferatu,” a film set in the 1830s, but proved tricky with “The Northman,” which was set in the 10th century. “A thousand years ago, people were playing very different kinds of instruments, and no one quite agrees [on it]. With ‘Nosferatu,’ I could just get stuck in. There was less research involved.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNoah Schnapp joined his “Stranger Things” co-stars on the cover of Time magazine and recalled journalists prying for information about his sexuality during press junkets when he was just a young teenager. Schnapp publicly came out as gay in January 2023 at 18 years old. Public scrutiny around his sexuality had persisted for years, especially as “Stranger Things” worked towards his character, Will Byers, coming out as gay on the show.\n\n\t“When I was younger, I was obviously very scared of talking about it,” Schapp told the publication. “They would pry and ask me, ‘Is he gay? Are you gay?’ I was 12, 13. I didn’t know what to say.” \n\t\n\n\tSchnapp confirmed in a July 2022 interview with Variety that Will Byers was gay. “Stranger Things 4” was dominating the Netflix charts at the time, and the series had put Will’s sexuality front and center. When the actor publicly came out in a social media post months later, he wrote: “I guess I’m more similar to Will than I thought.”\n\n\t“Once I did fully embrace that Will was gay, it was just an exponential speed towards accepting it for myself,” Schnapp later told Variety in a cover story. “I would be in a completely different place if I didn’t have Will to portray, and to embrace and help me accept myself. I think if I never played that character, I probably would still be closeted.”\n\n\tSchnapp remembered how his original comments about Will being gay “blew up in the press,” and the reaction was overwhelmingly positive much to his surprise. He added: “Everyone was like, ‘Oh, Will’s gay! Hooray!’ I saw all these comments on Instagram and TikTok. There was not one bad thing about him being gay. I was like, if he has all this support, then why should I worry about anything?”\n\t\n\n\t“Stranger Things 5,” which launches in November on Netflix, is the first season of the show to launch with Schnapp as an openly gay actor. Ahead of filming the final episodes, the actor admitted that “I think the way I act in Season 5, honestly, might be a little different. I will be fully aware of who I am. Knowing all of that about myself and being able to invest that in my character, I’m honestly just excited.”\n\n\t“Stranger Things 5” kicks off with Vol. 1 on Nov. 26.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSnoop Dogg has partnered with GLAAD to support Spirit Day, the LGBTQ+ youth anti-bullying initiative. As part of the campaign, the rapper sat down with “The Voice” alum Jeremy Beloate — a member of the LGBTQ+ community who was part of Team Snoop on the NBC reality series — for a special Spirit Day conversation. The two discussed their recent collaboration on a new song titled “Love Is Love,” which is featured in Snoop’s animated children’s YouTube series, “Doggyland.”\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a beautiful thing that kids can have parents of all walks and be shown love, to be taught what love is…being able to have parents from all walks of life, whether it be two fathers, two mothers, whatever it is, love is the key,” Snoop said in the conversation. \n\n\n\tIn the children’s show, Beloate voices a puppy named Zippy, who joins the Doggyland pups to sing “Love Is Love,” a song that celebrates the love shared among families. Snoop, meanwhile, voices Bow Wizzle, one of the show’s main characters. \n\n\t“Our parents are different / No two are the same / But the one thing that’s for certain is the love won’t change,” the pups sing, as several same-sex couples appear on screen. “Families are special / They are so unique / Everybody’s got a purpose, more than what you see / We love you, parents / We love you so.”\n\n\tSnoop said in a statement: “At the end of the day, it’s all about love — that’s what we’re teachin’ the kids with ‘Love Is Love.’ Partnering with GLAAD for Spirit Day just felt right, because spreading love and respect for everybody is what real gangstas do. We’re showin’ the next generation that kindness is cool, inclusion is powerful, and love always wins.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tSnoop’s partnership with GLAAD, along with his new song “Love Is Love,” comes months after the rapper made controversial comments about the Pixar film “Lightyear.” \n\n\tOn an August episode of the “It’s Giving” podcast, Snoop Dogg said he felt “scared” to bring his grandchildren to the movies after watching “Lightyear,” the 2022 “Toy Story” spinoff that includes a scene featuring two women raising a child — along with Disney and Pixar’s first same-sex kiss.\n\n\t“They’re like, ‘She had a baby — with another woman,'” Snoop recalled. “Well, my grandson, in the middle of the movie is like, ‘Papa Snoop? How she have a baby with a woman? She’s a woman!’”\n\n\tSnoop remembered thinking, “Oh shit, I didn’t come in for this shit. I just came to watch the goddamn movie.’” \n\n\t“‘They just said, she and she had a baby — they’re both women. How does she have a baby?'” he recalled his grandson pressing. \n\n\t“It fucked me up. I’m like, scared to go to the movies,” Snoop added at the time. “Y’all throwing me in the middle of shit that I don’t have an answer for… It threw me for a loop. I’m like, ‘What part of the movie was this?’ These are kids. We have to show that at this age? They’re going to ask questions. I don’t have the answer.”\n\n\tDuring his recent conversation with Beloate, Snoop explained that “Love Is Love” is “teaching parenthood, it’s teaching the situation that kids and the world is going through right now in a beautiful way — through song, dance, melody — and just trying to get more understanding, clarity, on how we live and the way we live. And I felt like this music is a beautiful bridge to bring an understanding.”\n\n\tHe continued, “This is a program that we’ve been doing for years, where we involve kids, and these are things that kids have questions about. So now, hopefully, we can help answer these questions and help them to live a happy life and understand that love is love.”\n\n\tWatch Snoop and Beloate’s full conversation below: \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery has responded to a legal letter regarding calls for a boycott of Israeli film institutions, acknowledging such a pledge would likely violate its internal policies. \n\n\t“Warner Bros. Discovery is committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment for its employees, collaborators, and other stakeholders,” a spokesperson for WBD told Variety. \n\n\t“Our policies prohibit discrimination of any kind, including discrimination based on race, religion, national origin or ancestry. We believe a boycott of Israeli film institutions violates our policies. While we respect the rights of individuals and groups to express their views and advocate for causes, we will continue to align our business practices with the requirements of our policies and the law.”\n\t\n\n\tLast month a plethora of industry figures including Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem signed a pledge organized by Film Workers for Palestine vowing to avoid working with Israeli film institutions “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” Examples of “complicity” suggested by Film Workers for Palestine include “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them.”\n\n\tIn its FAQ section, Film Workers for Palestine clarifies that Israeli citizens of Palestinian heritage would not be subject to the same boycott as Israeli citizens of other heritage, with a different set of “context sensitive” guidelines applied instead.\n\n\tHowever law associations on both sides of the Atlantic have warned the boycott is likely to violate equality laws. As Variety reported exclusively last week, the group U.K. Lawyers for Israel has warned studios, agencies and unions that the pledge breaches the Equality Act 2010 making it “highly likely to be a litigation risk.” This could also have a knock-on effect on insurance and film finance.\n\t\n\n\tThe Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights under Law of Washington D.C. has also cautioned that in the States “numerous federal and state civil rights laws plainly prohibit” the boycott.\n\n\tLast month Paramount was the first studio to respond to the boycott, with Paramount chief communications officer Melissa Zukerman saying the studio does “not agree with recent efforts to boycott Israeli filmmakers.”\n\n\t“Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace,” Zukerman’s statement continued. “The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication — not less.”\n\n\tMeanwhile over 1,200 film industry figures including Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik and Debra Messing have signed an open letter rejecting the boycott.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCity of Hope staged its annual Spirit of Life Gala last night at Los Angeles’ Pacific Design Center, raising nearly $6 million to fund cancer research and treatment and featuring an appearance from Cher to introduce honoree Tom Corson, co-chairman and COO of Warner Records.\n\n\tThe event drew hundreds to West Hollywood including Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda, Diane Warren, Lucian Grainge, Haim Saban, Sylvia Rhone, Jimmy Jam, Neil Portnow and more, treating guests to an evening of speeches from those involved with City of Hope as well as a closing performance from Michael Bublé.\n\t\n\n\tCher made an unexpected appearance to introduce Corson, recalling the first time she met him the night before the “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again” premiere. “I found to my experience that the people who are the head of music companies are either suits or music men, and Tom is a music man,” she said. “‘Cause there’s lots of suits.” She discussed recording her first Christmas album, 2023’s “Christmas,” and how she felt playing him the first single, “DJ Play a Christmas Song.” “I sat down and was really nervous and I just sat there and went, oh please, please like it. Then he told me it was his birthday and this is the best Christmas gift he could have ever had.”\n\n\n\n\tCorson gave a gracious speech, thanking many in attendance including his Warner Music staff, who will participate as a team at City of Hope’s Walk for Hope on Nov. 2. “Music has the power to connect, inspire and heal, and tonight proved how deeply this industry cares for the lives behind the mission,” he said. “I’m honored to accept the Spirit of Life Award, but even more honored to stand with my Warner Records family and this extraordinary community as we help City of Hope accelerate discoveries and restore quality of life for patients everywhere.”\n\t\n\n\tFollowing his speech, Corson introduced Bublé who performed big band tunes to close the night. “I know that it’s an age-old story, artists and music executives loving each other,” joked Bublé. “Just being best friends. Feeling supported and loved. That’s my story with Tom. Truly. If I had it in my power, I would want this relationship for every artist.”\n\n\tDuring the fundraising portion of the evening, auctioneer Zachary Ian Krone encouraged attendees to donate to City of Hope’s cause. Lucian Grainge pledged $50,000, while Corson’s wife Susan offered $100,000 and Saban committed a staggering $250,000.\n\n\tAdditional speakers throughout the night included Aaron Bay-Schuck, co-chairman and CEO of Warner Records; Dr. Saro Armenian, Barron Hilton Chair of Pediatrics and the Director of the Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer (AYA) and Survivorship Programs at City of Hope; Kristin Bertell, chief philanthropy officer at City of Hope; Robert Stone, chief executive officer and the Helen and Morgan Chu Chief Executive Officer Distinguished Chair of City of Hope; Evan Lamberg, president of Universal Music Publishing North America and MFEI board chairman; Alissa Pollack, EVP of Global Music Marketing at iHeartMedia and MFEI board president; and Amber Mike, vice president of branded content and integration at BET Networks.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers for the series premiere of “9-1-1: Nashville.”\n\n\tRyan Murphy’s “9-1-1” franchise set out to fill the “Lone Star”-shaped hole in fans’ hearts with the Oct. 9 debut of new spinoff “9-1-1: Nashville.”\n\n\tWhile similar to Fox’s “9-1-1: Lone Star” with its cowboy aesthetic, ABC’s “Nashville” has an all new cast — Chris O’Donnell, Jessica Capshaw, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, LeAnn Rimes, Hailey Kilgore, Michael Provost, Juani Feliz and Hunter McVey — a new city and new drama in its first responder’s personal lives, in the form of long-lost sons, scheming exes and jealous brothers.\n\t\n\n\tThe show returns Oct. 16 with its second episode, which will pick up immediately where the series premiere left off, with a multi-episode tornado and stadium-collapse disaster arc. Yes, the “9-1-1” franchise has seen a twister before, but showrunner Rashad Raisani (who was also the head writer and producer on “Lone Star”) assures fans that “Nashville” will distinguish itself from its L.A.-based parent series “9-1-1” (led by series creator and showrunner Tim Minear) as well as “Lone Star.” But its first crossover episode with lead-in “9-1-1” is in the second episode of “Nashville.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“There is going to be a small one coming up right away that is more on the ‘9-1-1’ hour,” Raisani teased to Variety ahead of Episode 2, adding: “We are planning and trying to figure out a way to get this crossover going. Whether it’ll be late in Season 1 or early Season 2, it’s in the works for sure.”\n\n\tAs for whether or not Raisani is planning to bring back any fan-favorite “Lone Star” characters on “Nashville,” he says he would “love it,” but “it’s going to depend on story, and it’s going to depend on actors’ availability.”\n\t\n\n\t“We definitely would love to bring them in, and I think we’re going to balance that with wanting to let our characters from ‘Nashville’ find their footing with the audience, and shine. And then once that’s really up and running, then we can start integrating some of these other characters.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRaisani noted that “Lone Star” lead Rob Lowe’s character Owen ended in up New York at the end of the Fox series, “so that’s not too far away” — plus, Lowe’s real-life brother, Chad Lowe, is a producer on the “Nashville” set, “so there’s always possibilities.”\n\n\tSee below for more from Variety’s “9-1-1: Nashville” debut chat with Raisani.\n\t\n\t\t“9-1-1: Nashville” breaks a precedent set by “9-1-1: Lone Star,” which could have been “9-1-1: Austin.” Did you consider “9-1-1: Music City,” to be more in keeping with the previous choice?\t\n\n\tWe actually did explore a few different titles. And as we got to know the city of Nashville, and in talking with them, too — and to be honest, I think there may have been some marketing people — I think that “Nashville” just said it. And there was a little bit of vagueness about Music City, that people would think it was a musical or music-based. And also, we wanted to not just say that Nashville is only about music. There’s other things that are really cool and dynamic about it. And so I think at the end of the day, we just thought, OK, let’s just say “Nashville,” because then it’s a little bit more all encompassing than maybe naming one aspect of the city.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhere did the long-lost son storyline between Don (Chris O’Donnell), his son Ryan (Michael Provost), and his estranged son Blue (Hunter McVey), come from as the central conflict of the show?\t\n\n\tRyan Murphy had that original inspiration. He just really wanted to tell a story about a father and a son, and the son felt like he always had the perfect family, and then it gets disrupted in the biggest way. That was Ryan’s original inspiration for how to approach this whole series, and then we just kind of went with it. And for me, I’ve always been obsessed with the prodigal son story in the Bible, and I’m an older brother. I’ve always identify with a brother who feels like, “Hey, what the hell? I did all this work, and now I’m getting kicked to the curb.” So it’s always been a really powerful story for me, and when he pitched it, I was able to connect with it right away.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow did LeAnn Rimes get involved in the show to play Dixie, Blue’s mother — and the ex-girlfriend of Don, who is married to Blythe (Jessica Capshaw)?\t\n\n\tShe got involved the old-fashioned way. That part was just written as Dixie, and she auditioned. And I’ll never forget, we got a call from casting right after she auditioned to say, “We just saw lightning in a bottle.” And when I watched that audition, it was so electric, it was so incredible. Because obviously, I’ve known who LeAnn Rimes is for many years, but I thought she was unrecognizable as Dixie. It was just one of those things where even before she spoke, she had the cigarette in her hand, and the way she held it, I was like, “Oh, well, that’s it. That’s her.” And so she truly just gave the audition of all time. For me, it was just amazing.\n\t\n\t\tI need to know if the character name for Dixie’s son, Blue, came before or after LeAnn Rimes — who has a famous song titled “Blue” — was cast.\t\n\n\tThat is just kismet. Ryan Murphy, another great line of his was, “And I think the son should be named Blue, because I think America is ready for a kid named Blue.” And so that was before we knew LeAnn was involved. And then I said to her, “Isn’t this bizarre?” It’s just kismet.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you decide what the big opening emergency for “Nashville” would be?\t\n\n\tIt was a confluence of things. One of them was there’s a real stadium collapse, a terrible story, that this was inspired by. We had been looking at it when we were doing “Lone Star,” specifically, but it didn’t ever make sense for the creative or the logistics that we could pull it off in “Lone Star.” And then as we were looking for, what’s the most sort of iconic way to get into “Nashville”? What’s the most iconic emergency? That collapse was always in my mind, that we could use that. And then our great partners at ABC, they were like, “Let’s get somebody great. Let’s not have it be some fake singer. Let’s get a real singer who can act and can be a character in the show.” And that was how it started to turn into Kane Brown. And then it just felt like, OK, now we really have something exciting, where it can be somebody who’s famous anyway, who has a great song they’ll play, and then they can have a big hand in the resolution of the story.\n\t\n\t\tWe only got to see a little bit of Kimberly Williams-Paisley’s character, the 9-1-1- dispatcher Cammie, in the premiere. What can you tease about her?\t\n\n\tHer character, we call her the Southern heartbeat of the show. Kimberly is so wonderful as Cammie. She’s got such a sweet, but also wry, funny energy. And I just, I just love all the calls she does. She’s so terrific. And we’re gonna find out that Cammie did not start as a 9-1-1 dispatcher. She came to this very late in life, in the last five years. She was a music producer, and after a terrible tragedy, which we’ll unpack in the show, she switched careers to try and make the world a better place. She has a lot going on beneath the surface.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIn the premiere, Don decides to give his long-lost son Blue a job at the fire station alongside himself and his other son, Ryan, citing a cadet program where you can get training in the field. Is that a real program? And how is this going to work in the show, because it feels crazy even for “9-1-1”?\t\n\n\tThe cadet program is a real program, and it has been. Now, the part where you go, “OK, it’s usually done in, like, extreme emergencies. It’s when it’s the fire of all fires.” So, yeah, Don is technically right, that does exist. But as Ryan’s like, that’s crazy — and then the chief of the fire department in a few episodes is going to be like, That’s crazy. That’s unacceptable — the you-know-what will hit the fan on that. But a big thing that we’re trying to do also is Don’s guilt is making him do things that maybe he shouldn’t necessarily do as a captain at the beginning. That was the impetus for that.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has commissioned the Canadian series “The Granville Girls,” based on Cat Cahill’s “Gilbert Girls” novels. \n\n\tThe streamer has ordered eight episodes of the series. The official logline states: \n\n\t“As the great railway sweeps across the Canadian Rockies, Emma Daniels becomes a ‘Granville Girl,’ one of a select few women hired to work at the Granville Hotel. The job offers adventure, friendship, and a chance to support her family—if she can resist the hotel’s strictest rule: never fraternize with the men. But when Emma’s heart is captured by the hotel’s mysterious builder, she faces a choice that could cost her everything.” \n\t\n\n\tAdriana Maggs (“Law & Order Toronto: Criminal Intent,” “Frontier”) will serve as writer and showrunner on the series. Christina Jennings (“Murdoch Mysteries,” “Departure”), chairman and president of Shaftesbury, will executive produce. Shaftesbury will produce. \n\n\n\t“Shaftesbury is delighted to partner with Netflix and showrunner Adriana Maggs to bring ‘The Granville Girls’ to the screen,” Jennings said. Global audiences will discover the splendour of the Rocky Mountains — a perfect setting for our young women to explore adventure, friendship and romance.”\n\n\tThere have been six books in “The Gilbert Girls” series to date, beginning with “Forbidden Forever” and with the most recent entry being “On the Edge of Forever.” \n\n\t“’The Granville Girls’ is a big blue sky series that offers the comfort of female friendship and the allure of period romance,” said Danielle Woodrow and Tara Woodbury, directors of content for Netflix Canada. “Between Adriana’s distinctive voice and Christina’s powerhouse producing, we’re confident that audiences are going to be hooked from the first episode.” \n\t\n\n\tThis marks Netflix’s latest move into the western romance genre. The streamer currently airs the series “Ransom Canyon” (based on the Jodi Thomas novels), which has been renewed for a second season. Variety also reported that Netflix is currently developing a series take on Elsie Silver’s Chestnut Springs novels. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMarc Maron has once again addressed his long-standing feud with Jon Stewart, saying it is “fully fueled” by Maron’s “insecurity.”\n\n\t“Jon never did anything to me,” Maron told Esquire. “I was just jealous.”\n\n\tMaron has previously spoken about his rivalry with the “Daily Show” host, saying it dates back to when they both came up in the comedy scene in the 1990s. Maron was one of Stewart’s successors as the host of the Comedy Central clip show “Short Attention Span Theater,” before it was canceled in 1994. Stewart would soon go on to host “The Daily Show” and become one of the most recognizable faces in comedy.\n\t\n\n\tMaron was jealous of Stewart because he saw him as a “smart, cute, Jewish guy” who was “disciplined” and knew how to best harness and capitalize on his talents. “I never had any control over my talent. I never knew its limitations or what it was,” Maron said.\n\n\n\t“Throughout my early career, Jon, who is roughly my age, was everywhere,” he added. “My envy of him was always … I would just shit on him, and to his face. It was consuming. I couldn’t get through a week without him being on the cover of a magazine. For some reason, I saw him as, ‘If I could only have my shit together, I could be more like that guy.’ … Which wasn’t true, because I was out of my mind, and I was definitely gunning for something else.”\n\n\tAsked by Esquire if he ever tried to get Stewart on “WTF,” his nearly 1,700-episode podcast that ended earlier this week, Maron said he put out an offer “early on” in the show’s run. He recalled telling Stewart about the podcast on the phone and “kind of apologizing.” According to Maron, Stewart said, “There’s no love here.” \n\t\n\n\t“He said, ‘I might be willing to have coffee or something, but I’m not doing that with you,'” Maron said. “And then he said, ‘I’m sure what you’re doing is very creative, and good luck with it.’ Just the stinging condescension of that … it didn’t help anything. And now he’s doing a podcast. So, full circle!”\n",

Rebecca and Jake originally claimed their son was kidnapped from the parking lot of a Big 5 Sporting Goods store in Yucaipa, in San Bernardino County ... Rebecca told police she was changing the child's diaper next to her car in the parking lot when she was approached from behind and assaulted, knocking her out. She said when she came to, the baby was gone.\n      \n    \n          Investigators found inconsistencies in Rebecca's story ... prompting a K9 search of the Haro family home and the seizure of Jake's car for evidence.\n      \n    \n          Then in August, authorities arrested Jake and Rebecca for murder -- and, Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin alleged Emmanuel was a victim of extended abuse and likely succumbed to his injuries.\n      \n    \n          Jake was seen shackled, accompanying law enforcement officers in August during a search for the baby in a field in Moreno Valley, in Riverside County, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Jake's sentencing is set for November 3. Rebecca's felony settlement conference is scheduled for October 28, NBC Palm Springs reports.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Jake Haro\n              \n                          \n                Rebecca Haro\n              \n                          \n                Emmanuel Haro\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Emmanuel Haro Tragedy\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Ellison is on a race against the clock, meeting political leaders and entertainment figures across Europe to rally support for his $108.4 billion hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery and build an opposition against rival suitor Netflix. The outreach comes as regulators in Europe and the U.S. continue to scrutinize both deals.\n\n\tOn Wednesday, Ellison and his delegation traveled to Paris, where they met with French President Emmanuel Macron and culture minister Rachida Dati as well as key figures within the film landscape, notably the president of the National Film Board (CNC) Gaetan Bruel; Gaumont CEO Sidonie Dumas; Richard Patry, the head of the French Exhibition Association; and Metropolitan Filmexport boss Victor Hadida. Paramount execs have also traveled to Germany and the U.K. (where Ellison spoke to Lisa Nandy, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport) and held meetings at the European Commission, according to Bloomberg, which was first to report on Ellison’s visit to the French Elysée. \n\t\n\n\tWhile Ellison was busy mounting a European lobbying push in France, Germany and the U.K., a Delaware Chancery Court judge rejected Paramount Skydance’s attempt to fast-track its lawsuit against Warner Bros Discovery, which seeks to force the company to disclose financial details of its $83 billion deal with Netflix. That leaves Ellison’s hostile $30-per-share takeover bid to proceed without expedited discovery and with an expiration date (self-imposed by Paramount Skydance) set for Jan. 21.\n\n\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was in France last month for the premiere of “Emily in Paris” Season 4, where he also met with industry players, talked to Macron as Darren Star was receiving the Legion of Honor at the Elysée Palace, stopped by Canal+ Group’s upfront and vowed to keep Warner Bros. movies in theaters during a fireside chat with Canal+ Group CEO Maxime Saada. The next day, Sarandos and Greg Peters visited Discovery CEO David Zaslav on the historic Warner Bros. Studio lot in Burbank to show the world that his deal was locked for good. French industry figures were stunned when just a few weeks later, rumors started circling about Netflix’s plan to have a 17-day window for Warner Bros. movies.\n\t\n\n\tDuring his conversations with French executives and creatives this week, Ellison stressed how committed to the theatrical experience he was. \n\n\t“I was impressed by David Ellison’s determination to try to buy Warner. His arguments are strong,” an industry source who attended the conversations in Paris told Variety. “He explained his strategy to us: he is betting everything on keeping both studios, respecting media chronology and windows in France and other countries, and maintaining a high level of production at Paramount and Warner.”\n\n\tAnother source said he believes Ellison’s efforts to rally political and industry support are not vain. “We’re hearing that the deal with Netflix is being heavily scrutinized in the U.S. and we think it’s going to hit a wall with the European anti-trust regulators,” said another source, before adding that Ellison “made it crystal clear that seeing Warner selling to Paramount Skydance rather than Netflix would be a much happier outcome for the film industry.” In France, a 17-day theatrical window would not be possible due to local windowing rules where cinemas have a four month exclusive window on any new releases. Netflix, meanwhile, has to wait 15 months to access newly released films. The streamer has called out those rules and even lodged an appeal with France’s Council of State.\n\n\tThe fate of Warner Bros. is a source of great concern for exhibitors across the pond, who have already been weakened by declining theatrical admissions in 2025. The studio is known to be not only a source of tentpoles but also the most “European” of the American studios.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures Networks India has restructured its leadership team to support its evolution into a content-driven, multi-lingual entertainment company that treats all distribution platforms equally.\n\n\tThe Mumbai-based broadcaster unveiled the changes Friday, explaining that the reorganization will give individual teams complete control over their content portfolios while breaking down operational barriers between its television networks and SonyLIV streaming platform. The goal is to create a more cohesive business approach that treats linear and digital distribution as equally important revenue channels.\n\t\n\n\tThe new structure places four executives in charge of distinct content portfolios, with each responsible for all aspects of their channels’ operations including creative development, scheduling, audience engagement initiatives, and promotional activities across both broadcast and streaming. Nachiket Pantvaidya now runs Sony Entertainment Television, Sony Marathi, and the company’s film production unit. Ajay Bhalwankar oversees Sony SAB, the film channels portfolio, free-to-air offerings, and factual programming. Rajaraman Sundaram has been tasked with building the broadcaster’s presence in southern India, while Ambesh Tiwari manages Sony AATH and children’s programming.\n\n\n\tSPNI will recruit an external candidate to run its streaming operations, though the company has not yet finalized its choice. Until that appointment is made, Banerjee will personally manage the digital division. Danish Khan, business head of SonyLIV and production unit Studio NXT, is exiting SPNI next month.\n\t\n\n\tOn the commercial side, the broadcaster is bringing together its various income sources – including advertising, carriage fees, sports rights, and overseas licensing – under a single executive. Rajesh Kaul will serve as chief revenue officer, managing a team that includes four newly promoted lieutenants. Akshay Agrawal now runs television advertising sales, while Makarand Palekar handles distribution agreements with cable and satellite operators. Ranjana Mangla, who previously focused solely on streaming advertising, will now also develop the company’s YouTube channel strategy. Manish Aggarwal oversees business-to-business deals and content licensing for SonyLIV. All four report directly to Kaul.\n\n\tIn corporate functions, Gaurav Laghate takes responsibility for external communications, brand management, and public relations. Meanwhile, office management and facility operations have been moved under the purview of chief human resources officer Manu Wadhwa.\n\n\tGaurav Banerjee, MD & CEO of Sony Pictures Networks India, stated: “As we look ahead to our next phase of growth, we have reviewed our operating model and organizational structure to ensure they best support our goals. We are redefining our content strategy from a largely linear-first to a linear and digital approach that delivers seamless consumer experience across platforms. By empowering our teams with greater ownership and driving deeper collaboration, we will improve focus, agility, and execution across the organization, while strengthening our customer-centric approach across brand and content.”\n\n\tSony Pictures Networks India operates a portfolio of 28 television channels available in standard and high definition, attracting more than 700 million viewers locally while distributing content to over 150 countries. The company functions as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation, Japan.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAdding another wrinkle to an already eclectic slate targeting market segments still displaying demand, Ezequiel Olzanski has added 20 new titles to EO Media’s Content Americas 2026 sales slate, drawing heavily on EO’s long-standing alliances with U.S.-company Nicely Entertainment and Miami-based Gluon Media. \n\n\tPotential standouts among new additions take in Stillz’ coming of-age found-footage tale “Barrio Triste,” produced by Harmony Korine, “A Useful Ghost,” a deadpan Thai fantasy genre mash which scooped Cannes Critics’ Week 2025 Grand Prix, and tone-shifting Cannes Midnight French comedy “Bloody Oranges,” all acquired from Gluon.\n\t\n\n\tAlso in the new title mix are faith-based family drama series “Crossroad Springs,” romcom “Love at Lookout Lake” and Ate de Jong’s showbiz exposé “Country Heart,” co-written by former Variety VP Steven Gaydos. \n\n\n\tFurther new titles take in a brace of feel-good romantic holiday movies sourced from Nicely Entertainment , such as “A Cherry Pie Christmas,” “The Christmas Ticket,” “Exes of Christmas Past,” “The Spirit of Christmas Station,” “Christmas In The  Ballroom,”  “Once Upon a Christmas Crown,” “Christmas at Fields Ranch” and “A Scottish Christmas Secret.”\n\n\tThese new movies and shows join a sales slate strong on top Hollywood cast – Olzanski name checks Jon Hamm, Nicole Kidman, Brian Cranston, Kevin Hart, Bradley Cooper, Zoe Saldana, Diane Keaton, Al Pacino and Ryan Reynolds – and action stalwarts Jason Statham, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren and Steven Segal.\n\t\n\n\tIn all, EO Media’s library boasts 250 movies and series, more than 150 dubbed into Spanish and available for for streaming services, cable and free-to-air TV channels and other windows including in flight rights, Olzanski added. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCrossroad Springs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of EO Media\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEO Media co-produced Amazon Studios series “El Presidente,” showrun by Academy Award winner Armando Bo, Flow’s “Cris Miró (Ella)” and new Star+ Original bio series “Ringo: Glory & Death,” about storied life of Argentine boxer Oscar “Ringo” Bonavena, who near went the distance in 1970 with Muhammad Ali, bringing what Variety described as a “marauding, tough as a ship’s deck style” to the ring.  \n\n\tEO Media announced in May 2024 “Punta Blanca,” a murder mystery produced with Uruguay-based El Camino Films (“Blindness”) and starring Natalia Oreiro (“Iosi, the Regretful Spy”).

    "body": "\n\tAfghan director Shahrbanoo Sadat’s romantic comedy “No Good Men” has been set as Berlin Film Festival opener.\n\n\tThe German-backed film set inside a Kabul newsroom during the democratic era, before the Taliban returned to power in 2021, will open the festival on Feb. 12 at the Berlinale Palast as a Berlinale Special Gala. \n\n\tBerlinale Director Tricia Tuttle commented: “Shahrbanoo Sadat is one of the most exciting voices in world cinema and ‘No Good Men’ really delivers on the promise of her first two features.”\n\t\n\n\tTuttle added: “Sadat continues her vital work spotlighting Afghan women’s lives, here bringing romance and touches of humour to a rousingly political story.” “That it is based on real events, and the director risked so much to get this film made makes ‘No Good Men’ even more meaningful as our opening gala of the 76th Berlinale,” the Berlin fest chief went on to note.\n\n\n\t“No Good Men” tells the story of a young camerawoman in Kabul who falls for a married TV reporter twice her age after discovering her husband has been cheating on her. While forbidden love simmers inside the newsroom, the film also portrays the often-dangerous work of reporters in Kabul along with the absurdities of daily life in the city at that time.\n\n\tSadat was forced to flee the Afghan capital with her family in 2021 after Taliban forces overran the city.\n\n\tSadat’s directorial debut “Wolf and Sheep” which blends realism with folkloric magic and follows shepherd children in a remote Afghan mountain village, won the top prize in Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight section in 2016. It was followed by “The Orphanage,” in which a boy is forced to live in a Soviet-run orphanage during the 1981 occupation, that played at Cannes Directors’ Fortnight in 2019.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo of the U.K.’s fastest rising stars are set to reveal the full lineup of the 2026 BAFTA Film Awards nominations.\n\n\tDavid Jonsson and Aimee Lou Wood are on hosting duties for the nominees announcement, which will start at 12 p.m. U.K. (4 a.m. PT) on Jan. 27 at the British Academy’s headquarters at 195 Piccadilly in London (and livestreamed on BAFTA’s YouTube and X channels).\n\n\tFollowing the first round of BAFTA voting, Paul Thomas Anderson’s scathing U.S. satire “One Battle After Another” leads with 16 nods across the longlist categories, a record since the round was first introduced in 2021, and is expected to continue its domination into the nominations. Further behind are “Hamnet” and “Sinners” with 14 longlist slots each, followed by “Marty Supreme” with 13 and “Bugonia” and “Frankenstein,” both with 12. \n\t\n\n\tNeither Jonsson nor Wood are strangers to the BAFTAs. Wood, who saw her star soar following the third season of “The White Lotus” last year, won the BAFTA TV award for best female comedy performance for her breakout role in Netflix series “Sex Education.” In 2023, she was nominated for the BAFTA Rising Star Award and is currently shooting Sam Mendes’ four-part biopic about the Beatles.\n\n\n\tJonsson, meanwhile, is the current holder of the BAFTA Rising Star Award, winning in 2025 following “Alien: Romulus” and his breakout turn in “Rye Lane.” He was recently seen in “The Long Walk” and “Wasteman,” the latter of which is on the BAFTA longlist for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer. Jonsson will soon star as Sammy Davis Jr. alongside Sydney Sweeney in “Scandalous!,” being directed by Colman Domingo.\n\t\n\n\tOf all the BAFTA film award categories, the Rising Star nominees have already been revealed. This year’s lineup, unveiled on Wednesday, includes Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”), Miles Caton (“Sinners”), Archie Madekwe (“Lurker”), Robert Aramayo (“I Swear”) and Posy Sterling (“Lollipop”).\n\n\tThe second round of voting closes Jan. 20. Following the nominations announcement on Jan. 27, the BAFTA Film Awards ceremony will take place on Feb. 22 at London’s Royal Festival Hall. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIndependent music publisher Kobalt has formed a worldwide partnership with Madverse Music Group, an India-based company serving the South Asian independent music sector with distribution, publishing and marketing services.\n\n\tUnder the agreement, Madverse’s community of independent songwriters, composers and producers will gain access to Kobalt’s publishing administration network. Services include royalty collection in more than 180 markets, improved metadata tracking and expanded synchronization licensing opportunities. Madverse currently works with a client base exceeding 150,000 artists and labels throughout India and South Asia.\n\t\n\n\tThe partnership targets a gap in international royalty collection that has historically prevented South Asian creators from capturing overseas earnings. \n\n\n\tMadverse CEO Rohan Nesho Jain said: “This partnership with Kobalt represents a pivotal moment in our mission to empower India’s independent music community. For too long, Indian creators have left money on the table simply because the infrastructure to collect global royalties was broken and almost nonexistent. \n\n\t“Publishing royalties are essentially a musician’s pension fund – they generate income long after the initial release, sometimes for generations. Through this collaboration, we’re ensuring that Indian independent artists can finally access and protect these earnings seamlessly, no matter where in the world their music is played,” Jain added. “This is about more than just collecting royalties; it’s about building sustainable careers and giving our artists the financial foundation they deserve. When independent voices are properly compensated and protected, the entire music ecosystem becomes richer and more diverse.”\n\t\n\n\tThe deal supports Madverse’s “Independent, Not Alone” philosophy, which emphasizes creator ownership and control. The partnership will offer improved transparency and operational efficiency while allowing artists to retain their rights.\n\n\tSimon Moor, Kobalt’s managing director for the Asia-Pacific region, said: “Madverse has built an impressive ecosystem that supports one of the most dynamic independent music communities in the world. By combining their creator-first approach with Kobalt’s global publishing infrastructure, we’re committed to ensuring Madverse songwriters and producers have the resources, accuracy, and reach they need to succeed on an international scale.”\n\n\tKobalt administers publishing for more than 1 million compositions through 10 international offices. The company’s songwriter and publisher clients include Roddy Ricch, Max Martin, Karol G, Phoebe Bridgers and Paul McCartney. Kobalt’s catalog accounts for roughly 35% of top 100 songs and albums in the U.S. and U.K.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Tokyo Broadcasting System has made a strategic investment in Legendary Entertainment, the producer of “Dune” and the Godzilla franchise, that will allow the Hollywood company access to more Japanese intellectual property.\n\n\tTBS – which operates broadcast networks, streaming platforms, production studios and a broad entertainment portfolio – has acquired a $150 million minority ownership stake in Legendary, led by CEO Josh Grode and chief creative Mary Parent. Legendary leadership and Apollo Funds remain co-owners of the studio’s majority stake. The partnership is non-exclusive across content verticals. \n\t\n\n\t“For decades, TBS has played a central role working with all members of the creative ecosystem in Japan, from multiple publishers to animators to writers and artists. Its position within the local market presents exciting opportunities for collaboration. We look forward to working with TBS to broaden our relationships in Japan and to help expand the global reach of its rich IP to the rest of the world in a manner that respects and honors the talented creators,” said Grode.\n\n\n\tIncluded in the TBS portfolio is production shop The Seven (which has both Japanese and domestic offices), behind series including Netflix’s “Alice in Borderland” and “Yu Yu Hakusho.” Legendary’s slate is steeped in Japanese IP across both theatrical films and shows, including “Godzilla x Kong: Supernova,” “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters,” “Street Fighter,” which recently wrapped production and the previously produced “Pokémon: Detective Pikachu.” \n\t\n\n\tYayoi Nakatani, board director and chief growth officer of TBS Holdings, said he was “thrilled to partner with Legendary, a world-class studio with a remarkable track record of history-making global hits. Legendary’s exceptional creativity and their proven ability to build and expand IPs into worldwide franchises will be an indispensable driving force to our global strategy.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Daily Show” host Michael Kosta will play a different type of anchor on Tracy Morgan’s “The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins,” premiering on Jan. 18.\n\n\tKosta will guest star on the upcoming NBC comedy series as Brett Mann, the smug, self-important host of a “SportsCenter”-style show. (Kosta himself was a former professional athlete, and he he hosts the podcast “Tennis Anyone” and contributes to Tennis Channel.)\n\n\n\tMorgan leads “The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins” as a disgraced former football star on a mission to rehabilitate his image with acclaimed filmmaker Arthur Tobin (played by Daniel Radcliffe). On his climb back to greatness, Reggie is forced to confront the ghosts of his past. The cast also includes Erika Alexander as Monica — Reggie’s ex-wife, agent and business manager — plus Bobby Moynihan, Precious Way and Jalyn Hall. \n\t\n\n\t“Reggie Dinkins” will have an early premiere on Sunday, immediately following the Rams-Bears NFL game. The series will then return on Feb. 23 at 8 p.m. with an encore of the pilot, plus a new episode.\n\n\tThe series reunites Morgan with “30 Rock” creator Tina Fey, who serves as an executive producer on “Reggie Dinkins.” Robert Carlock and Sam Means are the co-showrunners and writers, and they executive produce alongside Morgan, Eric Gurian and David Miner.\n\n\tThe series is produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group; Little Stranger, Inc.; 3 Arts Entertainment; Bevel Gears; Means Ends Production; and Streetlife Productions, Inc. \n\n\tKosta is an Emmy-winning comedian who sits behind the “Daily Show” desk on Comedy Central. He is represented by El Centro Management.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe BBC and YouTube are in talks for a landmark deal that would see the British broadcaster produce content for the video platform, Variety has confirmed.\n\n\tThe deal — initially reported in the Financial Times — is expected to be announced as soon as next week, and would involve the BBC making bespoke shows for new and existing channels it operates on YouTube that could then also be available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds. The BBC declined to comment on the matter, and YouTube did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment.\n\t\n\n\tUnlike other U.K. networks who upload entire existing shows to YouTube, Variety understands this arrangement would see the BBC commission dedicated short and long form content for the platform.\n\n\n\tThe deal points to the increasing challenge YouTube has posed for linear television channels, with younger audiences consistently turning to the platform for both entertainment and news. In December, ratings agency Barb reported that the number of viewers watching YouTube (52 million) surpassed that of the BBC’s combined channels (51 million) for the first time. According to the FT, the content that the BBC would produce on YouTube would mainly target these younger audiences, focusing on shows made by BBC Three, children’s programs and sports.\n\n\tThe FT reports that the BBC would also be able to generate a profit from the partnership with YouTube by advertising on programs shown outside of the U.K. As it stands, the BBC does not earn money through advertising on home soil as it is a public-service broadcaster, instead charging a license fee to British audiences for access to its content. \n\t\n\n\tA possible BBC-YouTube deal comes as the BBC is fighting a $10 billion defamation lawsuit from U.S. President Donald Trump over an edit of his Jan. 6 speech on its “Panorama” program, and following the news that YouTube would become the home of the Oscars in 2029 after airing on ABC for decades. \n",

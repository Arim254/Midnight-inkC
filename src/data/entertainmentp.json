    "body": "\n\tIt’s Halloween night at Madison Square Garden, and a group of 20-somethings are deep into a sacred ritual: gabbing in the bathroom mirror with your girlfriends. They fluff their hair and touch up lip gloss while discussing the costumes they’re planning for a party the following night. \n\n\t“It’s so hard,” one of them sighs, “to find something that’s both slutty enough and comfy enough.” Her posse groans in sympathy and agreement.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreg Swales for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLuckily, the artist they’re here to see has a solution. Sabrina Carpenter, who has retitled her long-running “Short n’ Sweet Tour” to “Short n’ Spooky” for the holiday, closes out her show with the exact brand of sex appeal those fans in the bathroom were shooting for. She’s wearing a floor-length gown covered in shimmering orange gems with some black spots and a blue necktie. Eventually, she tears away the bottom to reveal a miniskirt that flatters her figure, but there’s no mistaking it: She’s Fred Flintstone. \n\n\t“I was thinking about doing Pebbles or Bamm-Bamm or Wilma,” Carpenter says the following week, sitting down for a conversation in downtown New York. “And then I was like, ‘You know what? Fred can get away with things.’”\n\n\tIt tracks: This year, Carpenter has gotten away with a lot.\n\n\tIn February, she went to the Grammys as a nominated artist for the first time, taking home two awards — best pop solo performance for “Espresso” and pop vocal album for “Short n’ Sweet” — out of six nods. She celebrated those wins on the road; her first arena tour launched in September 2024, and in March, she set off on the European leg. Even as she continued  to promote “Short n’ Sweet,” the next chapter of her career began: She released “Manchild” in June, performing the song live for the first time at London’s famed summer concert series BST Hyde Park. \n\t\n\n\t“Why so sexy if so dumb? / And how survive the earth so long?” Carpenter sang, but she wasn’t just skewering her immature exes. With the single, and with the release of her seventh studio album, “Man’s Best Friend,” in August, Carpenter proved that the raunchy sensibilities of earlier songs like “Bed Chem” and “Juno” were much deeper than an attempt to shed her image as a good girl from Disney Channel, where she’d started her career. Instead, she was crafting a thesis on what a next-generation pop star could be. \n\n\tWithin the pages of the pop playbook written over the past decade are edicts from Beyoncé and Ariana Grande about the divine power of owning your womanhood and sexuality, while Taylor Swift and Adele have taught of vulnerability as strength and confessionalism as currency. Lady Gaga and Charli xcx demonstrate that a touch of chaos can be the best medicine. Those lessons are all reflected in Carpenter’s catalog. But, at 26, she also has something to say that her big sisters in music haven’t quite gotten to yet: Love and lust drive us all to make crazy choices, so even the most devastating breakups tend to come with a funny-as-hell story or two. Why not reflect that on the radio?\n\n\t“I feel like you can be super confident and strong and also knowingly fuck up and knowingly get yourself into situations that are not good for you. But you’re doing it all because you are a smart woman and because you’re in control of your life,” Carpenter says. “You can be super put-together and everything can be in shambles. Like, two things can exist!”\n\n\tThat’s what she was saying when she got on her hands and knees while shooting the cover for “Man’s Best Friend,” a fistful of her hair locked in an anonymous man’s grip. “You can be so in control and so not in control at the same time,” Carpenter says. In the photo, she looks directly into the camera with an inscrutable expression on her face. Is it stress, pleasure or both? Discussing the image — and the criticism it drew when it dropped in June, with many calling it degrading to women — she says, “It was about how people try to control women, and how I felt emotionally yanked around by these relationships that I had, and how much power you’re allowing yourself to give them.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreg Swales for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA week after her sold-out five-night residency at Madison Square Garden, Carpenter reflects on the debacle from a hotel room in Manhattan. Minutes ago, she channeled a French chanteuse in a white Jacquemus dress and matching vintage scarf, posing for photos on the penthouse balcony. After saying goodbye to Oscar, the orange tabby she requested join her for the shoot, she trades in her lace gown for a sweatshirt, sweatpants and fleece-lined boots. Feeling cozy, she suggests that we do our interview sitting on the floor. She catches sight of my old-school tape recorder and beams: “Retro! I’m glad they’re still around!” \n\n\tIf Carpenter has moments of weakness, she saves them for her love life. Things are different at work. About the “Man’s Best Friend” cover, she balances graciousness and guiltlessness with ease. “It meant one thing to me and 100 things to other people, and I was looking at it going, ‘That’s valid. Mine’s valid. What’s for dinner?’” she says with a shrug. “Not to bypass the weight that it did carry for some people. I saw it and was like, ‘That is a great point. It wasn’t the point I was trying to make.’” She’s speaking warmly, but with a firmness too — until I ask about the alternate album cover she released later, where she’s on her feet, holding a man’s arm. “Oh, girl,” she says with a wave, dismissing the idea that she’d given in to the hate. “I just wanted to take more pictures!” \n\n\tWhat Carpenter is polite enough not to verbalize is that the backlash proved her point, because even when the men in her life and the critics in her comments create situations out of her control, she finds her way back to the driver’s seat. “The [original cover] really says it all, even though it’s maybe not what you want me to say,” she muses. “But I was really, really grateful that the fans did listen to the album. It’s been the most beautiful reception.” “Man’s Best Friend” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, with all 12 tracks reaching the Hot 100 singles chart as well. By November, the record was certified platinum. Carpenter is a master of flirting with controversy while never getting sidelined by it, and the success of “Man’s Best Friend” has been undeterred. \n\t\n\n\tHer big year continued. In September, she was announced as a Coachella 2026 headliner, and in October, she appeared as the only featured artist on “The Life of a Showgirl,” joining Swift on the album’s title track, which details the glamorous woes of fame. Carpenter opened for her role model-turned-peer on two legs of “The Eras Tour,” during which they sang together twice and felt a deep chemistry as performers. “Ten-year-old me, for so many reasons, could not believe it — to hear our voices together,” she says. “We definitely realized it was special, but I would have never been like, ‘Hey, bestie, put me on a song.’ She was so gracious to think of me for a song that spoke to our life experiences in such a real, genuine way. It really sums up what so many young women in this industry go through.” \n\n\tOn the day of our interview, Carpenter picked up another six Grammy nominations, including album of the year. A few weeks later, her “Short n’ Sweet Tour” finally came to a close. With six sold-out nights at Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena, Carpenter capped off more than a year of performances with irreverent flair, spotlighting Miss Piggy as a special guest at her last show. \n\n\tCarpenter hasn’t had much time away from the stage at all since the fall of 2022, when she began touring her first post-Disney album, “Emails I Can’t Send.” “I’m definitely getting the comment of ‘You’ve been on tour forever,’” she says, but she isn’t worried about overexposure. “I’m aware of that [risk], but music finds people when they need it. Just because it’s there doesn’t mean you have to listen!” \n\n\tBesides, those warning Carpenter about audience fatigue will get what they want soon enough. “I’m really grateful that people have been receptive of me being in their faces for a little bit too long,” she says, “and I’ll be sure to take a good nap after.”\n\n\n\tA Sabrina Carpenter song is often born from the kind of gab sesh those girls had in the bathroom on Halloween.\n\n\tAmong Carpenter’s closest friends is 2025 Grammy songwriter of the year Amy Allen. The two became creative partners as Carpenter finished “Emails I Can’t Send,” with Allen later getting credits up and down both “Short n’ Sweet” and “Man’s Best Friend.”\n\n\t“Every time we write together, the first hour or two we’re just excited to be hanging out,” Allen says. “We usually talk for an hour or two, just catching up on life and showing each other songs, like, ‘Have you heard this deep cut off of this random 1968 album I just heard?’” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreg Swales for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThen they dive into the lyric fragments floating around in their heads, pulled from earnest texts to friends or spontaneous utterances at a bar. Carpenter offers the new album’s “Go Go Juice” as an example, recalling a casual hang with Allen and “Man’s Best Friend” producers Jack Antonoff and John Ryan. “We were walking to dinner, and they were like, ‘Are we drinking tonight?’ I said, ‘I’m just drinking to call someone.’” Immediately, gears started to turn. “That’s a song. Let’s write that tomorrow,” Carpenter remembers one of them saying. A day and perhaps an ill-advised drunk dial later, the foursome had created a country-inflected “cousin to ‘Manchild,’” as she describes it.  \n\n\t“I also like the idea that ‘Man’s Best Friend’ is a how-to guide, maybe, for some man out there on how to treat a woman,” she says, laughing. For instance, on “Tears,” she promises her partner sexual favors in exchange for doing the dishes — leading her detractors to claim she’s giving herself away for the bare minimum from a man. “There’s so much sarcasm in the album. More than people have been able to pick up on, unfortunately,” she says. “Sometimes I’m like, ‘You do know, right?’ Maybe I’ve gotta make it more obvious.”\n\n\tWhile much of Carpenter’s lyricism is unabashedly horny, it’s also clever, and she’s far from being the only celebrity making jokes about sex. So the backlash initially came as a surprise.\n\n\t“I think it wouldn’t matter so much if I wasn’t a childhood figure for some people,” Carpenter says, now a dozen years past her breakout role on Disney Channel’s “Girl Meets World.” “But I also can’t really help that. It’s not my fault that I got a job when I was 12 and you won’t let me evolve.”\n\n\tShe also knows — from her own childhood, which wasn’t so long ago — that her young fans have the capacity to glean from her lyrics what makes sense for them and figure out the rest later. She remembers looking up to female artists who happened to sing about sex when she was younger, and doesn’t feel that they influenced her to grow up any faster than she should have. “I always thought, ‘When I grow up, then I get to embrace my sexuality more. I don’t even know what that means yet!’ I don’t think they do. I wish I’d had more open conversations about all of it when I was younger, but people feel too scared to talk about it.”\n\n\tShe’s also noticed that “people think, ‘Oh, she’ll say and do anything.’ No. I really do have boundaries with myself — you’d be surprised!” she says. “I’m just actually living my life, and you’re watching. If you don’t like it, it’s not for you. If you do like it, let’s play.” \n\t\n\n\tAnd play she does. “I want to remember this as a time in my life when I really didn’t hold back,” Carpenter says. “I wore the skirts I wanted to wear; I spoke about things in a way that I won’t regret, because I was very open. I think that’s all that matters.”\n\n\tOn the topic of wardrobe, Carpenter brings up how her petiteness has become central to her identity, and I mention being 5-foot-2 myself. “Are you?” she coos — so I clarify that a doctor technically put me at 5-foot-2½. “That’s important,” she says, nodding. “Every half-inch counts.”\n\n\tCarpenter’s cheeks go pink as she realizes what she said. We fold over into a fit of giggles, both knowing that I’ll be writing about her accidental dick joke — so she owns it. Later, I ask if she thinks her singing career will always take precedence over acting. \n\n\t“Music is always going to be my true No. 1, but there’s something really special about playing an incredible role,” she replies. “So I would say No. 1 is music and No. 1½ is acting.” Then she gives me a sly grin. “And we know how the half makes a difference.” \n\n\t\n\t\tLocation: The Manner; Styling: Jared Ellner/A-Frame Agency; Makeup: Carolina Gonzalez /A-Frame Agency; Hair: Evanie Frausto/Streeters; Manicure: Naomi Yasuda/Forward Artists/Apres; Production: Alexey Galetskiy Productions; Look 1 (Lace Dress): Dress: Jacquemus; Scarf: Palace Costume; Look 2 (Green Dress): Dress: Conner Ives; Hat: Palace Costume; Look 3 (Leopard Dress): Dress: Vintage Emanuel Ungaro/(that) bityou vintage; Shoes: Melissa x Vivenne Westwood\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tComposer Daniel Blumberg says if anyone was right to tell the story of Ann Lee, it was Mona Fastvold. The historical drama, “The Testament of Ann Lee,” opening Dec. 25, stars Amanda Seyfried as the 18th-century religious leader who founded the Shakers and brought her followers from England to America. Fastvold uses music and dance from the Shaker movement to tell the story, with Blumberg on board as the film’s composer.\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety, Blumberg says, “I really related to her as an artist and a person, in terms of reading it. I thought it’s great that she’s going to tell this story. She’s very fluent with dance and music as well.”\n\t\n\n\tFastvold discovered the story while working on her 2020 feature, “The World to Come.” She was looking for old hymns from the area “50-100 years before the film took place, and that took me down a rabbit hole.” She discovered the Shaker hymn “Pretty Mother’s Home” by Patsy Roberts Williamson and fell in love with it, but she never ended up using the song. As she looked into the history behind the song, she stumbled upon the Shaker community, which eventually led her to Ann Lee.\n\n\n\tFastvold was fascinated not only by the feminine aspect of Lee’s story but also by the rich artistic and musical history of the community. “There is a lot of music. There are 1,000 hymns,” Fastvold says. Over 12 Shaker hymns were used in the film, as well as Blumberg’s compositions. Fastvold says she and the composer worked together to map out as much as they could in advance. “In certain places, we knew that this was a moment where we wanted a song, but we didn’t find anything that was right. So then it felt right for Daniel to write it.”\n\t\n\n\tOne song Blumberg wrote was the film’s end song, “Clothed By the Sun,” with Seyfried singing lead vocals. Fastvold was in post-production, working on the sound mix, when she realized she wanted an end-credits song. She wanted a song dedicated to Ann Lee, “a gift of sorts,” Fastvold says. She also knew she wanted Seyfried to sing, not as Ann Lee, but as herself. She envisioned something “that was its own piece, very much sort of in dialogue with the film, and less from the perspective of the characters.”\n\n\tBlumberg went into the studio and decided to try writing something. “It literally just came out in one go. I had my electric guitar and started playing, and this song came out with all the words and everything.” He adds that the faster process makes the best songs for him. “If it comes out very quickly, it tends to be a good sign.”\n\n\tOn hearing the song, Fastvold says, “It felt like a very poetic conclusion of all of our work together.” She adds that hearing Seyfried sing was exciting. “It was such a year of singing and singing and finding that voice, and then all of a sudden, the way she was singing ‘Clothed By the Sun’ was completely different again. I saw this incredible journey of her voice and how it changed throughout that year.”\n\n\tWatch the music video for “Clothed By the Sun” below.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tRedBird IMI boss Jeff Zucker appears to be embracing the AI revolution.\n\n\t“We actually think AI is an opportunity,” he told the audience at TV confab Content London on Wednesday. “We don’t think that it will be able to capture the same drama that ‘Celebrity Traitors’ did, or the human emotion that’s in ‘Hamnet,’ for example, but we think it’ll bring down the production costs tremendously. So we think it’s an opportunity.”\n\t\n\n\t“It’s not going to meet sources in an underground garage and break stories for Front Office Sports or any journalistic outlet like that,” Zucker continued, “but it’s a great tool for news organizations as well. So I think AI wasn’t here two years ago, but it’s a great opportunity to utilize as well.”\n\n\n\tHollywood is still split on AI, with some companies and individuals willing to give it a chance while others, most notably creatives, horrified about its infiltration into the screen ecosystem. Earlier this week “Frankenstein” director Guillermo del Toro lambasted the new technology while accepting the Vanguard Tribute at the Gotham Awards. “I’d like to tell the rest of our extraordinary cast and our crew that the artistry of all of them shines on every single frame of this film that was willfully made by humans, for humans,” he told the audience. “The designers, builders, make-up, wardrobe team, cinematographers, composers, editors, this tribute belongs to all of them. I would like to extend our gratitude and say: Fuck AI.”\n\n\tDuring the Content London panel, Zucker, who was in conversation with media consultant Mary Ann Halford, was asked to predict what the future of the entertainment industry might look like in 5 years time, which he declined to do. “I’m not trying to duck your question, but I mean, I think that anybody that pretends to tell you today what the world is going to look like in 2030 is a fool,” he told Halford bluntly.\n\t\n\n\t“Because I think the world is going to change twice between now and then. At least, the reality is, I think we’re going to see as much change in the next five years as we’ve seen in the last 20,” he continued. “Obviously, look, AI is going to play a huge part in that. The creator economy is going to play a huge part in that. And don’t count out the traditional places that are still producing great content, right?”\n\n\t“I think the one thing that will be forever true is whether people watch it on their phone or their TV screen or their iPad or whatever people watch content on they’re going to want professionally produced content, and they’re going to want creator produced content. And I think all of that will be helped by AI and I think all of that will be helped by human beings. And I think to know exactly what is going to get us from here to 2030 I have no idea, but I do think people will still be consuming content.”\n\n\tThe media titan also touched on RedBird IMI’s move into live events and sports, citing its sports trade Front Office Sports and doc/events company EverWonder, which pivoted from purely making factual content to events.\n\n\t“I really think that live and sports are really important components of the next couple years, and this happens to combine both of those,” he said of EverWonder.\n\n\t“Everybody’s always focused on owning teams and things like that, right? Because it’s sexy and it’s exciting. Everybody wants to be a team owner and stuff like that. … But I actually think the real opportunity lies in adjacencies to teams,” Zucker added. “I think new leagues is certainly an area. But I think production for all of these things is an opportunity. I think sports-adjacent programming is an opportunity. And that’s what we’ve tried to move into. But I really do believe that over these next couple years, sports and live production — and if you combine the two, great — are real opportunities, things that can’t be disintermediated that easily. Live events that have to take place, sports games that have to be played, and I think that that’s what we’re trying to play in.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThough Sky is currently the exclusive home for HBO series like “Succession” and “Game of Thrones” in the U.K., all will change when streaming service HBO Max launches in the region next year. However, during a Content London panel on Wednesday, Sky executive director of scripted originals Meghan Lyvers assured that the company’s strategy will be “business as usual.”\n\n\t“What we have seen is that the majority of the titles on Sky that have performed and customers have responded to are Sky Originals. That is incredibly fortunate for us in terms of the shows that we’ve been asked from the business and the audiences to continue making,” Lyvers said. “So our mantra is business as usual, which is we’re going to continue our strategy, we’re going to keep making the shows and keep delivering what we have been for the last couple of years.”\n\t\n\n\tLyvers said that for Sky, it’s “about consistency in a very volatile, ever-changing market,” and added that her team is actually looking to grow and produce two tentpole series a year instead of one. “That’s a big lift in terms of those types of shows and the big scale of those series,” she continued. “So we’ve been making inroads in that and will be talking about that more in the early new year.”\n\n\n\tThrough an expanded agreement announced last year, HBO content will still be available to watch on Sky for free even after HBO Max’s U.K. and Ireland launch — which doesn’t yet have a date — though obviously it will no longer be its exclusive home. Lyvers is optimistic about the situation, saying that another platform launching in the market will be a positive thing.\n\t\n\n\t“I fundamentally believe that if we’re all putting out great content, it keeps the bar high in terms of the storytelling. Because, ultimately, that is what we’re all chasing, which is excellence and ambition and delivering to audiences here something that is unrivaled,” Lyvers said. “The U.K. has, for the last year or so, put out extraordinary content, so that I welcome. Again, HBO’s content will be available on Sky on the platform for free when the service does launch here in the spring. But we’re staying the course, and it’s paying off.”\n\n\tHBO and Sky are also continuing to work together from a co-production standpoint, with George McKay’s upcoming legal thriller “War” set up at both broadcasters and already renewed for two seasons. “They’ve been wonderful partners on that show and we just saw a cut this week,” Lyvers said. “So these are U.K. stories, and we’re not designing them to be for the world, but they are finding partners and homes.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTammie Rosen, a staple of the indie film world who most recently worked at the Sundance Institute as chief communications officer, has died after a battle with cancer. She was 49 years old. \n\n\t“Tammie was a remarkable leader whose integrity, compassion, and unwavering commitment to our organization will have a lasting impact,” Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute Board Chair, said in a statement. “Under her stewardship, Sundance Institute’s story was told with heart and authenticity because, quite simply, she embodied the joy and power of our mission.”\n\t\n\n\tRosen was tapped by Sundance in 2020, and her tenure overlapped with a period of challenges and changes at the festival, including the COVID pandemic, which forced the annual gathering to go virtual for the first time in its history. It also coincided with Sundance’s decision to exit its longtime home in Park City, Utah for Boulder, Colo. where the festival will relocate in 2027.\n\n\n\tRosen was known as an indefatigable advocate for the indie filmmakers that Sundance highlighted, and worked around the clock (she literally answered emails and texts at all hours) to promote their work and the festivals that served as important launching pads for their careers. She had a sharp wit, an exhaustive knowledge of the industry and a warm and outgoing spirit.\n\n\tPrior to joining Sundance, Rosen was Tribeca’s executive VP of communications and programming from 2007 to 2019. Her association with the festival began in 2004 when she was still working with Tribeca’s outside PR firm Rubenstein. In addition to Rubenstein, Rosen also worked at Kenneth Cole Productions.\n\t\n\n\t“Tammie’s passion, commitment, selflessness, hard work, love of our community, the arts, filmmakers, and the stories they tell was infectious,” Tribeca co-founders Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal said in a joint statement. “She helped build creative strategies that expanded Tribeca outside our backyard to Rome, Beijing, and Doha and into areas of innovation, music, and sports. We will forever be in awe of her tireless dedication, her impeccable ethics, her remarkable leadership, her humor, her love of Bruce Springsteen, her trademark red lipstick, and most of all her friendship. She was singularly just remarkable.”\n\n\tRosen is survived by her mother, Sheryle; sister Stefani; brother Brian; and an extensive network of family and friends.\n",

    "body": "\n\tInteractive slasher film “Slay Day” will debut in theaters next fall from Kino Industries’ CtrlMovie.\n\n\tPer CtrlMovie, “Slay Day” will ask audiences to “collectively vote on each critical decision using their smartphones, seamlessly altering the story as it plays.” “No two screenings will ever be the same. Some theaters may crown a new ‘Final Girl,’ others may leave with no survivors at all. With over twenty unique endings, Slay Day transforms the slasher formula into a ruthless social experience: can you survive a horror movie when you’re the one pulling the strings?”\n\t\n\n\tAfter its theatrical run, Kino Industries’ CtrlMovie will release “Slay Day” across “traditional and interactive platforms,” including major gaming services such as Steam, PlayStation and Xbox.\n\n\n\tThe directorial debut of John David Buxton, “Slay Day” is set on Friday the 13th, 1987, in the picture-perfect town of Belle Falls, the story follows six teens preparing for their biggest night of the year: the Sadie Hawkins dance. But when the town exhumes the body of the real Sadie Hawkins to unravel the truth behind her killing spree fifty years earlier, a malevolent force returns to the town.\n\n\tThe “Slay Day” cast includes Jayden Bartels (“Goosebumps,” “Side Hustle”), Shelby Simmons (“Bunk’d”), Emma McNulty (“FBI: Most Wanted”), Caleb Brown (“Mother’s Day”), Luke Mullen (“V/H/S/99”), Corrado Martini (“Circles”), and Lyndon Smith (“National Treasure: Edge of History”). Casting was led by Danielle Aufiero and Amber Horn of Aufiero/Horn.\n\n\t“Slay Day” is written by Andrew Matisziw (“Goliath,” “The Firm”) and produced by Mark Dragin (“Law & Order,” “Law & Order: SVU”), Michael Kagan (“Night Patrol,” “The Apology”) and Scott C. Silver (“The Pyramid,” “Wheelman,” “BornStars”). Eric Schneider, Angela Kay and Chaz Barsamian are executive producers.\n\t\n\n\tBasePoint Capital is financing the film under its recently set deal with Kino Industries’ CtrlMovie.\n\n\t“Horror has always been about participation — yelling at the screen, covering your eyes, daring the killer to come closer,” Buxton said. “’Slay Day’ turns that instinct into action. For the first time, the audience truly decides who lives, who dies, and who deserves to, in a democratic and instantaneous experience.”\n\n\t“We’ve spent years developing CtrlMovie to blur the line between story and player, but ‘Slay Day’ is the first time audiences will experience that power on a theatrical scale,” Silver said. “It’s not just a movie, it’s a new theatrical experience where every decision ripples through the story in real time. The technology lets people experience horror in the most personal way imaginable. because this time the deaths are the direct result of the audience’s choices. Every reckless dare. Every jealous glance. Every deadly mistake. You choose. They pay!”\n\n\t“Every choice the audience makes determines who survives the night — and who doesn’t.“Utah was the ideal place to make this film,” Kagan said. “The state offered a great crew, a strong infrastructure, and an incredible range of locations — from small-town streets to wide-open landscapes — all within easy reach. The support we received from the local film community made it an exceptional place to shoot.”\n\n\tBuxton is repped by attorney Jesse Nord at The Nord Group. Lead and production counsel Chaz Barsamian of Entertainment Law Partners represents the film.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBeatlemania is back at the BBC. \n\n\tThe broadcaster has acquired “Hamburg Days,” an upcoming six-part drama series about the Beatles‘ early career in the ’60s, from Turbine Studios for BBC One and iPlayer. “Hamburg Days” — developed by “Generation War” producer Benjamin Benedict with “Succession” alum Jamie Carragher as head writer — is based on the autobiography by artist and Beatles session musician Klaus Voormann, who also consulted on the series.\n\t\n\n\t“In the smoke-filled clubs of Hamburg’s St. Pauli’s red-light district, an inexperienced young rock ‘n’ roll band from Liverpool collide with two young artists, Klaus Voormann and Astrid Kirchherr,” the show’s synopsis reads. “Together, they help spark a transformation that turns a scrappy group of teenagers into the greatest music phenomenon the world has ever known: The Beatles.”\n\n\n\tCasting of the fab four in “Hamburg Days” has not yet been revealed. German director Christian Schwochow (“The Crown”) will serve as showrunner, while Mat Whitecross (“Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams,” “Oasis: Supersonic”) is set to direct. The music in “Hamburg Days” will be curated by BAFTA-winning musician and composer David Holmes. \n\n\t“’Hamburg Days’ is the fascinating story of how, in the space of two short years, a raw young band from Liverpool honed their music skills in Hamburg, before returning home to become an overnight worldwide success,” said Sue Deeks, head of scripted pre-buy acquisitions at the BBC. “It is an incredible story, accompanied (of course) by an amazing soundtrack!”\n\n\tThe news of “Hamburg Days” comes as Sony is in production on Sam Mendes’ four-film Beatles cinematic event, with each movie — focused on a different Beatles member — to release in 2028. Harris Dickinson is starring as John Lennon, Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison and Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr.\n\t\n\n\t“Hamburg Days” is produced by W&B Television (a Leonine Company) and Turbine Studios for ZDF, the BBC and AGC Television. Executive producers include Benedict, Quirin Berg and Max Wiedemann of W&B Television, Andrew Eaton and Justin Thomson of Turbine Studios and AGC’s Stuart Ford, Lourdes Diaz and Miguel A. Palos Jr. Isabel Haug of W&B Television serves as a creative producer. The project is overseen at ZDF by Frank Zervos, Caroline von Senden and Alexandra Staib and the series is supported by MOIN Film Fund Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein.\n\n\tAGC International will handle worldwide sales excluding the U.K. (BBC) and Germany (ZDF).\n",

Ana's remains have never been found.\n      \n    \n          Massachusetts State Police Trooper Nicholas Guarino testified Tuesday under direct questioning that Walshe's laptop had viewed a pornographic video about a “cheating wife.\"\n      \n    \n          But, on cross examination, Walshe's defense attorney, Larry Tipton, got Guarino to admit that Walshe’s computer searches failed to show the user was specifically looking for smut films about a cheating wife.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Tipton indicated the laptop's user downloaded a video from Pornhub's vast library of erotic content and even suggested the user was searching for a specific porn star. Throughout his examination, Tipton was careful not to identify Walshe as the actual user of the laptop, instead referring to the person as a “device user.”\n      \n    \n          Guarino also testified that Walshe made numerous Internet searches about cleaning up and disposing of bodies, as well as searching for 1970's serial killer Patrick Kearney, better known as the \"Trash Bag Killer.\" After killing and dismembering his victims, Kearney would discard them in trash bags.\n      \n    \n          Day 3 of the trial continues tomorrow.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Brian Walshe\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

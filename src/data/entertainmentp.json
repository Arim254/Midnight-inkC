    "body": "\n\tNicki Minaj went after California Governor Gavin Newsom in a series of X posts on Friday, targeting a quote from the presidential hopeful in which he supports trans youth.\n\n\tDuring a recent appearance on The Ezra Klein Show, Newsom said, “I want to see trans kids… There’s no governor that’s done more pro-trans legislation than I have. No one has been a stronger advocate for the LGBT community.” The quote has recently circulated online, with some using it to disparage Newsom’s image as a potential presidential candidate.\n\t\n\n\tMinaj wrote on X Friday, “Imagine being the guy running on wanting to see trans kids. Haha. Not even a trans ADULT would run on that. Normal adults wake up & think they want to see HEALTHY, SAFE, HAPPY kids. Not Gav. The Gav Nots. GavOUT. Send in the next guy, I’m bored.”\n\n\n\tShe added minutes later, “Gavin is the cute boy who got everything handed to him b/c of how cute & sexy & hot & smoking he was. Oohhh look @‘m. Sitting there in that suit with the sneakers on. He thinks he’s Tom Cruise only difference is, his next mission IS impossible. He should get another leading role.” The 12-time Grammy nominee has nonstop berated Newsom on X throughout Friday and Saturday, usually accompanying her posts with a picture of the Chucky doll from “Child’s Play.”\n\n\tWhile not outright confirmed, many consider Newsom the frontrunner to become the Democratic presidential nominee come 2028. He recently told CBS Sunday Morning that he has “no idea” if he will run for president or not.\n\n\t“The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary,” he said. “Who the hell knows? I’m looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. That’s the question for the American people.”\n\t\n\n\tMinaj clearly doesn’t like his chances. In yet another post on X early Friday, she wrote, “Get on the nearest jet ski & let that beautiful hair blow in the wind. It will make you happier than this race that you will not win. Enjoy life. Peace.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Heated Rivarly” stars Hudson Williams and François Arnaud have responded to “I Love LA” star Jordan Firstman, who said the show’s depiction of gay sex is “not how gay people fuck.”\n\n\tOn an Instagram post reporting Firstman’s criticism, Arnaud commented, “Is there only one way to have ‘authentic’ gay sex on tv? Should the sex that closeted hockey players have look like the sex that sceney LA gay guys have?”\n\n\n\tWilliams reshared the comment to his Instagram Story and wrote, “But truly go watch ‘I Love LA’! Jordan and the cast are great!”\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked to compare the gay sex scenes in “Heated Rivalry” and “I Love LA,” Firstman told Vulture, “Yeah, we’re going for it. It’s gay. I’m sorry, I watched those first two episodes of ‘Heated Rivalry’ and it’s just not gay. It’s not how gay people fuck. There’s so few things that actually show gay sex.”\n\n\tFirstman went on to say that audiences don’t want to see authentic depictions of queer love in Hollywood. He added, “But they want to see ‘Heated Rivalry.’ I go to art to be confronted and to think, but a lot of people just want entertainment or to see two straight hockey players pretending to be gay and fucking.”\n\n\tOn Saturday morning, Firstman walked back his comments, writing on his Instagram Story, “I love ‘Heated Rivalry’ and ultimately I’m a f-ggot who can’t shut the fuck up but I’m gunna get better at that.”\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” was renewed for a second season on Friday. HBO will license Season 2 without producing, as it did with Season 1. Based on Rachel Reid’s “Game Changers” book series, the show follows two up-and-coming hockey stars who engage in a secret romance while maintaining a facade as bitter rivals on the ice.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFans can expect to spot a familiar face in the final “Fast & Furious” movie, “Fast X: Part 2”: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n\tVin Diesel, who leads the film franchise as Dominic “Dom” Toretto, seemingly confirmed the soccer star’s cameo when he shared a snap of the two on his Instagram account. In the caption, he wrote, “Everyone asked, would he be in the Fast mythology… I gotta tell you he is a real one. We wrote a role for him…”\n\t\n\n\tWhile little is known about Ronaldo’s potential part in the film (Ronaldo himself has yet to confirm), fans can expect to see “Fast X: Part 2” in theaters in April 2027. In addition to Diesel, the eleventh and supposed final film in the action-packed franchise will feature returning stars Dwayne Johnson (Luke Hobbs), Jason Statham (Deckard Shaw), Jason Momoa (Dante Reyes), Jordana Brewster (Mia Torretto), Michelle Rodriguez (Letty Ortiz) and more. In June, Diesel confirmed at FuelFest that the character of Brian O’Connor, played originally by Paul Walker, would also return in the film. \n\n\n\t“Fast X: Part 2” will be directed by Louis Leterrier, who previously directed the tenth installment in the franchise, “Fast X.” Christina Hodson and Oren Uziel will pen the script. \n\n\tNews of a potential Ronaldo cameo comes months after The Wall Street Journal first reported that Universal Pictures imposed a much tighter budget on the film following “Fast X,” which took $340 million to make. The tenth film would go on to gross over $700 million worldwide, though it still became one of the franchise’s least profitable chapters. Comparatively, 2021’s “F9” made more than $725 million worldwide on an approximate budget of $200 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrankie Muniz is getting candid about returning to the small screen for the four-episode “Malcolm in the Middle” reboot “Life’s Still Unfair,” describing the experience as the first in his entire life that he was “happy to call myself an actor.” \n\n\t“I’ve always been like, ‘Oh yeah, I act but I also do these other things too,’” the “Agent Cody Banks” star said in an interview with People. “It was just really fun and a really cool experience, so I’m hoping that everyone loves it for sure.” \n\t\n\n\tMuniz starred in the original 2000 sitcom as the titular boy-genius Malcolm Wilkerson alongside Bryan Cranston (Hal Wilkerson) and Jane Kaczmarek (Lois Wilkerson). The show ran for 151 episodes across seven seasons until 2006.\n\n\n\tWhile Muniz reflected fondly on the experience, he admitted he was unsure of what the dynamic would be on set 20 years later. \n\n\t“I was a kid,” Muniz said. “I was like 13 to 20 when I was on the show and I just kind of showed up and was excited to be there and said the words that were on the paper and it worked. As an adult, you tend to overthink things … and you put more pressure on yourself as well. So I didn’t know what it was gonna be like — if it was going to be easy to be Malcolm, if it was gonna be awkward back with the cast.”  \n\n\tQuickly, though, Muniz’s fears were dissuaded. “Not to sound like cliché, but it was as if not a single day went by,” he continued. “All of us — every single person — like instantly fell back into their characters with, I’m talking the first table read.” \n\t\n\n\tThe “Big Fat Liar” star added that filming for the upcoming reboot was “probably one of the best times I’ve ever had on a set,” largely because of the alleviated pressure that came with working on a project he knew fans would appreciate. \n\n\t“Twenty years ago, you film the first season, no one’s ever seen it, you don’t know if they’re gonna like it, you don’t know how people are gonna react to it,” Muniz said. “And then to have your seven years of success with it and now 20 years later, I can go anywhere in the world and people know Malcolm, right? They know the show, they love the show. They tell me how much it affected their lives and how much it meant to their families, how it brought them closer together.”\n\n\tAudiences can expect to stream “Malcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair” on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ in 2026.

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Little Disasters,” now streaming on Paramount+.\n\n\tOver the past year, a cinematic trend has emerge",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Little Disasters,” now streaming on Paramount+.\n\n\tOver the past year, a cinematic trend has emerged that powerfully underscores the intense difficulties of motherhood. From “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” and “Sinners” to “One Battle After Another” and “Song Sung Blue,” the challenges of being a joy-filled parent can rapidly intensify to an unbearable — and even a maddening — need to be a “perfect” mother. That plight is now being tackled on television in the limited series “Little Disasters” starring Diane Kruger. The six-episode series on Paramount+ illustrates the profound lengths a woman will go to protect her child while simultaneously enduring a significant emotional toll on herself, her marriage and her other children. Kruger has a theory as to why this trend in subject matter is happening — and why now.\n\t\n\n\t“I’d like to believe it’s because more women are in decision-making positions and are greenlighting and validating different concerns or female storylines,” Kruger says. “I certainly think it’s a good thing, and it’s time that we take a look at that as well.”\n\n\n\tThe series follows the complex lives of four new mothers who become fast, longtime friends while all attending a birthing class. Based on Sarah Vaughan’s gripping 2020 novel, the series shows the raw realities of postnatal anxiety, parenting struggles, marriage dynamics and maternal OCD, while also stepping into the culture wars with the lead character’s skepticism about publicly funded healthcare and vaccinations. These illustrated challenges to mothers are authentic and deeply real: an exhausting, backbreaking relentless exercise of patience, selflessness and unconditional love.\n\t\n\n\tIn “Little Disasters,” a fragile bond shatters when one friend, Jess (Kruger), brings her baby daughter to an emergency room in the middle of the night when her persistent crying has her and her husband concerned their infant is sick. But there, Liz (Jo Joyner), an A&E doctor and close friend of 10-plus years, spots a head injury on the child. Liz faces an excruciating dilemma: report her longtime friend to social services or risk the child’s safety. She chooses the former. This single moment ignites a devastating chain of events, revealing how quickly a life-altering decision can fracture and destroy entire families and friendships.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFrom the get-go, Kruger’s Jess is an emotional wreck. Her explanation of the injury to the doctors and social services is not only sketchy, it’s unlikely, making her look like an unstable mother — and worse, a possibly abusive one. Her anxiety snowballs as the story rolls out over the weeks that follow.\n\n\tKruger says the role was exhausting, not only because of the subject matter but also because they didn’t shoot in episode order, “So we could go in a day from doing a scene where I think my child died, to 20 minutes later doing a lovely picnic.”\n\n\tAnd it was also taking a personal toll on her, Kruger says: “The emotional extremes that were required almost broke me. Honestly, I said to my partner, ‘I feel like I’m having a burnout, like I’m overstimulated and overspent.’ But you know, on the other hand, I really felt the character was exploring very truthfully those very deep emotions. And especially when you are a mother, I think they rang really true. I was just able to lean into that. It didn’t require much for me to go there.”\n\n\tThankfully, she was able to shake those feelings when she returned to her real life as mom to a daughter with actor Norman Reedus. “Coming home, I have to say, I felt like it was easy — my home and my daughter was with me. We were filming over the summer, and so coming home to her happy little face every night felt like stepping into heaven.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJess’ struggle with the confusion of what really happened to her baby and the fear of the woman she had become overwhelms her. The writers kick it up a notch by allowing viewers into Jess’ head to hear her inner dialogue, and where her imagination takes her.\n\t\n\n\t“I understand women who struggle with postpartum to that extent — or intrusive thoughts — it doesn’t get better without help. In fact, it just reinforces everything you’re worried about to begin with,” Kruger says. “It was such an opportunity to look into that. I don’t pretend to be an expert on that, obviously, but from my circle of girlfriends that have struggled with mental health issues after giving birth, it was so incomprehensive for me at that time to watch them go through what I didn’t know they were going through. They were people I’ve known all my life, all of a sudden were isolating themselves from me. It almost felt like they were gone. Like the person that I thought I knew so well was gone. And I couldn’t understand what was happening.”\n\n\tMost of them eventually came out of that, and were able to somewhat explain what they were going through. But witnessing that extreme was quite scary — and one of the reasons why Kruger signed on to do “Little Disasters.” “I guess I wanted to explore that,” she says. “And Sarah Vaughn, the writer, she experienced this. I mean, not to this extent, but she struggled with very severe, intrusive thoughts, and she was great help of guiding me through this.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJess’ story isn’t cut and dry. There’s a mystery that unfolds, and takes unexpected turns as the series progresses. Her marriage begins to show strain, her two young sons start to exhibit disturbing behavior and although her friends try to be supportive, their concern for her mental state grows. Kruger says the show is just as much about the strengths, weaknesses and evolution of those relationships. And, above all, it explores the difference between how one sees themselves versus how the world around them does. And the moral of the story?\n\n\n\t“I think what unites us is that all mothers or all parents have that thing in common, which in a way is also the theme of the show,” Kruger says. “Because you see those friends coming from different walks of life, and what connects them is the fact that they all had a baby around the same time and they’re raising kids in very different points of views. \n\n\t“But it’s hard. We really shouldn’t judge someone, because we don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors and what they’re going through.”\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains details about Episode 4 of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tWhen Connor Storrie was filming his self",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains details about Episode 4 of “Heated Rivalry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tWhen Connor Storrie was filming his self-tape for “Heated Rivalry,” he decided he had to show off his body.\n\n\t“I was like, ‘If we’re doing a show that heavily involves sex,’” he tells me via Zoom video from his Los Angeles-area home. “So I took off my shirt, even though it didn’t say that. I had my shirt off the entire time because I was like, ‘If we’re doing that, you all have to see what these people look like naked.’”\n\t\n\n\tIt worked.\n\n\tStorrie landed the part of Ilya Rozanov, a Russian hockey star having a hot and steamy years-long off-rink affair with his Canadian counterpart, Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams). When the first two episodes dropped over Thanksgiving weekend on HBO Max — the streamer acquired the series from Canadian streamer Crave — the show became an instant hit with word of the soapy queer drama exploding on social media. Memes and GIFS zeroed in on the romance, the sports and, more often than not, the sex. “I didn’t even know that my butt was a topic of conversation until I had so many random people sending me screenshots of my ass on Twitter,” the 25-year-old actor says.\n\n\tStorrie, who grew up in Odessa, Texas, was just another actor living paycheck to paycheck when he booked “Heated Rivalry.” In fact, he was on the verge of losing his waitering job at Laurel Grill in Los Angeles’ Culver City neighborhood when the offer to play Ilya came in. “I did a fucking bad job. I dropped the ball, so I got another bad review,” Storrie recalls. “My boss sat me down, being like, ‘This is not acceptable. This is a final warning. If anything like this ever happens again, you’re out.’”\n\t\n\n\tMinutes later, with the written warning in his hand, Storrie looked at his phone. His agent had called to tell him that he got “Heated Rivalry.” “I worked a few more shifts and then was like, ‘See you!’” Storrie says.\n\n\tCan you wrap your mind around what’s happening?\n\n\tIt doesn’t feel real. Also, I’m coming off my directorial debut. I just wrapped production on my first feature that I directed. I did that for two months, right before going into press for this, so I’m like, “I feel so out of the loop.” I literally wasn’t online for two months.\n\n\tTell me about this feature.\n\n\tIt’s an iPhone feature. We did it super, super-duper indie, very reminiscent of my favorite filmmaker’s first films, like a Darren Aronofsky or an old school John Waters thing, where it’s pretty much just me, 10 close actors that I know just running around being crazy. Shot on the new iPhone, so it is in 4K. iPhones have come a long way.\n\n\tWhat’s it about?\n\n\tIt’s super bleak, but funny and brutal. It’s about this alien spirit that incarnates into a human body, wakes up as a full-blown adult and just gets fucked over for an hour and a half [by] the brutality of life, violence, being robbed, being stolen, being abused, being all of it, and then finding companionship through that.\n\n\tAre you the alien?\n\n\tI am not. Well, actually, I play the alien before he incarnates into a human body, but you can’t even tell it’s me.\n\n\tWas “Heated Rivalry” shot chronologically? Was your first sex scene when Ilya and Shane first hooked up?\n\n\tThe first sex scene that we did was in Episode 2, the Vegas hotel room. I dragged the chair, I watch him, he puts on a show for me, and then it gets more aggressive.\n\n\tYou worked a lot with an intimacy coordinator, but what was going through your mind before shooting that first scene?\n\n\tI was less exposed than Hudson was, right? I’m fully clothed. I’m bossing him around. He takes his underwear off. What was I thinking? Let me actually think about that. I just remember, for 90% of that scene, the camera is on my face. I, as a person, move a lot, and so it takes me some energy sometimes to chill out and not move. In my mind, I’m like, “Don’t move, feed into the sexy tension of it all.” Then once we get to the actual sex, to be honest with you, I know it’s not very glamorous, but a lot of those sexual scenes, it’s about making sure that you move in a way that we don’t see our cock socks. It’s literally like, “My hand is going to be here. Your leg is going to be here. I’m going to hide myself with this.” And then it’s a constant game of like, “Oh, right. Yep, that’s great.” “No, no. OK, now, we see it.” “Oh, yep, no, no, that’s great. OK, keep going.” It’s a lot of that.\n\t\n\n\tIn Episode 4, we see Ilya actually has feelings for Shane. He’s getting jealous of Shane’s girlfriend.\n\n\tOh, just you wait. Episodes 5 and 6, baby! It’s really good.\n\n\tDid you have to drink a lot of water before Ilya had to spit into Shane’s hand in Episode 4?\n\n\tEveryone was drinking City Seltzers. I don’t know if they sponsored our show, but we were all addicted to those things. So, when I say we were hydrated, we were hydrated on that set. I forgot that I spit in his hand until I saw it two days ago, and I was like, “Damn, we went there, huh?” We need to bring that back for Season 2. Bring the spit back.\n\n\tEarlier today, it was announced that “Heated Rivalry” is getting a second season. The show is based on Rachel Reid’s book series, but things can change in adaptations. Do you have any idea where they’re going to go in Season 2?\n\n\tI have no idea. With how true we stayed to the book for this one, I can assume it’s going to be equally as true. Rachel Reid is now a New York Times bestselling author. Those books are literally sold out everywhere. They’re number one on some of the book charts, which is crazy. I think that proves that these are obviously really well-constructed stories that a lot of people are really into. The only way to make this make sense is to stick to the books and also honor the fandom of the people who are really spearheading this whole thing.\n\n\tWhat did you tell friends and family about the show back in Odessa?\n\n\tMy mom has watched it. I was like, “There’s a lot of sex. We got picked up by HBO.” You know how sexy something is if it’s on HBO. She was like, “Oh, OK. How do you feel about that?” And I was like, “I feel good. How do you feel about that?” She’s like, “If you feel good, I feel good.” Obviously, she can’t watch the sex scenes. She was like, “I can’t watch the sex scenes yet,” and I was like, “You don’t ever have to watch the sex scenes, mom. I don’t need you to watch that.” Hudson’s mom, too. We were at the premiere, and I was like, “So, what did you think seeing it on the big screen?” And she was like, “Oh, I had to cover my eyes for most of it,” and I’m like, “Yeah, that makes sense.” That must be weird, huh?\n\n\tYou tell me.\n\n\tThe sex, specifically it doesn’t feel very spicy to me because I was there in-person doing it. I have to watch the episodes two times in order to really get into the story, because my brain the entire time is like, “Wait, I remember the day that we shot that. Right before this, we did that. Wait, what episode is that? Oh, that’s next episode. Oh.” I’m just remembering the plot more so than anything. I’m not a good judge of this show.\n\t\n\n\tIs all this attention overwhelming? Do you even know how to navigate all of this?\n\n\tMy MO is to just stay focused on my creativity…It’s so easy nowadays to get lost in the internet sauce. I obviously want to and need to engage and be a part of the cultural zeitgeist and take what people are saying, review everything, but I can’t get lost in the comments, the tweets. I didn’t even know that my butt was a topic of conversation until I had so many random people send screenshots of my ass on Twitter. I’m like, “Oh, wow, I didn’t realize it got that specific.” I knew that the sex would be a moment of intrigue for people, but I’m like, “Damn, I didn’t realize it was going to be GIFs, and screenshots, and wallpapers, and stickers, and 30,000 tweets.”\n\n\tWhat’s the pressure now to keep in shape?\n\n\tI know, right? Luckily, I have put in a lot of work over the years. I also love working out. Working out is just time. We hear about these celebrity transformations where it’s like, “This guy gained 20 pounds of hard muscle in six weeks for this thing.” Real fitness is four or five times a week, getting to the gym every single week for years, and slowly building up a solid body position. So, luckily, now, I can coast. I’ve only worked out twice in the past two months, and my physique is OK.\n\n\tHow many pushups do you do before each shirtless scene?\n\n\tI don’t do pushups. I do curls because my chest is — here we go, I sound so narcissistic — is naturally rounded, so I don’t have to try that hard. I’m more so arm-focused because my arms are my weak point. So I’ll take a chair and just do [bicep curls] 40 times, or shoulders. Shoulders are big. Shoulders are a big deal.\n\n\tHow much adlibbing and improv are going on during the sex scenes, or is it very by the book?\n\n\tEverything is scripted. Yeah, there are some oohs and ohs that we put in there. The things that aren’t fully scripted are some of our touches, some of our body kisses and stuff, and that just came down to establishing a bunch of boundaries beforehand. There are levels to everything, right? Where are you allowed to be touched? What type of kisses are you allowed to do? And what do you wear to give you proper protection in any moment, depending on the act? There’s a closed-mouth kiss. There’s an open-mouth kiss. There’s an open-mouth kiss with tongue. There’s a hardcore open-mouth, prolonged kiss with tongue. You can wear pants. You can wear shorts. You can wear a G-string. You can wear layers. You can wear bike shorts that have padding. You can wear neoprene. There are levels to it. Hudson and I, separately, we’re just like, “I’m not weird about that. I’m not squeamish.” I trust him. I also feel confident enough in the production to voice anything if I ever feel uncomfortable, so I’m like, “So, let’s go all the way. I’ll wear the least amount of clothes. I’ll do the most amount of kisses.” It literally just made me and Hudson be like, “Is it cool if I touch you here?” And I’m like, “Yeah, touch me anywhere. I don’t care.” So all those little intricate kisses, touches in between moments, a lot of that is just us organically feeling into that moment.\n\t\n\n\tYou guys have really become best friends.\n\n\tHe was just here for a week and stayed at my place. It’s really enlightening about the culture of how men and man-on-man affection is received because you don’t see that a lot. It’s taboo for men to be friends and grab each other a certain way or hold hands. And me and Hudson being in such a sexual circumstance with one another, it’s really interesting to watch people sexualize our very amicable signs of affection. That just shows where the culture is still at in a way like, “Oh, these two men…” Just because we’re really comfortable with each other and we love each other, we’ve been through the craziest experience together, we’re on this crazy rollercoaster together, if I have my hand on his leg as we’re sitting down doing a press thing because he’s my best buddy and I love him, and we have that level of comfort. It’s just interesting that that instantly gets turned into, “They’re more than friends.”\n\n\tI did not see anything like this on TV when I was growing up. I know there’s the sex and obviously, the show isn’t for all ages, but I think about that young man or woman out there who is coming to terms with their sexuality, battling with their sexuality. To see the two of you, whether it’s on-screen or off-screen, I’m just going to say it, that kind of stuff saves lives. It really does. Do you feel that? Have you been feeling that from young people?\n\n\tIt’s so easy to have these conversations about, “It is important for gay people to see this.” That’s such a big concept that we can logically be like, “Yeah, that’s important for this, this, this, and this reason.” But when you get really cellular like that, and I look someone in the eyes and someone says that, or there were meet and greets when we were in Toronto, where a lot of people are just excited about the show because they love these characters and stuff, but then every 1 out of 100 people would come up and were shaking with, “This is important to me. I see myself in this person” — it’s making me emotional [Storrie tears up] – “and being able to read this or see this makes my existence a little less painful.” It’s cool because I’ve gotten that opinion from multiple people, not just gay men, but transgender men, bisexual women. There are so many different people that identify with that sense of otherness. It’s really inspiring. I didn’t really get the magnitude of what that meant until looking someone face-to-face and them being like, “This is important to me. Thank you for bringing something to light.”\n\t\n\n\tI can’t wait for next Halloween in West Hollywood.\n\n\tOh God, I didn’t even think of that.\n\n\tNo one’s mentioned that to you?\n\n\tBro, people are going to dress up as us?\n\n\tIt’s going to be sexy hockey players everywhere.\n\n\tThat’s crazy. I never thought of that. One of my close friends, Sean, said, “That’s how you know something is of cultural significance is if people Halloween-ized.” This year’s “Weapons” was everywhere with Aunt Gladys. People are going to put my fucking mole on their face? Whoa, you just blew my mind. I did not think about that.\n\n\tHudson recently put it out there that he would love to play Nightwing in the DC universe. Which superhero are you going after?\n\n\tI want to be a supervillain, a new supervillain. I was already a part of the Joker. [Storrie played the unnamed asylum patient who fatally stabs Arthur Fleck in Joker: Folie à Deux]. I want to be bald. Remember that Christian Bale character [Gorr the God Butcher] in that “Thor” movie where he was completely painted gray, and he had black teeth, and he was bald? Give me something weird like that.\n\n\tYou want the weird stuff?\n\n\tAs an actor, playing dress-up is my favorite thing in the entire planet, and that’s what this is to me. This is just an exaggerated, prolonged playing dress-up. Putting on the accent, getting the haircut, wearing the necklace, having the hockey gear, it’s all play pretend and dress-up. So yeah, I want to play the devil or something.\n\n\tThis Q&A was edited for length and clarity.\n\n",

It's all on video -- everyone was strutting down the stage as Gaga sang \"Garden of Eden.\" You can see the dancer, named Michael Dameski, glide right off the end of the stage, made slippery due to heavy rainfall.\n      \n    \n          Gaga immediately stopped the production to tend to Michael and then led an applause as she confirmed he was A-okay. Those at the venue said on social media she stalled the concert long enough so crew members could find him some shoes with better grip.\n      \n    \n          The concert was part of the \"Poker Face\" hitmaker's \"Mayhem Ball\" tour and was being held in Sydney's Accor Stadium. It served as the tour's last show of 2025.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          All turned out well for Michael, who hopped on his IG story after the show to thank fans for their concern.\n      \n    \n          Michael is expected to be back on stage with Gaga and her concert crew at the end of January, when they bring the \"Mayhem Ball\" to Tokyo.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Lady Gaga\n              \n                          \n                Nurse!\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Concerts and Tours\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Smoove -- real name Jaelin Deanta Parker -- was pulled over in Miami late Wednesday night while driving a heavily tinted yellow Lamborghini, police say in online records. When the officer from the Miami Police Department approached the posh car, they \"observed a cloud of smoke ... and a strong odor of marijuana.\" The officer also noted a black handgun under the driver's seat, and at that point, all occupants were asked to exit the vehicle for the officer's safety.\n      \n    \n          Police say the musician and 2 passengers were swiftly arrested because they were not legally allowed to posess any firearms, and the gun was readily available for each one to grab.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The vehicle was then searched, which is when police say they found the black Taurus PT809 gun with 16 live 9mm rounds in the magazine as well as one live round in the chamber ... plus a yellow pill bottle in a hidden compartment containing suspected oxycodone, xanax and tizanidine hydrochloride -- a prescription muscle relaxant. Police also say they discovered a yellow backpack with $30,000 cash, 81.9 grams of suspected marijuana, 12 canisters of suspected THC wax and a bottle of promethazine -- a prescription antihistamine. Smoove told authorities he didn't know who the gun belonged to but confirmed the yellow bag was his, they claim.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          Smoove was charged with 7 felony counts in total -- 4 for being in possession of a controlled substance with an intent to sell or deliver while armed, 1 for being in possession of marijuana with an intent to sell or deliver while armed, 1 for intending to manufacture or sell prescription drugs and 1 for carrying a concealed firearm.\n      \n    \n          The \"Losing My Mind\" hitmaker was released from custody Friday after fulfilling a $1,000 surety bond.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Smoove for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Hip Hop\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tWhat did CBS News management get staffers for Christmas? A memo doubling down on a controversial decision that has roiled the Paramount Skydance news unit and drawn torrents of criticism.\n\n\tIn a note to staff sent hours before the start of Christmas Eve, CBS News Editor in Chief Bari Weiss, President Tom Cibrowski and new senior editors Charles Forelle and Adam Rubenstein insisted a move to delay a “60 Minutes” report by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi was enacted  “to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.” The signatures on the memo mark what is believed to be the first tacit appearance of a new CBS News editorial “masthead” that Weiss expects to get more entrenched in the newsgathering process at the company, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\t\n\n\t“Right now, the majority of Americans say they do not trust the press. It isn’t because they’re crazy,” the memo read. “To win back their trust, we have to work hard. Sometimes that means doing more legwork. Sometimes it means telling unexpected stories. Sometimes it means training our attention on topics that have been overlooked or misconstrued. And sometimes it means holding a piece about an important subject to make sure it is comprehensive and fair.”\n\n\n\t CBS News revealed over the weekend that a “60 Minutes” segment reported by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi and centered on the on-screen accounts of Venezuelan men deported by the U.S. to prison in El Salvador had been shelved just hours before Sunday’s broadcast. As disclosed by an email sent to colleagues by Alfonsi, the decision was made by Weiss, who insisted that Trump officials appear in the report to comment on camera, even though Alfonsi’s team had made good faith efforts to secure response ahead of filing the report for legal review. “The public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship,” Alfonsi said in her memo.\n\t\n\n\tWeiss has, since her arrival in October, insisted without presenting evidence that mainstream media has lost Americans’ trust.  And yet, a September study from Pew Research Center showed that CBS News enjoyed the backing of 51% of U.S. adults who have at least some trust in the information they get from national news organizations. CBS was ranked on par with CNN and PBS, and just a few percentage points behind ABC News and NBC News.Such decision making ” may seem radical,” the new memo said. “Such editorial decisions can cause a firestorm, particularly on a slow news week. And the standards for fairness we are holding ourselves to, particularly on contentious subjects, will surely feel controversial to those used to doing things one way. But to fulfill our mission, it’s necessary.”\n\n\tThe “60 Minutes” imbroglio grips CBS News and its parent at an extremely inopportune moment. The news unit is just days away from trying to launch Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of “CBS Evening News,” and looks to be doing so without the weeks of pre-launch promotion such a move would normally warrant. Instead, Dokoupil will go on a barnstorming tour of the U.S. and visit many cities and towns during his first days on the air. What’s more, Paramount is engaged in a heated battle with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, and a continuing series of gaffes under Weiss’ management casts a cloud over Paramount CEO David Ellison’s ability to manage the coropration.\n\n\tMany staffers are aghast over Weiss decision, noting that it came at the end of a long vetting process and after CBS News had already promoted the “60 Minutes” segment to the public. Indeed, many people have been able to watch the report on their own because a Canadian media outlet which airs “60 Minutes” made Alfonsi’s report available via digital means. Should a new version of the story surface on the newsmagazine, viewers will be able to see how it was changed under Weiss’ supervision. According to people familiar with the report, Alfonsi had already made efforts to seek comment from Trump officials, and had included a video snippet from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that offered the administration’s take on the topic.\n\n\tWeiss,  a digital provocateur whose opinion site, The Free Press, was acquired by Paramount Skydance earlier this year, has cascaded through a series of unforced errors since her arrival at CBS News. The gaffes scrutiny high on a news operation that backs top series such as “60 Minutes” and “Sunday Morning,” but operates weekday evening and morning news programs that have long run behind rivals at NBC and ABC.\n\n\t Since her arrival, Weiss has brought pushback from the union representing CBS News staffers after asking them to lay out their job duties; nabbed conservative newsmakers and Trump administration officials for various segments for broadcast and online programming; tried to hire big-name anchors by enticing them to leave their current contracts at rival operations; and launched a new series of town halls and debates by moderating a session with conservative activist Erika Kirk that lacked support from mainstream advertisers. Bank of America has signed on as a sponsor for future editions of the series, now dubbed “Things That Matter.”\n\t\n\n\tThe new memo continued to promote Weiss’ stance that news consumers have less trust in mainstream media outlets, a theorem that the executive has put forth several times in public without evidence.  And yet, a September study from Pew Research Center showed that CBS News enjoyed the backing of 51% of U.S. adults who have at least some trust in the information they get from national news organizations. CBS was ranked on par with CNN and PBS, and just a few percentage points behind ABC News and NBC News.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following piece contains plot details from “La Chica o El Mundo,” the Season 1 finale of “Pluribus,” now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following piece contains plot details from “La Chica o El Mundo,” the Season 1 finale of “Pluribus,” now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tI have a confession to make: I love Carol Sturka.\n\n\tIn that way, I’m a lot like the hive mind that’s absorbed most of humanity in “Pluribus,” the Apple TV drama of which Carol is the star. I love Carol’s abrasiveness. I love how she responds to the end of the world not with high-minded heroism, but a self-centered defiance rooted in grief — a solipsism encouraged by how the hive mind caters to her every request. I love how Carol is tough enough to spend over a month on her own when the hive mind abandons Albuquerque rather than endure Carol’s efforts to undo their joining, but human enough to relent and give acquiescence a try in the season finale. (Humanity and its attendant flaws are in scarce supply in “Pluribus.”) I believe Carol is a truly great TV character, brought to life by a truly great TV actor in Rhea Seehorn. \n\t\n\n\tNot everyone seems to agree. “Pluribus” is the third series from Vince Gilligan, the showrunner who earned himself a permanent place in his chosen medium’s Mount Rushmore with the back-to-back triumphs of “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul.” Both those series focused on ascendant figures in New Mexico’s narcotics trade, an exciting hook that belied Gilligan’s evident fascination with the detailed gruntwork between violent confrontations. I always think of Jonathan Banks’s Mike Ehrmantraut silently disassembling his car, part by individual part, in search of a tracker over several minutes of screentime in an early season of “Saul.”\n\t\n\n\tApple’s largesse allows “Pluribus” to expand Gilligan’s purview to Las Vegas, South America and other far-flung locales, but also practice his preferred MO with a heightened focus. “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” — particularly the latter — could be rigorous, but they also distributed that rigor across a wide-ranging ensemble. In her Gilligan-verse debut, Seehorn’s Kim Wexler was just one of many fastidious obsessives in and around the Albuquerque underworld, joining kindred spirits like Mike and chicken-slash-meth kingpin Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). In “Pluribus,” Carol and the hive mind are pretty much all we have, give or take a few fellow survivors like gleeful hedonist Mr. Diabaté (Samba Schutte) and Manousos Oviedo (Carlos-Manuel Vesga), who spends much of Season 1 holed up in a Paraguayan storage facility.\n\n\tThat puts pressure on both Carol as audience surrogate and the viewer asked to train their attention on a single person’s response to a global cataclysm. Lengthy scenes show Carol doggedly investigating the hive’s source of nutrition (Human Derived Protein, which is exactly what it sounds like), or Manousos studying radio frequencies and noting his findings by hand. Especially in the hive’s absence, “Pluribus” is quiet, deliberate, patient — and for some, those qualities cross the line into “boring.” Writing for The New Republic, critic Philip Maciak pronounced the show “a bit of a snooze,” echoing many complaints on social media about the hive’s noisy, chaotic genesis giving way to the placidity of a status quo where almost everyone is quite literally of one mind.\n\n\tClearly, I disagree. I can point to certain objective factors in Gilligan’s defense: “Pluribus” balances out the indulgence of languid scene-to-scene pacing with sub-50 minute runtimes and a nine-episode season; the show’s visual panache works against a sense of monotony, like a dumpster-diving sequence directed by frequent Gilligan collaborator Gordon Smith that gives the grossest of tasks uncanny color and symmetry. (Cinematographers Marshall Adams and Paul Donachie seem to bask in the desert sun.) But mostly, I think how you feel about “Pluribus” comes down to how you feel about Carol, and your investment in the trajectory she takes from closeted, self-loathing romantasy author to airlifting an atom bomb onto Manousos’s doorstep.\n\t\n\n\tThe premise of “Pluribus” is abstract and allegorical by design, and Gilligan has said in interviews he prefers to leave interpretation to his audience. While the hive’s parallels to AI are uncanny — they even respond to prompts! — I’m partial to the most literal of readings. Millions of people don’t survive the process of assimilation into the hive, and Carol’s wife Helen (Miriam Shor) is one of the casualties. Carol is in mourning, and many of her most extreme, impulsive or just unsavory actions arise from that fact. So does our empathy for her.\n\n\tIn losing Helen, Carol has lost the one person on Earth who saw and accepted her for who she really was: her curmudgeonly qualities, but also the basic fact of her sexuality, which Carol hid from the public by making the romantic lead of her popular Wycaro series a man. Part of what makes the hive mind so eerie is how it’s able to provide a hollow facsimile of such intimacy. The hive absorbed Helen’s memories before she died, and deploys this knowledge in alternately earnest and manipulative ways. (Much of “Pluribus” operates from a place of ambiguity about The Joining and its consequences. That Human Derived Protein? It’s a last resort because the hive can’t kill what’s currently alive, so must make use of the dead for nutrition — no matter the species). Zosia (Karolina Wydra), the individual the hive deploys as its emissary to Carol, is chosen because she looks exactly like the romantic lead of Carol’s novels, before the character was genderbent into a man to reach a broader audience.\n\n\tThough “Pluribus” is a science fiction show, it eschews the mystery box structure deployed by so many of its genre peers. Questions remain about the hive, its motives and its mechanics, but they’re secondary to how Carol feels about the Joining and how she responds to it. For every new detail we learn about the hive, there’s a Carol-focused revelation like her painful history with anti-gay conversion therapy, which tells us all we need to know about her near-allergic reaction to the prospect of being forcibly assimilated into a dominant majority group. The hive’s unconscious natural instinct is to absorb whoever it can, and when Carol notes this fact on her whiteboard, she puts it in understandably personal terms: “Wants to CHANGE ME” — the last two words underlined. Carol’s precious safe harbor has been inverted into her worst fear, an abstract anxiety “Pluribus” renders concrete as only great horror, and horror-adjacent character studies, can.\n\t\n\n\tIn the last couple episodes of “Pluribus,” Carol’s resolve is tested, as any hero’s must be. She experiments with using the hive, as Diabaté has, to manifest her deepest desires. Carol sleeps with Zosia, asks her to use “I” pronouns instead of the hive’s preferred “we” and generally performs coupled domesticity. (Carol and Helen went to an ice hotel; Carol and Zosia go skiing.) This results in an amusing reversal wherein Manousos, who’s traveled thousands of miles in search of another skeptic, is just as appalled by Carol’s willing self-delusion as Carol once was by people like Laxmi (Menik Gooneratne), who refuses to acknowledge the obvious change in her own son. Carol is shocked out of her complacency only after learning that the hive has obtained her stem cells without her consent — from frozen eggs, so she could have a child with Helen — and could absorb her within the month.\n\n\tThe big shift in the “Pluribus” finale isn’t in our understanding of the hive, whose intentions were already shared. It’s within Carol, who chooses to ally herself with a fellow misanthrope in Manousos as unlikely saviors of mankind. I think there’s something beautiful in Gilligan employing such abundant resources, from tracking down and casting a Quechua speaker to shooting in the Canary Islands, in service of one person’s internal evolution. I also understand why it’s not for everyone — though, in my less generous moments, I’m frustrated that a story centered on a queer woman seems to get a shorter leash than Gilligan’s previous work about men doing crimes. To me, though, enjoying “Pluribus” isn’t about eating one’s cultural vegetables. It’s about enjoying a strange, absurd, uncategorizable show that’s also thoughtful and restrained. And it’s about Carol Sturka, a highly specific person whose unease with others is nonetheless broadly accessible. I’d never exchange her spiky, pushy personality for permanent affability, and I understand why she wouldn’t either.\n",

    "description": "\n\tElizabeth Chan is in her 15th consecutive year of releasing a new Christmas album every year, and going through a divorce and becoming a single mom ",
    "body": "\n\tElizabeth Chan is in her 15th consecutive year of releasing a new Christmas album every year, and going through a divorce and becoming a single mom was not about to put a stop to that personal and professional tradition. She considers all 15 of those records to be reflective of where she was in the year leading up to the season, and the fact that home-and-hearth look a little different for her in 2025 is duly reflected in “Christmas Unhinged.”\n\t\n\n\tThe title of this year’s release is a reference to Hinge, which has been Chan’s post-divorce dating app of choice this past year. She could have gone with something a little cornier, because, as she jokes, “This chapter is called ‘Single Bells, Single All the Way.'”\n\n\n\tIn all seriousness, Chan says, “I felt like I could really speak to everyone that listens to my Christmas music and Christmas music lovers everywhere to understand what kind of Christmas I was having this year, and why it’s OK to live Christmas not just in, like, a snow globe of time, but as an actual living, lived experience.”\n\n\n\tPerhaps you’re familiar with Chan for the legend that has built up around her as the only artist of note to have devoted her recorded output exclusively to Christmas music, which was a hot take a decade ago, let alone 15 years into her unbroken streak. Or perhaps you became aware of her as the artist who put up a challenge to Mariah Carey, and prevailed; Carey attempted to trademark the term “Queen of Christmas,” and Chan went to court to block it, noting that she had also been using it for many years and the New Yorker had even called her that in a headline. (Carey eventually stopped further action in the trademark pursuit, leading the judge to dismiss it and leave the slogan in the public domain.) If you’re unfamiliar with any of those parts of Chan’s story, you can retrace the footprints through the snow via previous Variety articles, including this origin story.\n\t\n\n\tBut for 2025, we had a very-late-in-the-season catchup with Chan about whether “Christmas Unhinged” is officially a divorce album, and what it’s been like to return the dating field and eventually have to explain to all possible suitors just what it is that she’s known for.\n\n\tThe answer might be evident to anyone who knows you, but the question is: Why put out a Christmas album that reflects your divorce?\n\n\tThis is definitely new emotional territory for me. But if you step back and look at all 15 chapters of my life in Christmas music, what makes my Christmas music so distinctive is that at the end of the year where we’re all taking inventory of where we are in our milestones of living, I curate my albums to capture the snapshot of where I am. And if I’m getting divorced, there are millions of other people just like me, who are facing the holidays without their spouse or without their family members as they know it, or their traditions have been upended. I’m not the only one. So it’s a tremendous honor to be able to create the kind of Christmas songs that are lacking if we only hold onto “A Holly Jolly Christmas.” I can grow with my Christmas canon and share some songs that might inspire others to embrace all of the holiday season — the good, the bad and the unknown. \n\n\tWould you go so far as to call this your Christmas divorce record?\n\n\tI think that last year was more my Christmas divorce record, with the album I called “Shatterproof.” I actually filed for divorce last year and I was going through so much internal turmoil, but I wasn’t ready to share it all yet. I processed the impending end of my marriage in the last album as safely as I could process it. I only do Christmas music, but this is how I process my emotions as an artist; it’s very cathartic to me. “Christmas Unhinged” is what happens once I decided to be divorced and embark on rediscovering myself, not focusing so much on the pain of divorce, but the opportunity of becoming who I’m meant to be in the second act of my life. As a single mom, it’s a beautiful thing. You know, divorce starts very sad, but there’s so much opportunity, because once you’ve been so down, the only place you can go is up, and I’ve never felt more myself in many years than I do right now.\n\n\tYou have talked on your social media about what it’s like to date now as the Queen of Christmas and how men react to that.\n\t\n\n\tEspecially while I was dating people during the beginning of the Christmas season, which is around September, I started to get really nervous, because this is when I cannot hide this aspect of my life. First of all, I have not even dated in 20 years. So when I had to start even contemplating going out on dates again, and then downloading an app, going through hundreds and hundreds of random pictures and trying to decide, “Hey, do I wanna date you, Random Picture?,” it’s the weirdest thing in the whole world, right? And I got very, very frustrated in the process. So I ended up writing a non-Christmas song called “Love Me Right or Leave Me Alone,” which is sincerely my Hinge-dating mission-status song.\n\n\n\n\n\tAlso, I did a Beatles cover on this record, “Something,” because I feel like there wasn’t a proper female version of that song. And as I was meeting new guys and going on all these dates, I’d be like, “Oh yeah, there’s something about him.” And then I sang it for myself and I put it on Hinge as my mating call.\n\n\tYou got your Beatles on with this record, doubly, because you also covered John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” which you retitled “Happy Ex-mas.”\n\n\tI do covers only if they transform in the way that I relate to lyrics. When I got divorced, I started to really think about the lyrics to that song, and the one lyric that really helped me in the studio get through all of my pain of divorce was the lyric “War is over if you want it.” Right when you’re in the middle of a divorce, those words are so powerful. And so that is really a message to my ex-husband. Which is not the original intent of the song. But having sung it the way that I did and even retitling it “Happy Ex-Mas” — sorry, Yoko, if you’re not happy about that! — the way that it came out was super cathartic.\n\n\n\n\n\tGoing back to your dating experiences this year, what was it like to tell people what you are famous for?\n\n\tI’ve dated tons of different types of people from all ethnicities and creeds and cultures, and they get to know me as Elizabeth, and they’ll connect with me if they’re also going through divorce or if they’re single parents. But sometimes the minute that they find out I’m the queen of Christmas, it’s like a needle drops. It’s like, “What does this mean? Do you know I’m Jewish?” or something like that, and I’m like, yeah, it doesn’t matter. But it can become very challenging to people. It’s just been pure comedy.\n\t\n\n\tMaybe they imagine it’s like the Tim Allen movie, and they think they will date you and then they suddenly turn into Santa Claus and grow a big beard and belly.\n\n\tI feel like the only person who would’ve really tolerated that would’ve been the Mormon potato farmer that I dated. I don’t know how I found this guy in New York. He would’ve been OK with turning into Santa, I’m pretty sure. I went on a coffee date with a Hare Krishna…\n\n\tI was gonna ask if you had run into any Christmas fetishists who might be really turned on by that part of you.\n\n\tThere was a request from somebody who was really convinced that I should expand into Christmas OnlyFans. And I knew very quickly that this guy was not the guy for me. So yes, I encountered that guy. It was a very awkward conversation because I think he was quite serious about it.\n\n\n\n\n\tYou make it sound, though, like you’ve had fun this year, going through that process, as confounding as it is to someone coming back into the dating world in the age of apps.\n\n\tI have to step back and laugh because the whole ridiculousness of dating in this day and age is so unlike how I remember dating back in the day, where you would go to a bar and then maybe get someone’s number and start dating, and then it was just that person until it faded out. Now it doesn’t even feel like dating; it feels like a messed-up video game. The worst term we had back then was fading out on somebody. Now we’ve got rostering, we’ve got ghosting, we have submarining, we have breadcrumbing, we have all kinds of stuff. You know how in Alaska they have a thousand names for snow? In dating, there’s a thousand names for disinterest.\n\n\tWait, you are going to have to explain some of these terms, to someone who is not out in the field. “Ghosting” I get, but what were some of the others you mentioned?\n\n\t“Rosters” means when people have more than one person that they date casually… “Submarining” is not quite ghosting, which is where someone just completely goes like the Ghost of Christmas Past on you and they just disappear and there’s no explanation. Submarining is when they kind of go down into the depths of the ocean and you have no idea where they are, and then like maybe a week later or two weeks later, they come back up. It’s like, “Hey, what’s up? I was just down in the ocean. Sorry I couldn’t talk to you. I was in the abyss.”\n\t\n\n\tTimes have indeed changed…\n\n\tAnd a lot of these profiles are AI-generated. I might be falling in love with robots.\n\n\tBack on the music: Do you ever consider taking a year off between Christmas albums? Or would that ruin what you’ve got going?\n\n\tNever. What, you’re asking me now, 15 years in? You could have asked me this eight years in.\n\n\tJust wondering if it’s ever been a temptation to skip a year, or like in college, taking a gap year.\n\n\tI think the closest thing to a gap year that I had was when I broke my spine and I couldn’t sing. I had a meeting with my musicians and my co-producers and managers and I let them know that I physically could not stand because I was paralyzed from the left leg down. and I couldn’t even breathe. I had no stability of my diaphragm because I had broken my L1 to L5. I was crying and my daughter was sitting next to me and she was like, “No, mommy, I’m gonna help you sing.” And then my friend Dave Eggar, when I floated around that maybe that might be the year that I wouldn’t be able to do something, was like, “There’s no way.” We always figure it out. So my team around me reminds me, “No, Elizabeth, you have a greater purpose. You must tell your story every Christmas.” I really owe it to my friends in this business who remind me that at the end of the day, I’m an artist, and as an artist, my perspective informs my inspiration, and my inspiration is through my Christmas music. They constantly remind me that what I do is very different, and they’ll hold that space for me and remind me that you’re not allowed to not celebrate a Christmas.\n\n\tIt’s like me asking you: Are you gonna skip a Christmas this year? Have you ever skipped a Christmas?\n\n\tYou know, I have not.\n\n\tNo. Right? So why would I? I mean, I know I do a little extra than you do, but I’m not gonna not celebrate Christmas, and the way that I celebrate Christmas is just the way that I celebrate it, is like, you know, producing new songs and coming up with new albums and presenting them to the world and telling my story one Christmas at a time. Why would I not want to do that?\n\n\tI got behind in thinking about the season, and I did not put any lights up till the 22nd this year, but I feel like this conversation has helped me round a corner.\n\t\n\n\tSee, my magic powers prevail. I’m sure that you know if you need some Christmas backup, all you have to do is call and ask. I am the Queen of Christmas. Like, I know some people.\n\n\tWe know you record these in the summer, but have you started thinking about next year’s Christmas record yet?\n\n\tI have, actually…\n\n\tIt could be full of love songs about the perfect person you found on the app.\n\n\tIt could be. If the fates allow.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tPat Finn, a veteran character actor best known for his roles on the TV comedies “The Middle,” “Ed” and “Marvin Marvin,” died Dec. 22 at his home in ",
    "body": "\n\tPat Finn, a veteran character actor best known for his roles on the TV comedies “The Middle,” “Ed” and “Marvin Marvin,” died Dec. 22 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 60.\n\n\tFinn had been battling bladder cancer for several years. Finn’s family issued a statement that noted the actor’s love of college football and the Chicago Bears NFL team. “They also ask you to be kind, to try and make one person’s life a little easier every day and to Bear Down. It’s what Pat would want, too.”\n\t\n\n\tFinn worked steadily in film and TV from the mid-1990s on. Early in his career, he was a member of the Second City improv troupe, where he worked with Chris Farley.\n\n\n\tFinn’s most prominent role in recent years was a recurring character on “The Middle,” the domestic comedy that ran on ABC from 2009 to 2018. He played Bill Norwood, a friendly but quirky neighbor of the Heck family at the heart of the series. On the Nickelodeon live-action series “Marvin Marvin,” which aired from 2012 to 2013, Finn played the patriarch of a family who takes in an alien teenage boy from another planet.\n\n\tThe actor’s long list of credits included guest shots on a host of notable TV series, from “Seinfeld,” “Friends” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” to “The Goldbergs,” “Two Broke Girls,” “Yes, Dear” and “The Bernie Mac Show.” His film work included “Dude, Where’s My Car,” “Funky Monkey,” “I Love You, Beth Cooper,” “It’s Complicated” and “Selfie Dad.” He was also featured in commercial spots for H&R Block, DiGiorno Pizza and Toyota and the milk industry’s “Got Milk” campaign.\n\n\tBorn in 1965, Finn grew up in Wilmette, Ill. He graduated from Marquette University in 1987 with a degree in speech. Farley, who went on to fame in “Saturday Night Live” and movies but died of a drug overdose in 1997 at age 33, was a classmate and rugby teammate of Finn.\n\t\n\n\tAfter college, Finn worked in improv out of Chicago and joined the touring company of Second City. His big boost in TV came with a series regular role on “The George Wendt Show,” which lasted only eight episodes on CBS in 1995. Finn and “Cheers” alum Wendt played bachelor brothers who ran an auto repair shop in Madison, Wisconsin. From 1995 to 1997, Finn had a recurring role on CBS’ “Murphy Brown.”\n\n\tOther TV roles on Finn’s long resume include “Caroline in the City,” “That 70s Show,” “The King of Queens,” “Third Rock From the Sun,” “According to Jim,” “Less Than Perfect,” “The Drew Carey Show,” “My Boys,” “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody” and “Wizards of Waverly Place.”\n\n\tFinn also worked as an adjunct professor and taught Improv for Strategic Communication at University of Colorado, and he taught at his alma mater, Marquette. “He loved sharing the joys of improv and the gospel of ‘yes, and’ with anyone who was willing to learn,” the Finn family said.\n\n\tFinn is survived by his wife of 35 years, Donna Crowley Finn, and three children, Cassidy, Caitlin and Ryan.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” scored its most-watched episode in more than a year on Dec. 20 with 5.4 million viewers.\n\n\tNot only was the episode hosted by pop star and “Wicked” actress Ariana Grande with Cher as musical guest — it also marked Bowen Yang’s final outing as a cast member. Yang joined “SNL” as a writer in 2018 before becoming the late night sketch show’s first-ever Asian cast member during Season 45 in 2019. News of his exit was reported the day before his last show.\n\t\n\n\tThis isn’t the first time Grande has brought strong ratings to “SNL”: When she hosted in October 2024 alongside musical guest Stevie Nicks, the resulting 5.6 million viewers were the show’s biggest audience since Elon Musk hosted in May 2021. During Season 50, Grande’s episode was only outdone when John Mulaney hosted the following month, hitting 6.8 million viewers, and Grande’s Season 51 episode has been the biggest since then.\n\n\n\tBefore Grande’s night as host and Yang’s exit, the most-watched episode of “SNL” Season 51 with 4.6 million viewers was the Oct. 4 season premiere, when Bad Bunny hosted with Doja Cat as musical guest. On Peacock, Bad Bunny’s episode is still the most-watched of the season, followed by Grande’s.\n\n\tAdditionally, Saturday marked the biggest Christmas episode since 2020, when Kristen Wiig hosted with Dua Lipa as musical guest, achieving 6.6 million viewers.\n\n\tGrande’s episode has also been Season 51’s biggest on social media, with 503 million views across YouTube, Facebook, X, Instagram and TikTok as of Dec. 23, outpacing every episode of Season 50. \n\n\t“Saturday Night Live” is produced in association with Broadway Video, with Lorne Michaels as creator and executive producer. The series returns on Jan. 17 with “Stranger Things” star Finn Wolfhard as host and A$AP Rocky as musical guest. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” has earned $450 million globally after a week of release, including $119 million at the domestic box office and $331 million overseas. \n\n\tOn Tuesday, James Cameron’s third trip to Pandora has collected $16.5 million in North America and $34.3 million internationally. Those mid-week ticket sales represent a steady hold from opening weekend and bode well for the upcoming Christmas stretch, which marks one of the busiest times of year for moviegoing. \n\t\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” is aiming for $75 million to $80 million through the four-day holiday frame, which would be enough to retain the No. 1 spot in North America. That’s as three new films — A24’s Timothee Chalamet-led sports dramedy “Marty Supreme,” the Focus Features musical drama “Song Sung Blue” and Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda” — enter the theatrical mix. Those films aren’t opening until Christmas Eve, so their respective studios won’t be reporting grosses until Christmas Day on Thursday. \n\n\n\tMeanwhile, Disney‘s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” is expected to remain a force through the Christmas holiday. So far, the family friendly juggernaut has earned $1.3 billion worldwide, including a staggering $993 million overseas. “Zootopia 2” long ago outpaced the original 2016 film in box office grosses and will soon become only the second animated film ever (“Inside Out 2” was the first) to surpass $1 billion internationally.\n\n\tAhead of Christmas, Disney unwrapped a gift in the form of a major box office milestone. Thanks to all-audience hits like “Zootopia 2” and “Lilo & Stitch,” the studio surpassed $6 billion in global ticket sales — including $2.3 billion domestically and $3.65 billion internationally — for the first time since COVID and fifth time in history.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAll hail the Magic Kingdom. Disney notched a major box office milestone, surpassing $6 billion in global ticket sales.\n\n\tThis is Disney’s fifth time crossing the $6 billion benchmark — and first since COVID — having previously achieved these box office heights in 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. No other studio has managed to reach $6 billion since 2015. Underscoring the significance of Disney’s feat is the reality that the overall box office hasn’t regained its strength since the pandemic-induced reset, with ticket sales still lagging around 20% behind the before times.\n\t\n\n\tThanks to two billion-dollar behemoths, May’s “Lilo & Stitch” ($1.03 billion) and November’s “Zootopia 2” ($1.3 billion and counting) as well as James Cameron’s juggernaut “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ($450 million after a week of release) and three Marvel sequels, the studio has earned $2.3 billion domestically and $3.65 billion internationally across all titles.\n\n\n\tThis marks Disney’s biggest year on record since 2019, when the studio had a record seven films that shattered the $1 billion mark: Marvel adventures “Captain Marvel” and “Avengers: Endgame,” the live action “Aladdin” and “The Lion King,” animated sequels “Toy Story 4” and “Frozen II” and “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” \n\n\tNot everything that Disney released in 2025 will turn a theatrical profit. Pixar’s “Elio” ($154 million), the live-action “Snow White” ($205 million) and legacy sequel “Tron: Ares” ($142 million) were major money losers against their production budgets that range from $150 million to $250 million. (Studios split ticket sales roughly 50-50 with theater owners, meaning a movie needs to earn at least 2.5 times its production budget to justify its price tag.) Meanwhile, Marvel couldn’t regain its strength with three consecutive commercial duds in “Captain America: Brave New World” ($415 million), “Thunderbolts” ($382 million) and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” ($521 million). Those tallies are a far cry from the days when any installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe could sprint past $1 billion (or get very close!) with ease. Granted, Disney’s misses still outperform most of their rivals biggest wins in terms of sheer box office dollars. And the characters that populate these films can sell hundreds of millions, if not billions in the case of “Lilo & Stitch,” in consumer products.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s box office dominance likely won’t waver in 2026 with a powerhouse lineup that includes “Avengers: Doomsday, “Toy Story 5,” the live action “Moana,” and “The Devil Wears Prada 2.” It’s good to be Disney.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMark Hamill didn’t plan on having such an active year.\n\n\tIn January, the actor lost his home in the Palisades fires and was forced to relocate with his family. Just months later, the 74-year-old actor found himself promoting three major studio projects: Mike Flanagan’s life-affirming fantasy drama “The Life of Chuck” (streaming Dec. 26 on Hulu), the adaptation of Stephen King’s “The Long Walk” and now “The SpongeBob Movie: Searching for SquarePants,” in which Hamill voices the ghoulish Flying Dutchman.\n\t\n\n\t“You can’t really control it, but this was a really, really active year,” Hamill tells Variety. “I don’t have anything lined up, so maybe next year won’t be so active.”\n\n\n\tHamill weighed the idea of retirement after reprising Luke Skywalker in the “Star Wars” sequel trilogy, wanting to hang up his cape while the going was still good. “As much as an actor appreciates a good entrance,” he says, “you want to find a way to end your career in a way where you can hold your head high.”That outlook shifted when Mike Flanagan offered him a part in “The Fall of the House of Usher,” which reignited his excitement for the craft. “It was a character part that would’ve been routine in voiceover,” Hamill said. “In voiceover, they don’t care what you look like, so you’re going to play many roles you’d never get on camera. They cast with their ears, not their eyes.”Now firmly in his third act, voice acting has allowed Hamill to keep playing those juicy roles untethered from age or physicality. But as AI reshapes Hollywood, he remains wary of how his legacy — especially in future Disney’s “Star Wars” projects — will live on. “It’s hard to predict the future,” Hamill says, “but I may have to ask my family if they want me in a Star Wars movie 30 years from now after I’m gone.”With Variety, Hamill discusses his approach to the Flying Dutchman, moving on from “Star Wars,” and why he quit Facebook.\n\n\tYou’ve had quite the year.Yeah. When it rains, it pours.How are you reflecting on the year as a whole? The Palisades fire in January, all these big movies — it’s been a lot of ups and downs.\n\n\tIt’s remarkable. I’m in the business of escapism, and if I can take people’s minds off the horrible headlines — especially for those affected by the fires — then I’ve done my job. A lot of things are unexpected. I did a show years ago called “Regular Show.” It has a cult following, but it ran for eight seasons. I’ve never been on a show that comes back. We did 40 new episodes, and they want to do 40 more.Before “The SpongeBob Movie” starts, there’s this five-minute “Ninja Turtles” short that plays. Did you see it?I did.It pokes fun at society’s over-reliance on ChatGPT. Has it been unsettling seeing AI-generated videos of you or Luke Skywalker? I saw one the other week of Luke talking to Ben Kenobi’s Force Ghost and couldn’t believe how realistic it looked.\n\n\tI haven’t seen that. Is it live-action or animated?It’s live-action. It plays like a deleted scene from “Return of the Jedi.”\n\n\tGee, I haven’t seen that. It’s one of those things where there’s a disconnect between the fan world and myself, in the sense that every actor does the job, and when the job is completed, they move on to the next project. They don’t really hang on to it. And yet, “Star Wars” is such a vital ongoing franchise. [Disney] is doing really well, and obviously, they’ve done more material since I left. But I had my time. Now I’m just a fan. I love “Rogue One,” “Mandalorian,” “Andor.” They’re doing great without me.Disney has a new partnership with OpenAI, where fans will now be able to generate short videos using characters from the “Star Wars” universe. How does that sit with you?\n\n\tIt’s fascinating to see it develop, and I’m also apprehensive about how it will be used. The story of the AI-generated actress that got signed by a major agency is mind-boggling. Is she going to stay 33, or whatever her age is, forever? It’s obviously hard to predict the future, but I guess I’m gonna have to talk to my family about if they want me to be in a “Star Wars” movie 30 years from now after I’m gone.It’s cool to hear you lend your voice to The Flying Dutchman. How did you approach that iconic laugh, especially given comparisons to the Joker?\n\n\tWhen I accepted the offer to be the Flying Dutchman, I thought it was a new character created just for this movie. I start to do my homework, and it’s a character that’s been done for years by Brian Doyle-Murray. I’ve been a fan of his since “Saturday Night Live.” I loved him on Chris Elliott’s show “Get a Life.” He’s just terrific. But I was too intimidated to listen to what he had done. I thought I’d better do my version, and I’ll listen to his later. With a character like a ghost pirate in the world of “SpongeBob,” you can go as big as you want. It’s like children’s theater. There is no too big.\n\n\tIn terms of the Joker, when you’re in the head of the character, I didn’t see the parallels. Now that I’m sort of distanced from it, I can see how people find comparisons between the two. I love both characters in different ways, and they’re both fun to play.Certain actors choose the route of retirement, but you’ve stayed incredibly active. Do you think you could retire?\n\n\tA few years ago, I started thinking, “I’ve done a lot, maybe it’s time to make a dignified exit.” As much as an actor appreciates a good entrance, you want to find a way to end your career in a way where you can hold your head high. The real turning point for me was meeting Trevor Macy and Mike Flanagan about “The Fall of the House of Usher.” That made me excited about performing again because it was a character part that would’ve been routine in voiceover. In voiceover, they don’t care what you look like, so you’re going to play many roles you’d never get on camera. They cast with their ears, not their eyes.\n\n\tYou can’t really control it, but this was a really, really active year. I don’t have anything lined up, so maybe next year won’t be so active. When you’re in your 20s and 30s, it’s hard to think of yourself in your 50s and 60s, but I certainly didn’t think I’d be on camera as long as I’ve been.Are there any dreams you haven’t achieved yet?\n\n\tI wanted to go to Broadway, I did that. I’ve wanted to do animation ever since I found out that people did animated voices. In grade school, I saw Clarence Nash do Donald Duck on a Walt Disney show, and I really zeroed in on all my favorite shows. I learned who Mel Blanc was. I loved “Rocky and Bullwinkle.” I’d go to the record stores to look at the back of the record albums to write down the names of the actors — because we didn’t have the internet, you couldn’t Google it. It was something I aspired to. \n\n\tIt’s a very unique job, and doing the Flying Dutchman is one of the reasons I love being an actor. And the fact that I got to play it in live-action segments. I mean, it was crazy fun. If people have even a fraction of the good time that I’m having doing this character, they’re in for the time of their lives.\n\n\tThey say in the movie that SpongeBob has the purest heart of an innocent. Before SpongeBob, that was Luke Skywalker for a lot of people. What gravitates you towards these optimistic characters?\n\n\tI never forget the fact that we are in the business of escapism. These are troubled times. The movie is therapeutic in that regard. You go to something like “The SpongeBob Movie,” you leave all your troubles behind. It’s healthy in troubling times to have an escape.\n\n\tGeorge Lucas mastered that escapism, but at its core, “Star Wars” is a very anti-authoritarian story. \n\n\tWell, that’s the thing. It’ll work on different levels, depending on your age. And you’re right about George. The original “Star Wars” was an allegory commenting on the Vietnam War. So there’s the resistance, the rebels, the Empire. It’s surprisingly relevant when you consider what’s going on in our country today.\n\t\n\n\tYou’re in the business of entertainment, but you’ve also stayed very connected to politics and charities. Why is that important to you?\n\n\tIf you’ve been lucky enough to be able to do what you love and make a living at it, you have a responsibility to pay back as best you can. That’s why I love Make-A-Wish, and that’s what I use social media for. I’m not really overtly political on talk shows, but more so on Bluesky and Instagram. I left Twitter the day after the election because I didn’t want to support anything that Elon Musk is involved in. I left Facebook in 2016 because I didn’t like the way Zuckerberg handled Hillary. But who cares that I left Facebook? It’s a real lesson that you’re only one voice in a country of over 300 million. So, get a grip and don’t take yourself too seriously.\n",

Many of the same titles end up appearing on every list of critics association awards, guild nominations and Oscar projections. This means that dozens of other titles end up basically getting lost along the way, thanks to an all-too-brief stint in theaters and then swimming into the sea of streaming movies as one in a vast school of tasty catches. \n\n\tOverlooked can mean many things – sometimes, it means critics weren’t on board, even if many viewers disagreed. Or maybe it had upwards of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, like Kristen Stewart’s directing debut “Chronology of Water,” but didn’t get much attention during its initial limited release in a brutally tough theatrical market for indie films. Or maybe, like “Jingle Bell Heist,” it’s from a genre like “Holiday Movies” that doesn’t get much respect. In addition, there are many horror and other genre films that are just as well-crafted as awards bait, but can end up getting lost in the shuffle.\n\n\tHere are Variety‘s picks for some 2025 releases that are worth re-considering and seeking out.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t The Alto Knights\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Warner Bros\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA Mob drama so reviled by the critics that I felt a touch embarrassed every time I talked about how much I liked it. But it’s seriously good! What seemed to push everyone’s buttons was the idea that Robert De Niro, having portrayed about 100 gangsters in his life, would now deign to play two of them…at once. In this true-life war of the underworld, he plays a pair of lifelong New York frenemies: Frank Costello, who is courtly and political, trying to live in the real world, and also Vito Genovese, the sociopathic firecracker who doesn’t want to be controlled by anyone. The reviewers treated this as a joke, as if it were “GoodFellas” meets “The Patty Duke Show,” but just watch what De Niro brings off in this unique double performance. He creates a master class in the nuances of Mob psychology. The movie, directed with straight-ahead gusto by Barry Levinson, was written by “GoodFellas’” Nicholas Pileggi, and it’s one of the only movies to dig behind the façade of the gangsters you used to see in tabloid-newspaper photographs — the old men in glasses and fedoras who ruled the Italian underworld in the ’50s and ’60s. “The Alto Knights” was a big enough bomb to indicate that this kind of Mob movie has come to its end as a genre, but if you’ve been a connoisseur of it, you owe it to yourself to check out what amounts to an essential gangster chronicle. — Owen Gleiberman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAmerican Sweatshop\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Guido Marx\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDaisy Morris (Lili Reinhart) has one of the unhealthiest jobs imaginable. Not inhaling asbestos all day or scraping toxic sludge from public spaces, but not all that different either. As a content moderator, she’s part of a team that reviews violent and offensive videos online, which means spending soul-sucking hours watching the worst the internet has to offer (vile clips with names like “baby in a blender”). There’s only so much someone in her position can take. \n\n\tConfronting ideas of free speech our founding fathers couldn’t possibly have imagined, Uta Briesewitz’s under-the-radar SXSW discovery presents the female version of an angry Paul Schrader character. Think Robert De Niro in “Taxi Driver” or George C. Scott in “Hardcore”: dudes who flip out when confronted by how dark the world can get. Here we have a seemingly level-headed woman who sees what looks like a snuff film, and rather than simply deleting it, she resolves to track down the sickos responsible. — Peter Debruge\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Ballad of Wallis Island\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everet\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tHave you ever experienced a film that has what appears to be a cloying setup, and a seemingly deeply annoying major character precipitating all the action… that then turns out to be funny, moving and maybe even profoundly truthful, in spite of all those red flags? That is “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” one of the very best contemporary films about music, although that’s hardly all it’s concerned with. Tim Key plays a social misfit so alienating, it makes sense that he has exiled himself to a Welsh island, the remote spot where he uses his riches to try to force a reunion between a famous male-female music duo — wonderfully played by Carey Mulligan and co-writer Tom Basden — who are more deeply estranged than Stevie and Lindsey. What it finally has to say about fandom, musical harmony and the frailty of mismatched relationships feels so real, you may learn never to trust first impressions again —Chris Willman\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBob Trevino Likes It\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Roadside Attractions\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTracie Laymon’s debut feature won both the jury and audience awards at last year’s SXSW Film Festival but only made it into theaters a year later, in March 2025. And it’s easy to see why festival audiences all over the country have been charmed by this warm-hearted tale based on the director’s own story. Barbie Ferreira proves her star power as Lily, a young woman cut off by her toxic biological dad (French Stewart, playing against type), who finds an even better father figure in a man who shares his name, played by John Leguizamo. Both Lily and Bob are broken and damaged in different ways, and their healing journey together is funny, sly and sensitive. It’s currently on Hulu; here’s hoping more audiences discover it. —Jenelle Riley\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBring Them Down\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Credit: Patrick Redmond\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tOf all the crimes captured on screen this year, none is more upsetting than the senseless attack on an entire flock of sheep — a stealthy late-night operation that leaves the poor animals bleeding to death in the dark and their owner Michael (Christopher Abbott, infinitely more intimidating than he was in “The Wolf Man”) with a head full of fury. What kind of monster could have cut off all his livestock’s legs, and to what end?\n\n\tMichael interprets this sick act as the latest salvo in a long-running feud with his neighbor (Paul Ready), who married his ex and is now stealing his sheep. To complicate things, the prickly couple has a daft, loose-cannon son with a history of bad decisions (the latest inspired use of Barry Keoghan’s feral energy).\n\n\tWriter-director Christopher Andrews’ tough, terrifically acted gut punch confronts the cycle of pain in this rural Irish community, barely scraping by as it is. Poverty and ignorance butt up against cycles of anger and retribution — a common theme in Irish life and literature, afforded new angles in this doomed portrait of two rivals dragging one another down, when their best hope for survival ought to be teaming up and working together. — Peter Debruge\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCaught Stealing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Sony Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAustin Butler plays Hank, a bartender who is left to look after his neighbor’s cat. Except that his neighbor is a punk rocker who is in trouble with gangsters, and Hank gets caught in the middle. Butler gets you rooting for Hank, who is something a screwup thanks to a traumatic past. Director Darren Aronofsky sets the action in 1990s New York City, staging every scene with authentic grit and delivering one of the best action sequences of the year: a car chase through Flushing Meadows! —Jazz Tangcay\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Chronology of Water\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Andrejs Strokins\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tKristen Stewart’s directorial debut adapts Lidia Yuknavitch’s devastating memoir — about her salvation through swimming while coping with addiction and sexual abuse — in a raw, punk-rock way. With a revelatory Imogen Poots as the film’s anchor, Stewart employs uncomfortable close-ups, a searing script and clever editing to deliver a film with a truly singular vision that simultaneously recalls the greats. As Variety’s Owen Gleiberman wrote in his review: “Stewart stages the movie like a numinous documentary that’s being lived and remembered at the same time. The drama is pointillistic, the way it was in ‘The Tree of Life’ — the poetry of images that illuminate and scald.” Despite premiering to rave reviews out of Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section, it took three months for the film to score U.S. distribution and it won’t release wide until Jan. 9. Still, if this is how Stewart chose to start her directing career — brave, unabashed and with a true artist’s touch — we can’t wait to see what’s next. — Ellise Shafer\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEternity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy ot TIFF\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“Eternity” is the kind of romantic oddity studios don’t make often enough. It’s clever, melancholy and unexpectedly moving. Director David Freyne reimagines the afterlife as a place of waiting area of reckoning, where Elizabeth Olsen’s conflicted heroine must choose which love defines her forever, opposite soulful turns from Miles Teller and Callum Turner. The premise is playful, but the execution cuts deeper, blending screwball rhythms with existential ache. Da’Vine Joy Randolph nearly steals the film with a scene-lifting supporting turn. The tenderness beneath the chuckles lingers in a film unafraid to ask whether love is defined by passion, comfort or timing, even beyond death. – Clayton Davis\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFight or Flight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nBasically “Bullet Train” on a plane, Josh Hartnett has a ton of fun playing a washed-out ex-Secret Service agent who must keep a hacker alive, despite the fact they’re on a commercial flight full of hitmen. What it lacks in overall originality, it makes up for with inventive fight sequences, which are frequent, fun and flashy, taking full advantage of all the items on a flight that could make great weapons in a pinch. After all, who doesn’t want to watch a manically grinning Hartnett run around an airplane with a chainsaw, taking out bad guys. – William Earl\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe G\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe managers of a corrupt conservatorship that preys on vulnerable seniors make a deadly error in judgement when they mess with the wrong grandma in this gritty revenge thriller, starring longtime character actress Dale Dickey in the title role. With her gravel-soaked voice, dead-eyed scowl, and steel-fisted resolve, Dickey redefines the classic noir antihero, playing a ruthless survivor who’s part June Squibb, part Charles Bronson. Set against the harsh industrial underbelly of an unnamed city in winter, writer-director Karl R. Hearne confidently captures the bleak vibe of a Jim Thompson–style pulp novel, where double-crosses and betrayals hit harder than a .44 Magnum at close range. Packed with simmering threats, suspenseful showdowns, and sudden bursts of cathartic violence, “The G” is a pitch-black crime gem, perfect for fans of “Emily the Criminal” and early Paul Schrader – Matthew Chernov\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHallow Road\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of SXSW\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThis propulsive two-hander stars Rosamund Pike and Matthew Rhys as a couple racing to a late-night auto accident caused by their daughter. The film mainly takes place in the cab of the car, with the parents on speakerphone with their daughter during the agonizingly long drive. Creating great tension from a confined space, Pike and Rhys are compelling as they learn in real time how far the other is willing to go to protect their child. Warning: The ending to this film takes a HUGE left turn that might leave less adventurous audiences in the cold after a wonderfully taut ride. — William Earl\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJingle Bell Heist\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Rob Baker Ashton/Netflix ©2025\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAfter Thanksgiving, I will watch pretty much any Christmas movie on Netflix, and admittedly, the bar is low. But they’re often cozy fun, and this year, I especially enjoyed the charming “A Merry Little Ex-Mas,” led by Alicia Silverstone. Yet I was not prepared for “Jingle Bell Heist” — starring Olivia Holt and Connor Swindells — to be genuinely, truly …. good? Holt and Swindells play two strangers, Sophia and Nick, who meet by happenstance in London, and, since they both desperately need money, decide to rob the department store where Sophia works at Christmastime.“Jingle Bell Heist” is boosted by the strong performances of its leads, as well as supporting turns by Peter Serafinowicz as the store’s villainous owner and Lucy Punch as his not-to-be-underestimated wife. As a rom-com, “Jingle Bell Heist” delights; as a heist movie, it’s good too! I did not see its twists coming, plus, you get to see London during Christmas. Michael Fimognari directed from Abby McDonald’s script, which was actually on the 2022 Black List (Amy Reed co-wrote the eventual movie). Curl up and watch “Jingle Bell Heist,” and you won’t be sorry! — Kate Aurthur\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Last Rodeo\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Angel Studios\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDirected and co-written by Jon Avnet (“Fried Green Tomatoes”), this faith-based contemporary Western drama about family, sacrifice, and getting back up when you’re knocked down plays like a cross between “Rocky Balboa” and a Professional Bull Riders competition. No stranger to the cowboy genre, “Yellowstone” star Neal McDonough delivers a muscular, heartfelt performance as a trail-worn rodeo champ who climbs back in the saddle one last time to earn prize money on the tournament circuit when his grandson’s medical care costs skyrocket. The role fits the rugged McDonough like a beloved pair of work boots, and you can practically smell the Stetson cologne wafting off the screen. As for the film’s immersive bull riding sequences, they’re shot with vivid intensity by DP Denis Lenoir and scored with gusto by composer Jeff Russo (“Alien: Earth”). Sincere, uplifting and corny in the best way possible, “The Last Rodeo” is a dad movie that might make mom shed a few tears too. – Matthew Chernov\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLilly\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Blue Harbor Entertainment\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe best role that the great Patricia Clarkson has had in a long time, and she makes it indelible. In this true-life whistleblower drama, Clarkson plays Lilly Ledbetter, a homespun Alabama wife and mother who went to work at the local Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company plant. She climbed the managerial ladder, only to keep getting knocked back down, and after 20 years she learned that she was making half of what her male colleagues did. So she took on the system, and took it right to the top (but, as the movie demonstrates, that’s now like climbing a pole greased with oil). The way Clarkson plays Lilly, in shopworn bangs, with a horse-sense Southern directness, there’s nothing about her that signals righteous “activist.” Even when her battle reaches the halls of power in Washington, the beauty of Clarkson’s performance is that she makes Lilly plainspoken, dogged, stubborn in her decency, and a woman in way over her head. She makes her one of us. “Lilly” opens our eyes to how fighting the power is always more possible than the power wants you to think. — Owen Gleiberman     \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Lost Bus\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©HLN/Courtesy Everett Collectio\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFew films in 2025 matched the white-knuckle immediacy of “The Lost Bus,” a survival thriller that refuses to sensationalize heroism while still honoring it. Dramatizing the true story of a school bus driver and a teacher who guided 22 children through the 2018 Camp Fire, the film is as harrowing and humane. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of his most grounded performances as an ordinary man rising under impossible pressure, while America Ferrera brings fierce compassion and resolve to a teacher who will not abandon her students. Shot with visceral urgency and anchored by practical effects, the film engulfs the viewer in smoke, panic and resolve — a gutting reminder of courage amid catastrophe. – Clayton Davis\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLove, Brooklyn\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Photo\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA love letter to both the people and the New York City borough for which it’s named, “Love, Brooklyn,” invokes the spirit of classic ’90s romances, like “Love and Basketball” and “Love Jones,” while accurately depicting modern dating woes. André Holland stars as Roger, who suffers from writer’s block as he attempts to capture Brooklyn’s changing landscape for a story. His creative impasse is linked to his indecision about his romantic relationships, as he bounces between a friendship with his ex, Casey (Nicole Beharie), a fine-art gallerist, and a situationship with Nicole (DeWanda Wise), a widow with a young daughter. In her feature debut, director Rachael Abigail Holder crafts a charming movie that underscores the bittersweet beauty of change and how one must let go to embrace a new beginning. – Angelique Jackson\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMy Dead Friend Zoe\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tArmy veteran Kyle Hausmann-Stokes’ activist-minded debut has serious Frank Capra vibes, confronting the way society doesn’t do enough to help those who’ve served their country to acclimate back to civilian life. It’s been a bumpy adjustment for Merit (Sonequa Martin-Green), who blames herself for the death of fellow soldier Zoe (Natalie Morales). During their tour of duty in Afghanistan, the pair swore they’d always have each other’s backs. Now Merit is haunted by her guilt. As vivacious a ghost as you’re likely to meet, Zoe pops up at inopportune times, making jokes and crashing group therapy sessions (overseen by Morgan Freeman, one of multiple real-life vets in the cast). The powerful drama finds an original way to remind that more U.S. soldiers die of suicide than in combat, lending an urgency to the idea that it’s our collective responsibility to support those like Merit, who defend us at great personal cost. — Peter Debruge\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tA Normal Family\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Room 8 Films\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSouth Korean genre hits like “Squid Game” and “Parasite” have proven so popular in recent years that audiences no longer need convincing to check out some of the country’s most compelling new exports — though Hur Jin-ho’s tense, morally thorny drama slipped quietly under the radar this spring. Track it down, and the film’s guaranteed to grab you from the first scene, in which an inexplicably furious sports car driver smashes into an SUV. That opening act of aggression sets the stage for all kinds of heightened emotions, inadvertently pitting two brothers against one another: One’s an attorney who’s been hired to represent the driver, while the other is a doctor fighting to save the injured girl who narrowly survived the accident. But that’s just the beginning of the movie’s many ethical dilemmas, as the siblings’ teenage children have committed an inexplicable crime that makes this anything-but-normal family every bit as compelling as the characters in Netflix’s “Adolescence” (which is cinematic enough to merit an honorable mention on this mid-year list). — PD\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tNovocaine\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Paramount Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tYou may have forgotten about “Novocaine,” which released way back in March, but it’s a worthy “John Wick” imitator starring a charmingly awkward Jack Quaid as a man who can’t feel pain. It’s a simple, but effective, premise: Boy meets girl. Girl gets kidnapped. Boy saves her. But in this case, boy clumsily murders legions of gangsters and literally can’t feel pain due to a rare disorder. That means he doesn’t notice knives piercing his body, his hand burning on a stove or his bladder filling up to burst (don’t worry, he sets an hourly timer to remember to relieve himself). It’s a surprisingly solid action movie, buoyed by Quaid’s performance and his painless chemistry with Amber Midthunder that drives the revenge story.    — Jordan Moreau\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOh, Hi!\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Sony Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMolly Gordon has shown off her comedy chops in movies like “Good Boys” and “Theater Camp” – plus she can bring the drama, as seen in “The Bear – and “Oh, Hi” combines everything into one hilariously unraveled performance. Opposite Logan Lerman, she plays one half of a new couple who suddenly realizes they have different outlooks for their relationship after Lerman is handcuffed to the bed in a night of kinky sex on a weekend getaway. Gordon tries everything to convince Lerman to stay with her, from brewing a love potion to interpretive dance, until things take an even more drastic turn in this darkly tinged, yet somehow still relatable rom-com. — Jordan Moreau\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Plague\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of The Space Program, Cannes Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMale adolescence as a horror story is taken to new levels when a 12-year-old boy named Ben (Everett Blunck) attends a water polo camp in the summer of 2003. While generally kind, Ben finds himself joining up with the camp bullies (led by an unsettling Kayo Martin) to focus their disdain on Eli (Kenny Rasmussen), whose body is covered in a strange rash. Urban legends about how “the plague” is contagious run amok and Ben finds himself torn between his humanity and the desire to fit in. Writer-director Charlie Polinger’s feature debut will expand wider in January, and deserves to find an audience. — Jenelle Riley\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRosemead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Rosemead Project LLC\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe film began with Frank Shyong’s 2017 L.A. Times article “A dying mother’s plan: Buy a gun. Rent a hotel room. Kill her son,” but Marilyn Fu’s tender script goes beyond the headline to present a tender portrait of a mother faced with an impossible choice. Lucy Liu is stellar as Irene, a Chinese immigrant whose struggles with a schizophrenic son (newcomer Lawrence Shou) intensify when she learns she has terminal cancer. Mental health is not something discussed regularly, particularly in her community, and what unravels next in director Erin Lin’s feature debut is harrowing and all-too timely. — Jenelle Riley\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSketch\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMove over, James Cameron. The year’s most creative use of visual effects could be found in a kids’ movie about a family that’s lost its matriarch. Daughter Amber channels her feelings into fanciful — and sometimes frightening — doodles, which come to life and start to terrorize the locals, forcing Amber, her older brother (Kue Lawrence) and their dad (Tony Hale) to confront the feelings they’ve been avoiding. Director Seth Worley has come up with a creative — and highly teachable — concept for his feature debut, using imaginative visual effects to impart a valuable lesson about dealing with grief and other strong emotions. In short, keeping such feelings in can be more dangerous than letting them out through art and other healthy means of processing. The live-action/CG-animated hybrid channels the spirit of “Jumanji,” by way of “The Babadook,” but with something important to say. — Peter Debruge\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSovereign\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIf there’s anything the forces of MAGA are right about, it’s that the entertainment industry doesn’t exactly devote a lot of time and energy to portraying what’s on their minds. But Christian Swegal’s revelatory drama does. It stars Nick Offerman, in a performance that’s never less than stunning, as a sovereign citizens leader who preaches a radical idea of what the government can and cannot do. A local guru of the new anti-government militancy, he travels through the heartland, presenting his seminar in bingo parlors and dingy conference rooms, preaching to small-town types who feel like they’ve been raked over the coals. \n\n\tThe movie never references President Trump, but it doesn’t have to. It’s about something larger than Trump — how desperation and nihilism and extremism seeped into Middle America, giving rise to a new politics of righteous despair. The movie is a real-world thriller that’s also a riveting character study that’s also a portrait of the place where the reactionary spirit of today descends into obsession. — Owen Gleiberman     \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSplitsville\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: \"Splitsville\" (Courtesy of Neon)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDakota Johnson is the secret weapon of this entertaining contemporary couples comedy from Michael Angelo Covino (“The Climb”). When life coach Ashley (Adria Arjona) decides she wants a divorce from good guyCarey (co-writer Kyle Marvin), he goes to stay with his wealthy friends Julie (Johnson) and Paul (Covino), only to discover they have an open marriage. Amid several brawls, glimpses of Carey’s manhood and numerous preposterous situations involving cheating and casual hook-ups, there’s some amusing dialogue, and it all plays a little bit like a glossy version of what Eric Rohmer or Hal Hartley might come up with these days. – Pat Saperstein\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSteve\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Robert Viglasky/Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCillian Murphy won the Oscar for playing a historical icon in “Oppenheimer,” but it’s his introspective, humane portrait of a teacher at a boarding school for teen boys with behavioral challenges that might be his greatest work. While newcomer Jay Lycurgo won a British Independent Film Award for his breakthrough performance as Shy, a troubled but relatable student, but the rest of the film deserved more attention. In America, streaming giant Netflix had its hands full with a starry awards season slate and perhaps underestimated how powerful the little indie film would be – though after the success of “Adolescence” on the TV side, you’d think they would know better. Fortunately, the streamer provides access to a worldwide audience, who can now discover the film. — Jenelle Riley\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Surfer\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Roadside Attractions and Lionsgate\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNicolas Cage plays a man pushed to his limit in this allegorical tale. Cage, as the unnamed title character, is determined to catch a wave on an Aussie beach, but it’s the territory of a violent gang led by Scally (the late Julian McMahon). The Surfer begins to lose his belongings, his dignity and eventually his sanity in the pursuit of settling the score with the gang, until he is nearly indistinguishable from the destitute people wandering the shore. A rip-roaring examination of how calamity can be just a few choices away, “The Surfer” plays like a hazy, sun-drenched nightmare. – William Earl\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTwinless\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Greg Cotten\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIn James Sweeney’s disarmingly funny second feature, two men meet in an emotional support group for those who’ve lost an identical sibling. That seems as good a place as any to talk about codependency, although it’s the even more universal subject of loneliness that animates Sweeney’s insightful coping comedy. The writer-director recognizes that some of his laughs could be in poor taste, but isn’t shy about casting himself as a weirdo, when such discomfort can point the way to deeper truths.\n\n\tSweeney, who does not have a twin in real life, has spent some serious time thinking about the special bond twins share, weaving those ideas into a script that has a few sick twists up its sleeve, including a highly unconventional “bromance” involving the transference of an erotic fixation from one sibling to another (both played by a startlingly versatile Dylan O’Brien). It’s a tonal tightwire act, to say the least, as Sweeney balances unconscionable behavior with an earnest look at bereavement, anxiety and anger management. — Peter Debruge\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWild Diamond\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Monterrey Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tThe fraudulent seduction of reality TV. The toxic backbiting of social media. The false god of fame — not the old-fashioned kind but the new fame, the lusty fickle kind that can last 15 seconds. These are all fundamental forces in the way we live now, especially for those who are young. Astonishingly, though, the drama that’s come closest to putting its finger on the narcotic dynamic of what it’s like to grow up in the media-splintered image culture of the 21st century isn’t an American film. It’s French, and is the first movie written and directed by Agatha Riedinger. \n\n\tIn telling the story of Liane (Malou Khebizi), a 19-year-old glam trainwreck in Southern France, Riedinger portrays the collective soul of troubled youth with a convulsive power that the François Truffaut of “The 400 Blows” would have understood. As sociology, “Wild Diamond” is as pinpoint incisive as a movie by the Dardenne brothers, yet what puts the film over is how moving it is. It gazes, with total empathy, upon its heroine’s coarsened and trashed humanity, separating the sinner from the sin, even as it holds both up to the light. — Owen Gleiberman\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNiall Horan Follows Up ‘The Voice’ Victory With New Restaurant Opening in Arizona\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe World’s Most Important Motorcycles Can Now Fit on Your Coffee Table\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Give FIFA’s Roblox Deal Context, Look at YouTube\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          According to court docs, obtained by TMZ, the \"16 and Pregnant\" alum was on the brink of being arrested after the court found she'd fallen more than $23K behind on child support for her kids -- Weston Jr. and River -- with ex Weston Gosa.\n      \n    \n          The judge ordered Purvis be taken into custody and jailed unless she paid a $4K lump sum purge payment to avoid jail time. Court docs now show she paid the full amount ... so the judge rescinded the order before she was ever arrested.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Purvis is still on the hook moving forward because she's been ordered to continue paying $353 per month in current child support, plus $20 per month toward the arrears, along with additional processing fees.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          We broke the story ... Purvis was previously in police custody after being arrested on a felony involuntary manslaughter charge tied to an alleged fatal overdose. Police claimed she intentionally distributed Tranq, a fentanyl-xylazine mixture, which they say caused John Mark Harris to die from a toxic overdose.\n      \n    \n          She also faces two additional drug charges, including possession with intent to distribute. The arrest came just weeks after the death of her teenage son, Weston Jr.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Whitney Purvis\n              \n                          \n                TV\n              \n                          \n                Reality TV\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                16 and Pregnant\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tThe Mediapro Studio Distribution has pounced on the international rights to period series “The Marquise” (“Leonor, Marquesa de Alorna”), capping a flurry of activities at the Berlin Film Festival where it showcased films and TV series to which it has worldwide distribution rights.\n\n\tThis ambitious adaptation of the bestselling novel by Portugal’s Maria João Lopo de Carvalho was created by Pandora da Cunha Telles. It centers on Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna– a poet, diplomat and revolutionary thinker, who was considered one of the most captivating women of the 18th century.\n\t\n\n\tThrough six episodes, the series traces the Marquise’s life, from her early childhood in a Lisbon convent to her years at Vienna’s royal court and in revolutionary France. There she bears witness to the monumental changes sweeping across Europe before she returns to Portugal. Once back home, she makes it her mission to challenge despotic rule and foster education.\n\n\n\tProduced by Da Cunha Telles’ Lisbon-based label Ukbar Filmes and Spain’s Tornasol Films, an Oscar winner with Juan José Campanella’s “The Secret in Their Eyes,” it is set to debut on Portuguese pubaster RTP and Netflix in Portugal.\n\n\tThe Mediapro Studio also presented the latest film titles in its vast catalog, including “Lapönia,” “Aida y Vuelta” and “Mesa de Regalos” at the EFM.\n\n\tAt the Berlinale Series Market Selects, it showcased two new series, Daniel Burman’s “So Far So Good” (“El resto bien”) and Hernán Caffiero‘s “Raza Brava.”\n\n\t“So Far So Good” is the latest from Daniel Burman, made for the Argentine platform Flow. Produced by The Mediapro Studio’s Oficina Burman and Latin America’s production-services house Cimarrón, the new dramedy series from Burman and actor-director Daniel Hendler, who helmed Netflix’s 2025 San Sebastian opening film “27 Nights,” follows a successful comic book artist in the throes of a mid-life crisis.\n\t\n\n\tStarring Benjamín Vicuña, Rita Cortese, Violeta Urtizberea and Jorge Bolani, the eight 30-minute episodes were co-written by Burman and a team of often regular writers. It features appearances by Hendler, Andrea Frigerio, Alejandro Awada and Marina Bellati and will premiere on Flow in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.\n\n\t“Raza Brava,” created by Hernán Caffiero who won an International Emmy in 2018 for his anthology series “The Suspended Mourning,” is the first fiction series about a real Latin American soccer team: Colo-Colo and comes at a time when World Cup “futbol” fever is coming to a head.\n\n\tProduced by DeCulto alongside Erik Barmack’s Wild Sheep Content and Atomica, with support from Chilean broadcast network CNTV, it is based on actual events that took place in the Chilean capital of Santiago more than two decades ago.\n\n\tIt follows Carlos “Barti” Aguilar, a young man from a blue-collar neighborhood who rises to become a leader of the White Claw (Garra Blanca), rabid supporters of the Colo Colo soccer club. With his pal Clavo, he is sucked into a sordid world of new-found wealth and power-battles where White Claw, once a source of identity and respect, becomes a prison.\n\n\tStarring Gabriel Muñoz, Karla Melo and David Gaete, the production cast thousands of real soccer fans as extras, adding authenticity to scenes filmed at Colo Colo’s Estadio Monumental and other real-life locations in Santiago where the scenes in the series took place.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Marquise,  Courtesy of Ukbar Filmes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRita Carmo\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpanish streaming platform Filmin and Belgium’s Boucan Film Production have boarded the series “Robbery, Beating & Death” (“El pitjor atracament de la historia”) from “This is Not Sweden” producers, Funicular Films.\n\n\tUpscale SVOD service Filmin also produces original shows and holds a vast catalog of classic films. It also hosts dedicated country channels, like that of Costa Rica.\n\n\n\tFounded by producers Boris Van Gils and Michaël Goldberg, Boucan describes itself as a company that makes audience-driven auteur films with mainstream appeal. It has offices in Brussels, Abidjan and Paris. Among their notable credits are Stephan Streker’s “Noces,” nominated for a Best Foreign Film César award in 2018 and Belgian box office hit “Les Rayures du Zèbra.”\n\t\n\n\tParticipating in the Berlinale Co-Pro Series event, the series turns on two lifelong friends who are hired to create a television series centered on a bank heist. Eager for the acclaim they’ve always been denied, they cling to the bold, extreme philosophy of a mysterious artist they admire. Determined to prove themselves, they push their project beyond fiction—choosing not to film the story, but to carry out a real bank robbery instead.\n\n\tSaid Funicular’s Marta Baldó: “Framed as a playful guide to pulling off the greatest heist in the world, ‘Robbery, beating and death’ uses comedy to explore universal themes: friendship, family, loyalty, work, art, capitalism and the contradictions of our industry.”\n\n\t“Like science fiction or dystopia, its meta layer lets us talk about the present human condition with political and philosophical bite,” she noted.\n\t\n\n\tMarcel Borràs and Nao Albet have written and directed the series, in which they will also star. The rest of the cast has yet to be confirmed.\n\n\t“Robbery, Beating & Death” received vital support from Catalan cultural agency, ICEC, a pillar of Catalonia’s robust audiovisual production landscape.\n\n\tICEC’s High-End TV Production Fund, launched in 2022, allots up to €1.5 million ($1.8 million) for Catalan-language series with a minimum budget of €4 million ($4.7 million).\n\n\t“This Is Not Sweden,” first presented at Series Mania 2024, picked up the Best Performance award for Aina Clotet at Canneseries 2024. It also won the Prix Europa for Best European TV Fiction Series. Clotet has directed her first feature film, the love triangle drama “Oh Nora!” based on a screenplay she co-wrote with Valentina Viso. It is co-produced by Funicular and Ikiru Films and is currently in post.  \n\n\tBowing in Spain on Catalonia’s 3Cat and national pubcaster RTVE, “This is Not Sweden” follows a young couple, Mariana and Samuel who resettle, along with other yuppies, to a chic, leafy community perched on the western hills overlooking Barcelona, determined to create the best possible life for their young children.\n",

    "body": "\n\tYouTube went down on Tuesday night, with more than 300,000 users experiencing technical difficulties, according to DownDetector. Problems for the digital video platform began around 5 p.m. PT, and some users saw services partially restored as early as about 6:00 p.m. PT. \n\n\t“If you’re having trouble accessing YouTube right now, you’re not alone — our teams are looking into this and will follow up here with updates,” read a post from the TeamYouTube X account, which linked to the website’s support page. \n\t\n\n\tApproximately 25 minutes later, TeamYouTube posted the following update on X: “An issue with our recommendations system prevented videos from appearing across surfaces on YouTube (including the homepage, the YouTube app, YouTube Music and YouTube Kids). The homepage is back, but we’re still working on a full fix – more coming soon!”\n\n\n\tUser complaints on DownDetector spiked at 5:21 p.m. PT and heavily tapered off by 6:06 p.m. PT. \n\n\tDuring the outage, users could still access videos through their subscriptions. However, the homepage and the suggestion bar in the video player were completely blank. The suggestion bar still seems to be down, but access to the homepage has been restored. \n\n\tThe problem occurred on both the mobile app and the desktop version of YouTube. Ads seemed unaffected by the outage when playing videos through subscription pages. \n\n\tIn online chatter about the outage, users from the United States, India, the U.K. and Argentina posted about service interruptions, suggesting the technical disruption was a global issue. \n\n\tGoogle had no further comment regarding the issue. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Abundantia Entertainment and AI video technology company InVideo have unveiled a strategic partnership to launch an AI-driven film production studio, backed by an investment of  INR100 crores ($11 million) — what the companies are calling the largest structured commitment to AI-driven filmmaking in India to date.\n\n\tThe deal was revealed at the India AI Film Festival, held at New Delhi’s Qutb Minar on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit 2026. The festival is hosted by InVideo and sponsored by Nvidia.\n\t\n\n\tUnder the partnership, the two companies will develop and produce a slate of five AI-driven films over the next three years, using the joint corpus to fund development and production. The collaboration will operate through Abundantia’s artificial intelligence-focused division, aiON, which will harness InVideo’s generative video technology to rethink how films are conceptualized, developed and produced.\n\n\n\t“AI in film-making is now real,” said Vikram Malhotra, founder and CEO of Abundantia Entertainment. “Every major leap in cinema – from sound to color to digital – has expanded storytelling possibility. AI represents the next inflection point. With Abundantia aiON, we are building a future where AI strengthens and amplifies the filmmaker’s voice, not substitutes it. Our partnership with InVideo allows us to design a future-facing creative studio that blends human imagination, authorship and intelligence to create stories that are both emotionally resonant and technologically path-breaking.”\n\n\tSanket Shah, Founder and CEO of InVideo, framed the deal as an extension of the company’s democratization mission. “Partnering with a top-notch studio like Abundantia Entertainment enables us to extend this capability into the world of high-quality filmmaking by building tools and workflows that allow creators to move from idea to cinematic expression faster and more freely than ever before. This is about accelerating and enhancing creativity, not just automating it.”\n\t\n\n\tInVideo, which counts Tiger Global and Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Capital India) among its backers, claims a user base of over 50 million across 190-plus countries and has raised more than $50 million in venture funding. The company recently revealed a collaboration with Google Cloud to develop AI-powered filmmaking tools, including enterprise-grade production pipelines aimed at studios, broadcasters, ad agencies and large production houses.\n\n\tOn the Abundantia side, the partnership builds on the studio’s aiON division, which is already in development on two AI-driven features: “Chiranjeevi Hanuman,” produced in partnership with Collective Artists Network and set for a 2026 release, and “Jai Santoshi Mata: Sukh Sampatti Daata.”\n\n\tFounded in 2013 by Malhotra, a former COO of Viacom18 Motion Pictures, Abundantia has built a track record spanning theatrical and streaming fare, including “Baby,” “Airlift,” “Toilet – Ek Prem Katha,” “Shakuntala Devi,” “Sherni,” “Jalsa,” “Ram Setu” and “Sukhee,” as well as the Amazon original series “Breathe” and its successors. The studio’s most recent release is “Daldal,” a Prime Video crime drama series starring Bhumi Pednekar.\n\n\tThe alliance is currently in the process of assembling its slate in collaboration with filmmakers, writers and visual-tech artists and engineers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix threatened ByteDance with “immediate litigation” on Tuesday, joining three other studios that have condemned the company for enabling copyright infringement via its Seedance 2.0 AI service.\n\n\tNetflix sent a cease-and-desist letter demanding that the Chinese company remove its intellectual property from training datasets and establish guardrails to prevent further infringement.\n\n\n\t“Seedance acts as a high-speed piracy engine, generating mass quantities of unauthorized derivative works utilizing Netflix’s iconic characters, worlds, and scripted narratives,” wrote Mindy LeMoine, director of litigation. “Netflix will not stand by and watch ByteDance treat our valued IP as free, public domain clip art.”\n\t\n\n\tByteDance was given three days to respond. \n\n\n\tThe move followed similar steps by Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros., each of which accused the company of stealing its most valuable IP. Netflix accused ByteDance of enabling infringement of “Stranger Things,” “KPop Demon Hunters,” “Squid Game” and “Bridgerton.”\n\n\tIn the case of “Bridgerton,” the letter alleges that videos are circulating that show unauthorized depictions of costumes from Season 4 in a masquerade ball setting.\n\n\t“These outputs mirror specific, narratively important costumes like Sophie Baek’s ‘Lady in Silver’ gown,” LeMoine wrote. “ByteDance has even promoted this content using #Bridgerton tags via its own official social media channels, such as @BytePlusGlobal.”\n\n\tNetflix also cited videos that are circulating of the “Stranger Things” series finale, “which feature detailedreproductions of the iconic cast as well as the monsters from the series, including Demogorgons and the Mindflayer.”\n\t\n\n\tUsers have also created “unauthorized crossovers, such as inserting real-world figures like Elon Musk into the Squid Game environment,” the letter states. It also alleges that users have made video clips reproducing the visual style and character design of “KPop Demon Hunters,” including the lead character, Rumi.\n\n\tIn response to the furor, ByteDance said on Monday that it would impose additional guardrails to prevent unauthorized uses of copyrights and actors’ likenesses by Seedance users. Those assurances have not been enough for Warner Bros. or Netflix, both of which sent letters on Tuesday.\n\n\tThe Netflix letter was the first to explicitly threaten litigation. The letter also sought to preempt a “fair use” defense, arguing that “use of copyrighted works to create a competing commercial product, especially one that regurgitates the original, is not protected by fair use.”\n\n\tSeedance 2.0 appears to mark a significant advance over prior AI video generators, mixing video and audio relatively seamlessly using only a few prompts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDaniel Radcliffe recently joined ScreenRant for a video interview and urged press moving forward not to ask the new “Harry Potter” actors about the original cast. Dominic McLaughlin is taking over the lead role in HBO’s “Harry Potter” series reboot opposite Arabella Stanton as Hermione and Alastair Stout as Ron.\n\n\t“When these kids got cast, there is a whole thing around the internet being like, ‘We have to look after these kids!'” Radcliffe said. “If you really mean that, then one of the things you can do is don’t ask about us – me, Emma [Watson] and Rupert [Grint] – all the time. I would like not to be weird spectral phantoms in these children’s lives. Just let them get on [with it], it’s going to be a new, different thing. I’m sure Dominic is going to be better than me.”\n\t\n\n\tRadcliffe revealed on “Good Morning America” last year that he wrote a letter to McLaughlin after the newcomer was announced as HBO’s Boy Who Lived. The young actor later said it was “insane” to receive Radcliffe’s support and “I was going mad.” \n\n\n\t“I wrote to Dominic and sent him a letter and he sent me a very sweet note back,” Radcliffe said. “I don’t want to be a specter in the life of these children but I just wanted to write to him to say, ‘I hope you have the best time, and an even better time than I did — I had a great time, but I hope you have an even better time.’ And I do, I just see these pictures of him and the other kids and I just want to hug them. They just seem so young. I just look at them and say, ‘Oh, it’s crazy I was doing that at that age.’ But it’s also incredibly sweet and I hope they’re having a great time.”\n\t\n\n\tRupert Grint similarly wrote a letter to Alastair Stout as the young actor takes over the role of Ron Weasley. As Grint told the BBC last year: “I wrote him a letter before they started, passing the baton as it were. It was really just wishing him all the best with it. I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience… It’s quite strange to have the cycle happening again. I’m really intrigued what it’s going to be like.”\n\n\tWhile Radcliffe’s “Harry Potter” experience is near and dear to his heart, he told ScreenRant that he’s only ever watched his own “Potter” movies once or twice. He quipped that he’s actually excited to show his children HBO’s reboot instead. \n\n\t“I’ll probably show my kid that so he doesn’t have to watch me,” Radcliffe said. “I think that will be more fun. I would probably enjoy it more… I hate watching myself, generally. I would like to watch the earlier films more because I’m so much further away from them. When I was 18 or 10, I was embarrassed by my 10 or 11 year old self.”\n\n\tWatch Radcliffe’s full interview with ScreenRant in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. has joined a parade of studios in blasting ByteDance for “blatant infringement” on its new AI video service, accusing the Chinese company of facilitating user-generated knockoffs of its iconic characters.\n\n\tThe studio’s legal counsel fired off a letter on Tuesday to John Rogovin, the general counsel of ByteDance who happens to have previously worked as general counsel at Warner Bros. The letter takes note of Rogovin’s prior service in defense of the copyrights of Superman and Batman.\n\t\n\n\t“These characters are the lifeblood of the company,” wrote Wayne Smith, the executive VP of legal at Warner Bros. Studios. “ByteDance is now engaged in blatant infringement of the very same properties you spent many years protecting.”\n\n\n\tWarner Bros. demanded that ByteDance cease training on its characters and implement guardrails to prevent further infringement.\n\n\tByteDance, the owner of TikTok, released Seedance 2.0 last week, announcing it represents a “substantial leap in generation quality” over the prior versions. Within days, social media sites were flooded with cinematic-looking clips of Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, Batman fighting Spider-Man, Superman fighting Thanos, and other permutations.\n\n\tUsers also posted “alternate endings” to films and TV shows, including one of the HBO series “Game of Thrones.”\n\n\tThe Motion Picture Association and SAG-AFTRA quickly denounced the new platform, while Disney and Paramount sent cease and desist letters last week. On Monday, ByteDance pledged to implement additional safeguards “as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users.”\n\t\n\n\tThat promise did not satisfy Warner Bros., which said in its letter that the focus on users is misplaced.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“[T]he users are not the ones at the root cause of the infringement,” Smith wrote. “They are merely building on the foundation of infringement already laid by ByteDance as Seedance comes pre-loaded with Warner Bros. Discovery’s copyrighted characters. That was a deliberate design choice by ByteDance.”\n\n\tThe letter cites posts on X, formerly Twitter, that include Seedance videos of characters from “The Matrix,” “The Lord of the Rings,” “Harry Potter,” “Rick and Morty,” and “Game of Thrones.” It also cites fight scenes involving Batman, Catwoman, and Superman.\n\n\tWarner Bros. acknowledges that ByteDance appears to be taking steps to block text prompts involving its characters.\n\n\t“While this is a promising indication that we may resolve this dispute business to business, it nonetheless begs the question why guardrails that can so quickly and easily be implemented were not present upon Seedance’s release,” the letter states.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn Tuesday night’s broadcast of “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert slammed his home network, CBS, for releasing a statement denying it pulled his interview with Rep. James Talarico off Monday night’s broadcast, a move he says was done without his knowledge.\n\n\t“Without ever talking to me, the corporation put out this press release,” Colbert said, presenting the statement to the audience on a sheet of paper. “This statement, it’s a surprisingly small piece of paper considering how many butts it’s trying to cover.”\n\t\n\n\tColbert then read the statement, released Tuesday by CBS, in full: “‘The Late Show’ was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico. The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. ‘The Late Show’ decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”\n\n\n\tHe went on to say that the statement read like it was “written by and, I’m guessing, for lawyers.” Colbert joked that since CBS’ legal team seems “intent” on telling him how to do his job, he would return the favor. \n\n\t“Fellas, I am well aware that we can book other guests,” Colbert said. “I didn’t need to be presented with that option. I’ve had Jasmine Crockett on my show twice. I could prove that to you, but the network won’t let me show you her picture without including her opponents. So I guess I’ll just have to show you this picture of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein instead.”\n\t\n\n\tColbert explained that “every word” of Sunday night’s script was approved by CBS’ lawyers before the interview with Rep. Talarico was abruptly shut down. Colbert also claimed he received even more notes from the legal team during the commercial break about how he can and can’t talk about the pulled interview, something that has “never happened before” in the 11 seasons of “The Late Show.”\n\n\t“So I don’t know what this is about. For the record, I’m not even mad. I really don’t want an adversarial relationship with the network,” Colbert concluded. “As I said last night, in my interview with James Talarico — check it out, it’s on YouTube, it’s pretty good — I said to him I’m grateful to have worked at CBS for the last 11 years and worked with George [Cheeks] and David [Stapf] and Amy [Reisenbach] and everyone at the network, the Sheldons of every age, the Matlocks of every sex. I’m just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies.”\n\n\tColbert on Monday night revealed that lawyers for CBS called “The Late Show” staff and told them, “in no uncertain terms,” the interview with Rep. Talarico was not to be aired in compliance with the FCC’s “equal time” rule. The “equal time” rule states that broadcast networks must provide equal airtime to politicians from both sides of the aisle during election season. However, according to Colbert, there has “long been an exception to this rule” for talk shows like “The Late Show.”\n\n\tAlthough FCC Chair Brendan Carr has yet to eliminate the exception, Colbert pointed out that CBS is “unilaterally enforcing it as if he had.” In jest of the network’s own language as to why it canceled “The Late Show,” Colbert said the decision to shoot down the interview with Rep. Talarico was “for purely financial reasons.”\n\n\tColbert went on to give his own interpretation of what happened, “Let’s just call this what it is. Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV. He’s like a toddler with too much screen time. He gets cranky and then drops a load in his diapers. So it’s no surprise that two of the people most affected by this threat are me and my friend Jimmy Kimmel.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJane Shattuck-Takamoto-Baer, whose long career in animation included working on films including “Sleeping Beauty” and “Who Framed Roger Rabbit,” died Monday at her home in Van Nuys, Calif.. She was 91.  \n\n\tThe longtime animator, producer and industry pioneer first got her start in 1955 as an assistant animator on Walt Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty,” where she worked alongside Walt Disney Animation’s legendary “Nine Old Men.” She continued as an animator at Ed Graham Animation before joining Pantomime Studios in their layout department where she worked on “Skyhawks” and “Speed Racer.” Shattuck-Takamoto-Baer then moved to Filmation Studios, where she worked on “Aquaman” and “Journey to the Center of the Earth.” She returned to Disney in 1975, working for the legendary animator Milt Kahl on “The Fox & The Hound,” “Mickey’s Christmas Carol” and “The Black Cauldron,” and as an assistant animator on Medusa. \n\t\n\n\tIn 1984, Shattuck-Takamoto-Baer and her then-husband, Dale Baer, started Baer Animation, their own animation company, which would go on to become one of the most successful independent animation houses in Hollywood. Together, they created the entire Toontown sequence for “Who Framed Roger Rabbit.” The company covered every face of animation production, including digital ink & paint, compositing, recording and effects. Shattuck-Takamoto-Baer also expanded these services to include a camera team that shot major portions of “The Little Mermaid,” “The Prince and the Pauper,” “Rover Dangerfield,” “FernGully: The Last Rain Forest,” “The Swan Princess” and a variety of projects for Warner Brothers Animation and Hanna-Barbera Studios. She successfully ran Baer Animation until her retirement in the early 2000s.\n\t\n\n\tShattuck-Takamoto-Baer also worked on a number of commercials, including Coca Cola’s “Disney Christmas,” Pamper’s “Disney Babies,” Charmin’s “Princess” and Snapper Lawn Mower’s “Lawn Toy” amongst many others. She received many awards for her work, including a Gold Award for Best Animation at the Houston International Film Festival for “Princess” and a Clio Award for Best Animation for “Disney Babies.” \n\n\tGrowing up in Winnipeg, Canada, Shattuck-Takamoto-Baer’s artistic talents were evident from an early age. She followed in her father’s path (also an illustrator) and trained at the Art Center in Pasadena. She was a founding member of Women in Animation and later served on its Advisory Board. She was also a longtime member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, The Animation Guild and Women in Film. \n\n\tShattuck-Takamoto-Baer is survived by her son Michael and his partner Beth and her brother and his family.\n\n\tDonations may be made in Shattuck-Takamoto-Baer’s name to the Best Friends Pet Adoption Center in Los Angeles.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA film of deceptive simplicity, Jason Osder and William Lafi Youmans’s investigative documentary “Who Killed Alex Odeh?” often struggles against its own straightforward style, but in the process, embodies the helplessness of its grieving subjects. Its focus is the 1985 assassination of a Palestinian activist in California, the specifics of which it lays out through archival footage. However, contemporary interviews and investigations turn up surprising answers about who was responsible — not because their identities are unknown, but because the specifics have been in plain sight for decades.\n\t\n\n\tThe film’s very premise presents a challenge, especially in the age of the true crime documentary. The suspects who bombed the office of Alex Odeh have long been identified by the FBI, and while one was imprisoned for unrelated crimes, the other two have been living comfortably in Israel for many years. In the film, this is treated halfway between a major reveal and an inevitability — it’s hard to be quite sure of the intent — but what’s surprising isn’t these known facts about the alleged terrorists, but rather, the ease with which Israeli investigative journalist David Sheen follows up on these leads, which the authorities consider cold.\n\n\n\tUsing both old and contemporary footage, the movie captures — often plainly — the perspectives of Odeh’s widow and his daughter, in the form of sit-down interviews that help catch us up on various details. These talking-head segments seldom probe further than the surface of the subjects’ grief; such a thing might theoretically be invasive, but this is the nature of the filmmakers’ chosen topic. “Who Killed Alex Odeh?” is, or ought to be, as much about the question posed by its title as the secondary, implied question underneath: “Who was Alex Odeh?” This query is largely left up to news clips, from ‘80s and ‘90s, of people discussing him in death — both supporters and detractors alike. This gradually pivots the narrative toward the possible culprits in the form of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), an organization in Europe and North America branded a right-wing terrorist group by the FBI. However, who Odeh was outside these parameters of this death is given only glancing attention, making it hard to fathom who and what was lost.\n\t\n\n\tThe investigation itself takes curious turns, with surprises that are less about the facts themselves and more about the ease with which necessary information can be found online — a simplicity of access that ends up applicable to alleged perpetrators too. Reporters including Sheen can be seen concocting covert plots to meet with them face to face, the success or failure of which briefly becomes an intense point of interest. As the directors paint a portrait of the JDL and its founder Meir Kahane, the film becomes undoubtedly informative, with enough by way of violent statements made against Arabs, accompanied by spooky music, to really hammer home how scary these forces are.\n\n\tHowever, what goes unsaid even amidst the most surprising parts of the reporters’ quest — including discoveries the camera captures in real time, about why the case was unceremoniously dropped — is the “why” of it all. The film can’t help but leave lingering questions about its bigger picture, i.e. the entwinement of American and Israeli politics, which still continues to influence why a case like Odeh’s might go unsolved or un-prosecuted. In its laser focus on Odeh’s death, it leaves out not only much of his life, but the more chilling global ripple effects of why this subject is of such vital importance today.\n\n\tOn one hand, a wider political purview is something each audience member ought to bring into a film themselves. On the other, “Who Killed Alex Odeh?” is left occasionally languishing in an awkward middle ground between probing the universality of this story and leaving it to the imagination. All in all, however, the movie’s straightforward aesthetic approach ends up jostled by the very nature of the story at hand, where it turns out, some 30-odd minutes into its runtime, that its most major twist is the fact that it lacks one altogether. It makes for an especially intriguing oddity where the sheer lack of stylistic flourish — for better or worse — feels rooted in an anti-mystery, where the dearth of available options for justice ends up paralyzing and defeating. By the end, its lack of catharsis is the point.\n",

TMZ has learned the actor hit up a local pub for his first meal right after court in Louisiana.\n      \n    \n          Sources tell TMZ ... Shia showed up at The Jimani in New Orleans roughly 50 minutes after his 3 PM court appearance, making the sports bar-style spot his first stop post-hearing. We're told he kept it simple ... chowing down on a burger and fries while throwing back a glass of ice-cold water.\n      \n    \n          Ironically, the pub is known for its \"Hang Ova Burger\" -- though we're not told whether that specific burger is what landed on Shia's plate.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Folks at the pub struck up a conversation with Shia, but interestingly enough, we're told he didn't say a word about his arrest in the French Quarter Monday night. Instead, the convo took a surprisingly wholesome turn. A recently engaged couple in the group chatted with him about marriage, and we're told Shia congratulated them and shared that marriage is a beautiful thing, but something you have to work at every day.\n      \n    \n          The group also talked Olympics with Shia before snapping a selfie together. After wrapping up his meal, Shia went on his way.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we first reported ... Shia was arrested Monday night in the French Quarter after allegedly punching a bar employee, sparking a brawl before cops arrived. He was later charged with two counts of simple battery.\n      \n    \n          The arrest comes months after his split from Mia Goth. We broke the story ... following the breakup, Shia relocated from Los Angeles to New Orleans in December, purchasing a 3-bedroom, 3.5-bath Uptown cottage for just over $1 million.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Shia LaBeouf\n              \n                          \n                Mia Goth\n              \n                          \n                Food & Travel\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tPeacock is back with a new streaming deal, just in time for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina.\n\n\tThe NBCUniversal streaming service is the official streamer for this year’s Olympic Winter Games, not to mention the streaming home to Sunday’s Super Bowl LX game. Now, sports fans can get in on all the action with a couple of deals that discount the price of a monthly Peacock membership.\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat Are the Best Peacock Streaming Deals 2026?\t\n\n\tA subscription to Peacock normally starts at $10.99/month for the Peacock Premium plan, which gets you access to live sports and events, plus thousands of hours of on-demand TV shows, movies and specials. But the streamer is offering an annual plan discount right now that gets you 12 months of access for the price of ten.\n\n\n\tThe total price is $109 and locks in access for an entire year. That saves you 17% versus paying for Peacock month to month. The limited-time offer is available to all new and eligible returning subscribers and there is no promo code needed.\n\n\tPeacock has priced its annual subscription down to as low as $79.99 a year in the past but with the streamer being home to the Olympics and Super Bowl, it’s unlikely we’ll see a further discount from the current promotion live online.\n\n\tAnother way to score a Peacock discount online is by bundling the streamer with Apple TV (formerly Apple TV+). The Apple TV and Peacock Premium bundle costs just $14.99/month — a savings of 40% versus paying for each streamer separately.\n\n\tPeacock is also home to hundreds of new movies such as “Bugonia,” “F1” and “Black Phone 2” plus fan-favorite shows like “Pluribus,” “New Girl,” Bel-Air,” “The Office” and the Bravo universe franchises.\n\n\n\tPeacock is also a top-choice streamer for sports fans, who can live stream live sports like the NFL, Premier League, Big Ten Football, and WWE. \n\t\n\t\tDoes Peacock Have a Free Trial?\t\n\n\tWhile Peacock doesn’t currently offer a free trial, you can get Peacock for free with a Walmart+ membership. Walmart+ costs $98/year and as part of your membership, members can choose between Peacock Premium or Paramount+ Essential at no added cost.\n\n\tThat’s in addition to perks like free shipping, free grocery delivery, special discounts, gas savings and more. Sign up for Walmart+ here (you can also test-drive the service with a 30-day free trial here).\n\n\tYou can also stream Peacock online for free with Instacart+. The grocery delivery service offers an upgraded tier that gets members free grocery delivery, free restaurant delivery and an annual membership to Peacock for free. Instacart+ costs just $9.99/month or $99/year. Try it out with a 14-day free trial here.\n\n\tThis year’s Winter Olympics air from Feb. 6 to 22 live from Milan, Italy.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Group raised its outlook for the current fiscal year ending in March, as the Tokyo-based tech and entertainment company beat expectations with a 22% increase in operating income for the September-December 2025 quarter.\n\n\tFor the three months ended Dec. 31, its third quarter of fiscal 2025, Sony reported total sales of JPY3.713 trillion ($24.1 billion), up a slight 1%, as operating income came in at JPY515.0 billion ($3.3 billion), up 22%. One reason for the higher income was a JPY43.9 billion in realized gains on land transferred by Sony Group to Sony Life Insurance Co. in connection with the latter’s spin-off in the quarter. Net income rose 11% to JPY377.3 billion ($2.5 billion).\n\t\n\n\tThe company raised its forecast for full-year fiscal 2025 operating profit to rise to JPY1.54 trillion, up 8% from its previous guidance, and upped its annual revenue projection by 3% to JPY12.3 trillion. Sony maintained its estimated losses from U.S. tariffs at JPY50 billion.\n\n\n\tFor the December 2025 quarter, Sony Pictures Entertainment posted revenue of JPY353.3 billion ($2.32 billion), down 11%, and operating income was JPY30.9 billion ($197 million), a decrease of 9%. The company said the drop was because the year-earlier period benefited from the contribution of the blockbuster film “Venom: The Last Dance” and licensing revenue from other theatrically released films.\n\n\tRevenue in Sony’s music segment was JPY542.4 billion ($3.5 billion), up 13%, and operating income was JPY106.4 billion ($690 million), an increase of 9%. The company said streaming revenue year-on-year growth rates on a U.S. dollar basis were +5% for recorded music and +13% for music publishing. The music segment comprises Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Music Publishing and Sony Music Entertainment (Japan).\n\t\n\n\tSony’s PlayStation games and network services segment saw revenue of JPY1.613 trillion ($10.5 billion), down 4% compared with the year-earlier quarter. The segment’s operating income rose 19% to JPY140.8 billion ($91 million), which the company attributed to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, increase in sales from networks services and higher sales of first-party games titles. Gaming user engagement trended well in the period, with monthly active users in December 2025 reaching a record 132 million accounts and total gameplay hours increasing year-on-year.\n\n\tThe company’s Entertainment, Technology & Services Segment (ET&S Segment) saw revenue fall 7% in the December quarter, to JPY658.1 billion ($4.3 billion), driven by a decrease in unit sales of displays. Segment operating income dropped 23% to JPY59.4 billion ($39 million).\n\n\tSony’s Imaging & Sensing Solutions Segment sales increased 21% to JPY604.3 billion ($3.9 billion) on higher sales of image sensors for mobile products, and operating income kicked up 35% to JPY132.0 billion ($857 million).\n\n\tThe U.S. dollar figures are calculated based on an average rate of $1 to 154.0 yen.\n\n\tAs previously announced, Kenichiro Yoshida will retire as CEO of Sony Group as of April 1, and will become executive chairman. Current president Hiroki Totoki is assuming the role of of CEO.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFinneas took to Instagram Threads on Wednesday to defend his superstar sister and songwriting partner, Billie Eilish, from “very powerful old white men” who are “outraged” about her Grammys acceptance speech.\n\n\t“Seeing a lot of very powerful old white men outraged about what my 24-year-old sister said during her acceptance speech,” he wrote. “We can literally see your names in the Epstein files.”\n\n\n\tAfter her track “Wildflower” won song of the year at the 2026 Grammys, Eilish declared “fuck ICE” in her acceptance speech. Finneas joined Eilish on stage while she accepted the award.\n\t\n\n\t“I feel so honored every time I get to be in this room,” she said. “As grateful as I feel, I honestly don’t feel like I need to say anything but that no one is illegal on stolen land. And, yeah, it’s just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now, and I feel really hopeful in this room, and I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter, and fuck ICE. That’s all I’m going to say. Sorry. Thank you so much.”\n\n\tEilish was among the many artists to use their Grammys platform to promote social and political reform. The most commanding example was Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, who said “ICE out” to resounding applause after winning best música urbana album with “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS.”\n\n\t“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans. Also, I will say to people, I know it’s tough to know not to hate on these days and I was thinking sometimes, we get contaminados [contaminated], I don’t know how to say that in English. The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. We don’t hate them. We love our people. We love our family, and that’s the way to do it. With love. Don’t forget that please. Thank you.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tHuman performance company WHOOP was a hot topic at this year’s Australian Open after umpires asked star tennis players Carlos Alcaraz, Aryna Sabalenka and Jannik Sinner to remove their WHOOP bands, stating that they are not currently approved for use in the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. \n\n\tShortly after the incident, the brand released an ad with the copy “Always on for the biggest moments in sports. Well, almost always.” The support has come pouring in, and many people have expressed how unfair the rule is, particularly given that there is no advantage associated with wearing the health and fitness band during gameplay. Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum, WHOOP’s ability to meet the moment is reflective of its innovative and forward-thinking spirit.\n\n\n\tOf course there’s other big news for WHOOP this month too, as the brand has announced a creative partnership with acclaimed designer Samuel Ross MBE. Ross has also been named Global Creative Director for WHOOP x SR_A (the moniker of his award winning design studio) and he is set to lead a multi-year collaboration between the two brands titled “PROJECT TERRAIN.” The partnership represents the ongoing evolution of WHOOP as it shapes the future of personal health at the intersection of performance fashion and cultural design.\n\n\tThe first performance design collaboration under Ross’ direction for ‘PROJECT TERRAIN’ will be a bespoke capsule collection set to feature limited-edition, customized WHOOP bands. The range will also include new apparel pieces within the WHOOP Body collection, which features technical garments that enable wearing WHOOP beyond the wrist. All products will arrive in limited edition drops later this year and into 2028.\n\n\n\t“At WHOOP, we’ve always believed that wearable technology needs to be invisible or it needs to be cool,” says Will Ahmed, Founder and CEO of WHOOP. “Working with Samuel Ross has been a true joy. He deeply understands wearable technology. Our members will feel something new and different when they wear this limited collection.”\n\n\tRoss, who says he has worn WHOOP for more than five years, formed an immediate connection to the brand’s design, culture and technology. Under his design studio, SR_A, his work spans products for several brands, including Nike, Converse, Oakley, LVMH via Hublot, Acqua di Parma and Beats. He has consistently reimagined how culture, material science and form influence one another, and his transition into performance innovation with the brand represents the natural progression of an industrial designer whose work centers on precision, human movement and the evolution of contemporary aesthetics.\n\n\t“WHOOP is shaping the future,” says Ross. “That’s true progress, for all. It is one of the first design and technology companies of our generation, founded within our generation, by our generation, that is defining the right relationship to health, through advanced technology. I look forward to building the future with Will and the WHOOP design teams. We have a clear, sharp vision to move global design expectations forward.”\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWHOOP Origins Pack\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWHOOP’s current lifestyle offerings include this Origins Pack, which feature a hoodie, SuperKnit band and a graphic tee. Choose from multiple sizes and colorways online.\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tAs part of this collaboration, SR_A will join as an investor, alongside investor-partners including One Direction singer Niall Horan and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. WHOOP will also contribute to the SR_A Black British Artist Grant and host its selected recipient for an in-house design residency, enabling emerging talent to collaborate directly with WHOOP creative teams.\n\n\tThe first limited edition WHOOP x SR_A capsule will be available globally in the coming months at shop.whoop.com.\n",

The prayers of our Nation are with her and her family. GOD BLESS AND PROTECT NANCY! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump previously told reporters that he would provide more resources to the Guthrie family if needed. This new announcement represents an urgent and more explicit delivery of that promise.\n\n\n\tNancy Guthrie went missing in Tucson, Ariz. over the weekend, and on Monday, the Pima County Sheriff’s Office announced that her disappearance was being treated like a crime. Authorities said they found “very concerning” evidence at her house.\n\n\t“I believe she was abducted, yes,” Sheriff Chris Nanos told CBS News. “She didn’t walk from there. She didn’t go willingly.”\n\n\tOn Wednesday evening, Savannah Guthrie posted an emotional video to her Instagram, in which she and her two siblings, Annie and Camron, shared a message to their mother’s kidnapper.\n\n\t“She’s 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, and she needs it not to suffer,” Savannah Guthrie said. “We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos will return to “Chicago P.D.” for the upcoming three-part crossover with “Chicago Fire” and “Chicago Med,” set to air on March 4 on NBC.\n\n\tPer an official description, Spiridakos’ character Hailey Upton “returns to her former stomping grounds, but this time on the federal level as a Special Agent of the FBI. She joins her former P.D. allies after a drug enforcement task force case out of her Detroit field office leads her back to Chicago.” Jay Halstead  (Soffer) has “been deep undercover, leading him on a path to the same case that Upton is investigating.”\n\t\n\n\tSoffer last appeared in an October 2022 episode, exiting three episodes into Season 10 as his character decided to join an Army group to bring down the Cartel in Bolivia. Spiridakos, for her part, last appeared in May 2024, exiting at the end of Season 11. Hailey — who was married to Halstead before he moved away — decided to start over and chose to leave Chicago.\n\n\n\tAt the time of their respective exits, both expressed that they’d love to pop back in — something pretty common in the One Chicago universe. Soffer has been back to direct, but this will be both of their first times back on screen in the roles.\n\n\t“I like to think — and I hope the fans think this too — that he’s just in another country right now, doing what he does best and making the world a safer place. In a family, sometimes somebody moves away or goes to college somewhere else,” Soffer previously told Variety about keeping the door open to returning. “I still love it. I still love the fans. And I still love Halstead. Halstead’s always going to be in my blood. That’s never going to change.” \n\t\n\n\tPer the logline for the crossover event, “Firehouse 51 is called to an airfield when a passenger jet suddenly goes silent mid-air, triggering a high-stakes emergency. Their discovery cracks open a bigger and deadlier mystery — one with consequences that could ripple far beyond the runway and put countless lives in jeopardy.”\n\n\tThe night will switch up the usual order of shows, beginning with “Chicago Fire” at 8 p.m. followed by “Chicago Med” at 9 p.m. and “Chicago P.D.” at 10 p.m.\n\n\tUniversal Television produces One Chicago in association with Wolf Entertainment. “Chicago P.D.” is executive produced by Dick Wolf, Peter Jankowski, Gwen Sigan, Chad Saxton, Gavin Harris and Jason Beghe.\n\n\tWatch the promo below:\n\n\n\n",

In December, days after Netflix and WBD sealed an $83 billion merger agreement, Trump told reporters “I’ll be involved in that decision.”\n\t\n\n\tBut this week, Trump told Llamas that he’s changed his mind, even though he’s been contacted by “both sides” in the transaction.\n\n\n\t“I haven’t been involved,” Trump told the “NBC Nightly News” anchor in a clip aired by NBC News as a preview for the full sit-down set to run before the big game on Sunday. The pre-Super Bowl presidential interview with an anchor from the host network has been a tradition on the NFL’s big day since President George W. Bush first did so in 2004.\n\n\t“I must say, I guess I’m considered to be a very strong president. I’ve been called by both sides. It’s the two sides, but I’ve decided I shouldn’t be involved. The Justice Department will handle it,” Trump said, per an NBC News transcript.\n\n\tTrump acknowledged that Netflix’s proposed deal to acquire Warner Bros. is complex and the antitrust concerns about its long-term impact on the streaming TV marketplace are significant. He also nodded to the ongoing skirmish between Netflix and Paramount Skydance as the latter keeps up its campaign to snare WBD away from Netflix.\n\t\n\n\t“There’s a theory that one of the companies is too big and it shouldn’t be allowed to do it, and the other company is saying something else,” he said. “They’re beating the hell out of each other — and there’ll be a winner.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSavannah Guthrie posted an emotional video to her Instagram on Wednesday evening in which she and her two siblings, Annie and Camron, addressed the kidnapper of her 84-year-old mother.\n\n\t“She’s 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, and she needs it not to suffer,” Guthrie said. “We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.”\n\t\n\n\tEarlier in the video, Annie, Guthrie’s sister, called their mother the “beacon” of their lives and begged for her to come home. \n\n\n\t“We are always going to be merely human, just normal human people who need our mom,” she said. “Mama, Mama, if you’re listening, we need you to come home. We miss you.”\n\n\tGuthrie concluded the video by directly speaking to her mother.\n\n\t“Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman,” Guthrie said. “You are God’s precious daughter, Nancy. We believe and know that even in this valley, He is with you. Everyone is looking for you, Mommy, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again. We speak to you every moment, and we pray without ceasing, and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again. We love you, Mom.”\n\n\tNancy Guthrie went missing near Tucson, Ariz. over the weekend and was last seen on the evening of Jan. 31 at her house in the Catalina Foothills. She was classified by police as a “missing vulnerable adult” because of her age.\n\t\n\n\tOn Monday, the Pima County Sheriff’s Office announced that Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance was being treated as a crime after finding “very concerning” evidence in her house. “I believe she was abducted, yes,” Sheriff Chris Nanos told CBS News. “She didn’t walk from there. She didn’t go willingly.”\n\n\tNanos said on Sunday night that Nancy had “no signs of cognitive issues” and is “very alert” and of “very sound mind.”\n\n\tSavannah Guthrie was not on air on “Today” Monday morning, but gave a statement to her co-hosts asking for the public’s help in locating her mother. She also took to Instagram later in the day to ask for prayers. \n\n\t“We believe in prayer. We believe in voices raised in unison, in love, in hope. We believe in goodness. We believe in humanity. Above all, we believe in Him,” she wrote in the caption of her post. “Thank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy, a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant. Raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment. We need you.”\n\n\tOn Tuesday night, TMZ reported that it had received an alleged ransom note “demanding payment for the release of Nancy Guthrie” in Bitcoin. The Pima County Sheriff’s Office said in response: “We are aware of reports circulating about possible ransom note(s) regarding the investigation into Nancy Guthrie. We are taking all tips and leads very seriously. Anything that comes in, goes directly to our detectives who are coordinating with the FBI.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 14, Episode 5 of “The Masked Singer,” “Red, White and Clue,” which aired Feb. 4 on Fox.\n\n\tFor Teddi Mellencamp, appearing on “The Masked Singer” “got me out of a pretty dark place, and I am forever grateful.” Mellencamp ended her run as Calla Lily, after performing “Jack and Diane,” the No. 1 hit made famous by her father (back when he was still performing as John Cougar). She had previously performed “Fight Song,” by Rachel Platten.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the panelists, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg got it right with Teddi Mellencamp. Ken Jeong thought it was Christina Applegate, Rita Ora guessed Selma Blair, and Robin Thicke went with Danielle Fishel.\n\n\n\t“I’m not a singer by trade, clearly, and so that part was challenging for me,” Mellencamp said. “Also, a big part of my memory has been askew since my brain surgery. So I was a little bit nervous, but I was excited to push myself out of my comfort zone and try something new, and it felt like it gave me a little bit of life.”\n\n\tMellencamp said she decided to appear on “The Masked Singer” because she watches it with her children, who immediately identified her after her first performance this season. She had also informed her father, whom she asked singing advice.\n\n\t“He’s like, ‘just sing loud and proud. And you know, if you sing something off key, it doesn’t matter.’” Had she continued on the show, Mellencamp was hoping to perform “Before He Cheats,’ by Carrie Underwood.\n\n\tMellencamp has recently made headlines for battling Stage 4 cancer — particularly when her father, John Mellencamp, told podcast host Joe Rogan that his daughter “is really sick” and “suffering right now.”\n\t\n\n\tOn another podcast, Teddi Mellencamp said she’s in immunotherapy and still considered Stage 4, although there’s currently no trace of cancer. And she seemed in good spirits Wednesday as she discussed being the latest notable to be revealed on “The Masked Singer’s” “Red, White and Clue Night.”\n\n\tIn an earlier clue package on the show, Mellencamp — as Calla Lily — alluded to her health: “I was recently reminded how precious it all is. The doctors didn’t catch it at first, but I knew something was wrong. I pushed back and needed answers. When they told me the diagnosis, my world stopped. But then I thought about my children. I chose to face my fears and fight. And it seems to be working. I still have good days and bad ones. But when this opportunity popped up, I jumped at it. I’m nervous but I’m present.”\n\n\tHigh Voltage, Owl, Pangolin and Eggplant join Galaxy Girl, Stingray, Cat Witch, Pugcasso, Snow Cone and Crane in moving on to the next round.\n\n\tTeddi Mellencamp (Calla Lily) joins Claudia Oshry (Queen Corgi), Taraji P. Henson (Scarab), Tone Loc (Handyman), Tiffany Haddish (Le Who Who), Todd and Julie Chrisley (Croissants) and David “Big Papi” Ortiz (Googly Eyes) as the celebrities unmasked so far on “The Masked Singer” Season 14.\n\n\tBack for Season 14 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists McCarthy Wahlberg, Jeong, Ora and Thicke. Thicke opened this episode by singing James Brown’s “Living in America.”\n\n\tNew this season is “America’s Insider,” in which singer, dancer and social media personality Kylie Cantrall will share behind-the-scenes hints and clues for viewers. The twist: Cantrall is in costume as Cat Witch, but will only unmask for viewers — so the audience knows who she is, but the panelists don’t.\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” Season 14 themed episodes include a tribute to “Star Trek,” the ‘90s comedy “Clueless,” the comic franchise “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and the blockbuster “Twilight Saga” films. Also Fox’s new “Fear Factor” reboot will feature host Johnny Knoxville in a “Fear Factor: House of Fear Night,” and an “Ozzfest Night” honors late rocker Ozzy Osbourne, including a special tribute by “Masked Singer” alum Kelly Osbourne (Season 2’s Ladybug) saluting her father’s musical influence.\n\t\n\n\tThe 18 Masked contestants in Season 14 include Eggplant, Pugcasso, Queen Corgi, the Croissants, Owl, 14 Karat Carrot, Snow Cone, Galaxy Girl, High Voltage, Googly Eyes, Scarab, Handyman, Crane, Le Who Who, Pangolin, Stingray, Cat Witch and Calla Lily.\n\n\tPer the show, the Season 14 contestants have sold a combined 94 million records, received 47 Teen Choice Award nominations, 12 Emmy nominations, two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one Tony Award win and one Academy Award nomination.\n\n\tHere were the performances on Wednesday’s episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNick Cannon and High Voltage, “The Masked Singer.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHigh Voltage\t\n\n\tSong: “Miles On It,” Kane Brown and Marshmello\n\n\tPrevious song: “Everybody Wants to Rule the World,” by Tears for Fears\n\n\tClue: Guitar. “I’ve had this by my side since I was 13. It reminds me the greatest comes from finding your rhythm and sticking with it.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Jimmy Fallon, Conan O’Brien, John Stamos\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Conan O’Brien, Julian Edelman\n\n\tHigh Voltage voiceover: “You know what makes America so special? Me. Just kidding. It’s the American dream. My dad immigrated to America with a passion for science. He met my mom, a poet, and the rest is history. Growing up, I lived the full American experience. Slurpees in the summer, Van Halen on repeat, MTV on full blast. And then boom, we’re in the back yard spit roasting a goat. America is called the melting pot for a reason. Who could have guessed, I’d go on to become an American icon. I suppose that’s my version of the American dream. Family, friends, culture coming together and a whole lot of goat.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCalla Lily, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSong: “Jack and Diane,” by John Mellencamp\n\n\tPrevious song: “Fight Song,” by Rachel Platten\n\n\tClue: Diamond key. “This has unlocked countless doors for me and reminds me to step boldly into what comes next.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Danielle Fishel, Selma Blair, Teddi Mellencamp\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Selma Blair, Christina Applegate\n\n\tCalla Lily voiceover: “I can’t celebrate America and not mention an American legend. He’s an icon, but to me, he’s so much more. His main focus was to make my life normal. But man, he was strict. Once, he even grounded me for being late to dinner. At the table, in front of Madonna and Sean Penn. Talk about a mortifying way to find a life lesson. For a while, I resented him for not making my life easy. And there were years that we were distant. When I stopped asking him for his handouts and instead asked him for his wisdom, our relationship flourished. Now, I’m thankful for all he’s done for me. It made me tough, strong and always on time for dinner.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOwl, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOwl\t\n\n\tSong: “Ain’t No Sunshine,” by Bill Withers\n\n\tPrevious song: “Wild Thing,” by the Troggs\n\n\tClue: Super bowl. “I was super-excited when I got to play a part in one of America’s biggest events. Millions of eyes glued to my every move.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Matthew McConaughey, Kurt Russell, Jeff Daniels\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Matthew McConaughey, Billy Bob Thornton\n\n\tOwl voiceover: “I love America’s favorite pastime as much as anyone. But I’m no pro.  Back in the day, I was a scrappy, right-handed slugger. Then one day, my heart was telling me something. This was not my path. So I turned in my glove. I knew there were other fields for me to play in. And guess what? I soared to success. Now that’s a lesson I try to teach my kids. Follow your heart and no matter the field, you’ll always hit a grand slam.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEggplant, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEggplant\t\n\n\tSong: “American Woman,” by Lenny Kravitz\n\n\tPrevious song: “Rocket Man,” by Elton John\n\n\tClue: Hot sauce. “Some say my career has been hot, hot, hot. And I think this bottle says it best.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Billy Joel, Daryl Hall, Kenny Loggins\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Martin Short, Nathan Lane\n\n\tEggplant voiceover: “Life comes at you fast. Especially in the land of opportunity. Like the time I crashed the most iconic event in pop history: The recording of ‘We Are the World.’ I got the private invite from Quincy Jones. Suddenly, I’m hanging with 45 of the biggest legends in music. Now, I topped the charts myself, but I was starstruck. Springsteen. Turner. Dylan. Then along comes MJ, and he tells me, ‘I loved your album. And your voice. Keep doing your thing.’ I was so inspired. And now here’s something I love more than America, an American woman.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPangolin, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWild Card: Pangolin\t\n\n\tSong: “Ironic,” by Alanis Morrisette\n\n\tClue: Winner. “My first big win was more than a dream come true. It was proof that passion and hard work can pay off.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Sara Bareilles, Christina Perri, Katy Perry\n\n\tPangolin voiceover: “Where I’m from is rich with American history. And we all speak the same language: Sports. My family was way into it. My dad would quiz me on Sunday’s starting lineup. And I’d always get it right. I was pretty obsessed. Fast forward to high school. I was at a game with my boyfriend, and after watching the half time show, I was struck, I wanted to do that. He laughed and told me it would never happened. I stared at him and said, I’m going to prove you so wrong. And I did. Right after I dumped him. I became the halftime queen. Turns out, my sports obsessed roots fueled my competitive fire. And to that silly high school boy who said I’d never make it, pretty ironic, don’t you think?.”\n\t\n\n\tPast “The Masked Singer” winners include T-Pain as Monster (Season 1), Wayne Brady as Fox (Season 2), Kandi Burruss as Night Angel (Season 3), LeAnn Rimes as Sun (Season 4), Nick Lachey as Piglet (Season 5), Jewel as Queen of Hearts (Season 6), Teyana Taylor as Firefly (Season 7), Amber Riley as Harp (Season 8), Bishop Briggs as Medusa (Season 9), Ne-Yo as Cow (Season 10), Vanessa Hudgens as Goldfish (Season 11), Boyz II Men as Buffalos (Season 12) and Gretchen Wilson as Pearl (Season 13).\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment. Rosie Seitchik, Craig Plestis and Cannon are executive producers, while Seitchik serves as showrunner. The series is based on the South Korean format created by Mun Hwa Broadcasting Corp.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe evening before Music’s Biggest Night, there is always Music’s Smallest but Mightiest Night. That could serve as one way to describe the Americana Music Association’s annual Grammy Eve concert at the famed Troubadour club in West Hollywood, which is a very different kind of destination from the concurrent “Clive party.” The Americana affair annually presents itself as a tribute to one of the great singer-songwriters of all time, with a cast of performers partly pulled from a list of artists who are up for Grammys the following night. Many music titans have been saluted over the nearly 20 years the AMA has been doing this (think John Prine, Paul Simon and Willie Nelson), and there remain countless possibilities of music heroes who could still be feted with one of these evenings (like: they still haven’t done Dylan).\n\t\n\n\tBut perhaps they don’t really need to get to anyone else. Because…\n\n\n\t“It’s gonna be Neil Young next year, too. Every year, moving forward,” promised Molly Jenson, the night’s emcee and house-band vocalist, taking stock of how the setlist was barely scratching the surface of the honoree’s song portfolio. \n\n\tShe didn’t mean it, but doing a second year of Neil for 2027’s event really wouldn’t be a bad idea: Shakey has been nothing if not steady in his prolific output over the last 60 years. At this year’s concert, the generous 21-song performance leaned more toward Young’s most familiar-to-every-household classics than obscurities; in other words, no Americana takes on “Trans,” say, at this event. But virtually every performance felt transformative enough, whether the interpretations took his time-honored material more into adjacently rootsy subgenres or stayed right within the Young wheelhouse. (Or the Neil-house.)\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMargo Price, Sarah Jarosz, Sierra Hull and Rhiannon Giddens backstage at the Americana Fest Pre-Grammy Salute: The Songs of Neil Young takes place at The Troubadour on January 31, 2026, in Los Angeles, California. (Erika Goldring Photo)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tErika Goldring\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAmong the participating performers who were nominated for Grammys this year were a murderer’s row of Recording Academy darlings: I’m With Her (who went on to walk away with two on Sunday), Jesse Welles, Margo Price, Rhiannon Giddens, Sierra Hull, Maggie Rose and Grace Potter. The cast expanded to include returnees who’ve been favorites at past such AmericanaFest salutes, including Milk Carton Kids and Chris Pierce, and notable first-timers like Young the Giant. This year’s concert, officially billed as the AmericanaFest Pre-Grammy Salute to the Songs of Neil Young, easily sold out despite the $200 price tag (being a benefit for both MusiCares and the AMA) and the availability of a name-your-own-price livestream. You had to be there; except, with the free stream, you didn’t; except you kind of still did.\n\n\tGiddens made an early and glorious appearance in the show, dropping in with fellow former Carolina Chocolate Drop Justin Robinson to deliver “Comes a Time” in the banjo-and-fiddle configuration that was featured on their Grammy-nommed collaborative album, “What Did the Blackbird Say to the Crow.” (Justin Harrington joined in as a third on handheld percussion, which came in handy when the tune finally erupted into a very un-Neil-like double-time rush.)\n\n\n\n\n\t“Comes a Time” probably wouldn’t be mistaken for any of the Black folk traditional tunes on the duo’s recent album, but it was making Giddens think about race anyway, or at least the general overall atmosphere was. The crowd broke into an “Ice Out” chant during her commentary, and Giddens pointed to her button bearing that demand. “We are here also,” she said, “to remind about the history of this country, and slave catchers by any other name…” By the time she was finished with the song, it was a wonder tall trees weren’t falling down.\n\n\tRace figured in as an even more unmistakable undertone in Chris Pierce’s supple and defiant rendering of “Southern Man,” which was, by acclamation, the most powerful number of the night. Unlike most of the other performers, Pierce has had this in his repertoire and been able to absorb it and make it his for a while, since he has done it in concert before and recorded a studio version for a 2025 tribute album, “Heart of Gold: The Songs of Neil Young.” Seeing him do it live is an edge-of-your-seat experience, as he takes what Young wrote about racism as an admonishing outsider and makes something rivetingly relevant and personal out of it. The audience might still be recovering; the year is young, but no one who saw Pierce tear down the Troubadour is likely to experience anything more memorable in 2026.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tJust about everyone else on the bill had to kind of settle for second-to-Pierce status when it came to sheer visceral impact, but that was still an exalted enough place to be.\n\n\tIf it ever comes down to a contest of who’s truly the MVPs at any AmericanaFest gathering, that would perennially come down to the men of the Milk Carton Kids and the women of I’m With Her. So it was a little like an Avengers meetup when that duo and trio joined forces near the end of the evening as a vocal quintet for an intricately arranged version of “Harvest Moon.” Earlier in the show, the Milk Carton Kids had done “Heart of Gold” on their own in their very quietest mode, going all sotto voce in their Everlys-go-to-Redwood take on one of Young’s most famously plaintive hits. I’m With Her did much the same with “Only Love Can Break Your Heart,” which was soothing enough to sound like a candidate for a sequel to group member Sara Watkins’ lullaby album, should she ever make another.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe country side of Young got some showcasing right from the start, with the house band kicking off the show with the promissory “Are You Ready for the Country.” Margo Price revived “Love Is a Rose” with just a little more twang than Linda did, in an old-school country suit festooned in flowers. Keith Secor was more than ready for it with a fiddle-soloing version of “Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere”; the Old Crow frontman also sat in on Molly Tuttle’s “Helpless,” although he left the fireworks to his better half as she rounded out that coming-of-age anthem with a characteristically great acoustic guitar-solo coda. Tuttle was not the be-all and end-all of female pickers on the roster, as her fellow Grammy nominee Sierra Hull added a beautiful mandolin wind to “Look Out for My Love.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMargo Price performs at the Americana Fest Pre-Grammy Salute to the Songs of Neil Young at the Troubadour on January 31, 2026. (Erika Goldring Photo)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tErika Goldring\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe pop side of Neil Young? That might sound like an oxymoron, but not when Molly Jensen is singing a straight-up cover of Nicolette Larson’s not-so-straight-up, adult contemporary cover of Young’s “Lotta Love,” which became a top 10 hit in 1978 — complete with a house band member providing both the flute and sax interludes.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tNo one would have mistaken the concert for a Crazy Horse gig, but rocking out did take place, starting in earnest with a Katie Pruitt-led rendering of the sadly relevant “Ohio,” followed some time later by Maggie Rose wailing terrifically and in earnest through a high-dynamics, no-hurry version of “Down by the River.” Those numbers thrive on unleavened tension, but Grace Potter was all smiles and all bounding around while delivering “Cinnamon Girl” with one of the night’s guitar heroes, Leif. He had earlier taken a turn in the spotlight, firing off some instrumental gunplay while singing his own version of the beautifully fatalistic “Powderfinger.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIf it feels sacrilegious to the music’s humble ethos to say the Americana movement has “stars,” it’s inarguable that Jesse Welles has become one in this modest corner of the culture. So there were few appearances as highly anticipated as his taking to the stage for “After the Gold Rush,” offering a raspier take on the choirboy delivery Young gave to his eco-protest sci-fi anthem 55 years ago. Young the Giant — no relation to Neil Young the giant — took on “Old Man,” with Sameer Gadhia sweetly up to the very ungrizzled task of playing the role of an actual young person. \n\n\tWhatever else the org does, the Americana Music Association can be counted on to provide two of the year’s best Various Artists concerts — one being its performance-heavy annual awards show at the Ryman in Nashville each September, and then this much more intimate gig at the Troubadour in January, which is a tighter, less-talk-more-rock affair. The latter, with its “twas the night before Crypto” timing, inevitably raises talk about how the artists and genres represented here have real singers playing real instruments, yada yada, in comparison to some of their more choreographed brothers and sisters in prime time. There might be some undue moral superiority in some of that, but you don’t even have to hate Addison Rae or Katseye to revel in the emotion and virtuosity on a night like this one and conclude: This, truly, is the shit. Long may it run… to paraphrase a song that, with any luck, will be performed at the AmericanaFest Salute to the Songs of Neil Young Part II next year.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJesse Welles, Leif, Grace Potter and Maggie Rose perform in the finale at the Americana Fest Pre-Grammy Salute to the Songs of Neil Young at the Troubadour on Jan. 31, 2026.

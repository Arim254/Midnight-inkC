    "body": "\n\t“Sinners” will return to Imax theaters in time for Halloween.\n\n\tThe R-rated box office smash, directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan, will be back in select locations for one week starting on Oct. 30. This is the second Imax re-release for “Sinners,” which returned to the country’s biggest and brightest screens in May after the film’s initial run was cut short to make room for Marvel’s “Thunderbolts.”\n\n\n\t“This limited engagement offers audiences the chance to experience one of the most original and emotionally resonant films to ever reach the big screen in the way Coogler originally envisioned: presented in premium format on Imax 70MM and Imax screens,” Warner Bros. wrote in a press release. “The re-release reunites audiences with a story that spoke volumes when it first premiered—both for its ambitious visual storytelling and for the passion and artistry of its stellar cast and crew.”\n\t\n\n\t“Sinners” opened in April to $48 million at the domestic box office, marking the biggest debut for an original film since Jordan Peele’s “Us” opened to $71 million in 2019. Thanks to sterling reviews and glowing word-of-mouth, “Sinners” earned nearly as much in its second weekend as its first, an extreme rarity for a film that didn’t open around the holiday season. The Warner Bros. release has since generated $278 million in North America and $366 million globally against a $90 million budget. Those outsized results are a testament to Coogler and Jordan’s box office bankability. They also prove that audiences will show up for original ideas.\n\n\tJordan plays identical twins Smoke and Stack in “Sinners,” which takes place in the 1930s as the brothers return home to the South and open a juke joint… only for vampires to descend on the small town. Variety‘s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman called “Sinners” a “lavishly serious popcorn movie” and distinguished it as “the rare mainstream horror film that’s about something weighty and soulful: the wages of sin in Black America.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSundance’s final edition in Park City will include a tribute to its founder, the late Robert Redford, as well as anniversary screenings of films that helped put the independent festival on the map.\n\n\tSundance organizers revealed on Tuesday the first wave of programming details for the 2026 edition, which will be held from Jan. 22 through Feb. 1. This will be the final year it’s held in Park City before the festival moves to Boulder, Colo. in 2027. \n\t\n\n\tNext year’s festival will serve as a “meaningful tribute to Robert Redford and his vision that has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema around the world,” Sundance said in a press release. Redford, a leading man turned Oscar-winning director, died in September at age 89. In his honor, Sundance will present a commemorative screening of 1969’s “Downhill Racer” — Redford’s first independent film and a passion project that served as the catalyst to create the Sundance Institute and film Festival. Then throughout the festival, there will be gatherings including “Celebrating Sundance Institute: A Tribute to Founder Robert Redford” event, Salt Lake City Celebration event, and the Directors Brunch at Sundance Mountain Resort where the 2026 filmmakers will convene.\n\n\n\t“This will be an especially poignant year for us as we reflect on the vision of our late founder, RobertRedford, who redefined cinema and provided a home for generations of artists when he created Sundance Institute,” says Sundance Film Festival director Eugene Hernandez. “We’re looking forward to honoring the festival’s time in Park City and Robert Redford’s legacy. His fearless support of artistic integrity and risk-taking is at the core of the work we continue to do, and the 2026 Festival will be a celebration of that important mission.”\n\t\n\n\tA legacy program, devoted to past festival favorites, will take place from Jan. 27 through Jan. 30. The lineup includes “Little Miss Sunshine” (featuring a new digital restoration), as well as James Wan’s “Saw,” Reginald Hudlin’s “House Party,” Ryan Fleck’s “Half Nelson,”  Barbara Kopple’s documentary “American Dream” and the late Lynn Shelton’s “Humpday.”\n\n\tA full lineup of world premieres will be announced later this year.\n\n\t“The program announced today carries special significance as we mark and honor this year’s festival in Utah and is the start to a full slate of projects to be unveiled in the coming weeks,” said Kim Yutani, Sundance’s director of programming. “This coming January we’re looking forward to hosting our community of alumni, artists, industry, staff, and volunteers with deep connections to the festival in Utah as they come together in celebration of a place so meaningful to us all.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “New Girl” rewatch podcast, called “The Mess Around,” has found a new home for listeners to go behind-the-scenes of Apartment 4D. \n\n\tThe podcast’s creators — “New Girl” stars Lamorne Morris and Hannah Simone — will join the podcast network Headgum for new episodes of “The Mess Around.” The partnership begins on Oct. 21, kicking off with Season 4, Episode 11, titled “LAXMas.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Headgum\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The Mess Around” features real-life friends and former co-stars, who portrayed CeCe Parekh and Winston Bishop, rewatching “New Girl” and revealing untold stories with the help of guests, writers and directors. \n\t\n\n\tIn the announcment, Morris shared his excitement about working with Headgum, saying, “After partnering with the team at Headgum on ‘The Lamorning After,’ it was a no-brainer to bring both podcasts under the same umbrella. Also, ‘New Girl’ fans, rejoice. You no longer have to endure ‘We’re Here to Help.’ Your move, Jake.”\n\n\n\t“The Mess Around” has featured recurring guest stars Justin Long and Olivia Munn, as well as fellow “New Girl” cast members Zooey Deschanel, Jake Johnson, Damon Wayans Jr., Max Greenfield and show creator Elizabeth Meriwether.\n\n\t“New Girl” aired on Fox from 2011 to 2018 for 146 episodes over seven seasons. The series followed a quirky teacher named Jessica Day (Zooey Deschanel) who, after a bad break-up, moves into an apartment unit with three single men, ultimately forming a close-knit relationship throughout the series. \n\n\t“The Mess Around” marks Morris’ second podcast on Headgum, along with “The Lamorning After,” which landed on the network in 2023 and is co-hosted with writer and director Kyle Shevrin. \n\t\n\n\t“The Lamorning After” features a rotating cast of celebrity guests discussing relationships, life and recapping what they did the night before. Past guests include Raven Symoné, Glen Powell, Josh Peck, Hannah Simone, among others.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Isaac Abrams\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHeadgum VP of content, Kaiti Moos, said about the partnership: “Hannah and Lamorne’s natural chemistry is what makes ‘The Mess Around’ so special. Their shared history and personal connection bring a warm, nostalgic energy to every episode, inviting listeners to hang out right there in Apartment 4D with the crew.”\n\n\tShe continued: “ It’s been such a joy to grow together since we teamed up with Lamorne in 2023 for ‘The Lamorning After.’ We’re excited to add another one of his shows to Headgum and give fans of ‘New Girl’ even more behind-the-scenes stories. Expanding into video is an exciting next step, and we can’t wait to share more with their incredible fanbase.”\n\n\tNew episodes of “The Mess Around” are released on Tuesdays, and can be found on major platforms as well as on YouTube. \n\n\tHeadgum is a Los Angeles and New York-based comedy podcast network behind the production of shows like “Handsome,” “We’re Here to Help” with Johnson and Gareth Reynolds, “Landlines” with Allison Williams, “Dead Eyes,” “Why Won’t You Date Me” and “Best Friends” with Nicole Byer and Sasheer Zamata.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCalifornia has set aside $342 million in tax credits in a bid to jumpstart production of big-budget films, including a record $43.9 million for the next installment in the “Jumanji” franchise.\n\n\tThe state is also committing $37.2 million for “Heat 2” from Michael Mann, as well as $38.4 million for the next film from the Daniels, the Oscar-winning team behind “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” The Daniels’ film, from Universal, was already approved for $20.8 million in March, but thanks to the expansion of the state’s incentive program this summer, now finds itself the recipient of a nearly $18 million windfall.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to a spokesman for the California Film Commission, the Daniels’ film withdrew from the program after receiving the initial allocation and “reapplied.” The state will now cover 35.8% of qualified expenses instead of 19.5%. The project’s employment figures have not changed.\n\n\n\tThe next “Jumanji” — the fourth overall, and the third since 2017 — is set to begin shooting in November. It is due for release in December 2026. In a statement, director Jake Kasdan said he is “thrilled” that it will be made in California. \n\n\t“I have long looked forward to the day when the California Film Incentive would help us bring movies like this one back home — and now that it does, I am so grateful that ours will be among the first to take advantage of the new program,” Kasdan said. “Making these big popcorn movies requires hundreds of specially-skilled people, and the world’s finest live in California.”\n\n\tGov. Gavin Newsom signed a major expansion of the tax credit in June, as the state seeks to counter an industrywide downturn that cut production jobs by 29% since 2022. Under the expanded program, the state will award $337 million to feature films and $412 million to TV shows each year for the next five years.\n\t\n\n\tOnly eight big-budget feature films were in production in the most recent quarter in California, a 43% decline compared to the same quarter of 2024, according to data from ProdPro.\n\n\tFilm production was also down by 33% in the U.K. and 6% in Canada in the third quarter of 2025, compared to the same quarter in 2024.\n\n\tThe U.S. remains the largest global hub for film production. But California has had to compete with Georgia, New Jersey, New York and other states in offering subsidies to attract productions within the U.S. — while Canada, the U.K. and other countries offer their own generous subsidies to lure films overseas.\n\n\tBefore the expansion, which took effect on July 1, no project could get more than $25 million in credits, and most were limited to $20 million. Under the new system, that cap has risen to $48 million. In July, the California Film Commission awarded $42.8 million to a new Hulu series from Dan Fogelman.\n\n\tThe noteworthy feature film projects in the latest allocation include:\n\n\n“Sunday,” from Blumhouse, $16.4 million\n“The Fifth Wheel,” from Netflix, $14.8 million\n“A Tree Is Blue,” produced by Dakota Johnson, $2.4 million\nUntitled Family Drama, from Warner Bros., $39.6 million\n“Epiphany,” starring Bill Murray and Kristen Wiig, $4.2 million\n“The Incredible Heist of Hallelujah Jones,” from Taika Waititi and starring Janelle Monae, $1.8 million\n“Nightwatching,” starring Mila Kunis, $3.3 million\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tExactly three decades ago, in October 1995, Shakira unveiled her third studio album, the career-defining “Pies Descalzos.” The collection of Spanish-language songs became a daring introduction to an artist intent on reshaping the Latin music landscape with a blend of pop and rock and with the pulse of Latin America and beyond, weaving in echoes of Afro beats, Arabic melodies and folk traditions that hinted at the global storyteller she was destined to become.\n\t\n\n\tA decade later, she once again upended expectations with her “Fijación Oral” two-part project that blurred languages. Following the global triumph of her 2001 English-language debut, “Laundry Service,” she returned with something to prove, releasing “Fijación Oral, Vol. 1” in Spanish and its mirror image, “Oral Fixation, Vol. 2,” in English.\n\n\n\tPaired with her unmistakable vibrato, these two records would cement Shakira as one of the most original and influential voices of her generation.\n\n\t“I think my memories of ‘Pies’ are burned into my brain with more clarity than the ‘Oral Fixation’ series,” Shakira tells Variety in an email interview. \n\n\t“Just because it was such a before and after moment for me and it was all recorded in such a brief time. There was nothing to lose, then, really, and there was a freedom in that. ‘Oral Fixation 1 and 2’ were another before and after, because they had two of my biggest hits, ‘La Tortura’ and ‘Hips,’ but they were a much, much longer process and full of so many different sounds — I was doing a lot more exploring and fusion by then, though even as early as ‘Pies’ I was including world genres like reggae.”\n\t\n\n\t“Fijación” set a record for the highest debut of a full-length Spanish-language album in the U.S. (debuting at No. 4 on the Billboard 200) at the time. Internationally, it reached No. 1 in Argentina, Germany, Mexico and Spain. And at the seventh Latin Grammy Awards, it won album of the year, making a then 29 year-old Shakira the first female recording artist to take the category.\n\n\tTo mark the 30th anniversary of “Pies Descalzos,” and the 20th anniversary of “Oral Fixation (Vol 1 and 2),” Spotify and Shakira have reimagined the classics that shaped her career alongside Ed Sheeran, Colombian artist Beéle and a 14-piece string ensemble.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Cornejo \n\t\n\n\n\n\tBelow, Shakira revisits her most pivotal moments in intimate detail, offering insight into which of today’s artists she would’ve loved to feature on her early albums. She also shares her reaction to the news of Bad Bunny headlining the Super Bowl and much more.\n\n\tYou are performing these songs with Ed Sheeran and Beéle for the Spotify special. Why did you choose to revisit these songs with these collaborators?\n\n\tEd and I have been talking and trading ideas for years, literally, and have worked on multiple ideas, but the timing was never right for one or the other of us. This year we are finally making two big moments with writing together for “Zootopia,” and now this. I really love what he does with just a guitar and how unique it and his vocal arranging is. I knew he would bring something fresh to “Hips.” \n\n\tBeéle is from my hometown, and part of the new generation, and with this song being the one that put Barranquilla on the map in the U.S., I thought it would be beautiful to incorporate another artist from there and especially that autochthonous phrasing and melody that we put together for this and that he sings so well and with so much soul.  \n\n\tWhen you revisit the original artwork and creative vision behind “Fijación Oral,” what do you see or understand now about the artist or person you were then?\n\n\tI see someone who was exploring, searching, still looking to break barriers, to push things one step further after having introduced Latin sounds to a U.S. audience on “Laundry Service.” I felt more bold and self-assured by this point in my career in both Spanish and in English, and it was one of the most fruitful creative periods of my life. \n\t\n\n\tOutside of the big hits, is there a track from those albums (“Fijación Oral Vol. 1 and 2”) you wish you had the chance to revisit more often in your live shows?\n\n\tI always have a soft spot for the B-sides. I think, it would be impossible to say I wouldn’t love to be able to perform “Dia Especial” side by side with Gustavo Cerati again. After all these years, I still draw inspiration from him — and his absence is still felt. \n\n\tYou were defiant in “Pies Descalzos” and it ended up changing your career forever. The same thing happened with the songs you included in your last record – songs full of passion like your “Bzrp Music Session” and “TQG.” What is it like to know that you and your fans have always connected over rebelliousness? \n\n\tFans intuitively know what’s authentic and what isn’t. Sometimes you’re fully authentic and it still doesn’t perform the way you want it to — it’s never an exact science, there is so much good music out there and a lot has to do with a perfect storm of timing, the zeitgeist, and things out of your control. But what I DO know is that when it’s inauthentic, it never really works. They can smell it a mile away, so you may as well just be honest, real, and hope it connects. \n\n\tIf “Fijación Oral” or “Pies Descalzos” captured a specific moment in your artistic history, what moment do you feel your current work is capturing today?\n\n\tMy work now is uncharted territory. You have expectations of where your life will lead, and most of the time, they’re completely off. The sounds I connect with always change from album to album, but the topics that are moving me these days are new, my questions, the things that fulfill me, the things that excite me, the things that scare me, are all different from what I thought they would be at this stage of life. I can’t wait to see where it takes me artistically.  \n\n\tIs there any artist from today’s music landscape that you would’ve liked to have featured on a song on “Oral Fixation”? Who would it be and for which song?\n\n\tI would love to hear Chappell Roan on “La Pared.” I think she would do an incredible rendition. Her voice and her artistry are incredible. \n\n\tDo you have a favorite lyrical moment on “Pies Descalzos”? \n\t\n\n\tI think the title track from that album has lyrical moments that were precocious at the time, but also completely accurate to what many teenagers like myself felt at the time. I love performing that song live, it’s always fun. \n\n\tWhat has allowed you and Luis Fernando Ochoa to sustain such an honest artistic partnership throughout the years?\n\n\tLuisfer is family. We can go months or even years without seeing each other but we always fall instantly back into the same dynamic without missing a beat. We’re also both a little neurotic… and have the same sense of humor, so we understand each other. Our conversations in the studio can get really ridiculous, in a good way. Some people are just songwriting soulmates. He’ll always be one of mine.\n\n\tWhat can you tell us about your reaction to the news that Bad Bunny is headlining the Super Bowl? Six years after he sang with you during your own Halftime performance.It’s about time!\n\n\tI remember when we did ours that even having part of our set in Spanish was a bold move… Acceptance of Spanish-language music as part of the mainstream has come so far from when I started. I hope and like to think that all the times my music was met with resistance or puzzlement from the English-speaking world before it was embraced, helped forge the path to where we are now. \n\n\tAnd I’m so proud that Bad Bunny, who represents not only Latin culture but also how important Spanish language music has become on a global scale and how universal it has become, is getting to perform on the biggest stage in the world. It’s the perfect moment for a performance like this. I can’t wait to watch it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has traded some serious resources to secure the global rights to “Catan.” \n\n\tThe streaming giant is now developing projects based on the beloved board game across film and both scripted and unscripted TV, as well as both live-action and animation. All projects will be produced by Darren Kyman from game publisher asmodee, Pete Fenlon of Catan Studios (an asmodee studio), and Guido and Benjamin Teuber, the sons of ‘Catan’ inventor Klaus Teuber. Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment will also produce. \n\t\n\n\t“Millions of people are enjoying ‘Catan’ since it was created and for many, it remains a gateway to modern board gaming. I’m thrilled to see the game expanding to a larger audience who will discover the richness of its universe, I find it exciting for the future of the brand.” said Thomas Koegler, CEO of asmodee. “It’s also a testament that board gaming is truly part of pop culture and a popular form of entertainment in everyone’s homes, and I’m delighted to continue asmodee’s relationship with Netflix.”\n\n\n\tKlaus Teuber originally released “Catan” in 1995 under the name “The Settlers of Catan.” Since then, the game has become a phenomenon, selling over 45 million copies worldwide and having been translated into over 40 languages. In the game, players reach the fictional island of Catan, where they must acquire resources and grow their settlements, ultimately acquiring victory points in order to win. \n\n\t“When our father Klaus Teuber first introduced ‘Catan’ thirty years ago, he imagined an aspirational world where people would gather by trading, building and settling together — both at the table and beyond it,” said Benjamin and Guido Teuber, co-CEOs of Catan GmbH. “This collaboration with Netflix marks an exciting new chapter in that journey. For three decades, ‘Catan’ has connected families and friends around the world. Now, we’re thrilled to see it inspire storytelling on a global stage — staying true to our father’s vision of creativity, strategy and human connection.” \n\t\n\n\tNetflix is developing or has already released a number of projects based on both video and board games. The streamer previously aired the acclaimed animated series “Arcane,” which was based on “League of Legends,” as well as an animated adapation of “Castlevania.” Most recently, Netflix announced it had ordered a series version of “Assassin’s Creed” and a “Monopoly” reality competition series. \n\n\t“Anyone who has played ‘Catan’ knows that the intense strategy at the core of the game has endless opportunities for some serious drama,” said Jinny Howe, head of scripted series, US and Canada, for Netflix. “We’re thrilled to partner across series, features, animation, and games to bring this world to life for hardcore ‘Settlers’ and new fans alike.”\n\n\tThe deal was negotiated by CAA and Goodman Genow on behalf of asmodee and Catan GmbH. \n",

    "body": "\n\tElizabeth Olsen told InStyle magazine as part of a new cover story that she is no longer signing on to Hollywood studio movies that don’t have a guaranteed theatrical release. As an indie film darling since the start of her career with 2011’s “Martha Marcy May Marlene,” Olsen is comfortable acting in a movie without distribution that gets sold to a streamer. But her preference is always a theatrical release.\n\n\t“If a movie is made independently and only sells to a streamer, then fine. But I don’t want to make something where [streaming is] the end-all,” Olsen said. “I think it’s important for people to gather as a community, to see other humans, be together in a space. That’s why I like sports. I think it’s really powerful for people to come together for something that they’re excited about. We don’t even audition in person anymore.”\n\t\n\n\tSince her last outing as the Scarlet Witch in the Marvel Cinematic Universe courtesy of 2022’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” Olsen has made only indie movies such as 2023’s “His Three Daughters,” 2024’s “The Assessment” and the upcoming A24 romantic comedy “Eternity.” Only “His Three Daughters” was backed by a streamer (in this case Netflix), although it was given an awards-qualifying theatrical release in select theaters.\n\n\tOlsen knows a thing or two about bringing millions of people together in movie theaters thanks to the MCU, where she’s played Scarlet Witch since debuting in the post-credits scene of 2014’s “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.” \n\n\t“Making the films are fun. Goofy. It’s ridiculous. We’re grown people like children on a playground,” Olsen told InStyle about the MCU. “We’re flying. We’re shooting things out of our hands. And it’s a character that I’ve gotten to return to so many times after over 10 years. It’s good to put her down and then I miss  her and I want her back. I’d jump at the opportunity to be in her shoes again.”\n\t\n\n\tOlsen added about the pros of the MCU, “It’s the consistency of a community and a job, which is hard to find. The insane camera movement, stunt work and special effects, visual effects that are happening in real time. It’s a lot of coordination, it’s hundreds and hundreds of people on set, and it’s a powerful thing to be a part of all those people working towards one goal. The people doing the visual effects are artists… The soul, the spirit, the heart is fulfilled doing it. It does mean something. I care about the acting being great — everyone does.”\n\n\tThe “Doctor Strange” sequel remains Olsen’s last in-person Marvel appearance as Scarlet Witch. She was recently featured as a voice role on the Disney+ animated series “Marvel Zombies.” Her next film is “Eternity,” co-starring Miles Teller and Callum Turner. The A24 film puts a fantasy spin on the rom-com genre by being set in an afterlife where the recently deceased have one week to decide who to spend eternity with. Olsen’s Joan must decide between her first love or the man she built her life with.\n\n\t“Eternity” opens in theaters this Thanksgiving.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery is reviewing “strategic alternatives” in light of “unsolicited interest” it has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and the standalone Warner Bros. streaming and studios entity, the media conglomerate said Tuesday. \n\n\tWBD didn’t say which companies have made M&A overtures. But the announcement comes after Paramount Skydance, headed by chairman and CEO David Ellison, has been pursuing a major deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. In recent weeks, WBD reportedly rejected Paramount Skydance’s $20-per-share offer as too low.\n\t\n\n\tOn the Warner Bros. Discovery announcement, the company’s stock jumped more than 8% in early trading to nearly $20 per share.\n\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery “continues to advance its previously announced separation of Warner Bros. and Discovery Global,” currently targeted to be completed by April 2026. At the same time, the board announced it has initiated a review of strategic alternatives “to maximize shareholder value.” Through this process, the Warner Bros. Discovery board will evaluate a broad range of strategic options, which include the sale of the entire company, or separate transactions for its Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses, it said.\n\n\tAs part of the review, the company will also consider an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. with a third-party acquirer alongside a spin-off of Discovery Global to shareholders, it said.\n\n\t“We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,” David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement.\n\t\n\n\tZaslav continued, “It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.”\n\n\tSamuel A. Di Piazza Jr., chairman of the Warner Bros. Discovery board, said in a statement: “Our decision to initiate this review underscores the board’s commitment to considering all opportunities to determine the best value for our shareholders. We continue to believe that our planned separation to create two distinct, leading media companies will create compelling value. That said, we determined taking these actions to broaden our scope is in the best interest of shareholders.”\n\n\tWBD said there is no deadline or “definitive timetable” set for completion of the strategic alternatives review process. Other than the separation transaction that is already underway, which the company has said it targeted to be completed in April 2026, “there can be no assurance that this process will result in the company pursuing a transaction or other outcome,” it said. \n\n\tIn its announcement, Warner Bros. Discovery said it does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the review of strategic alternatives “unless and until the board approves a specific transaction or otherwise determines further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.”\n\n\tAllen & Company, J.P. Morgan and Evercore are serving as financial advisers to Warner Bros. Discovery and Wachtell Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP are serving as legal counsel.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCould a superstar as big as Michael Jackson be compelled, almost against his will, to return to the recording studio for a do-over on one of his songs? The answer to that in 1995 was a surprising yes, when Jackson re-recorded a key line of the song “They Don’t Care About Us,” amid a media firestorm over controversial lyrics that included anti-Jewish slurs. But, maintaining that there was no antisemitic intent to his words, the superstar was far from happy about having to “make that change.” Indeed, he took out his anger on the recording studio where the vocal overdubs were taking place in 1995.\n\t\n\n\tThat’s one of the compelling stories in “You’ve Got Michael: Living Through HIStory,” a new book by former Epic Records executive Dan Beck, which offers a first-hand, never-before-revealed look at what was going on with Jackson’s music career during some of his peak years as the world’s biggest pop superstar in the 1990s. Beck, a senior VP at the company, worked closely with Jackson on the “Dangerous” and “HIStory” projects and bears fascinating witness to the ups and downs that marked that volatile period of change in Jackson’s life as well as stardom.\n\n\n\tIn Variety’s exclusive excerpt from “You’ve Got Michael,” Beck recounts exactly how reluctant Jackson was to change the lyrics to a recording that was already out in the marketplace, and the silent protest he registered after being convinced he had to. Published by Trouser Press Books, the book is available as a paperback and e-book online from Amazon, B&N, Apple, www.trouserpressbooks.com and other digital platforms. Here is the excerpt of a story recounted in Beck’s absorbing backstage memoir. —Chris Willman\n\t\n\n\t– – –  \n\n\tOnce Michael deemed the “HIStory” album complete, we set up a secure listening room at Sony Music Studios on West 52nd Street. Listening sessions were usually scheduled in the four or five weeks leading up to the release date and only select people were invited to a preview.\n\n\tI attended nearly all of those listening sessions when I was not traveling. The first three or four were early evening “rehearsals” to make sure the album would sound perfect in this small studio. It was at one of those that I discovered the lyric issues of “They Don’t Care About Us.” The song had an aggressive, staccato beat and vocal delivery; the general theme was Michael as an oppressed underdog fighting back. On one of those first evenings, I heard a red flag as Michael angrily spat out the words, lyrics that included an antisemitic slur.\n\n\tI told [my boss, Epic Records chairman] Dave [Glew] that somebody needed to speak to Michael and [Michael’s co-manager] Sandy [Gallin]. Sandy argued that Michael spoke as an empathetic voice of the oppressed. “He’s saying stop labeling people, stop degrading people, stop calling them names. The song is about not being prejudiced. To take two lines out of context is unfair.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichael Jackson and Dan Beck with a “Thriller” sales award, 1984\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Dan Beck\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Thursday, June 15, one day before the international in-store date and five full days before the U.S. street date, the controversy hit the fan. The New York Times, in an Arts section story under Bernard Weinraub’s byline, led the pack with the headline “In New Lyrics, Jackson Uses Slurs.” The first sentence established the issue: “…includes a song with lyrics that can be interpreted as pointedly critical of Jews.”\n\n\tThe controversy was already brewing behind the scenes, as Diane Sawyer had asked about the lyric in her taped interview with Michael and Lisa Marie for ABC News’ “Primetime Live,” which was scheduled to air that night. Sawyer’s spotlight, which sixty million people tuned in to see, gave Michael a national forum to clearly define his intent and lead the discussion with a measured response. Unfortunately, his reply was muddled: “It’s not antisemitic because I’m not a racist person. I could never be a racist. I love all races.” Worse, he fell on the weak and damning defense of “My accountants and lawyers are Jewish. My three best friends are Jewish — David Geffen, Jeffery Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg.”\n\t\n\n\tGeffen and Spielberg were mixed in their responses. David offered a supportive perspective: “There’s not one iota of antisemitism in Michael. He’s not a hater of any kind. At worst, sometimes he’s naïve, and I think to the degree that anybody is bothered or offended, he’s genuinely sorry.” But Spielberg was angry and distanced himself from Michael. He had written liner notes for the album but now said, “[Those liner notes, written two years ago] are by no means an endorsement of any new songs that appear on what has now been released as Michael Jackson’s ‘HIStory’ album.”\n\n\tWe had three phone calls with Michael regarding the situation, and his answer was repetitive and straight to the point. “This is the media,” he complained. “I would never be racist or antisemitic.” We continued to explain that it wasn’t about him. It was about the people who those words hurt, no matter the context in which they were used.\n\n\tHe couldn’t grasp how the media could misunderstand his intentions. Instead, he saw a conspiracy against him. “People know I would never mean that!” he protested to me directly over the next few days. His voice was firm and steadfast: raised, but in control, yet he was clearly on the defense. His repeated response of “Everybody knows me. They know I don’t hate people” stood in stubborn defiance.\n\n\tIt was four days before the U.S. in-store date, and we had no idea how to defuse the issue. Suddenly, I was in meetings and on conference calls with Epic and Sony Music brass, with Sandy Gallin and with Michael’s stable of PR guns. Rat Pack veteran Lee Solters mixed it up with Motown alumnus Bob Jones, the vastly more contemporary public relations expert and strategist Michael Levine and the street-savvy New York-based media master Dan Klores. Meanwhile, critical voices roared out. [My assistant] Joy Gilbert fielded calls from Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League. “We got a huge backlash from that,” she remembers, “and it got worse after he went on with Diane Sawyer.”\n\n\tWe needed to speak with Michael. He was in the lead here and was going to do whatever he was going to do. We could give him information on our read of the media and the public reaction. We could give him advice on how to handle it. But ultimately, we needed to assess his position and then decide how to respond.\n\t\n\n\tThe meeting began with Michael protesting, “Everybody knows I’m not prejudiced!” In his mind, he had become the Jew in the song. It was he who was oppressed. It was he who spoke for the others. He wouldn’t hurt anyone. He still seemed bewildered that anyone could think otherwise. He went on to blame the media for ganging up on him, as it had done with the change of skin color, the plastic surgery and the child molestation accusation.\n\n\tAs the call progressed, it became clear that, by focusing on his adversaries, he had lost sight of those who were hurt or offended by the lyrics. Michael’s co-manager Jim Morey took a calm, rational approach, explaining that for the good of all he just needed to re-record the lyric. Finally, he agreed. I recall his response was a soft, resigned, almost inaudible “Okay.”\n\n\tI actually felt bad for him. He believed he was capitulating to the media for a transgression that he didn’t commit. He saw this song as a protest, and he was the voice of that protest, not the antagonist. Yet his delay in making the change had backed us into a corner. Before ending the conference call, Michael agreed to re-cut the vocal at the Sony Music Studios.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJim Morey [and I] continued to communicate, but it seemed that the King of Pop was avoiding the situation. After months of middle-of-the-night calls, Michael was now avoiding me on the phone. After repeated tries, I finally reached him. Michael knew why I wanted to speak with him. I had never called out Michael Jackson before, but that day I did just that. I reminded him that he had given his word, that an official press release had gone out saying he was re-recording the lyric. I told him how bad this looked. I said that I had spoken to every angry major journalist [including Army Archerd of Variety] and assured them all that he had personally told us he was making the change.\n\n\tI never raised my voice, but I was as direct as I could be. He knew that I always gave him my honest thoughts. He knew that I didn’t shield him from the facts when he needed them. Whether under duress or not, Michael had made a promise, and I had conveyed that message on his behalf. He couldn’t just blow this off. I didn’t say so, but I was pissed. He needed to deal with this.\n\n\tJim Morey and Dave Glew were on the call. It was Jim who gently moved the debate into a path forward. “Michael, it would be easy for you to slip into the Sony studios when you are back in New York and re-do the lyric.” Dave added, “Michael, we can have this set up for you and put this issue behind us.” Michael heeded the groupthink. He softly gave in.\n\t\n\n\tWithin forty-eight hours, Jim Morey brought Michael to Sony Studios on 54th Street and 10th Avenue. It was shortly after the July 4th holiday, at least three weeks after the controversy arose. It seemed like a year! I greeted Jim and said, “Hi, Michael,” but Michael didn’t return the greeting. He was ticked! Jim quietly said hello as our eyes met in acknowledgment of how heavy this was.\n\n\tWe wove our way through the hallways to the bowels of the five-story building. Again, Michael never said a word, I guess to show Jim and me how angry he was. The tension was palpable, but at least the pace of our walk made it bearable. A recording engineer was waiting at the console in the control room. Michael, still silent, went directly into the studio, where a lone microphone and music stand stood.\n\n\tMichael pulled a folded piece of paper from his pocket and placed it on the music stand. The engineer asked through the talk-back system if Michael was ready. Michael told the engineer to play the song from beginning to end. When “They Don’t Care About Us” reached the controversial lyric, the engineer pushed “record” and Michael sang the new lyric.\n\n\tAs the engineer let the song play on to another section that needed to be fixed, Michael picked up the music stand and threw it at the wall. He picked up a chair and threw it, too, then angrily pushed over a baffle. Michael Jackson was trashing the studio!\n\n\tI looked at the engineer, who was clearly in shock. The cameraman, who was capturing the event so that we could carefully edit it and release a clip to the media to prove the change had been made, was frozen with his camera running. I saw his eyes bulge. But he never stopped filming.\n\n\tAs the song reached the second appearance of the controversial lyric, Michael went from maniacal anger back to smoothly singing the new lines. Once the recording light was off, he resumed the demolition of the studio.\n\n\tJim Morey and I looked at each other in the control room in disbelief, but with relief that we had gotten this task done. We simply started laughing. I think neither of us could believe the convoluted path this entire episode had taken. The engineer and cameraman looked at us like we were crazy.\n\n\tYes, we were crazy, all right! We had gone crazy trying to get this horrible controversy resolved — and now we had. We had it on the master tape and we had film footage to prove it. And Michael knew that he could express his anger to us, the footage of which would never get out into the world. I’ve never seen that video since the day after we shot it. There are various renditions of the song on YouTube, including those with the original lyric (listed as “uncensored”) and the revised version. The footage of Michael recording the new words was used only as part of the press release to announce that Michael had changed the lyrics.\n\t\n\n\tThe song finished playing. Michael ended his tirade and walked out of the studio. We left the control room and spilled out into the hallway. No one spoke. The three of us walked down the hall together to the lounge where we had met Michael. We said goodbye. And that was it.\n\n\tIn time, the lyrical controversy faded, but it was never really resolved. Michael believed in his heart that he had only wanted to represent the victims of tyranny. The media and the public took two roads: to believe him or to remain skeptical. I am quite sure the revised version of “They Don’t Care About Us” was used only for the single release and the promo videos but never implemented in a second manufacturing run of the album, as the factory already had an abundance of inventory. A later version simply had a sound effect added to obscure the words.\n\n\t– – –  \n\n\tDan Beck spent two decades at Epic Records as a publicity executive, product manager, and Senior VP of Marketing and Sales.

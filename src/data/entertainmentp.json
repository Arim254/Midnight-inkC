Behind “All I Want for Christmas Is You” sits Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree,” Bobby Helms’ “Jingle Bell Rock,” Wham!’s “Last Christmas” and Ariana Grande’s “Santa Tell Me.” “Last Christmas” also crowns the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts, each for a second week.\n\n\n\tOver on the album charts, Taylor Swift continues to reign at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in its 11th nonconsecutive week. But the Christmas cheer is spread elsewhere in the top 10 with seven holiday albums occupying the upper reaches of the tally. Bing Crosby’s “Ultimate Christmas” peaks at No. 2, followed by Michael Bublé’s “Christmas,” Nat King Cole’s “The Christmas Song” and “A Christmas Gift for You From Phil Spector.” Rounding out spots six through 10 are Morgan Wallen’s “I’m the Problem,” Vince Guaraldi Trio’s “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” Carey’s “Merry Christmas,” Frank Sinatra’s “Ultimate Christmas” and the “KPop Demon Hunters” soundtrack.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tChappell Roan praised Brigitte Bardot upon learning of the French actress’ death, but now has walked those comments back, after getting some pushback from fans who informed the singer that the late French star was famous for right-wing views that led to convictions for inciting hatred in French courts.\n\n\t“Holy shit I did not know all that insane shit Mr. Bardot stood for,” Roan wrote Monday in an Instagram Stories post. “I do not condone this. Very disappointing to learn.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt was not surprising that Roan would have at least some praise for Bardot, having name-checked her in the very first line of one of her most famous songs, “Red Wine Supernova,” which begins with the lyric: “She was a playboy, Brigitte Bardot / She showed me things I didn’t know.”  Still, it did come as a shock to some Roan devotees that she did not qualify that with a disavowal or at least acknowledgement of the extremely polarizing social views Bardot became most famous for later in life. Roan’s followup message pleaded ignorance of what some fans would consider Bardot’s dark side.\n\n\n\t“Rest in peace Ms. Bardot,” Roan’s initial message on Sunday read. “She was my inspiration for red wine supernova.”\n\n\tBardot’s reputation has been fractured in the decades following her 1960s peak as a cinematic sex symbol who also appeared in art films like “Contempt.” Outside of the realm of films, some remember her best for her animal activism and founding the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in the 1980s to advocate for animal rights. Others know her primarily for her statements against Muslims in European life, as Bardot was convicted five times in France on charges of inciting racial hatred.\n\t\n\n\tWrote Le Monde in a remembrance of Bardot Monday: “Brigitte Bardot, the actress, was known for ‘Le Mépris (Contempt)’; Bardot, the political figure, embodied racial hatred. Convicted five times for inciting racial hatred, Bardot remained, for three decades, an exception in French culture – the only celebrity to openly defend the far right.”\n\n\tLe Monde further said, “Her advocacy for animals went hand in hand with her Islamophobia.” Bardot first raised her voice to write a letter about animal slaughter on the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Kebir, then eventually took that objection much further. “They slaughter women and children, our monks, our civil servants, our tourists and our sheep, one day they’ll slaughter us, and we’ll have deserved it,” she wrote in foreseeing a “Muslim France.”\n\n\tBardot had been married since the 1990s to Bernard d’Ormale, who served as adviser to Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the far-right Front National. \n\n\tRoan is far from the only popular singer to have called out Bardot in song, as an iconic reference, if not necessarily a deeply personal one. Olivia Rodrigo compared the subject of her song “Lacy” to “Bardot incarnate.” Going all the way back to 1963, Bob Dylan wrote the lines on his “Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan” album: “Well, my telephone rang it would not stop / It’s President Kennedy callin’ me up / He said, My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow? / I said my friend, John, Brigitte Bardot…”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJim Jarmusch‘s “Father Mother Sister Brother,” now in theaters, is made up of three very different segments, each with a notable cast discussing the nature of their family relationships. One thing they have in common is a specific color: A deep red, the color of a jammy merlot, is a throughline that appears in each character’s contemporary clothing.\n\n\tSet in New York state, Dublin and Paris, the three segments each revolve around an adult sibling pair. While in the first two, the siblings have somewhat uncomfortable interactions with their parents, in the third Paris section, the twin brother and sister have only memories of their late parents to excavate.\n\t\n\n\tThe clothes worn by cast members including Adam Driver, Cate Blanchett and Charlotte Rampling appear to be everyday items, but costume designer Catherine George explains that all the pieces seen onscreen — even Tom Waits’ very mundane hoodie — were made by iconic French fashion house Saint Laurent, a backer of the film. \n\n\n\tThe idea for the red theme came from Jarmusch, about whom George enigmatically says, “In the last few years, he’s been seeing colors in a different way. Red specifically looks different to him than it used to.”\n\n\t“Jim called me about the movie pretty early on,” George says. \n\n\t“He said, ‘We’ve got this movie, it’s shooting in New York, Dublin and Paris.’ I’m from Ireland and shooting at home was amazing, and also shooting in Paris, incredible.”\n\n\t“And then he said, ‘Well, it’s a little complicated, because YSL will be collaborating with us, but I want you to design the costumes. We’ll be using some of their pieces that already fit the characters, but if they don’t, then you’re designing them.'”\n\t\n\n\t“Jim already had a color theme — I think it was for one character — a sort of red and pink combination, and he wanted to carry that theme through all the stories, at least the red.\n\n\t“It’s nice to start a project and already have a sort of a theme that you’re working within, rather than just grabbing at straws,” she says. “It sort of gave me a base to think about while I was designing.”\n\n\tGeorge, who has worked several times with Bong Joon Ho and also has “Die, My Love” this year, previously collaborated with Jarmusch on “The Dead Don’t Die” and “Paterson.” Below, she breaks down how the wardrobe for each segment was created.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTom Waits wore a hoodie custom made by Saint Laurent with a subtle burgundy lining. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Mubi/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPart One: Father\t\n\n\tTom Waits is an eccentric, solitary dad who is visited in his rural New York home by his wary, traditional son (played by Adam Driver) and daughter (Mayim Bialik). Driver and Bialik’s styles mirror each other; they’re both in conservative blazers over deep red sweaters, while Waits sports a casual zippered hoodie.\n\n\tDriver’s clothes were “not unlike his real clothes,” says George. “Tom’s character was a little more involved,” says George, “because he lives in a cabin and he’s portraying himself as a penniless father.”\n\n\tFor Waits, they had originally though he would wear a robe or pajamas. “We initially had thought of sort of a dressing gown for him. But when I went to fit him, I went to his studio in California and had the tailor from YSL with me, and Tom tried on the dressing gown and wasn’t quite feeling it,” she says. “When we arrived, he was in a hoodie,” she recalls. “So we used the pajamas that we’d made for him, and I said, ‘Let’s try your hoodie on with it.’ He felt more like the character, more comfortable and natural.”\n\n\tOf course, even the drab hoodie got a subtle burgundy lining.“Each each item of clothing, they would either send me images of something existing, or I would send them an image of a particular piece, and they would source the fabric. So it was a back and forth across continents,” George says.\n\n\tThough Waits’ character acts like he’s possibly broke, it turns out that might be an act — one clue is a snazzy suit he dons at the end of the segment.\n\n\t“When Tom changes at the end into a suit to go out, that was fun to make a really beautiful suit in the specific color, and his shoes I really loved,” George says. “He wore some creepers, like he wears in real life. So we had a pair made in burgundy, which were unbelievably beautiful.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharlotte Rampling’s red Saint Laurent shirtdress was adapted from a jumpsuit design. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Mubi/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPart Two: Mother\t\n\n\tIn the second segment, strait-laced Cate Blanchett and free-spirited Vicky Krieps make a once-a-year visit to their rather stiff novelist mother Charlotte Rampling in her Dublin home. The trio’s distinct personalities are evident in their wardrobes.\n\t\n\n\t“We seem to be accidentally color-coordinated,” Rampling’s character says, underlining the awkwardness. “How embarrassing!”\n\n\tWith pink-tinted hair and a fluffy fake fur coat over a printed red sweater, Krieps’ character is “a bit of a party girl,” George explains, though she’s also putting on a show — she’s possibly not the successful influencer she makes out to be.\n\n\tBlanchett’s character is frankly uptight, which is instantly signaled by the way she wears an oxford shirt over a burgundy turtleneck. Her clothes weren’t pulled from existing YSL collections, George says. “We had come up with the shirt, but then we wanted to incorporate the red, and that was, again, finding a balance. A whole red sweater would have been too much, but putting the shirt on top added to her sort of buttoned-up version of herself.”\n\n\tRampling’s character, meanwhile, makes the most of the couture tailoring in a burgundy shirtdress that was based on a YSL jumpsuit design. \n\n\t“They made beautiful pieces,” George says. “The thing with working with YSL is they have access to so much incredible fabric and their production is gorgeous. When the pieces arrived, they were beautifully made: the shoe, the bags. Even Kate’s sort of dowdy pieces were really beautifully made and executed.”\n\n\tBut even YSL pieces need to be aged to make them look lived in, she says.\n\n\t“I find it jarring when I see something that looks too fresh, too new, if the character is not that kind of person. You know, Tom’s hoodie, his his sweatshirt, his pajamas — they all went through a process of being washed and aged,” says George, though she adds that Rampling’s character is the type who would take very good care of her clothes.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLuka Sabbat and Indya Moore play twin siblings, who wear leather jackets with slightly different designs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Mubi/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPart Three: Sister, Brother\t\n\n\tIn the final segment, siblings played by Indya Moore and Luka Sabbat drive through Paris to their late parents’ empty apartment to talk about their family. They’re as naturalistic and free-spirited as the other siblings are rigid.\n\n\t“They’re twins and they have some kind of psychic messaging system, and their biker jackets, even though they’re two different versions, are quite similar,” says George. “His is a classic sort of motorcycle jacket, and hers is more of a fashion type.”\n\t\n\n\tThough the color theme isn’t as obvious, Indya’s character does wear a red tank top, which was based on a piece George actually owned but in a Saint Laurent-designed version.\n\n\tAs for Sabbat’s character, “We decided to keep him in a classic white T-shirt as just a sort of iconic movie character,” she says.\n\n\tAfter working on fantastical films such as “Mickey 17” and “Snowpiercer,” George says working with Saint Laurent was a welcome change of pace. “It was nice to get very specific and go back to a combination of costumes and fashion. I trained in fashion design, so it was nice to combine the two things.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLuka Sabbat, left, wore a classic white t-shirt, while Indya Moore’s red tank top was based on one owned by costumer designer Catherine George.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“Father Mother Sister Brother” (Courtesy of Yorick Le Saux/Vague Notion)\n\t\n\n\n",

In the clip, they watch footage taken outside the courthouse where Combs’ trial took place as headlines about their father flash across the screen. The trailer ends with Justin receiving a prepaid call from New Jersey’s FCI Fort Dix, where Combs is currently serving out his 50-month sentence.\n\t\n\n\n\tCombs’ sons were on hand to support him through his criminal trial earlier this year, and Justin spent Christmas Day visiting his father in prison. Combs himself hasn’t given up on overturning his conviction, filing an appeal two days before Christmas. In the filing, Combs’ lawyer Alexandra A.E. Shapiro argued that his sentence was greater than it should have been, and that the ruling Judge Aran Subramanian defied the jury’s verdict by “[acting] as the 13th juror.”\n\n\n\tCombs was the recent subject of Netflix’s popular “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” docuseries, a four-episode chronicle of the mogul’s life as told through the perspective of his close associates. “The Reckoning,” directed by Alexandria Stapleton and executive produced by Combs’ longtime foe 50 Cent, featured footage commissioned to be shot in the week leading up to his Sept. 2024 arrest on federal sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution, and racketeering charges.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tSome comeback!\n\n\tThe past 12 months were supposed to turn things around for struggling cinemas. But instead of heralding a dramatic return to moviegoing, 2025 is running neck-and-neck with the middling 2024 box office, and will fall far short of the $9 billion in domestic ticket sales that most analysts expected the theatrical movie business to easily eclipse. Prior to the pandemic, North American revenues would regularly hit between $10 billion to $11 billion. The 2025 results are a massive disappointment that no amount of spin can change. (Already there’s talk of how much better 2026 will be.)\n\t\n\n\t“There’s an unfortunate trend, which that we just can’t get the industry to $9 billion at the domestic box office,” says Mike Sherrill, the chief operating officer of dine-in cinema chain Alamo Drafthouse. “It looks like it’s going to be two years in a row that the industry flatlined.”\n\n\n\tMore worrisome is the reality that many of the movie business’s biggest franchises are showing signs of oversaturation or fatigue. Marvel continued to struggle with its B Team heroes; February’s “Captain America: Brave New World” and May’s “Thunderbolts” lost tens of millions during their theatrical runs, while July’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” will only eke out a modest profit. And even though “Avatar: Fire and Ash” ($760 million and counting), “Wicked: For Good” ($504 million) and “Jurassic World Rebirth” ($869 million) will rank among the year’s top-grossing releases, they will fail to match the revenues of previous films in their respective series. Clearly, the theatrical industry can’t thrive on sequels and spinoffs alone.\n\t\n\n\tIt would be easy to declare an end to comic book movies. That said, genres have risen and fallen throughout Hollywood history — just look at musicals or westerns or raunchy comedies, which have faded in popularity after once being surefire draws. What really has theater owners and some studio chiefs concerned as the year closes out is what the future will hold if Netflix is able to secure government approval for its $82.7 billion deal to buy Warner Bros. Already, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has hinted that he believes that “windows,” industry jargon for the amount of time that movies play exclusively in theaters, are too long. He told Wall Street shortly after the pact was announced that he expects that they will “evolve” in a more “consumer friendly” direction. Everyone knows exactly what he meant by that.\n\n\tFor cinemas, it’s nothing short of an existential threat. During COVID, studios abbreviated the gap between a film’s theatrical release and its home entertainment debut, only to discover that customers got accustomed to waiting to watch movies until they hit streaming or on-demand platforms. If windows keep shrinking, theaters may lose their competitive advantage.\n\n\tThere were also reasons to feel optimistic about the trajectory of an industry that has been knocked down and counted out for half-a-decade. China, which had been hostile to Hollywood fare since the pandemic, embraced a few major studio releases such as “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” signaling that one of the world’s biggest moviegoing markets is still accessible to certain U.S. productions. Of course, China is doing just fine without Hollywood — thank you, very much. The year’s highest-grossing release isn’t an English-language production but rather the Chinese animated sequel “Ne Zha 2,” which has generated more than $2.1 billion globally, despite the fact that most Americans would draw a blank at the title.\n\n\tFamily films and video game adaptations proved irresistible to audiences, who flocked to theaters to see the likes of “A Minecraft Movie,” “Lilo & Stitch” and “Zootopia 2.” The three films, all of which carry PG ratings, were the three highest-grossing Hollywood productions, with “A Minecraft Movie” tapping out just shy of $1 billion and “Lilo & Stitch” and “Zootopia 2” both crossing that threshold. It’s the second consecutive year that PG films outgrossed their PG-13 counterparts, which is notable because it’s usually the other way around. Meanwhile anime proved to be a massive boon, with “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” and “Chainsaw Man” scoring back-to-back wins for Sony-owned Crunchyroll.\n\t\n\n\t“What happened with ‘Demon Slayer’ is great because it opens a new category of film,” says Sherrill of Alamo Drafthouse. “About 49% of the audience was under 24 years old. That’s so important because we need to be thinking about what’s going to be relevant for the next generation of moviegoers.” \n\n\tComic book content is no longer king. After being the most popular genre for over a decade, these movies have recently looked a lot less superhuman. The latest “Captain America” suffered from a prolonged post-production and extensive rewrites, with critics piling on when the film debuted in February. Although “Fantastic Four” and “Thunderbolts” movies were much better regarded, they still failed to match the kind of grosses that Marvel movies used to routinely achieve before the pandemic. Marvel Studios will have a chance to recapture its box office prowess with next July’s “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” as well as December’s “Avengers: Doomsday,” which brings back Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans.\n\n\tMarvel’s rival, DC Films, fared better with “Superman,” a generally well-received Man of Steel adventure that grossed $616 million. A lot had been riding on the success of the film, which centers on the most recognizable name in DC Comics. James Gunn, who took over DC with Peter Safran in 2022, directed the film and positioned it as a reset for a company in desperate need of a fresh direction. For years, DC films such as “Justice League” and “The Flash” have been slammed as too dark and dense. Gunn and Safran wanted to recapture the humor and hope that defined Richard Donner’s 1978 classic, “Superman.” DC’s real challenge will come next year when the studio fields films like “Supergirl” and “Clayface,” which are based on far lesser known characters.\n\n\t“We needed to have the DC logo be synonymous with quality again,” Safran says. “For too long, our movies had suffered from real inconsistency. It takes time to develop a positive reputation, but this put us on the right track.”\n\n\tIt was a disappointing year for many adult-oriented dramas, with the likes of “The Smashing Machine,” “Bugonia” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” failing to make much of a dent at the box office. However, some studios took artistic gambles that paid off handsomely, none more so than Warner Bros., which bet on idiosyncratic horror films like Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” and Zach Cregger’s “Weapons,” both of which attracted huge crowds after they debuted to rave reviews. And awards buzz helped another of the studio’s auteur-driven films, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” gross more than $200 million. The only problem: With a budget of $140 million and tens of millions spent on marketing, the film stands to lose $100 million theatrically since studios and exhibitors essentially split ticket sales.\n\t\n\n\t“The good news is that when a movie catches the eye of a filmgoing audience, they are ready and excited to go. We saw all kinds of movies work this year,” says Adam Fogelson, chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “The challenge is if you have something that, for whatever reason, doesn’t spark people’s interest, the floor is non-existent, regardless of the level of star power. You can have a movie that the audience likes and no one goes to see.”\n\n\tTom Cruise’s star power may be dimming, as evidenced by the diminished returns of the mega-budgeted “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.” It ranks among the year’s biggest bombs and may put Ethan Hunt on hiatus, at least until Cruise’s adventure films get less costly. But other talent is ascending to the A-list. Timothée Chalamet, for example, proved that he’s one of the hottest names in movies. The 30-year-old actor has helped make A24’s “Marty Supreme,” a period movie about ping pong, into an unlikely holiday season hit. Credit goes to the star who helped mastermind a promotional push that saw him deploy everything from bright orange blimps to viral videos in service of the indie drama — the marketing blitz drew TikTok fans, as well as arthouse aficionados.\n\n\tMovie theaters have also relied heavily on premium large formats like Imax and Dolby. The popularity of those screens, which are more expensive than the average movie ticket, has helped to offset the decline in attendance. For visual spectacles like “Avatar: Fire and Ash” or “F1: The Movie,” those PLFs have accounted for 50% to 60% of overall sales. Although industry sales were essentially flat, Imax delivered its best-ever year at the box office with $1.2 billion globally.\n\n\t“We branched out in genres,” says Imax’s CEO Richard Gelfond. “We were known more in 2022 and 2023 for superhero movies and sequels. This year, we did a lot more in horror and family films. Three of the four biggest animated films in our history were this year, which I don’t think is a coincident. The public’s attitude is expanding to the kind of films they like to see in Imax.”\n\n\tHe suggests that “more diversified content would help insulate theaters from some Hollywood changes.”\n\n\tExhibitors have, in fact, been turning to alternative content to populate their screens during the slower months. “Kill Bill” or “Back to the Future” re-releases or “Jaws” anniversary screenings have helped Alamo, for one, pace 5% ahead of the industry’s year-over-year returns. But cinema operators are keenly aware that oldies aren’t going to keep the lights on by themselves. They need Hollywood to supply the kind of new releases that turn multiplexes back into the epicenter of culture.\n\t\n\n\t“I would like to think that studios and distributors are looking at the trends and seeing that original, fresh stories are working,” says Sherrill. “So don’t just give me 20 more movies. Give me 20 more of the stuff that’s meaningful for people.”\n\n\tWill those type of films fill marquees in 2026? This year, they certainly didn’t.\n",

    "body": "\n\tShane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov’s journey may be over for now — “Heated Rivarly” Season 2 is likely not coming until 2027 — but Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie have the perfect solution to hold fans over.\n\n\tThe actors are set to narrate “Ember & Ice,” Quinn’s three-episode immersive audio romance. Per the official logline, “Ember & Ice” follows fae princes Dane and Finn from rival Solari and Lunare kingdoms. The series, “set in a richly imagined fantasy world shaped by history, duty, and forbidden desire,” is “a story about choosing love in defiance of expectation” and amplifies “every moment of tension, longing, and intimacy.”\n\t\n\n\tQuinn confirmed that Storrie will not be reading in an accent as he does in “Heated Rivalry,” posting on X, “We tried.” While some Quinn original stories feature the main character speaking directly to the reader, this will be a gay romance, without a self-insert listener character.\n\n\n\t“Hudson and Connor have a really special chemistry, and we feel incredibly lucky to work with them,” says Quinn founder and CEO Caroline Spiegel. “The way they connect with audiences and show up in the cultural conversation is exciting to watch.”\n\n\tThe first two episodes will debut on Dec. 30, exclusively on Quinn, the leading audio erotica platform and the destination for female-first audio erotica. The company works with both non-celebrity narrators and voice actors, both known as “creators,” who tell stories directly to the audience members, placing the listener as the main character.\n\n\tSince 2022, Quinn Originals has partnered with multiple recognizable actors to lead storytelling. Christopher Briney joined following the end of “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” Previously narrators include Andrew Scott, Tom Blyth, Jamie Campbell Bower, Manny Jacinto, Jesse Williams, Victoria Pedretti, Thomas Doherty, Lucien Laviscount and Katherine Moennig.\n\t\n\n\tThe new romance comes on the heels of the “Heated Rivalry” finale, which dropped on Dec. 26. The Canadian series was a massive hit for both Bell Media’s Crave streamer and HBO Max, once they bought it and decided to push it out this year instead of waiting until 2026. It’s since been renewed for a second season.\n\n\tCasey Bloys was surprised when the show became such a quick smash hit for the streamer. “I thought it would be kind of a very specific, maybe gay-only show, but it really is a broader audience than that. From a business point of view, the money we spent for acquisition was an incredible investment,” he recently told Variety. “I’ve been at HBO for over 20 years. I’ve done a lot of shows with sex scenes. I think what was interesting about them here was, for anybody who has been closeted for any amount of time, and especially in the show — that kind of high-pressure situation of a professional sports team, where coming out is even harder — the sex was a little bit more reflective of that feeling of ‘You’re never going to find this again.’ It was intense, but to me, it amplified what they were trying to do with the storytelling. That said, I’m not complaining that they were attractive and hot. And I will say, as I told Jacob [Tierney], very well-directed.”\n\n\tSee exclusive photos from “Ember & Ice” below:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat a difference a Super Bowl makes. Last year, Fox was down double digits in Variety‘s year-end ranker of the year’s most-watched networks in primetime. But in 2025, Fox had the Big Game: And a a result, the network was up double digits in both total viewers and adults 18-49 (where it was No. 1).\n\n\tBut don’t count out the strength of regular programming, as CBS — even sans Super Bowl, which it broadcast in 2024 — managed to stay No. 1 in total viewers thanks to series like “Tracker” and “60 Minutes.” ABC, meanwhile, was up 5%, after being virtually flat in 2024 — meaning for two years in a row, the Alphabet net has managed to keep the viewership erosion at bay. In an age where primetime numbers are naturally going down as audiences flock to streaming, that’s nearly a miracle. (Well, and ABC has been helped by airing more NFL Monday Night Football games the past two years.)\n\t\n\n\tThis reps the first year that Nielsen’s big data + panel ratings were implemented, which now mix both Nielsen panel data from viewers along with set-top box and smart TV datasets. That has caused some grumbling in the industry, given some missing data and inaccuracies that have been found. It also makes year-to-year comparisons that might be a bit apples and oranges. Most noticable in this year’s charts are a stabilization in the primetime ratings for kids’ networks Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. After years of annual double-digit declines, Disney was down slightly in 2025, and Nick was actually up (both saw gains in 18-49). No one believes that kids have suddenly started watching linear again — but no one can really explain the change there, other than perhaps a quirk in this year’s methodology.\n\t\n\n\tTomorrow, Variety will share the ranker of this year’s most-watched primetime telecasts. But here, we recount which networks were up and down in 2025.\n\n\tFox Corp.: Fox famously downsized after selling its studio operations and most of its networks to Disney — but the channels it held on to did quite well in 2025. Fox was up 10% in both total viewers and adults 18-49 (where it was No. 1), thanks to the power of the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Fox News defied the post-election downward trend seen by MS Now (formerly MSNBC) and CNN.\n\n\tThe CW: Speaking of controversial companies that had reason to cheer, Nexstar saw its The CW network climb 13% in total viewers, while Newsnation grew 16% — albeit, from low numbers. But a shift toward more live sports is clearly having an impact on The CW, which also saw its adults 18-49 rating climb a hair.\n\n\tESPN: Sports! ESPN’s still got it, and this year climbed 18% — the most of any network in the top 30 among total viewers. The other big story is ESPN in adults 18-49, where this year it’s one of the Big 4 — jumping 10% to rank as the No. 4 network in primetime, beating out CBS.\n\n\tTruTV: Ooh la la! The French Open clearly had an impact on Tru TV, a channel that has gone through many lives (starting as Court TV, then later as a reality-focused channel, then the comedy-focused home of “Impractical Jokers”). This year, which this year shed most of its remaining comedy product (“Impractical Jokers” is now on TBS) to focus even more as a secondary home for TNT Sports fare. That paid off when it came to the French Open, which included wall-to-wall replays and coverage on Tru TV. Ratings for the full tournament were up 25% this year on TNT and TruTV, and that probably explains why TruTV bucked the trend of cablers (including its other Warner Bros. Discovery siblings), jumping 46% in viewers and 27% in 18-49. (Again, those percentages are huge because TruTV was coming in at a much smaller audience.)\n\t\n\t\tLOSERS\t\n\n\tFamilies: Channels with “Family” in their titles did not fare well in 2025. Family Entertainment TV, down 29%. Great American Family, down 18%. Hallmark Family, down 14%. Discovery Family Channel, down 22%. To be fair, it’s tough out there for virtually all linear cable networks. If families are still watching TV together, it’s not on these “family” channels.\n\t\n\n\tDr. Phil: One-time talk powerhouse Dr. Phil McGraw launched his Merit Street TV network (now just “Merit TV”) in 2024 and got on the board with a paltry average of 27,000 viewers. Just a year later, Merit Street Media filed for bankruptcy and sued its joint venture partners at the Trinity Broadcasting Network. The channel still exists as a shell of its ambition, and in 2025 dropped the most of any network on our ranker: down 41%, to an average of just 16,000 viewers in primetime.\n\n\n\tBelow are the primetime rankers for broadcast, cable and premium cable networks in 2025, among total viewers (as well as the top 50 list in adults 18-49).

Kids will also relish a long list of animated titles, from the original “Hoppers,” “GOAT” and “The Cat in the Hat” to the anticipated sequels “Toy Story 5,” “Minions 3” and “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.” Beyond animation, families can also look forward to a live-action “Moana” remake and a fourth “Jumanji” film before the year’s end.\n\n\tThis year will also see Star Wars, Marvel and DC make splashes on the big screen as “The Mandalorian and Grogu” takes us back to a galaxy far, far away in May, “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” and “Supergirl” swing and fly into view over the summer and “Avengers: Doomsday” brings its exhaustive list of heroes to theaters at the end of the year.\n\n\tMeanwhile, two of the most celebrated filmmakers working today will return to theaters as Universal releases Steven Spielberg’s “Disclosure Day” and Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” over the summer. Both stand to be epic spectacles and potential box office juggernauts.\n\n\tHere some of the most highly-anticipated films of next year:\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGreenland 2: Migration (Jan. 9)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of STXfilms\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe sequel to the 2020 disaster film “Greenland” is set after a comet strike destroyed most of Earth.

An investigative grand jury can be useful to subpoena and then force uncooperative witnesses to testify.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Our sources say, however, the grand jury that has been hearing witnesses in the Celeste Rivas murder is actually one that will vote on indictments, and multiple sources tell TMZ that authorities -- including prosecutor Beth Silverman -- believe D4vd was involved in the death of Rivas.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TMZ.com\n          \n\n          TMZ broke the story ... earlier this month D4vd's day-to-day manager, Robert Morgenroth, testified for days. A TMZ reporter heard Morgenroth tell his lawyer in the courtroom hallway, Silverman was \"very pushy\" as to why he didn't call the police. He said he responded by saying it wasn't his responsibility and his job was to make sure D4vd's tour kept going.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Grand juries generally do what prosecutors want ... in no small part because the target -- in this case D4vd -- has no right to present a defense.\n      \n    \n          There was also talk in the courtroom hallway ... the grand jury could hear witnesses in February, so don't expect a quick indictment.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Beth Silverman\n              \n                          \n                Celeste Rivas\n              \n                          \n                D4vd\n              \n                          \n                D4vd Tesla Case\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Collective Artists Network has rolled out its inaugural content slate through HistoryVerse, with stories drawing from Indian mythology and history.\n\n\tThe outfit has revealed eight titles spanning theatrical features and streaming series under Collective Studios, the firm’s newly established unified production entity consolidating original content development across its platforms.\n\n\n\tThe projects draw inspiration from prominent figures and traditions in Indian mythology and history, including Hanuman, Krishna, Shiva, Shivaji, Durga, Kali, and Swami Samarth. The previously released AI-powered “Mahabharat” series serves as the initial entry in HistoryVerse’s long-term strategy for adapting culturally-rooted material for contemporary audiences.\n\t\n\n\tAmong the newly announced titles, three are being packaged as theatrical releases while two will be formatted as series, with additional projects currently in various development phases. The productions are being designed to deliver scale and immersive detail across their narratives. The slate aims to reach audiences across multiple demographics and territories.\n\n\n\tThe productions are being developed as AI-native projects, integrating generative AI, 3D/CG animation, VFX, and selective live-action elements through the company’s proprietary technology platform. AI tools are primarily deployed for world-building and environmental design, with AI-powered 3D and animation handling character design and motion. Live-action reference footage is incorporated selectively to enhance realism and transfer performance elements, with the overall production pipeline engineered to meet theatrical, broadcast, and streaming distribution standards.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve always believed that our folklore is among the richest in the world, and that these stories, woven into the core of our cultural fabric, deserve a global stage,” said Vijay Subramaniam, founder and group CEO of Collective Artists Network. “As HistoryVerse grows, our vision goes beyond films and series to include experiences, consumer brands, and gaming; building a larger ecosystem around these stories for audiences to engage with.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAcclaimed Indian filmmakers Shoojit Sircar and Vikramaditya Motwane have joined forces to present “Thursday Special,” a short film by Indian National Award winner Varun Tandon that has earned significant recognition on the international festival circuit.\n\n\tThe intimate drama, which explores themes of love, companionship and the passage of time, recently claimed the Most Poetic Film Award at Serbia’s Küstendorf Film Festival 2025, a distinction personally selected by renowned director Emir Kusturica. \n\t\n\n\t“Thursday Special” stars Anubha Fatehpuria and Ramakanth Dayama as Ram and Shakuntala, an elderly married couple whose relationship is anchored by their mutual passion for food and a weekly Thursday tradition. Karan Luthra produces, with Tandon penning the script alongside co-writer and executive producer Krati Tandon.\n\n\n\tSircar, whose directing credits include “Piku,” “Vicky Donor” and “October,” praised the film’s understated approach. “Thursday Special really moved me with its simplicity and gentle storytelling,” he said, drawing comparisons to his own unreleased feature “Shoe Bite,” which starred Amitabh Bachchan.\n\n\t“Varun’s nuanced portrayal of companionship, ageing, and love is heartfelt and mature. It’s a delicately handled take on marriage and middle-age relationships – especially impressive for a young filmmaker – and it reminded me, in a way, of my unreleased film Shoe Bite,” Sircar added. “The storytelling in ‘Thursday Special’ is clear and sincere, with every department serving the story. Knowing that Varun has made over 15 short films highlighted his passion and dedication, and I felt both he and the film deserved support.”\n\t\n\n\tMotwane, known for pushing boundaries in contemporary Indian cinema, emphasized the film’s focus on overlooked narratives. “When I watched ‘Thursday Special’, I was struck by the fact that though all the stories we tell are human stories, we tend to forget that there are so many other stories out there in the mundane, and in the lives of people who you would not expect to have unique stories,” he said.\n\n\t“I really enjoyed the film. I think people should see it, and they will like it. It’s a film that you can talk about and discuss and not just from an aesthetic perspective. While it’s beautifully directed and performed, it is truly special in terms of pure story, pure feeling,” Motwane added.\n\n\tFor Tandon, whose short “Syaahi” earned a Special Jury Award at the Indian National Film Awards, the project represents a long-cherished creative vision. “This is a story that has stayed in my heart for years. I was taken over by the sheer excitement and curiosity to see these characters on screen and watch their lives unfold,” said the filmmaker, who also directed the documentary short “Dribbling Dreams.”\n\n\t“Thursday Special is a heartfelt portrayal of a couple whose lives revolve around their shared passion for food. Through their weekly tradition, we delve into their world and witness the intricate layers of their relationship,” Tandon added.\n\n\tThe short has amassed more than 25 awards across global festivals since its premiere at Mecal Pro in Barcelona. Notable wins include Best Narrative Short at the New York Indian Film Festival, Best International Short Film at the Adelaide Independent Film Festival, and Best Narrative Short at the Tryon International Film Festival.\n\n\tThe film is set for release on Jan. 29 via the Humans of Cinema YouTube channel.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Beckham family feud has boiled over from tabloid fascination to a burning Hollywood scandal.\n\n\tBrooklyn Beckham released a lengthy statement to his Instagram Stories on Monday morning, accusing his parents, David and Victoria, of trying to “control the narratives” around his life and “trying endlessly to ruin” his relationship with wife Nicola Peltz. The eldest Beckham has been estranged from his family for roughly three years, a painful saga with Instagram unfollows and endless press leaks that have overshadowed the public profiles and work of all involved since it began. \n\t\n\n\t“I had been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private,” Beckham wrote. “Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed. I do not want to reconcile with my family. I’m not being controlled, I’m standing up for myself for the first time in my life.”\n\n\n\tA  rep for David Beckham had no comment. Representatives for Victoria Beckham did not immediately respond to a request from Variety. The family dynamic that Brooklyn Beckham alleged in his confessional social media post paints a deeply unflattering portrait of his father and siblings. Victoria Beckham gets the worst of it, accused of momzilla behavior that instantly prompts the question, “Ryan Murphy adaptation, when?” in Hollywood these days. \n\n\tBeckham accused his parents of putting “countless lies” in the media about him and his family. He described his relationship with his parents and siblings as “inauthentic,” buoyed by “performative social media posts” and family events.\n\t\n\n\tBeckham also claimed his parents tried everything they could to curb his relationship with Peltz. He said his mom “cancelled making Nicola’s dress in the eleventh hour” and “attempted to bribe” him into signing away the rights to his name before he got married.\n\n\tOn his wedding day, Beckham said his mother hijacked his first dance with Peltz and “danced very inappropriately” on him.\n\n\tHe recalled, “Marc Anthony called me to the stage, where in the schedule was a planned to be my roamntic dance with my wife but instead my mum was waiting to dance with me instead. She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I’ve never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.”\n\n\tHe ended his statement by saying the narrative that his wife controls his life is “completely backwards,” and instead, it’s his parents who have been manipulating him. These are the kind of pearl-clutching specifics that can derail press tours for ventures like Victoria’s eponymous fashion brand, as well as tarnish a complicated Beckham legacy that seemingly settled with the family enshrined in a bubble of adoration and protection. \n\n\t“My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press or manipulation,” he concluded. “All we want is peace, privacy and happiness for us and our future family.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothy Busfield will be edited out of the upcoming Amazon MGM film “You Deserve Each Other” after he was accused of groping a 7-year-old boy on the set of “The Cleaning Lady,” Variety had learned.\n\n\tThis is the second project involving Busfield to be affected in the wake of his sexual abuse allegations. On Jan. 12, NBC pulled an episode of “Law & Order: SVU” that guest-starred Busfield from its schedule. The episode was set to debut on Jan. 22.\n\t\n\n\tOn Jan. 9, an arrest warrant was issued against Busfield on two counts of sexual abuse involving a minor. The investigation stems from twin boys who appeared on the TV series “The Cleaning Lady” in 2022. Busfield was the director at the time.\n\n\n\tOn Jan. 13, Busfield turned himself in at the Metro Detention Center in Albuquerque. He will remain there until his court hearing on Tuesday. He faces three charges — two counts of criminal sexual contact with a child, which carry a maximum sentence of six years each, and one count of child abuse, which carries a maximum of three years.\n\n\tBusfield was top billed in “You Deserve Each Other” on IMDb, which could suggest a significant contribution to the picture. Other cast members include Penn Badgley, Meghann Fahy, Justin Long, Kyle MacLachlan, Natalie Morales, Ana Gasteyer, Hope Davis, Delaney Rowe and Lisa Gilroy.\n\n\tThe film is directed by Marc Silverstein and Abby Kohn and is based on Sarah Hogle’s novel of the same name. According to the official logline, the film follows “Naomi (Fahy) and Nick (Badgley) who are about to get married and live happily ever after –– the only problem being they’ve fallen completely out of love. With the wedding rapidly approaching and its pressure mounting, they both resolve to secretly push the other into calling off the wedding, only to fall back in love along the way.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt Variety, we talk a lot about the soft power of the red carpet. We live in an age where “image architect” is a vaunted job title, thanks to the serious economic and cultural impact the right look can offer stars and brands. \n\n\tWe can largely thank Valentino Garavani, who died at 93 on Monday, for creating this mutually beneficial relationship. In the late ’70s, European fashion houses became global enterprises. As the designer of deeply glamorous and dreamlike gowns, Mr. Valentino (as he was known) saw the writing on the wall. Celebrities and artists — particularly actresses — would come to reinvent how fashion captivated culture and commerce. His muses are renowned, from Jackie Kennedy to Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia Roberts to Cate Blanchett.\n\t\n\n\tCelebrated documentary filmmaker Matt Tyrnauer (above, far right) chronicled the designer’s opulent lifestyle and pioneering spirit in the 2008 movie “Valentino: The Last Emperor.” The project premiered at the Venice Film Festival that year, and would spark a subgenre of fashion docs that gave glimpses into the pain, mess and belief it takes to inspire the masses and sell big.\n\n\n\tWe caught up with Tyrnauer just hours after the Valentino news hit, drawing tributes from the likes of Paltrow and Colman Domingo, to discuss the designer’s legacy in show business and his notoriously mercurial personality. \n\t\n\t\tYour movie, now almost 20 years old, shows how prescient Valentino was in bringing celebrities into the fashion world. What will his legacy be in our town? \t\n\n\tValentino was at the forefront of Hollywood’s love affair with fashion in the late 20th century and the early 21st. He was one of the first high fashion designers to embrace movie stars hardcore. Before that, fashion was really focused on socialites and aristocrats. It was Valentino and his partner, Giancarlo Giammetti, who really pushed hard to have actresses wear his clothes. Being a global movie star at that time was an extraordinarily potent type of fame. Fashion began to be redefined by movie stars wearing your clothes, not only out in public or on the red carpet, but sometimes in the films themselves. Valentino was essential for that movement from high society to Hollywood being an important part of the fashion universe.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWho were some of his biggest muses? \t\n\n\tElizabeth Taylor and, in Italy, Monica Vitti were two of the first. Through the years, we saw Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Hathaway, the “Kates” (meaning Cate Blanchett and Kate Winslet), Claire Danes, Julia Roberts. It was Jackie Kennedy, though not a movie star, who was the glamorous woman who made him a household name. She was the first First Lady to bring a movie-star-level candlepower to that position.\n\t\n\t\tYou had unprecedented access to Valentino for your film. What’s the thing that will stay with you?\t\n\n\tI never saw anyone live a lifestyle like Valentino. It was so over the top, beyond description. There were villas and chateaus and chalets and Fifth Avenue apartments. Not one pug, not two pugs, but five pugs. And multiple servants in white gloves to tend to the pugs. Gianni Agnelli famously said, ”I live like a king, but Valentino lives better than me. And I don’t know how he does it.” \n\t\n\t\tYou were very open about having big creative disagreements with Valentino during filming. How do you reflect on it now?\t\n\n\tWhat really defined the whole production was the warm embrace of Valentino, and then the really unspeakable tantrum. It was a seesawing motion throughout, and I put some of that in the film. He had no editorial control over the film. He hated the film. When he first saw it, it premiered at the Venice Film Festival. He got a 10-minute standing ovation after, and he quickly turned into a big fan. He was extraordinary at doing the press attendant to the film, which was a surprise hit. I have nothing but affection and fondness and respect for Valentino and Giancarlo Giamatti. They were absolutely extraordinary people to spend that much time with, and they really did let me into their world. It was extremely brave. At the end of the day, we went into the success of the film arm-in-arm. It was an unforgettable moment. And it really did go around the world. It was a very happy ending.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDon’t doubt the hustle of Marty Mauser.\n\n\tA24‘s “Marty Supreme,” a sports dramedy starring Timothée Chalamet as a fictional table tennis champ, has surpassed $100 million globally. It’s the fourth A24 release to ever cross this box office milestone after 2022’s Oscar best picture winner “Everything Everywhere All at Once” ($142 million), 2024’s dystopian thriller “Civil War” ($127 million) and last year’s romantic drama “Materialists” ($107 million). This benchmark is especially impressive because it’s been a challenging time for arthouse releases; “Marty Supreme” and “Materialists” were 2025’s only independent films to generate above $100 million.\n\t\n\n\tThanks to Chalamet’s unconventional marketing efforts and glowing word-of-mouth from critics and audiences, “Marty Supreme” has earned $102.3 million worldwide, including $80.8 million in the United States and $21.5 million overseas. Top international markets include the United Kingdom with $16 million, Canada with $5.7 million and Mexico with $944,000. (Canada is traditionally a part of North American grosses, but A24 only distributes its films in the U.S. and partners with companies such as Entertainment Film Distributors, Elevation and Sun Distribution Group for other territories.)\n\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” recently became A24’s highest-grossing movie in the U.S. after overtaking the benchmark held by “Everything Everywhere All at Once” with $77 million. Where “Marty” will end up on A24’s worldwide charts remains to be seen. However, the film is likely to remain a draw in the States through awards season, and it’s yet to be released in several overseas markets. “Marty Supreme” debuts next weekend in 12 territories, including Australia, Brazil and Italy.\n\t\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” cost $70 million, which makes it A24’s most expensive film to date and means it hasn’t climbed out of the red. (Remember: Theater owners keep about half of ticket sales.) However, “Marty Supreme” has been valuable to A24 on the awards circuit (Chalamet won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice for best actor) and is expected to be a major contender when Oscar nominations are announced on Thursday. Josh Safdie directed the frenetic, R-rated adventure, which follows Marty Mauser as he goes through hell and back to pursue his dream of becoming the world’s best ping pong player.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKarine Jean-Pierre is ready to take the stage.\n\n\tThe former White House press secretary for President Joe Biden is stepping into a new kind of spotlight as the host of this year’s 17th annual African American Film Critics Awards, revealed exclusively to Variety.\n\n\tJean-Pierre, 51, joins an impressive roster of earlier AAFCA emcees, following last year’s Amber Ruffin, the comedian who led the film ceremony, and “American Idol” Season 6 winner Jordin Sparks, who hosted the organization’s 2025 television honors. The ceremony, celebrating achievements in filmmaking, will take place Feb. 8 in Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tHonorees this year include Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson and director Ryan Coogler, alongside animated feature breakout “KPop Demon Hunters.” Winners are selected by more than 100 members of the African American Film Critics Association.\n\n\n\tJean-Pierre is no stranger to making history. She served as the 35th White House press secretary from 2022 to 2025, becoming the first Black person and the first openly LGBTQ individual to hold the role. Hosting the awards marks a notable shift in trajectory for the veteran political adviser, and one she does not take lightly.\n\n\t“I don’t want it to be about me,” Jean-Pierre tells Variety. “I’m playing a tiny part here. My job is to honor, celebrate and lift the brilliant artists who are being recognized.”\n\n\tJean-Pierre has long admired AAFCA’s mission and leadership, making it “an easy yes” to accept the hosting gig. “The AAFCA Awards have spent 17 years celebrating extraordinary contributions in film, and I am just so in awe of Gil Robertson and the team,” she says. “The mission is to honor storytellers who explore the many faces of humanity through diverse perspectives. Why not help lift that up?”\n\t\n\n\tDespite being one of the most recognizable communicators in American politics, Jean-Pierre is adamant that the evening will remain focused on the artists. “One of the things I learned in the press comms world is don’t make yourself the news,” she says. “I want it to be light, enjoyable, smooth and let the stars shine.”\n\n\tWith politics touching nearly every facet of daily life, Jean-Pierre’s post-White House career has differed from her predecessors. One would have expected her to pivot into cable news or become a political pundit, a common next step for former press secretaries. When asked about whether that absence was a conscious choice, Jean-Pierre is direct, describing her career as one that has never been about following a prescribed route.\n\n\t“I’ve always seen myself as someone who does things differently,” she says. “I don’t follow a set path or look at the people before me and copy their trajectory — that’s just never been who I am. I like to do things my own way and ask myself, ‘How can I make an impact? How can I be different?’”\n\n\tAmong those she’s excited to meet are several of the night’s honorees, particularly the cast and filmmakers behind “Sinners,” which she calls “one of the most brilliant pieces of work I’ve seen in a long time.”\n\n\t“I’ve never met Michael B. Jordan,” she says with excitement. “And Ryan Coogler — just touching him would be amazing. He’s so incredibly brilliant.”\n\n\tJean-Pierre, who recently published her memoir “Independent,” says hosting aligns with a broader desire to tell stories beyond the political arena. While she plans to remain engaged in civic discourse after two decades in politics, she views this next chapter as an opportunity to expand her impact through storytelling and mentorship.\n\n\tAfter spending 20 years in politics, Jean-Pierre says her focus is now on lifting up communities she cares about. Most recently, she acquired the rights to the stories of Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne, the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps, and wants Hollywood to tell their stories.  “The women asked presidents questions and were often ignored by the boys’ club, and yet so few people know their names,” Jean-Pierre says with passion. “I recently acquired their books, and I want to help bring their stories to life.”\n\t\n\n\tIn November 2023, while still serving as press secretary, she honored their legacy by dedicating the White House lectern in their names.\n\n\tHer next career chapter, she says, will focus on telling stories that matter — potentially as a producer and writer — while continuing to mentor young people and develop new writing projects.\n\n\t“My career has always been a zigzag,” she says. “I move toward what excites me and what feels meaningful, and that’s how I want to continue doing things: my way.”\n\n\tStill, Jean-Pierre acknowledges that hosting an awards ceremony during a moment of political and cultural turbulence carries added weight.\n\n\t“We need this right now,” she asserts. “We need an opportunity and a space to celebrate ourselves — to be seen in this way, and for little boys and girls in our community to see us in this way.”\n\n\tAs conversations around diversity and inclusion remain fraught, Jean-Pierre views events like the AAFCA Awards as essential.\n\n\t“We cannot let our stories die. We must continue to be bold and tell those stories. There is real value in telling our journeys so that generations to come can see how brilliant we are.”\n\n\tGil Robertson, AAFCA president and co-founder, said he is “elated” to welcome Jean-Pierre into the organization’s family.\n\n\t“She’s current, credible and brilliant,” Robertson says. “She has a background in journalism and has occupied positions at the very center of popular events. We love her energy and her vibe, and it’s what people expect from us — smart hosts who are part of the conversation.”\n\n\tAs Jean-Pierre prepares to take the stage, her approach stays rooted in service, just as it was behind the White House podium.\n\n\t“My message is to continue to hold each other,” she says. “Telling our stories is more important now than it has ever been before.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatthew McConaughey recently joined Woody Harrelson and Ted Danson on their “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast. During the episode, Harrelson recalled there were “so many times” he wanted to “punch” McConaughey while filming the first season of “True Detective” because he was method acting.\n\n\t“He’s method,” Harrelson said. “When we were shooting, he was Rust Cohle. There [were] so many times I wanted to punch this motherfucker in the face. I’m so pissed at him cause he’s in his character.”\n\t\n\n\tMcConaughey explained that he needed to be “stoic” between takes to stay in his character’s headspace.\n\n\n\t“We’re sitting there. We’re about to start shooting, and we were rehearsing,” McConaughey recalled. “I’m just kind of being stoic Rust Cohle. Woody goes, like, ‘Hey man, I need to talk to you about something.’ He goes, ‘The way you and I work, McConaughey, I hit you the ball, you hit back, I hit it back to you. We volley, we play. … Man, that’s us. It’s dramatic, but it’s also comedy.'”\n\n\tIn HBO’s “True Detective,” Harrelson and McConaughey played a pair of Southern investigators hunting a serial killer in the esoteric back country of Louisiana. Harrelson, at one point, thought the show was too dark and suggested to McConaughey during production that they should add in some jokes.\n\n\tHe recalled, “I remember saying to [McConaughey] before we started filming, I’m like, ‘Dude, people are gonna expect to laugh with us. We gotta throw some jokes in here.’ He’s just like, ‘Mhm.’ I’m waiting for him to say, ‘Yeah, you’re totally, no, none of that.’ He just, ‘Mhm, yeah.’”\n\t\n\n\t“True Detective” Season 1 earned 5 Emmy Awards and is still widely considered one of the best shows in HBO’s catalog. Despite the enduring popularity, Harrelson recently told “Today” that there is “no chance” of him and McConaughey returning to “True Detective.”\n\n\t“In fairness, never. No chance,” Harrelson said. “Because it turned out great. I love that it turned out the way it did, and if anything, doing another season would, I think, tarnish that.”\n",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bad-bunny/\">Bad Bunny</a> kicked off Season 51 of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/saturday-night-live/\">Saturday Night Live</a>” with a bilingual monologue that referenced his upcoming gig as the Super Bowl halftime show headliner — and the right-wing backlash to the announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m very happy,” he said of the opportunity. “And I think everyone is happy about it. Even Fox News.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“SNL” then played a supercut of clips from the conservative news channel, which has criticized the NFL for booking a Spanish-language artist, calling special attention to Bad Bunny’s recent comments about not playing the United States on his latest tour because of fears relating to his fans encountering ICE. But instead of airing news clips of Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, “SNL” chopped up the conservative anchors’ comments to make them say, collectively: “Bad Bunny is my favorite musician, and he should be the next president.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBad Bunny then delivered some heartfelt remarks in his native tongue, offering thanks to those who are genuinely excited for his upcoming Super Bowl performance. “Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors,” Bad Bunny said in Spanish. “It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen, back to English, Bad Bunny said cheekily: “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe monologue also featured a special guest, “SNL” favorite Jon Hamm — or, in Bad Bunny’s words, “Juan Jamón.” Bad Bunny introduced a clip of Hamm dancing at one of his recent concerts before the camera cut to Hamm in the Studio 8H audience, clad in a button-up shirt, sunglasses and bucket hat.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter a landmark 50th season, “SNL” returned on Oct. 4 with Bad Bunny and musical guest Doja Cat. On Oct. 11, Amy Poehler comes back to Studio 8H to host alongside music act Role Model, and on Oct. 18, Sabrina Carpenter will pull double-duty as host and musical guest.</p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of the new season, “SNL” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/lists/snl-season-51-cast\">added a handful of new cast members</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/snl-adds-7-new-writers-season-51-1236535056/\">writers</a> as a slew of familiar faces departed from the show. Heidi Gardner exited the series after eight seasons, while Ego Nwodim announced her exit after seven. Also absent are Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, Emil Wakim and Please Don’t Destroy’s John Higgins, as Martin Herlihy moves to the writing staff and Ben Marshall joins the main cast. New to the cast are Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson, Veronika Slowikowska and Tommy Brennan.</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch Bad Bunny’s monologue below. </p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

Rowling</a>‘s endless tweets against trans people and AI actress <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tilly-norwood/\">Tilly Norwood</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was reported that major talent agencies in Hollywood are interested in signing a new AI generated actress named Tilly Norwood,” co-anchor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/colin-jost/\">Colin Jost</a> said. “The AI generated actress got her start after she had a hotel meeting with AI Harvey Weinstein.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLater in the segment, “Harry Potter” character Dobby the House Elf (played by Bowen Yang in wild makeup and wearing a plunging sack) was brought on to speak about J.K. Rowling’s Twitter takedown of Emma Watson, as well as the former’s frequent social media posts against trans people.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Master Rowling has done so much for Dobby, and inclusion in general,” Yang as Dobby said. “Remember when Dumbledore was gay <em>after</em> the books came out? And when Hermione was Black <em>only</em> on Broadway? And when Cho Chang was…hmm, was Cho Chang Asian? Dobby can’t remember if the character named Cho Chang was Asian or not…”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Weekend Update duo also broke down Diddy’s sentencing this week, with co-anchor Michael Che saying, “Sean Combs was sentenced on Friday to four years in prison, and I’ll be honest, it’s hard for me to enjoy watching someone I love get punished. But that’s what Diddy would do!”</p>\n<p>\n\t“During Sean Combs’ sentencing, he pleaded for mercy, saying the things he did were disgusting, shameful and sick,” Che continued. “In fact, just thinking about it makes him harder than grandma’s candy!”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch Weekend Update below.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tHaving conquered the world’s biggest stadiums with her sold-out concert tours, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/\">Taylor Swift</a> is proving again she can rule the big screen, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tHer newest theatrical effort, “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” is dancing to the top of box office charts with $33 million over the weekend. The “cinematic experience,” as the project has been dubbed, collected another $13 million at the international box office for a global total of $46 million. It’s a significant tally given that “Showgirl” was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/taylor-swift-film-theaters-october-showgirl-1236524158/\">announced just over two weeks ago</a> and landed in theaters with minimal promotion outside of Swift’s social media feeds. AMC is distributing “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” which isn’t a traditional movie, or a concert film like Swift’s<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/news/taylor-swifts-the-eras-tour-highest-grossing-theatrical-concert-film-1235863956/\"> record-breaking “The Eras Tour,”</a> but instead a 89-minute listening party that offers fans a look at a new music video and behind-the-scenes footage for her 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl.” This is Swift’s second No. 1 box office debut after 2023’s “The Eras Tour,” which opened to a staggering $93.2 million.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“No other musical artist on the planet can do this,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tA self-proclaimed fan of numerology, Swift put tickets on sale for $12, which is above the national average price but below the cost in major cities like New York City or Los Angeles. Audience reception has been stellar (a rare “A+” grade on CinemaScore exit polls) but no matter the feedback, “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl” is only slated for the weekend of Oct. 3 through 5. That means the Swift-induced box office bump will be brief.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“On behalf of AMC Theatres and the entire theatrical exhibition industry, I extend our sincerest appreciation to the iconic Taylor Swift for bringing her brilliance and magic to movie theatres this weekend,” AMC’s CEO Adam Aron said in a statement. “Her vision to add a cinematic element to her incredible album debut was nothing less than a triumph.”</p>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere at the box office, audiences couldn’t smell what the Rock was cooking. This weekend’s other newcomer, Dwayne Johnson’s R-rated sports drama “The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/smashing-machine/\">Smashing Machine</a>,” cratered in third place with $6 million from 3,345 venues. Those ticket sales were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/taylor-swift-showgirl-projected-box-office-smashing-machine-1236534820/\">below projections of $8 million to $15 million</a> and mark a career-low for Johnson, below his 2010 thriller “Faster” ($8.5 million, not adjusted for inflation). Ignominious records aside, it’s a blow to A24, which spent $50 million to produce the movie — and many millions more on promotional efforts, including stops at Venice and Toronto Film Festival. Heading out of the Lido, “The Smashing Machine” was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/the-rock-venice-smashing-machine-premiere-standing-ovation-1236493253/\">greeted with a lengthy standing ovation</a> and considered an Oscar contender, but it’s unclear now if the disastrous commercial turnout will hurt the film’s awards chances.</p>\n<p>\n\tPart of the disconnect is that “The Smashing Machine” features a rare dramatic performance from Johnson, who is best known for family friendly franchises like “Jumanji” or “Fast and Furious.” He plays wrestler and UFC champion Mark Kerr as he makes a career comeback after battling substance abuse. Emily Blunt plays Kerr’s then-girlfriend, Dawn Staples. Though critics were kinder (a 73% on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences dismissed the film with a “B-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls. Benny Safdie, who rose to arthouse fame with his older brother Josh on films like “Uncut Gems” and “Good Time,” directed “The Smashing Machine” in his solo debut.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt are strong leads who have elevated bigger pictures. It’s not happening here,” Gross says. “American wrestling is a local phenomenon, and that will limit it abroad.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond place was Leonardo DiCaprio’s comedic action epic “One Battle After Another” with 10.3 million from 3,634 theaters, declining 53% from its debut. So far, the film has earned $41 million in North America and $101.7 million globally. On one hand, it’s officially the highest-grossing film of director Paul Thomas Anderson’s career, overtaking 2007’s Western “There Will Be Blood” ($76.4 million globally). On the other, “One Battle” cost above $130 million to produce and doesn’t seem to have the staying power needed to justify its outsized budget. Since ticket sales are typically split 50-50 between studios and theater operators, “One Battle After Another” requires roughly $300 million to break even theatrically. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso this weekend, Disney re-released “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which swam to $3.2 million from 2,140 domestic locations. The blockbuster epic added another $6.8 million overseas, bringing its weekend tally to $10 million. The studio brought director James Cameron’s sequel back to screens to stoke excitement for the third entry, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” which opens in December. The original “Avatar” and its looooong-delayed sequel “The Way of Water” each grossed over $2 billion globally and stand as two of the biggest movies in history. Will “Fire and Ash” complete the trifecta? </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tColin Jost portrayed  “secretary of war” Pete Hegseth during the first cold open of the 51st season, lamenting that “Our military is gay as hell,” but also mourning that, “It’s also never been fatter!”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis mirrored his real life meeting with the military’s top generals this week, during which the meeting was strangely similar. Jost’s version just got rid of any subtext, demanding that the military be filled with “hot, shredded, hairless men who are definitely not gay.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThen James Austin Johnson’s Trump interrupted to say he was “Just here keeping my eye on ‘<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/snl/\">SNL</a>‘ making sure they don’t do anything too mean about me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump then got meta, saying, “SNL 51 off to a rough start: 17 new cast members and they got the ‘Update’ guy doing the open,” a nod to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/lists/snl-season-51-cast/\">hirings and firings</a> from over the summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also got in a jab at Jost, saying, “I thought he’d be with his friends at the Riyadh Comedy Festival,” with Jost saying he didn’t get an offer.</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump then reminded the audience that if the late night show got out of control, they’d answer to my attack dog at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fcc/\">FCC</a>, Brandon Carr.” Mikey Day then tiptoed into the scene as Carr via a music cue of Rockwell’s “Somebody’s Watching Me,” correcting Trump for the mispronunciation of his first name (it’s actually Brendan). Unfortunately, Trump told him that was not one of his concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump ended the segment by saying, “Remember: Daddy’s watching.”</p>\n<p>\n\tJohnson has portrayed Trump on “Saturday Night Live” since he was hired in 2021.</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the sketch below.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

So I went back into the studio with Max and Shellback to record acoustic/unplugged versions of a few of the ‘Showgirl’ songs with brand new vocals and production! Cannot WAIT for you to hear.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides offering two acoustic bonus tracks each, the four CDs also feature fresh cover images, several of which fans will recognize as coming from the shoot for the new music video for “The Fate of Ophelia,” as seen in movie theaters this weekend and on YouTube as of Sunday night.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Life-is-a-Song-Cover-1.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Life-is-a-Song-Cover-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Life-is-a-Song-Cover-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Life-is-a-Song-Cover-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tOne CD, dubbed the “Life Is A Song Acoustic Version,” will include “Opalite (Life Is A Song Acoustic Version)” and “Ruin the Friendship (My Advice Version)” as the bonus tracks. Another, called “Dressing Room Rehearsal Version,” will feature “Wi$h Li$t (Settled Down Acoustic Version)” and “The Life of a Showgirl (Dressing Room Rehearsal Acoustic Version).” A third, “Alone In My Tower Acoustic Version,” has “The Fate of Ophelia (Alone In My Tower Acoustic Version)” and “Eldest Daughter (Now You’re Home Acoustic Version)” as its added attractions. And the fourth new CD,  “So Glamorous Cabaret Version,” includes two versions of the same track, one of which is a voice memo demo rather than a new recording: “Elizabeth Taylor (So Glamorous Cabaret Version)” and “Elizabeth Taylor (Original Songwriting Voice Memo).”\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/So-Glamorous-Cabaret-Cover-1.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/So-Glamorous-Cabaret-Cover-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/So-Glamorous-Cabaret-Cover-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/So-Glamorous-Cabaret-Cover-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tThe four CD editions were announced as being on her site “for 24 hours or while supplies last” and are priced at $7.99 each.</p>\n<p>\n\tSales for these CDs should count toward her first-week sales, assuming they do ship in the coming week. As announced earlier Saturday, Swift already sold 2.7 million copies of “Showgirl” on the first day, the second-highest weekly tally for an album in Soundscan/Luminate history. If these CDs are pressed in high quantities, they could go some way toward helping it beat the all-time record of 3.4 million set by Adele’s “25” in 2015.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dressing-Room-Cover-2.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dressing-Room-Cover-2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dressing-Room-Cover-2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dressing-Room-Cover-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Alone-in-my-Tower-Cover-2.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Alone-in-my-Tower-Cover-2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Alone-in-my-Tower-Cover-2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Alone-in-my-Tower-Cover-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIt’s no secret that director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/martin-scorsese/\">Martin Scorsese</a> is fascinated by religion. Almost all of his movies include some Biblical allusion, theological meditation, or, in the case of “The Last Temptation of Christ” and “Silence,” center-stage depictions of the church and its sacred texts. Despite the filmmaker’s interest with the subject, though, it may come as a surprise that he actually studied to become a priest, but reveals in a new documentary that he was kicked out of his Catholic seminary for bad behavior.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mr-scorsese/\">Mr. Scorsese</a>,” a new docuseries from Rebecca Miller chronicling the life of the legendary director, premiered at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/new-york-film-festival/\">New York Film Festival</a> on Oct. 4. In the first episode, which explores the director’s early life, Scorsese reflects on the impact that religion had on him as a child and young adult.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt age seven, Scorsese attended his first Catholic mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City, which inspired him to pursue a religious education for many years afterwards.  “There was a preparatory seminary, and that was on 85th Street somewhere. I did okay for the first few months, but something happened,” Scorsese reflects in the series.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tWhat seemed to happen was that Scorsese became fascinated with a world beyond the church. “I began to realize the world is changing,” he says, “It was early rock and roll and the old world was dying out. I became aware of life around me. Falling in love or being attracted to girls, not that you’re acting out on it, but there were these feelings, and I suddenly realized it’s much more complicated than this. You can’t shut yourself off.”</p><p>The director recollects that he eventually realized that the priesthood was not for him. “The idea of priesthood, to devote yourself to others, really, that’s what it’s about. I realized I don’t belong there,” he remembers, “And I tried to stay, but they got my father in there, and they told him, ‘Get him out of here.’ Because I behaved badly.”\n\t</p></div>\n<p>\n\tThe documentary doesn’t explain what specific bad behavior the young Scorsese partook in, but considering the amount of sex, drugs and violence embedded in his filmography, it seems evident that his curiosities were manifold.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tScorsese instead ended up earning a B.A. in English from New York University’s Washington Square College and later an M.A. from the University’s School of Education. He made his directorial debut in 1967 with “Who’s That Knocking at My Door,” which began a nearly six-decade career making influential and iconic films such as “Taxi Driver,” “Raging Bull,” “Goodfellas,” “Casino,” “Gangs of New York,” “The Irishman” and many more. He has been nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards ten times, winning in 2006 for “The Departed.”</p><p>“Mr. Scorsese” will release on Apple TV+ on Oct. 17. The full series is five episodes and includes interviews with Scorsese along with his family members, contemporaries and creative collaborators such as Robert De Niro, Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Robbie Robertson, Thelma Schoonmaker, Steven Spielberg, Sharon Stone, Jodie Foster, Paul Schrader, Margot Robbie, Cate Blanchett, Jay Cocks, Rodrigo Prieto and more.</p></div>\n</div>"

In the first feature Competition, the jury awarded best director to Pauline Loquès for “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nino/\">Nino</a>,” while Cole Webley’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/omaha/\">Omaha</a>” won best film.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe KlikFilm Short Movie Competition celebrated emerging Indonesian talent with four prizes. Sinung Winahyoko’s “Babon” claimed first place and a feature film fund, while Joni Astin Ariadi’s “Darma” took first runner-up (also receiving a feature film fund) and Ardian Parasto’s “Pembayun” placed as second runner-up (feature film fund as well). Nada Leo Prakasa’s “Wahyu” won the Audience Favorite Award and a cash prize of IDR50 million ($3,000).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe festival featured 185 films from 66 countries this year, drawing 208,111 attendees across online screenings and in-person cinema experiences in Jakarta.</p>\n<p>\n\tFadli Zon, Indonesia’s Minister of Culture, attended the closing ceremony and said: “Jakarta World Cinema is a very important event for the Indonesian film ecosystem, where it becomes a space for discussion and a celebration of cinema. Our film industry is something we must nurture, and so far its development has been very positive.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added: “Through JWC, we are also very pleased to see that several young filmmakers now have the opportunity to make their first feature films funded by KlikFilm. We hope there will be more platforms like this.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tExecutive director Frederica called the edition “a turning point for us,” noting the overwhelming audience response. “We are especially proud to provide opportunities for young Indonesian filmmakers to transition from shorts to feature films,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tFestival director Shandy Gasella echoed the sentiment: “The audience response to JWC 2025 has been extraordinary. From sold-out screenings to the excitement around the short film competition, this shows that spaces for appreciating both world and local cinema are growing.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tFounded in 2022, Jakarta World Cinema is powered by KlikFilm and supported by CGV Cinemas. </p></div>\n</div>"

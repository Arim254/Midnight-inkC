    "body": "\n\tAnyone who’s attempted to sing Mariah Carey’s catalog at karaoke or in the comforts of their car knows that matching the greatness of Mimi is often an insurmountable task. And yet, a slate of musicians — Foo Fighters, Kesha, Jennifer Hudson, to name a few — did just that in tribute to the Queen Lamb herself at the annual MusiCares Person of the Year benefit gala, which took place on Friday night at the Los Angeles Convention Center.\n\n\tThe event, which has featured honorees including Dolly Parton and Jon Bon Jovi in recent years, typically plays as a marathon of tributes to the artist at hand. (Some attendees last night were grumbling at the expected length before the show even commenced, given the grueling grind of Grammy week.) But the two-hour program was succinct and, at times, surprising, as some artists either selected very deep cuts from Carey’s oeuvre — Foo Fighters with Taylor Momsen for not one but two tracks from her unreleased grunge album — or completely transformed the songs at hand, namely Maggie Rogers and Laufey with clever attempts at “Honey” and “It’s Like That,” respectively.\n\t\n\n\n\tMusiCares 2026, the 35th annual event, was a well-oiled machine, with each artist introduced by surprise presenters including SZA, Rita Wilson, Stevie Wonder, Richard Marx, Gayle King, Babyface and Kim Burrell. Following a brief DJ performance from longtime Carey collaborator Jermaine Dupri, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. set the night into motion with a speech that established the event was just as much about Carey as it was celebrating her philanthropic efforts, and more specifically, encouraging donations from those in attendance.\n\t\n\n\t“Tonight, we honor a true icon, a five-time Grammy winner, truly spectacular voice that has inspired generations of artists, a songwriter whose melodies and lyrics have shaped the soundtracks of our lives. The one and only Mariah Carey,” he said. “What makes tonight especially powerful is that this honor is not just about music. Mariah’s always understood that influence carries responsibility. She’s used her platform to support communities and advocate for those in need, and to show up when it matters most. That spirit and passion paired with impact is exactly what MusiCares stands for.”\n\n\tTo that point, MusiCares has become a beacon of hope for those affected by some of the world’s most challenging moments in recent years. Mason Jr. himself has been instrumental in mobilizing the Grammy membership, staff and MusiCares to help those in need, distributing over $25 million to pandemic relief and a total of $24 million toward fire relief. Last night, attendees were encouraged to scan QR codes on their tables to donate or participate in a live auction, where bidders spent tens of thousands of dollars on front-row seats at this Sunday’s Grammy Awards or a trip to Abu Dhabi to meet with Carey.\n\n\tBut music was equally the focus at MusiCares 2026 (and, of course, Carey, which goes without saying). Hudson began the parade of tributes with a rafters-reaching medley of songs including “Vision of Love” and “My All,” followed by the night’s most unexpected performance: Foo Fighters with Taylor Momsen, who ripped through “Love Is a Scam” and “Hermit” off Carey’s 1995 grunge album “Someone’s Ugly Daughter” by the band Chick. The camera cut to an enthused Carey several times as she sang along to the tunes.\n\nFoo Fighters, fronted by guest singer Taylor Momsen, perform \"Love Is a Scam\" — a song from Mariah Carey's unreleased alt-rock album — as a highlight of Friday night's MusiCares salute to Mariah pic.twitter.com/ikWQft5Rk7— Chris Willman (@ChrisWillman) January 31, 2026\n\n\n\tSome of the more compelling performances of the night came from artists who attempted to completely rewire some of her canon. Laufey’s bossa nova rendition of “It’s Like That” somehow worked, while Maggie Rogers invoked the spirit of Joss Stone with a soulful version of “Honey.” Others played it straight, often to great effect: Charlie Puth turned in a chills-inducing take on “I Still Believe”; John Legend tickled the ivories for “Hero”; FLO traded harmonies on “Dreamlover”; Kesha traipsed through “Obsessed”; Billy Porter gave a spirited rendition of “Always Be My Baby”; Teddy Swims hit the runs on “Without You”; and Adam Lambert brought his glam-rock vocals to “Can’t Let Go.”\n\t\n\n\tThere were a few surprises here and there, namely with an appearance from the un-billed Busta Rhymes who performed their 2002 classic “I Know What You Want.” (He appropriately called it “baby-making music.”) The rapper, who revisited the song with singer Chanté Moore and Spliff Star, gave Carey her flowers as he emerged from the wings. “I love whenever I need you, even when it’s not the most convenient, you pull up for Busta Rhymes,” he told Carey. “At the time, I would look at you on Video Music Box before I got the opportunity to make music, and I’d be like, I might have a crush on her. And then fast-forward, we have shared moments where we can actually say, it’s forever documented and etched in stone for eternity.”\n\n\n\tCarey spent the two-hour show smiling and singing along to the performances, and kept it brief as she accepted MusiCares’ Person of the Year honor at the night’s end. Introduced by Jody Gerson, CEO and chairman of Universal Music Publishing Group, Carey took the stage for her four-minute speech, where she teared up near the end. “I got to have a chance to sit there and listen and feel very just blessed to be here,” she said. “Thank you so much. Standing here tonight, surrounded by so many friendly and familiar faces, people I’ve worked with, people I’ve long admired, people I’ve even thought I’d never see again, so much love. So much music. It’s overwhelming in the most possible way.”\n\n\n\tAt that, Carey picked up the mic for one final farewell: an all-star performance of her perennial hit “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” led by Jon Batiste and joined by many of the evening’s singers. Carey accompanied them, beaming, gladly relishing the homage.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFlorence Hunt‘s Hyacinth has been the baby of the family on “Bridgerton” for a long time. When Hunt first joined the Netflix show to play the household’s youngest child in 2019, she was a 12-year-old about to make her television debut in the Netflix fantasy series “Cursed.” Now on the cusp of 19, and a two-time SAG Award nominee for ensemble performance, Hunt has spent her teen years transporting between modern-day England and Regency-era London.\n\t\n\n\t“Bridgerton” is based on author Julia Quinn’s romance novels, with each book and subsequent season focusing on a specific sibling. Hyacinth’s novel, “It’s In His Kiss,” is the seventh installment, and introduces her love interest Gareth St. Clair as a young man struggling with a spiteful father and who’s looking to translate his late mother’s diary from Italian to English — which is where Hyacinth comes into play.\n\n\n\tThroughout the show’s first three seasons, since she was so young, Hyacinth’s role has been a relatively limited one. She can usually be seen in family settings, catching her siblings off-guard with well-meaning but surprisingly insightful questions about their love lives, and bringing an endearing innocence to the show. Season 4 marks a turning point not only for Hyacinth, but for the Bridgerton line-up as well. Officially halfway done with Quinn’s books — with four siblings’ stories told, and four to still be explored — viewers see Hyacinth begin to step closer toward the spotlight this season. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPrevious seasons focused on the romances of Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) and Simon Bassett (Regé-Jean Page), Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley) and most recently, Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan).\n\t\n\n\tNow it’s finally tortured artist Benedict Bridgerton’s (Luke Thompson) turn. Captivated by a stranger who ultimately flees his mother’s masquerade ball, Benedict is unknowingly reunited with his “Lady in Silver,” this time as herself: a young maid named Sophie Baek (Yerin Ha) to whom he is deeply drawn. Simultaneously, Benedict’s siblings continue to navigate their own lives, and Sophie is eventually brought into Bridgerton house as Hyacinth and Eloise’s lady’s maid.\n\n\tAnd for the first time in the show, Hyacinth has a storyline that is all hers. The teenager is desperate to debut in Regency-era England, sneaking into society events and eagerly attending etiquette lessons under the watchful eye of her sister Eloise (Claudia Jesse). While her eventual beau and days of translating Italian are down the road, Hyacinth is ready to step out into the world. As the Bridgerton house footman John remarks in the season’s opening sequence, “Princess Hyacinth has risen.”\n\n\tHunt spoke with Variety about growing up on the set of one of Netflix’s most popular shows, her character’s longing to enter society — and what lies ahead for Hyacinth Bridgerton.\n\t\n\t\tYou were 12 years old when you first started on “Bridgerton,” and you’re now 18. What has it been like to grow up with Hyacinth?\t\n\n\tIt’s a good proportion of my entire existence, which is crazy to think about. It’s an absolute honor to grow up with any character, but especially that character being Hyacinth, who is someone who I really adore. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFlorence Hunt at the “Bridgerton” Season 4 premiere in Paris.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThis season, Hyacinth is impatient, and wants to debut in society and be out in the world. The housekeeper remarks she’s tried to sneak into a ball four times, with audiences seeing one of these take place at the masquerade ball. Is Hyacinth eager to start her own life, after watching so many of her siblings fall in love and start families?\t\n\n\tI’ve got one older sister, and I think [it’s] natural when you’re younger, and you have a sibling that you look up to. Hyacinth’s got seven older siblings, and they’re going through these adult situations, and her main exposure to the world is through her siblings. As a younger child, you’re desperate to get there and join them on that journey, but you can’t quite comprehend the fact that you’re younger and that can’t happen yet. I feel like I related to that when I was younger, and my sister got a social media app before I did, and I was like, “That is not fair!” You want to be on the same level as them, and Hyacinth is really trying to join in with her older siblings. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s still a few years away, but how are you preparing to have the spotlight on you when you are eventually the romantic lead for your season? Did you have any hesitations regarding eventually becoming a romantic lead on the show, and what that will involve in on-screen depictions?It’s an extremely exciting thought, because I care so much about Hyacinth. It would be an absolute honor to just even see what happens in her life. Obviously, I’ve read the book — I know what the end goal is, but to be able to stick with her through that would be an absolute dream. So fingers crossed I will. But it’s also nerve-racking. “Bridgerton” is a huge, huge show, and you carry a lot of pressure to entertain everyone on that season. All my co-stars who play my siblings have done it so seamlessly that there is a pressure to live up to that. I’m in a great position where I’ve been able to watch everyone for all these years deliver and do such an amazing job that I’ve learned a lot of lessons.\n\t\n\t\tAre there certain aspects of her story you’re eager to see adapted? What do you want for Hyacinth as her character continues to grow in the build-up for her season?\t\n\n\tIt would be fun to see how she finally gets introduced into the Marriage Mart. We’ve had so many seasons of building up to her presentation into society and meeting these possible suitors that I’m really excited to see how she actually copes in those situations, because it’s something that she desires. There’s so many aspects to the story, like reading Italian out of the diary — I can’t speak Italian! One thing that I was considering doing this year is picking up on Italian, whether they use that part of the story or not.\n\t\n\t\tWhat are your theories on how Hyacinth got a dress — and more specifically, a mask — to sneak into the masquerade ball?\t\n\n\tI reckon she raids her siblings’ closets quite often. I feel like this is not the first time; this is not her first rodeo. I can picture her sneaking in ever since she was a young child, but I also feel like somewhere, there’s a sibling who’s helping her out. I’m thinking that maybe she didn’t do all of this on her own. I think someone helped her out — maybe Francesca, who knows?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrancesca (portrayed by Ruby Stokes in Season 1) and Hyacinth Bridgerton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIf you could describe Hyacinth’s character arc in Part 2 in three words, what would they be?\t\n\n\tLessons, maturity, and she… relaxes. Maybe “wise” is a better word. We’ll go with wise.\n\t\n\t\tMany of Hyacinth’s scenes this season are with Eloise as her unwilling chaperone at etiquette lessons. They clearly want very different things out of life, and in Episode 4 Hyacinth tells Eloise that she thinks her sister is only interested in herself. What can you tell us about that tension-filled dynamic and how it’s going to continue into Part 2?\t\n\n\tThey end up teaching each other quite a lot. Hyacinth ultimately learns a big lesson from Eloise, but I think secretly, Eloise is learning and feeding off of Hyacinth as well. They’re both so different that they kind of end up balancing each other out. It was a lot of fun for me and Claudia to play as well, because we’re so close in real life. It was quite a lot of fun to argue with her, because we’ve known each other so long, we literally are like siblings.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn addition to her Mom and sisters, Hyacinth grows up with her brother’s wives, too, surrounding her with strong female figures to look up to. What has their influence been like on her?\t\n\n\tShe’s a really, really strong individual, kind of like her mum. She’s obviously never met her dad, and she’s grown up with this single mother who’s able to raise eight children seamlessly. [Violet Bridgerton] is also so respected in society and she’s the rock of the family. She really, really looks up to her mum, as I think all of the siblings do. She loves her sisters, obviously wanting to be like them, but also learning from them and the wives of the brothers that we meet.\n\t\n\t\tThis season, Benedict’s love interest Sophie is in especially close proximity to Hyacinth, serving as her lady’s maid. There’s a touch of possessiveness that comes out when Eloise refers to Sophie as her lady’s maid. What can you tell us about that relationship? \t\n\n\tFor Hyacinth, she kind of views Eloise as having it all — she gets to be part of the Marriage Mart, she gets to meet these suitors, and that’s everything Hyacinth wants. She finally has Sophie come into her life as her lady’s maid, and she’s like, “This is my friend, Sophie.” Obviously, she’s her lady’s maid, but Hyacinth really does see her as a friend. She likes to think that she finally has something for herself. But we end up creating quite a nice friendship in the end, which was a lot of fun to play.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you think Hyacinth’s reaction will be to her mom’s budding romance in Part 2?\t\n\n\tMe and Will [Tilston] spoke about this. We know it’s happening, but we choose to turn a blind eye to it. It’s more comfortable to do that when it’s your own mum. But I think secretly Hyacinth is so happy, of course, who wouldn’t want to see their mum happy? Violet deserves it. \n\n\tAnthony has played a large role in Hyacinth’s life, stepping in as a father figure. How has his absence affected her this season?We have a really nice scene where he comes back, and I think for any child who’s got so many siblings, there’s nothing quite like all your siblings being in one room. He’s definitely taught her quite a few lessons and left that with her, and she’s also able to turn to her other brothers to kind of look for that male figure in her life. \n\t\n\n\tIn terms of scenes that stand out in Part 1, Francesca’s quest to figure out what an orgasm is results in a series of humorous and awkward conversations with various members of the family. What were your thoughts on the discussion of “the pinnacle” this season?\n\n\tA crazy, crazy conversation. Crazy read through to be at when that’s getting discussed! \n\n\tWhat has it been like growing up on set, spending your teen years on one of Netflix’s most popular shows? Do you have any specific memories that stand out?It’s a really special thing to grow up with such an amazing group of people. To have those people play siblings but also feel like your long-lost siblings in real life is a special thing and kind of a strange experience. I can’t even picture what my life would be like if I didn’t have the show, because it’s such an imperative part of my life and has been for so long. To be able to keep acting for that amount of time and develop a character over such a big period of time is such a special thing as an actor. It’s sometimes hard to distinguish between seasons, so I try to write stuff down on photos from a day on set, like tiny things that insignificant things that happened, just to kind of jog my memory.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHyacinth and Gregory Bridgerton (Will Tilston) in Season 1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHow have you balanced “Bridgerton” with school?\n\n\tUntil I was 16, I did tutoring. We’d film for the day, and then Will and I had to go off and do five hours of tutoring, which was hell. We got through that though. Post 16, it becomes a choice whether you want to tutor, and it’s not as important. So I continued doing school, but I did it in my own time, and I managed to sit my A-level [exams], which I’m really happy about.\n\t\n\t\tOutside of the show, what are you hoping to do next with your career?\t\n\n\tI’m just excited to see what comes along. There’s really exciting content being made at the moment, and I’m excited to see what the universe brings. I really enjoy doing independent films, so I’d love to carry on with that kind of thing. \n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMarvel Television’s new limited series “Wonder Man” is a meta look at superhero stardom, with Yahya Abdul-Mateen II taking on the role of Simon Williams, the aspiring actor with supernatural powers. As a Hollywood hopeful, Simon makes the rounds of familiar L.A. studios, restaurants and movie theaters, hoping to be cast in the reboot of the superhero movie “Wonder Man.” From the iconic movie palaces of Hollywood Boulevard to the streets of Pacoima, “Wonder Man” is full of authentic L.A. flavor.\n\t\n\n\tIt helps that production designers Cindy Chao and Michele Yu are both Los Angeles natives with years of memories of seeing movies at local theaters and enjoying quirky sights like the giant Superior Tile man looming over Laurel Canyon Boulevard in the Valley, which makes an appearance in the show.\n\n\n\t“Production design, when it comes to location shooting, is very much the curation of the world around us,” says Yu. “So we were very intentional in helping locations and our directors find establishing shots like this, because we wanted to show things that were less obvious and more evocative.”\n\n\t“We wanted to show a version of L.A. that digs beneath all of the layers. We came into the show thinking about peeling back the layers of the onion,” she continues. “The reality of Hollywood as a physical experience doesn’t necessarily hold up to that dream, right? But it was important for us to be able to show that, and shoot at all of these locations that ran the gamut of what you expect, what you dream about — what you really live if you’re living in L.A.”\n\n\tYu and Chao took the crew on field trips to experience all facets of the city, including several that didn’t make it into the show, such as Randyland, a folk art-esque display of colored bottles in Echo Park.\n\t\n\n\tThe production designers detailed the thinking behind some of the show’s locations and how important it was to them to be able to shoot in Los Angeles.\n\t\n\t\tThe Highland and Eagle Theaters\t\n\n\tSimon and Trevor meet for the first time at a screening of “Midnight Cowboy” at the Highland Theater in Northeast L.A.’s Highland Park neighborhood. It’s one of at least six classic L.A. theaters shown in the series.\n\n\t“It was scripted that we were in and out of movie theaters every other episode, and we really felt strongly that it was important to show a variety,” says Yu. “We wanted a locally known, visually interesting theater.”\n\n\tLater on, Simon flashes back to going to the movies in the ’90s with his father, so the Eagle Theater in Eagle Rock, now Vidiots, was dressed to be accurate to the period. The designers also made sure there was a fruit vendor outside to give the neighborhood authenticity.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lloyd Wright-designed Sowden House served as a set for the movie-within-a-movie in “Wonder Man.”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe film location at Lloyd Wright’s Sowden House:\t\n\n\tDesigned by Frank Lloyd Wright’s son Lloyd Wright in 1926, the visually distinctive Sowden House in Los Feliz has appeared in films from “L.A. Confidential” to “The Aviator.”\n\n\tThe house is where a crew is shooting the movie-within-a-movie in “Wonder Man.” “It’s architecturally significant, designed by Lloyd Wright, uniquely L.A. to its roots. It’s Neo-Mayan architecture, and it looks like a ziggurat, so it’s instantly ominous. It’s full of mystique,” says Yu.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSimon Williams/Wonder Man (Yahya Adbul-Mateen II) in front of the Fox Village Theater.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMARVEL TELEVISION\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Fox Village Theater\t\n\n\tNow owned by a consortium of filmmakers led by Jason Reitman, the Fox Village Theater in Westwood Village is the location of the premiere of the “Wonder Man” movie. The Bruin Theater can also be seen across the street.\n\n\t“It’s really crazy how many places we shot have closed,” Yu laments. “We want to show that this place was important to people when it existed. For our big Hollywood premiere and Simon’s big moment, we wanted the scene to happen at a place where premieres really do happen. It’s also such a beautiful space with really great flow.”\n\n\t“The Fox Theater is where I watched ‘Titanic’ with my best friend — watching ‘Titanic’ at that theater was epic,” adds Chao.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYahya Adbul-Mateen II, left and Ben Kingsley visit Zlatko Buric at his character’s Beverly Hills mansion in “Wonder Man.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSuzanne Tenner\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVon Kovak’s mansion\t\n\n\tVan Kovak is the eccentric filmmaker who is directing the “Wonder Man” remake and lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with a to-die-for view of the city. Trevor and Simon find themselves at the mansion after they go to Break Room 86, the Koreatown nightclub accessed through a nondescript storeroom.\n\n\t“We wanted a grand gate for where they enter. We looked at places like Greystone, but we wanted something not so recognizable,” says Yu. “The location we did land at, it was such a grand scale and it was such a potential for absurdity just because of some of the architectural touches that were in there.” \n\n\t“It showcased some of the quirkiness of L.A. and Hollywood that you could get away with once you’re successful,” says Chao.\n\t\n\t\tThe Talmadge apartment building\t\n\n\tThe production designers thought of Ben Kingsley’s character as a faded star who was able to move into the historic Talmadge building on Wilshire Boulevard in Koreatown back when he had more cash. In the years since, he’s added layer upon layer of memories to bring it into its current cluttered state.\n\n\t“We really liked the evolution of the place, that it is a lot more careworn now, but you can still see the beauty there and the original architecture and Renaissance Revival intricate detailing,” Yu says. “When we start the show, you still don’t really know that much about that character and who he is as a person. You know what roles he’s played in the MCU, you saw him in ‘Shang-Chi.’ We were thinking, he maybe had some early success in his career. He’s clearly been a world traveler, so now it’s a collection of every important memento he’s ever had throughout his life. It’s stuff from all over the world, things that have a story behind them.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Wonder Man” shot at the soon-to-close Taix French Restaurant in Echo Park.\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRestaurants: Mother Wolf and Taix \t\n\n\tAmong the restaurants that Simon visits are Hollywood hotspot Mother Wolf and Echo Park classic Taix French Restaurant. \n\n\tIn choosing the trendy Italian restaurant Mother Wolf, Yu says, “We liked that it was a place that has had its moment as somewhere people paying attention to restaurant openings might clamor to get into – tapping into yet another subculture in L.A. But again, it also has some wildly different history to it – the building used to be a newspaper office.” The designers called the glamorous space a “classic L.A. reinvention.”\n\t\n\n\t“We loved the soft, rich colors and textures of the interiors, and found a lot to play with in creating our set for a pivotal moment in these characters’ careers where we see them asserting their belonging in a place, and with a group, they might previously have felt excluded from. This is their moment of reveling for the first time in their success, and the promised luxury of it,” says Yu.\n\n\tFor Taix French Restaurant, Yu and Chao chose it partly because of their own connections to the historic spot, which recently announced it will close its doors on March 29. “We very much wanted to show as many sides of Los Angeles as we could, and Taix is the kind of local time capsule with big history that was important for us to show. It also felt good to record the place for posterity. The lively classic noisy bar in contrast to the quieter dining sections with comfortable booths all provided the perfect historic L.A. backdrop for intimate, and sometimes tense, moments.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe movie studio scenes were shot at a combination of Radford in Studio City and Paramount in Hollywood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMARVEL TELEVISION\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRadford Studios/Paramount studios\t\n\n\tThe movie studio in “Wonder Man” is a combination of the Radford Studios and its New York street and the Paramount lot. “When I think of old Hollywood, I immediately think of Paramount for some reason,” says Chao. \n\n\t“We wanted the characters to have a big magical Hollywood studio experience,” adds Yu.\n\n\n\tShooting in Los Angeles was important to the designers not just for the proximity and personal connections, also for the health of the business.\n\n\t“There’s just no place like L.A.,” says Yu, “I think if there is a way for this industry to come back to Los Angeles, only good things can happen. In terms of crew, in terms of vendors, in terms of weather, in terms of shootability and just history — it’s a place that unfolds to you when you figure out who you are and you find your place in the city. And it’s the city that rewards you for doing that work.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tAfter making its debut on Paramount+ with nearly 5 million viewers last week, the Ultimate Fighting Championship is back, as the promotion company travels “Down Under” for UFC 325. The main event features Australian Alexander Volkanovski (27-4-0) defending his featherweight title against Brazilian fighter Diego Lopes (27-7-0) in a marquee rematch. It’s scheduled for five rounds.\n\n\tUFC 325: Volkanovski vs. Lopes takes place at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney, Australia on Saturday, Jan. 31. The early prelims start at 5 p.m. ET/2 p.m. PT (Sunday, Feb. 1 at 9 a.m. AEDT), while the main card kicks off at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT (1 p.m. AEDT).\n\n\n\tBack in April 2025, Volkanovski defeated Lopes in an unanimous decision during UFC 314. The bout went the distance with Volkanovski claiming victory to reclaim the once-vacant UFC Featherweight Title. And now, less than a year later, Lopes is looking for revenge for the defeat with the hopes of winning the championship belt for himself. Lopes knows he can go toe-to-toe against Volkanovski, but it’s just a question of will. Either way, it should be a spicy rematch in Australia.\n\n\tAs UFC moves from ESPN to Paramount+ in 2026, UFC 325 is the just the second event with the promotion company’s new home. But, it’s rare that a major event comes so close to another. UFC numbered events are usually scheduled a month apart. UFC 324 was only last week on Saturday, Jan. 24. It’s likely UFC wants to get ahead of the Winter Olympics, which starts on Friday, Feb. 6 and ends on Sunday, Feb. 22, while it’s also likely that the company wants to showcase more premium events for Paramount+. \n\n\n\tUFC 325 is not a pay-per-view (PPV) event. The event is available to livestream exclusively on Paramount+. For new subscribers, UFC 325 starts at $8.99/month for the Paramount+ Essential plan for access to all UFC events (included numbered and fight night events).\n\n\tParamount+ is the home for hit originals, such as “1883,” “Mayor of Kingstown,” “Halo” and “Evil;” popular movies, including “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning” and “Top Gun: Maverick;” live sports from the NFL on CBS, UEFA, PGA, NWSL and other sports leagues, live news from CBS News and much more.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Paramount+ Premium, which goes for $13.99/month, features Showtime originals, like “The Chi,” “A Gentleman in Moscow,” “The Curse” and “Yellowjackets,” as well as features films and documentaries, including “Breathe,” “The Wrath of Becky,” “The Honey Trap: A True Story of Love, Lies and the FBI,” “Deadlocked: How America Shaped the Supreme Court” and others.\n\t\n\t\tUFC 325 Odds & Predictions\t\n\n\tFor the main event, Volkanovski is the favorite to retain the title against Lopes. BetMGM’s oddsmakers give Volkanovski a -160 moneyline, while Diego Lopes receives a line of +135 as the underdog. Want more odds?

    "body": "\n\tA flurry of newcomers from familiar faces (Sam Raimi and Jason Statham) and unexpected places (Melania Trump and Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach) hit the box office on Friday, but Fischbach’s indie horror “The Iron Lung” came out on top.\n\n\t“Iron Lung” pulled in an estimated $8.9 million on Friday from 3,015 theaters for a first-place finish, an impressive result considering the film was self-distributed and funded by YouTube superstar Fischbach, aka Markiplier. Domestic gross should climb to $17 million through Sunday, well past initial projections of $10 million. Based on the 2022 indie horror game, the film is co-directed by the game’s developer, David Szymanski, and Fischbach, who also stars.\n\t\n\n\t“Iron Lung” follows a fugitive in a post-apocalyptic future who, after a world-ending event known as “The Quiet Rapture,” must scavenge natural resources in an ocean of blood. Other cast members include Troy Baker, Elsie Lovelock, Seán McLoughlin and Caroline Kaplan.\n\n\n\t“Send Help,” a bloody desert island thriller from the “Evil Dead” mastermind Raimi, landed at No. 2 with $7.2 million on Friday from 3,475 North American theaters. Disney and 20th Century are hoping for $18 million by Sunday, a figure that could easily climb higher. Raimi, a fan favorite among horror fans, combined with the bankability of the genre, could spell sleeper hit status for “Send Help.” Although settling for second on Friday, “Send Help” is expected to win the weekend. The film carries a $40 million price tag.\n\n\tRachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brien headline “Send Help,” which follows an overworked and undervalued employee (McAdams) and her younger, douchey boss (O’Brien), whose power dynamic is reversed after their plane crashes on a remote island.\n\t\n\n\tIn third place was Brett Ratner’s “Melania,” which follows the First Lady in the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration. The doc grossed $2.9 million on Friday from 1,778 theaters. The film looks to earn $8.1 million by Sunday, a significant uptick from initial projections of $3 million to $5 million. Amazon MGM spent $40 million to acquire the film. “Melania” is Ratner’s first big-screen bout since sexual assault allegations in 2017 saw him black listed from the industry. He will also soon direct “Rush Hour 4,” reportedly at the White House’s request. \n\n\tFourth place went to the Statham action vehicle “Shelter” from indie banner Black Bear. The film made $1.9 million domestically on Friday from 2,726 theaters. Directed by Ric Roman Waugh (”Angel Has Fallen,” “Greenland”), the film is projected to reach $5 million by Sunday. The film cost $50 million.\n\n\t“Shelter” follows Statham as a reclusive man who rescues a girl from the sea, setting off a deadly chain of events that forces him to confront his dark past. Other cast members include Harriet Walter, Bill Nighy, Daniel Mays, Naomi Ackie and Bodhi Rae Breathnach.\n\n\tFifth place went to Disney holdover “Zootopia 2.” The animated sequel earned $1.3 million on Friday. It should add $5.8 million by Sunday, bringing the domestic total to about $408 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMelania Trump took to X on Saturday morning to flaunt the early achievements of her new documentary, “Melania,” which opened on Friday.\n\n\tThe First Lady posted that “Melania” is projecting the best opening in 10 years for a documentary (excluding concert films) and received an “A” score from movie pollster “CinemaScore.” Variety confirmed both accolades.\n\n\n\tWhile audiences were keen on “Melania,” critics were not. The film has a brutal 6% critic score on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, but the audience score is at a glowing 99%. Top markets for the film include Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, Phoenix, Houston and Atlanta.\n\t\n\n\tVariety’s film critic, Owen Gleiberman, was among the dissatisfied critics. In his review, he wrote that “Melania” feels like “a piece of state-sanctioned propaganda out of 1960s Communist China, that it never even wades into those controversial waters.”\n\n\n\t“By the time ‘Melania’ arrives at the Inaugural festivities, the film has given itself over to a series of rituals (the candlelight dinner, the Inaugural itself, the luncheon, the Starlight Ball), which feels weirdly fitting since the filmmaking itself is so ritualized,” he added. “It never lets the air of experience in. And that should tell you something. ‘Melania,’ like the Trump regime, is a designed-from-the-top-down reality show that’s devoted to shutting reality out.”\n\n\tDirected by Brett Ratner, “Melania” follows the First Lady in the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration. The doc earned $2.9 million on its opening day and is expected to gross $8.1 million by Sunday. That figure represents a significant uptick from initial estimates of $3 million to $5 million. Amazon MGM spent $40 million to acquire the film.\n\t\n\n\t“Melania” is Ratner’s first major directorial effort since sexual assault allegations in 2017 completely derailed his career. He will soon direct “Rush Hour 4” for Paramount, reportedly at the White House’s request.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tDuring the pandemic, when the prospect of interviewing people in person was an impossibility, I frequently thought to myself that if I never got to do that again, my interview over a long lunch with Catherine O’Hara and Eugene Levy for a “Schitt’s Creek” cover was the perfect way to go out. I met them on Friday, Feb. 28, 2020 at the Huntley Hotel in Santa Monica, which has a restaurant in its penthouse — within two weeks, the world shut down.\n\n\tWith “Schitt’s Creek” as our stated focus, we discussed how O’Hara had embraced the role of Moira Rose, which Eugene Levy and Dan Levy, who’d created the show, had conceived for her. Eugene told the story of being tasked to call her to ask her to join them, saying they’d gotten an order from CBC, which excited her. And that they were going to shoot the show in the summer, which… did not. “Eugene,” O’Hara said, telling the story, and sounding stern, “do you even know me?” She reminded him that, as many Canadians do, she has a cottage that she likes to go to with her family in the summer. He said he’d get back to her. Imitating Levy in his next call, O’Hara said, “OK! We’re going to shoot in the spring.”\n\n\tThinking about that day now that O’Hara has died, I feel so lucky to have had this experience. Her death is a devastating, shocking loss: for comedy, for the entertainment industry and for everyone who ever met her. To have had a conversation with O’Hara — and with Levy, her creative partner over many decades — about work she loved doing, about a character she adored, feels like a privilege of this job. And I knew it at the time too, and was smiling (and laughing, probably too hard) throughout the hours-long lunch, which they kept going long after all my questions were answered.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Pop TV/CBC\n\t\n\n\n\n\tO’Hara had a strong vision for who Moira was — what she looked like, and how she would sound. She’d gone to the initial meeting with the Levys with visual aids, armed with photos of the socialite Daphne Guinness. Eugene, sounding proud of his son, as he did throughout the lunch, said, “Daniel couldn’t write stuff down fast enough.” Moira’s voice and accent were less tangible, though, and O’Hara said she tried (and failed) to tell them what she was thinking … over email. “I was giving you nothing!” she exclaimed to Levy, describing the process. But then they heard it for the first time. “Unreal,” Levy said, marveling. As O’Hara put it, “You have to work with lovely, smart, talented people who allow you to sound like an alien.”\n\n\n\tI asked them when they knew “Schitt’s Creek” was working — and their answer was they knew right away, as they filmed the first episode. O’Hara said that Dan Levy and Annie Murphy, playing siblings David and Alexis, were immediately so good together (even though in my interviews with Dan and Annie, they’d confessed that they were incredibly intimidated by Catherine and Eugene). She then quoted from the famous scene in the pilot, when Alexis and David fight over whose bed should be closer to the door: “You get murdered first!” She laughed at the memory, and then added, channeling Moira, “Bébés to us!”\n\n\tThey frequently cited their past work together, too, to my delight. When I asked about Emmy nominations — “Schitt’s Creek” would go on to sweep in all the Emmy comedy categories that September — O’Hara pretended to scold me. “Don’t say that!” she said, wagging a finger at me. “Don’t suck us into the game! We were in ‘For Your Consideration!’” (If you want to read more, I published a Q&A version of the interview here. It includes O’Hara defining the Moira phrase “callipygian ass” as something that “means having firm, round buttocks.”)\n\t\n\n\n\tLunch ended, eventually. To avoid creating awkwardness by taking the elevator with them, I paid the bill and told them that I had a few things to do. The couple at the next table, who’d been eavesdropping (who wouldn’t have?), asked whether they were married. I said no, they’d just worked together forever, and were very close friends. The couple looked disappointed; I totally understood.\n\n\tA half-hour passed, and I felt safe to leave. But as I got out of the elevator, there were Levy and O’Hara, still chatting away at the valet stand. This was the awkwardness I’d sought to avoid! We greeted each other, and I gave the valet my ticket.\n\n\tAs I left the hotel, I could still see them in my rearview mirror, talking and laughing.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s an expression of the purest, most genuine endearment that Iris (Maria Petrova), an 11-year-old girl in the island nation of Cyprus, displays toward her father Aris (Christos Passalis) just days after meeting him for the first time. The two of them are driving in his car. The mood is joyful since they’ve just pulled off a petty scam, and the young girl’s gaze is fixated on his bearded face, as if hoping to preserve this moment intact forever. Her visage is not one of outward excitement but of tenderness for this man who should love her.\n\t\n\n\t“Hold Onto Me,” the first feature from Cypriot writer-director Myrsini Aristidou, departs from a recognizable premise — that of a child seeking affection from an estranged and ill-equipped parent — to find singular shades in the relationship it examines. Initially, neither party trusts the other, and the surprising but emotionally logical betrayal that prompts the film’s high-stakes climax carries a lovingly sincere intention. As their bond strengthens under strenuous circumstances, the actors’ performances evolve with the characters.\n\n\n\tTrouble finds Iris after an afternoon hanging out with Danae (Jenny Sallo), an older girl, on a boat they “borrow” from an oblivious local man. When they get caught, Iris winds up in the police station while her mother is out of town. Aris shows up to bail her out, though he operates with ulterior motives. A stranger to her, he is in town for his father’s funeral, not to reconnect with the children he abandoned. From their first encounter, the fantastic Petrova holds her ground, playing Iris with assured pluckiness. He can’t intimidate her. The kid roams around town without adult supervision, hanging out among those older than her.\n\t\n\n\tWithout exoticizing the location, cinematographer Lasse Ulvedal Tolbølls finds moments to remind the viewer that the locale where the narrative unfolds is in fact an island on the Mediterranean Sea. Silhouetted figures on the beach at dusk lit by an impromptu fire give the impression of a careless, youthful night. Then, the camera turns to Iris, her face illuminated by the embers. She is alone while others surround her. The sea itself plays its narrative role, first as an avenue for escapism that Iris and Danae cherish and later as an ominous terrain where father and daughter confront the weight of their choices.\n\n\tIris’ mother and her older brother have moved on from needing Aris in their lives (mom has a new boyfriend, and the teenage boy is busy with his girlfriend). But while technically present, they too ignore Iris. In the absence of guidance or attention, Iris clings to the long-absent Aris like a source of belonging. Part of what Iris finds appealing about him as a father figure is his disregard for rules. A scoundrel who cheats anyone gullible enough to fall for his tricks, Passalis (the Greek actor known for playing the adult son in Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Dogtooth”) turns on the charisma to breathe life into the constantly smoking ruffian.\n\n\tFollowing a victory at the horse races, Aris deems Iris his lucky charm. Her presence changes the dynamics of his antics, always for the better. When Aris tries to sell his deceased father’s belongings, the girl inspires sympathy from potential buyers. At a restaurant, he claims an unsanitary finding has made Iris ill and demands a refund. Later, during a life-or-death ordeal, she deters violence from coming his way. Aristidou portrays these interactions with a dose of bittersweet ambivalence. It’s no secret that Aris is using his daughter, who he never visited or supported before, to get himself out of a tough spot with his mafioso creditors.\n\n\tIn Iris’ eyes (which Petrova communicates nonverbally via smitten stares), bonding with Aris, even if under circumstances mostly advantageous to him, fills an empty cup within her. A shot of the two of them lounging under the sun is reminiscent of Charlotte Wells’ “Aftersun,” but the context here differs. Iris pretends to smoke in an effort to impress her dad, as well as to test whether he’ll behave like a traditional parent.\n\t\n\n\t“Stay out of trouble,” he tells her constantly, knowing well he won’t follow his own advice. Aristidou implies that the adult and the minor speak a common language. Everyone else around them has matured and behaves in an age-appropriate manner. Aris should know better, but he still rejects responsibility. Conversely, Iris has been pushed to mature too quickly. Their common ground defies parent-child attitudes for most of the movie, until a turning point forces them to assume the respective roles they should have always had in this relationship. Aristidou utilizes Danae, whose controlling dad suffocates her with his seemingly overbearing rigidness, as a counterpoint to the other extreme of fatherhood.\n\n\tAn astute writer, Aristidou avoids including a screaming match typical of stories like this. At no point do we see Iris verbally reproach Aris or the latter explaining to her why they can’t be together. In skipping the melodrama, the filmmaker allows “Hold Onto Me” to feel more grounded in the unpredictability of reality, offering no guarantees that Aris will stay or that they will remain close. That’s the hope, but even if it’s only for a moment, what’s emerged between them is unvarnished and truthful. If affection has in fact developed, it was hard-earned and not given for granted based solely on blood ties.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDemond Wilson, who co-starred with Redd Foxx on popular 1970s sitcom “Sanford and Son,” died Friday in Palm Springs. He was 79.\n\n\tHis publicist, Mark Goldman, said in a statement, “The family of Demond Wilson is deeply saddened by his passing. At this time, they ask for privacy as they grieve. No further details are available, and the family has no additional information to share. Personally, I had the privilege of working with Demond for 15 years, and his loss is profoundly felt. He was an unbelievable man, and his impact will never be forgotten. The family appreciates the support and understanding of the community during this difficult time.”\n\t\n\n\tHis son told TMZ he died of complications related to cancer. \n\n\n\tWilson, who was born Grady Demond Wilson, played Lamont Sanford, the son of Foxx’s Fred Sanford, on the the NBC series that ran from 1972 to 1977. \n\n\tHe went on to play Oscar Madison on “The New Odd Couple,” which ran for one season on ABC with Ron Glass in the Felix Unger role. \n\n\tBorn in Valdosta, Georgia, Wilson grew up in New York City, where he started performing at Harlem’s Apollo Theater at age 12. After serving in the Army in Vietnam, he performed onstage in New York before moving to Los Angeles.\n\n\tBefore breaking through in “Sanford and Son,” Wilson guested on series including “Mission: Impossible” and in the movie “Dealing: Or the Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick Lost Bag Blues.”\n\n\tA guest spot on “All in the Family” led to his casting in “Sanford and Son,” which spun off the groundbreaking sitcom. After Foxx walked off the series due to a salary dispute in 1974, Wilson became the star of the series, though Foxx returned the following year.\n\t\n\n\tAmong his other roles were the sitcom “Baby…I’m Back!” and the films “Full Moon High,” “Hammerlock” and “Me and the Kid.” More recently, he appeared in four episodes of the series “Girlfriends.”\n\n\tHe went on to write Christian books and became a minister in the Church of God in Christ. \n\n\tWilson had six children with his wife, model Cicely Johnston.\n",

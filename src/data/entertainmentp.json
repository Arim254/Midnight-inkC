    "body": "\n\tThe International Film Festival of Kerala has unveiled a 14-title international competition lineup that stretches from India’s Khasi Hills to Latin America, East Asia and the Middle East, anchoring the 30th edition of the festival in Thiruvananthapuram from Dec. 12–19.\n\n\tRepresenting the home state are Sanju Surendran’s “If on a Winter’s Night,” a Malayalam- and Hindi-language feature and Unnikrishnan Avala’s Malayalam drama “Life of a Phallus.” The Indian presence continues with Pradip Kurbah’s Khasi-language film “The Elysian Field” and “Shadowbox,” co-directed by Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi.\n\t\n\n\tLatin America appears strongly this year. Ecuadorian filmmaker Ana Cristina Barragán brings “Hiedra,” while Swiss-Argentine director Milagros Mumenthaler’s “The Currents” and Chilean filmmaker Nayra Ilic’s “Cuerpo Celeste” join the slate. Argentina’s Luis Zorraquín adds “Kissing Bug,” and “Before the Body,” directed by Carina Piazza and Lucía Bracelis, also represents Argentina.\n\n\n\tCentral and West Asia are represented through Shahram Mokri’s Tajikistan–U.A.E. feature “Black Rabbit, White Rabbit” and Mohamed Rashad’s cross-regional drama “The Settlement,” spanning Egypt, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Turkey–Iran director Gözde Kural adds “Cinema Jazireh” to the competition lineup.\n\n\tFrom East Asia comes Tom Shu-yu Lin’s Taiwan feature “Yen and Ai-Lee” and Sho Miyake’s “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” from Japan. \n\n\tBeyond the competition, IFFK leans into its traditional strength: mapping the breadth of Malayalam and Indian cinema. The Malayalam Cinema Today strand includes new works such as “All the Living,” “Ambrosia,” “Await,” “Celebration of Death,” “Desire,” “Ebb,” “Girl and the Fools Parade,” “OAK” and others, underlining the diversity and restlessness of Kerala’s filmmaking ecosystem.\n\t\n\n\tIndian Cinema Now broadens the scope with a slate including Kannada, Hindi, Bengali and multilingual Indian titles such as “Don’t Tell Mother,” “Flames,” “Full Plate,” “Hearth and Home,” “Mirage,” Venice winner “Songs of Forgotten Trees” and “Theatre.”\n\n\tThe Kaleidoscope section brings together eight films from across India, all of which have tasted global festival success, reinforcing the festival’s commitment to showcasing formally adventurous and regionally diverse work. The slate includes the Tamil feature “Bad Girl”; the Sundance-winning Marathi film “Cactus Pears” (“Sabar Bonda”); Hindi titles “Homebound,” which is India’s Oscar contender this year, “Pyre” and “Secret of a Mountain Serpent”; the Assamese-language “Kok Kok Kokoook”; the Nepali- and Sikkimese-language film “Shape of Momo”; and the Kannada–Malayalam production “Tiger’s Pond” (“Vaghachipani”).\n\n\tThis year’s Country Focus turns to Vietnam, presenting a curated five-film selection including “Cu Li Never Cries,” “Don’t Cry, Butterfly,” “Glorious Ashes,” “Once Upon a Love Story” and “The Tree House,” all emblematic of the country’s growing global festival presence.\n\n\tIndonesia’s Garin Nugroho is honored with a Contemporary Filmmaker in Focus tribute featuring “A Poet: Unconcealed Poetry,” “Birdman Tale,” “Letter to an Angel,” “Samsara” and “Whispers in the Dabbas.”\n\n\tIFFK also mounts retrospectives for two pivotal Indian filmmakers: Ritwik Ghatak, with screenings of “Meghe Dhaka Tara,” “Komal Gandhar,” “Subarnarekha” and “Titash Ekti Nadir Naam”; and Saeed Mirza, with “Arvind Desai Ki Ajeeb Dastaan,” “Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro” and “Naseem.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA core argument of Paramount Skydance‘s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery is this: WBD’s cable networks like CNN and TBS are not worth as much as the David Zaslav-led company’s deal with Netflix implies, Paramount claims.\n\n\tIt’s hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison of the two proposals. But here’s how the math works out, according to Paramount. The most recent $30/share offer from Paramount Skydance (all cash) is for the full company, including its TV biz (equity value: $77.9 billion). Netflix’s $27.75/share agreement with WBD (84% cash) covers the Warner Bros. TV and film studios arms, plus HBO, HBO Max and the games division (equity value: $72 billion) — excluding the non-HBO TV networks.\n\t\n\n\tSince Warner Bros. Discovery accepted Netflix’s deal terms and rejected Paramount’s proposal, the assumption is that WBD’s board concluded the Netflix offer was in the best interests of Warner Bros. and its stockholders — i.e., Netflix’s offer was worth more than Paramount’s.\n\n\n\tThat would imply WBD is ascribing a value of at least $2.25/share to the TV networks group, slated to be named Discovery Global and spun off in Q3 2026 ahead of the proposed Netflix transaction. But Paramount argues that the value of WBD’s networks group is in fact much lower: roughly $1/share, working out to an equity valuation of about $2.6 billion.\n\n\t“Even after assigning value to the global network stub, total value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal does not exceed $30 per share, and ours is in 100% cash,” Ellison told investors on a call Monday. “The Netflix deal leaves [Warner Bros. Discovery] shareholders with a highly levered declining global network stub, creating value uncertainty.” \n\t\n\n\t“The Netflix proposal leaves shareholders with stock in WBD’s Global Networks business, which is saddled with debt,” Ellison added. “How is WBD attributing value to this equity?” \n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\tWBD has not disclosed how it’s valuing the proposed Discovery Global spin-off “despite its significance to the economics of the Netflix proposal,” Andy Gordon, Paramount’s chief strategy officer and COO, said on Monday’s call. \n\n\tHere’s additional math, as outlined by Gordon: For Netflix’s proposal to exceed Paramount’s $30 all-cash offer, WBD’s Global Networks group would need to trade at more than five times forward EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) — higher than Wall Street analysts’ consensus estimates for Global Networks to be worth 4.5 times forward EBITDA. Financial analysts value WBD Global Networks’ closes competitor, Versant — the entity that Comcast is spinning off from NBCUniversal — at 4x-5x forward EBITDA.\n\n\tUnder WBD’s deal with Netflix, Netflix would assume $10.7 billion of Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt. So the implication is that Discovery Global entity would take on more than $23 billion of WBD’s debt load (which stood at $34.5 billion of gross debt as of the end of Q3).\n\n\tBecause WBD’s Global Networks is expected to have 3.5x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a 4.5x enterprise value multiple, according to Gordon, “one can imply there is less than 1x EBITDA of value in the business for equity holders, or roughly $1 a share.” He said Versant is expected to have a lower leverage ratio than WBD’s networks; Versant, with an anticipated 1.25x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, would be expected to carry a 3x EBITDA value.\n\n\tBut if WBD’s TV assets are a “declining” business, why does Paramount want them? Ellison addressed this on the call: “One of the reasons why we are so interested in [the Warner Bros. Discovery television business] and want to acquire it is because when you put together with our linear business, there are significant synergies.”\n\n\tGordon added that Paramount execs believe “that we can actually do a really good job on the synergy potential that we talked about and helping with that customer constituency and have confidence now that we’ve owned [Paramount’s TV business] for a bit and understanding what we can do with those brands. And let’s be clear, [Warner Bros. Discovery] Global Networks has some really great brands.”\n\t\n\n\tIn June 2025, WBD announced plans to separate its streaming and studios business (under the Warner Bros. banner, led by Zaslav) and its TV networks group (as Discovery Global, headed by current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels) into two separate publicly traded companies. Discovery Global will comprise properties including cable networks CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, OWN, TLC, Magnolia Network and Travel Channel; TNT Sports in the U.S.; free-to-air channels in Europe; and digital products including Discovery+ and Bleacher Report.\n\n\tThe separation of Discovery Global is now expected to be completed in third quarter 2026, prior to the closing of the Netflix transaction — unless, of course, Paramount Skydance’s rival bid prevails.\n\n\tRELATED: David Ellison Courted Warner Bros. Discovery’s Zaslav Hard Over 12 Weeks to Win a Deal. Then WBD’s Chief Stopped Responding to His Texts\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn today’s episode of “Daily Variety” podcast, Variety’s Gene Maddaus discusses the opposition in the entertainment industry that has assembled to fight Netflix’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. and HBO. And Alex Ritman reports on the scene at the Red Sea Film Festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\n\tMaddaus, Variety‘s senior media writer, says the opposition to Netflix’s acquisition of Warner Bros. is tied up in the economic squeeze that the creative community has felt in the post-pandemic era. Maddaus notes that the industry groups may not have the clout to derail the $82.7 billion transaction, but they can still have an impact by forcing discussion on issues of concern such as the merger’s impact on the job market and the creative rights of artists.\n\t\n\n\t“It is a pretty broad community that’s opposed at this point. I do think they have an opportunity to influence the conversation,” Maddaus says. “This will be reviewed by the Department of Justice and by the FTC, but also by state attorney generals around the country. And the more noise you can kick up, the more opposition there is, the more political pressure is brought to bear on political leaders around the country, not just in the white House, but state attorney generals and that sort of thing. Potentially,  they could create real headaches for Netflix on this.”\n\n\tAlex Ritman, Variety’s U.K. bureau chief, discusses the changing landscape for media and the arts in Saudi Arabia as the kingdom pursues its aggressive efforts to modernize and become more prominent on the world stage. Ritman is in Jeddah this week to cover the Red Sea Film Festival, which has been a showcase for the country’s arts and media push. Ritman, who has covered the festival for the past four years, explains how the event has evolved.\n\t\n\n\t“There’s this huge area called the Cultural Square and this vast cinema complex that’s been built there,” Ritman says. “It’s very much in tune with local Arabic style. The first two years I was here, everything was being held in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel — this exceptionally shiny and glitzy and slightly overbearing venue, but now it’s in its own purpose built location. There’s a huge auditorium for the main premieres, but also lots of other screens, and they’re having screenings throughout the day into the evening. There’s a huge area for the red carpets. This is what you can achieve when you have a lot of money at your disposal.”\n\n\tThe Red Sea Film Festival has made a point of championing female filmmakers. That stands in contrast to the historic restrictions on women in Saudi culture. There’s an undeniable tension there, but there’s also an energy as the country’s youthful population embraces the opening of movie theaters and the gradual easing of restrictions on what women can achieve.\n\n\t“Let’s not forget cinemas only reopened here in like 2018. So what we’re seven years on from that. The change has been phenomenal,” Ritman says. “You could suggest that this is a very expensive culture washing event. And that’s an elephant in the room that you perhaps don’t ignore. But at the same time, there’s this huge creative scene here that has that previously was just under the surface, and now they’ve been given this huge platform to come into their own. Just last night we had the local premiere of this film, ‘Desert Warrior,’ which is the most expensive Saudi film ever made. That’s a real statement of intent.”\n\n\tListen to Daily Variety on iHeartPodcasts, Apple Podcasts, Variety’s YouTube Podcast channel, Amazon Music, Spotify and other podcast platforms.\n",

You can try to drink through it, but you’re sober in the morning and you got to live in those hours too.”\n\t\n\n\tBateman said one negative review from his career stands out: “I got a terrible review from The New York Times on the pilot of ‘Ozark.’ Mike Hale basically said I was so boring to watch, it reminded him of the person that he buys a ticket from in the airport. I laughed my ass off. I appreciate those that get creative with it.”\n\n\n\tHale wrote in his “Ozark” pan that Bateman plays his character “with the aggressive blandness of an airline gate agent,” adding: “The real saving grace of the show — and an almost sufficient reason to watch — is Laura Linney. Mr. Bateman isn’t really able to make a compelling character out of the blankly craven Marty, but Ms. Linney, with her gift for high-comic indignation, makes Wendy at once hilarious and sympathetic. If there’s a Season 2, maybe she can take over the business.”\n\n\tNot everyone agreed with The New York Times, however. Over the course of “Ozark’s” four-season run on Netflix, Bateman was nominated four times at the Emmys for outstanding lead actor in a drama series. He also picked up three Golden Globe nominations and four Screen Actors Guild nominations.\n\t\n\n\tHead over to Esquire magazine’s website to read Bateman’s interview in its entirety.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLaura Segura has been appointed executive director of She Is the Music, the nonprofit dedicated to gender equality and increasing the number of women working in music — including songwriters, engineers, producers, artists, and industry professionals. In her new role, Segura will lead SITM’s strategic vision, oversee its global programs and partnerships, and guide the organization’s continued expansion and impact.\n\n\tAccording to the announcement, as executive director, Segura will oversee and expand SITM’s core initiatives — including its all-women songwriting camps, global creator database, mentorship cohorts, research and advocacy work, and community partnerships across labels, publishers, studios, management companies, DSPs and educational institutions. She will shape the organization’s long-term strategic vision, guide international expansion efforts, strengthen industry relationships, manage day-to-day operations, lead fundraising and development strategy, and ensure all programs meet SITM’s equity and representation goals. Segura will also serve as a key spokesperson and advocate for SITM’s mission across the global music community.\n\t\n\n\tSegura joins after five years as executive director of MusiCares, where she helped oversee the pandemic relief effort that included 140,000 services and $35.7 million distributed, and led a $16 million relief effort during the recent Los Angeles–area fires. Previously, Segura served as Vice President of Membership & Industry Relations for the Recording Academy.\n\n\tAlicia Keys, artist, producer and co-founder of She Is The Music, said, “I’m so proud to welcome Laura into this role. She has spent her career lifting people up, building support systems that work, and making sure no one is left behind — and that spirit is at the heart of She Is the Music. Laura understands the challenges women face in this industry and brings the strength, clarity, and compassion needed to create real, lasting change. I know she will help us push our mission even further, opening more doors, elevating more voices, and building a future where women are fully seen, heard, and supported.”\n\t\n\n\tJody Gerson (Chairman & CEO, Universal Music Publishing Group), Ann Mincieli (GRAMMY-winning engineer and studio owner), and Sam Kirby Yoh (Partner & Head of East Coast Music, WME) — co-founders of She Is The Music, jointly stated, “We’re excited to welcome Laura as she leads She Is the Music into its next chapter. Her dedication to driving meaningful change reflects the mission we set out to champion from day one. Laura brings a rare combination of vision, experience, and genuine care for the people who make this industry what it is. With her leadership, SITM will continue opportunities for women across every part of the music ecosystem.”\n\n\t+ Rapper-singer Don Tolliver has signed with United Talent Agency (UTA) for touring representation in North America. Last summer, Toliver wrapped the second leg of the “Psycho Tour” with a summer run in the UK and Europe. The headline tour also saw sold-out arena shows across the U.S., including New York’s Barclays Center and Los Angeles’ Cypto.com Arena. He has landed four consecutive Top 10 debuts on the Billboard 200 with records “Heaven or Hell,” “Life of a Don,” “Love Sick,” and “Hardstone Psycho,” the latter of which landed at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart.\n\n\tHe is managed by David Stromberg, Randall “Sickamore” Medford and Erin Duran, and is represented by Wasserman Music outside of North America.\n\n\t+ Atlantic Music Group has elevated Dave Rocco to the newly created position of chief creative officer at the company. In this new role, Rocco will guide the creative strategy for the label group globally and will continue to lead the team that collaborates with the label’s roster of artists on all visual creative elements, including creative strategy, video, artwork, advertising and more.\n\n\tHe was previously president of creative, joining the label in 2024. He held prior senior roles at Spotify, Universal Music Group and the advertising agencies Deutsch LA and BBDO New York. He will continue to report to AMG Chairman and CEO Elliot Grainge.\n\n\t“For the last year, Dave has played a crucial role in reenergizing and reimagining Atlantic Music Group,” said Grainge. “His creative contributions to our organization and to our artists have been immeasurable. I’m happy to be able to promote him to this important new leadership role.”\n\t\n\n\t+ Sony Music Publishing has announced the promotion of  Jeff Smarr to senior vice president, global copyright, effective immediately. Based out of SMP’s Nashville office, Smarr — a 31-year company veteran — will continue to report to EVP of worldwide administration Dale Esworthy. In his elevated position, Jeff will take on a greater role across strategic initiatives and high-profile deal and acquisition integrations, and continue to oversee SMP’s Global and North American Copyright Administration teams.\n\n\tEsworthy said, “Jeff is our go-to expert for any copyright question or concern and is unwavering in his commitment to our songwriters and team.

    "body": "\n\tKevin Lewis first made a name for himself in the horror community by helming the 2021 film “Willy’s Wonderland,” in which a mute Nicolas Cage plays a janitor fighting Chuck E. Cheese-esque animatronics that are possessed by the souls of cannibal serial killers. It’s quite the hook, but just as his biggest indie movie yet was taking off, his life nearly came to an end.\n\n\t“I had COVID at the time and was very close to death,” Lewis says. “I was saying goodbye to my family, and that was pretty intense. So when I got through that, it was carpe diem, seize the day.”\n\t\n\n\tIndeed, Lewis is all smiles while discussing his latest dark vision, “Pig Hill,” available Tuesday on VOD via Cineverse. Based off of a local legend out of Meadville, Pennsylvania, “Pig Hill” is about Carrie (Rainey Qualley), a woman investigating missing people in the area and is introduced to the legend of mutant inbred pig people. Things get seriously dark and surreal from there.\n\n\n\tLewis was inspired to helm this out-there vision after he read the book that Jarrod Burris’ script adapts, Nancy Williams’ novel “Pig: A Supernatural Thriller.”\n\n\t“It’s based on true folklore for decades and decades that these people have grown up with about the pig people,” Lewis says. “I just thought it was such a fascinating story. It’s a horror movie, but it’s more like psychological horror, and there’s a lot of drama to it. To me, good horror is drama. So the idea of it being grounded in something … There’s a real Pig Hill, and what’s crazy is you go to these bars and restaurants, and they’ve got pictures of missing women, like milk carton pictures, like it’s true. It’s a small town, and you go in, and they have a Pig People Beer. So the legend is really big out there.”\n\t\n\n\tAppropriately, “Pig Hill” was shot on location in Meadville, which helped Lewis achieve the spooky aesthetic he was aiming for with the material.\n\n\t“I love horror and the fact that it’s good drama,” he says. “But you can build an interesting, creative world with colors and mood and still get the truth of Meadville, and the fact that these people would exist and live in this town. So that was the balancing act.”\n\n\tWhen it comes to indie film shoots, directors are usually working against the clock with a shoestring budget. But Lewis says his brush with death changed his filmmaking philosophy, and he now embraces such challenges.\n\n\t“Going forward and making these movies, it’s very freeing,” he says. “Hollywood will beat you down, man, it’s hardcore. And I’m a hardcore boss in my head as well. So coupled with that, it’s very difficult. But ain’t nothing hardcore as what I faced in the hospital with COVID. I don’t want to say it’s a breeze, but I’m just enjoying the moment. Even when it’s tough — sometimes money falls out, or schedules shift around, can’t get the talent or whatever. I just try to enjoy the moment.”\n\n\tWith that sunny disposition, Lewis has an ever-growing list of projects he’s working on: There’s “Oak,” an urban myth about an oak tree that comes to life; a noir thriller called “Misdirection”; and a Jeremy Piven-starring horror comedy called “Driver.” He has a voracious desire to create, to try new genres, take new risks. And he’s considering his legacy as an indie filmmaker.\n\n\t“I’m just committing myself to a body of work,” Lewis says. “Some people get hung up on ‘This movie’s got to be perfect’ or ‘This, that and da, da, da.’ And I get that. I’m a little older now. I’m reflecting back on things. I just want to create and work with good people and make cool projects. Not every one is going to be A+. I’m working in the indie space, with budgets and time and all that. But I just like creating and committing to a body of work, and looking back at making a legacy, my little minuscule cinematic footprint in this world.”\n\n\tAnd when one of his movies hits the right audience, Lewis says there’s nothing like it.\n\n\t“A couple of months ago, I met a kid, and he loved ‘Willy’s Wonderland,'” he says. “It inspired him to start making movies with his iPhone. I thought, ‘That is the coolest thing.’ If someone saw my work and it inspires them, that’s what it’s all about. It’s all about paying it forward.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Pig Hill” below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCOL Group International has unveiled a first look at its newly completed studio complex designed specifically for microdrama production. \n\n\tThe Macao-based facility, located within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, houses more than 30 fully-equipped standing sets replicating global locations, from passenger aircraft cabins to French ballrooms.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe vertically integrated production hub responds to accelerating worldwide demand for high-quality short-form content. The global microdrama industry is projected to reach $26 billion in revenues by 2030, with China’s market hitting $7 billion in 2024 after growing from $500 million in 2021. \n\t\n\n\tStanding sets also include a modern hospital ward, CEO corporate offices, luxury apartments, courtroom, Western-style bar, police investigation office, chapel, and dressing rooms — all situated within a single compound.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe consolidated setup allows multiple productions to shoot simultaneously while eliminating location travel, a critical advantage given that typical microdrama series wrap within a week.\n\n\t“This studio complex represents a critical investment in the future of global storytelling,” said Timothy Oh, general manager at COL Group International. “As microdrama evolves from a trend into a mainstay of global entertainment, it’s a huge leap and investment for the industry, where we’ll see world class vertical productions take place, elevating the quality of shows and experience for the cast and crew.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe facility serves as the production backbone for COL Group’s streaming platform FlareFlow. James Wang, CEO of FlareFlow, outlined ambitious production targets tied to the new infrastructure.\n\t\n\n\t“This complex is the physical cornerstone of our strategy to produce over 200 premium series for FlareFlow and our partners in 2026,” Wang said. “It gives us the creative agility and industrial capacity to lead the next chapter of this industry, delivering cinematic quality to a global audience at an unprecedented pace.”\n\n\tBy centralizing the physical production pipeline into a purpose-built campus, COL Group aims to establish new quality benchmarks while achieving the speed and volume the microdrama format demands, with content tailored for diverse international audiences.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCOL Group International is a publicly listed media and entertainment company with more than 20 years experience in content development, production and IP management. The company positions itself as an early microdrama innovator, having created and powered multiple platforms in the space including FlareFlow.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Owning Manhattan” is back on Netflix, and so is its star Ryan Serhant.\n\n\tBut this time around, things are different. Serhant isn’t just selling Manhattan’s premium real estate. He’s still on his quest to build the number one brokerage on earth, and he’s also trying to be number one daddy to his daughter. However, Serhant’s business is booming and growing at an exponential rate, and Serhant can’t be everywhere.\n\n\n\tAs he previously told Variety, the show came out in June 2024, and Serhant gained a million followers and subscribers across accounts just from the global awareness. Serhant said, “We were in a couple of markets, but we were predominantly in Manhattan.” He continued, “18 months later, I just opened in my 14th state. We went from a couple of hundred people to 1500 people. Now I have a staff of 200 to help manage.”\n\t\n\n\tSeason 2 shows a new, vulnerable and emotional side to Serhant that audiences and fans alike have never seen. Aside from the personal woes, the new season also introduces some new characters and plenty of Manhattan real estate.\n\n\tWorld of Wonder co-founders and the show’s executive producers, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, also produced Bravo’s “Million Dollar Listing,” and cast the rising realtor in the New York edition of the franchise. The two spoke with Variety about the new season, what it was like seeing this new side of Serhant, and shared whether there are similarities between realtors and drag queens.\n\t\n\t\tThis was such a fascinating season to see Ryan at his most emotional and vulnerable as he struggles with his work-life balance. What was it like for you to witness this raw side of him?\t\n\n\tFenton Bailey: Ryan often presents himself as a selling machine, but there’s another side to him that he keeps closely guarded. Seeing that side was really great because, perhaps, some people don’t believe he has it. He won’t like me for saying this, but he’s a big old softie.\n\t\n\n\tRandy Barbato: He’s the original media beast. This is the first time he’s truly revealed the depth of his vulnerability, and that’s what makes this season so compelling. It’s also why Ryan has been so successful for so long, he isn’t just a selling machine. There’s a real depth to him that allows people to connect.\n\t\n\t\tSeason 2 has just dropped on Netflix. How would you describe it?\t\n\n\tBailey: There’s something about “Owning Manhattan” that goes beyond being a real estate soap opera. In this moment, you’re seeing who’s buying what, but you’re also witnessing the transformation of media, from legacy media to creator culture. Ryan is selling apartments, spectacular condos and properties, but he’s also, essentially, a creator. Today, everyone is a creator in this media space. We’re all selling all the time. That’s the hidden value of “Owning Manhattan.” It’s not just about real estate; it’s about the art of the sell. More and more, selling has become relatable and universal to the American experience, I think now than just being about someone building a property empire.\n\n\tBarbato: It’s about how to survive during times of epic transformation, which makes it incredibly relatable. Whether it’s the unknown of what is happening in the landscape of our entertainment landscape of our entertainment industry, to the most personal things of how you navigate your devices at home. You’re watching this guy who is this “Master of the Universe” succeed in his business, but also coping with this new world that we’re living in. I think it is more relatable a season of anything we’ve ever produced. Not just of “Owning Manhattan,” but for all the real estate shows we’ve worked on over the past two decades.\n\t\n\t\tGiven how much Serhant has grown, are you thinking of expanding the show to “Owning Florida” or other areas?\t\n\n\tBarbato: I think geography is too limiting. The next season should be “Owning Everything.” There are no boundaries when it comes to Ryan’s imagination and business acumen, and that’s what makes him so compelling. People who follow Ryan and Serhant know how sophisticated he is. He’s always aware of the camera, but the show is designed to be very broad, but it’s also designed for an audience with discerning tastes.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWas there a particular property that stood out to you this season as something you were invested in, wondering whether it would sell?\t\n\n\tBailey: I’ve been fascinated by the skinny scrapers story (Central Park Tower). I love the concept, especially the idea of the largest, most expensive property in the world. Things are not always what they seem. I suppose that always stuck out to me. But that’s more season one.\n\n\tBarbato: I have more modest tastes than most…\n\n\tBailey: I also liked that building with Anna Delvey.\n\t\n\t\tThis season introduces some new characters. What was it like seeing the new realtors? Not to compare them to the queens of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” but it’s always exciting to see what they’re like and what drama they’ll bring.\t\n\n\tBarbato: It’s very exciting to have new characters. By the way, someone who isn’t a new character but who we got to see in a new light this season is Amelia, Ryan’s wife, who is amazing. She has always been in the background. This season, she organically played a pretty important role, which was very satisfying for me to watch.\n\n\tBut it’s funny, I think you can equate real estate agents to drag queens because there are so many similarities. Drag queens and realtors are masters of invention. They have to be able to do everything and lip sync for their lives. I think we’re attracted to them because they have so many similarities, selling a property or selling a garment.\n\n\tBailey: To live is to perform, and to perform is to live.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

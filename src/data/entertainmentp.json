    "body": "\n\tSince its inception 35 years ago, Sony Pictures Classics — under the uncommonly consistent stewardship of co-chiefs Michael Barker and Tom Bernard — has been a bastion of socially minded cinema on the global stage.\n\n\tThe studio’s trademarks include international cinema that interrogates state power (“Persepolis,” “I’m Still Here”); character-driven dramas centered on identity (“All About My Mother,” “Call Me By Your Name”); documentaries about corruption and human rights (“The Fog of War,” “Inside Job”); and prestige releases that explore structural inequality (“Indochine,” “Incendies”), urgent social matters (“The Father,” “Foxcatcher”) and iconoclasts who defied societal norms (“Badasssss!,” “Searching for Sugar Man”).\n\t\n\n\tThe studio has also maintained a proud history of supporting female filmmakers (“Orlando,” “Europa Europa,” “The Rider”), not to mention a persistent dedication to underrepresented communities. In 1996, in fact, the documentary “The Celluloid Closet” — from Oscar-winning duo Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman — analyzed 100 years of LGBTQ+ representation in Hollywood cinema.\n\n\n\tMany of these films have been heralded by the industry as Oscar-worthy, starting with Sony Classics’ first-ever release: Merchant Ivory’s “Howards End” in 1992. That film would earn the first of 10 best picture nominations for the studio. Of course, there was Ang Lee’s iconic, record-breaking “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” in 2000, as well as László Nemes’ “Son of Saul” — a haunting Holocaust drama that became the second Hungarian film to win the Oscar for best international feature film.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a lineage to be proud of, and one that is increasingly difficult to sustain in a modern climate defined by consolidation and caution. What has always been so admirable is that Sony Classics has managed to do this both at home and abroad, centering not just domestic stories of injustice but international ones as well. Two films in particular this year have profoundly added to this legacy: Hasan Hadi’s “The President’s Cake,” set during Saddam Hussein’s murderous regime in 1990s Iraq, and James Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg,” about the 1945-46 International Military Tribunal that saw high-ranking Nazi official Hermann Göring convicted of crimes against humanity.\n\n\tThe power of these films, and their stark warnings against authoritarianism, are what led the Kramer family — in partnership with the African American Film Critics Association and the organization’s co-founder and president, Gil Robertson — to choose Sony Classics as this year’s recipient of the Karen & Stanley Kramer Award for Social Justice. It marks the first time a studio, rather than a film or individual, has received the honor.\n\n\tBarker and Bernard’s taste and mission bear a striking resemblance to that of my late husband. When Stanley made “Judgment at Nuremberg,” he was not interested in softening history. He had served in the Army’s photographic unit during World War II. He had seen the footage from the liberation of the concentration camps. He knew what had been done in humanity’s name, and he understood that if Americans were going to confront the reality of the Holocaust — 6 million Jews murdered, along with millions of others — they would have to see it unfiltered. Stanley was the first filmmaker to incorporate that footage into a narrative film.\n\n\tAudiences were stunned. Many could not fathom that human beings could do such things. But that was precisely his point.\n\n\tWe recently screened “Judgment at Nuremberg” and “On the Beach” in recognition of the anniversaries of the Nuremberg trials and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The themes remain urgent, and that’s in part why I find that Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg” and Stanley’s “Judgment at Nuremberg” are companion pieces. Vanderbilt trained his lens on Hitler’s designated successor, played with chilling charisma by Russell Crowe. Stanley, meanwhile, focused on the Judges’ Trial — the men who wore robes, presided over law and order and signed their names to atrocity. They were the final word of their regime. They had sworn to uphold justice. And yet they hid behind “orders.”\n\t\n\n\tIn Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg,” there is a moment when footage of the camps is shown at trial, a direct echo of Stanley’s film. The horror is undeniable. But what lingers most for me is the warning embedded in the story. The film closes with the historian R.G. Collingwood’s words: “The only clue to what man can do is what man has done.” That is not a historical footnote. It is a mirror.\n\n\tHistory does not repeat because monsters return. It repeats because ordinary people decide that silence is safer. Sony Pictures Classics understands that cinema can confront that silence. Over three and a half decades — as conglomerates merge and creative risk is sanded down to market-tested neutrality — Barker and Bernard have maintained a fiercely independent lane for films that challenge, unsettle and provoke. “The President’s Cake” examines authoritarian absurdity through a child’s eyes. “Nuremberg” confronts the architecture of state-sponsored evil head-on. These are not comfortable films. They are necessary ones.\n\n\tStanley believed the moving image could make a difference, that it could serve as both witness and warning. That belief feels more fragile today, and more essential.\n\n\tIt is important to remind ourselves what we are capable of. That reminder is not an act of despair. It is an act of vigilance.\n\n\tFor their courage in putting such reminders into the world, and for sustaining a platform where socially conscious cinema can survive, I am deeply proud to present Sony Pictures Classics with an award bearing my husband’s name. May their mission continue. We need it to.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tTax refunds are starting to hit bank accounts, and for anyone considering a phone upgrade, T-Mobile is making a compelling case to act now.\n\n\tThe carrier’s latest promotion highlights its “iPhone 17 On Us” offer: new customers can get an iPhone 17 (up to $830) at no cost with a new line on the Beyond plan. On top of that, T-Mobile will pay off your current phone up to $800 per line, making it easier than ever to switch. With potential savings compared to other major carriers, the deal delivers clear value.\n\t\n\n\tApple’s iPhone 17 remains one of its most advanced yet. The iPhone 17 Pro features a 6.3-inch display, aluminum unibody design, A19 Pro chip, and upgraded 48MP rear cameras. The Pro Max expands to a 6.9-inch screen and delivers the longest battery life ever in an iPhone — built for users who stream, game, and create throughout the day.\n\n\n\tBut T-Mobile’s pitch goes beyond the device itself. With expanded bandwidth, more towers, and the T-Satellite service, customers can text, share photos, and stay connected in areas where traditional networks fall short. According to Ookla Speedtest data, T-Mobile ranks as the best mobile network in the U.S., delivering faster speeds and more reliable coverage than competitors.\n\n\tThen there are the extras. T-Mobile layers in ongoing perks that make the monthly bill feel more worthwhile. Depending on the plan, customers can access streaming benefits like subscriptions to Hulu and SiriusXM, along with exclusive deals, limited-time offers, and special partner promotions throughout the year. Instead of treating streaming as a separate expense, Magenta Status folds entertainment into the wireless experience — a practical perk for families and heavy streamers alike.\n\t\n\n\tWhen you combine an iPhone 17 on them, up to $800 per line to pay off your current device, network performance, and entertainment perks built into your plan, the offer becomes more than a seasonal promotion. For consumers weighing how to use their tax refund, or simply looking to upgrade strategically, T-Mobile is positioning the move as both timely and financially smart.\n\n\tLearn more about the iPhone 17 and T-Mobile’s latest offers on its website.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAuthentic Studios is hoping this weekend’s release of “EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert” — its new doc from Baz Luhrmann — is just the beginning.\n\n\tVariety first broke the news in December 2024 that fresh off the success of his “Elvis” biopic, Luhrmann was partnering with Authentic to produce a documentary about the King of Rock & Roll, centered on never-before-seen footage and recordings of Presley that he unearthed while creating his Austin Butler-starring film. \n\t\n\n\tNow, as “EPiC” opens this weekend, Authentic Studios — the production arm of Authentic Brands Group, which is now the world’s second-largest licensor of intellectual property — is mining its properties for other opportunities (including, for example, Muhammad Ali and Marilyn Monroe, as the 100th anniversary of her birth approaches). \n\n\n\t“The Greatest,” a bio sports drama starring Jaalen Best, Giovanni Ribisi and Omari Hardwick, is already in production for Prime Video, from Amazon MGM Studios and producers including Michael B. Jordan. Prime Video is also in pre-production on another project based on an Authentic property, Barneys New York, which is being shepherded by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage under their new deal with Amazon MGM Studios.\n\n\tRecent Authentic projects include HBO Max’s “Surviving Ohio State” (based on a Sports Illustrated story), Prime Video’s “Iv3erson” and at Netflix, “Power Moves” and the Emmy-winning “Beckham.”  Authentic Studios was launched in 2023, and is made up of four production units: David Beckham’s Studio 99 (run by president Nicola Howson), Shaquille O’Neal’s Jersey Legends, Authentic Productions and SI Studios.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark the Cobrasnake\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAuthentic Studios president Colin Smeeton noted that Authentic’s move into production came after the release of the “Elvis” movie, “where we were really guests of Warner Bros., which was great, and we realized that this is our intellectual property. These aren’t just one-off projects. These are brands that that we own, that we care about, we spend a lot of money on, that we should be more involved in the creation and the production of compelling content around this.” \n\n\tSmeeton noted that much of Authentic Studios’ early work has been on the unscripted side, but he sees “this great opportunity” with scripted as Authentic continues to purchase the IP to three to four brands a year. “We’re really being focused on who we partner with, with our brands, because that’s really important for where we want to go as a studio.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRadiohead has issued a joint band statement decrying the use of the group’s song “Let Down” in a pro-ICE video, telling the U.S.’s Department of Homeland Security to “go fuck yourselves” for misappropriating the track.\n\n\tA spokesperson for Radiohead said it “goes without saying it was without the band’s permission” and passed along their statement, which reads:\n\n\t“We demand that the amateurs in control of the ICE social media account take it down. It ain’t funny, this song means a lot to us and other people, and you don’t get to appropriate it without a fight. Also, go fuck yourselves… Radiohead.”\n\t\n\n\tA choral version of “Let Down” appears as the soundtrack to a video appearing on ICE’s social media accounts that shows a montage of victims of violence that the government agency attributes to “illegal aliens” “raping and murdering” U.S. citizens.\n\n\n\tThe text accompanying the video reads: “Thousands of American families have been torn apart because of criminal illegal alien violence. American citizens raped and murdered by those who have no right to be in our country. This is who we fight for. This is our why.”\n\nThousands of American families have been torn apart because of criminal illegal alien violence.American citizens raped and murdered by those who have no right to be in our country.This is who we fight for.This is our why. pic.twitter.com/lKQp1lb4Q2— U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (@ICEgov) February 18, 2026\n\n\n\tRadiohead’s objection to ICE using its music follows other pop stars decrying their songs being picked up for viral videos depicting the roundup of immigrants.\n\n\tOlivia Rodrigo wrote in a message to ICE in November, “Don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,” after DHS used her song “All American Bitch” in a video portraying agents chasing and detaining immigrants.\n\t\n\n\tSabrina Carpenter had her own message after the agency used her “Juno” song to accompany footage of immigrants being tackled and arrested. “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda,” Carpenter wrote at the time. Rather than leave her out of their future messaging, though, ICE again featured her in a video lifted from a “Saturday Night Live” commercial, with altered voiceover to make it sound like she was arresting cast member Marcello Hernández for being “too illegal.”\n\n\tThe plain-talking message from Radiohead follows a more polite message that Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood and director Paul Thomas Anderson sent to the makers of the “Melania” documentary, asking that a piece of scoring from “The Phantom Thread” that was licensed for the film be taken out. Greenwood contended that his contract for working on “Phantom Thread” mandated that he at least be made aware of any future licensing for the music, which he said did not occur.\n\n\tIn a Variety interview with “Melania” producer Marc Beckman published this week, the advisor to Melania Trump said Radiohead was one of his favorite bands, and that he would entertain a conversation with Greenwood about his concerns. But Beckman reiterated that the “Phantom Thread” cue was properly licensed and would never come out of the movie. He said that the Greenwood instrumental was one of the pieces of music he was proudest of having in the film. Greenwood has not subsequently commented on that usage.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBAFTA is moving to correct the record on two fronts after John Davidson’s Tourette’s-related outburst — including the technical question of whether a microphone near his seat may have made the moment more audible — while the BBC faces growing scrutiny over how a racial slur remained in its tape-delayed BAFTA broadcast and on iPlayer.\n\n\tBAFTA officials tell Variety they reviewed Davidson’s remarks in his recent interview, in which he said: “As I reflect on the auditorium, I remember there was a microphone just in front of me, and with hindsight I have to question whether this was wise, so close to where I was seated, knowing I would tic.”\n\t\n\n\tAfter examining the claim, BAFTA has said it has assured StudioCanal that the microphone “wasn’t amplifying sound in the room or the broadcast.” The organization said it was “an analyzer mic that monitors the loudness in the room for EQ purposes.”\n\n\n\tThe BAFTA update comes amid broader controversy over the BBC’s handling of the moment in its broadcast. The ceremony was tape-delayed and edited for a two-hour BBC One telecast, yet the N-word — said during the presentation by “Sinners” stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo — still aired and remained available on iPlayer for hours before the BBC pulled the program and apologized.\n\n\tVariety has confirmed a report by Deadline that BAFTA raised concerns with the BBC about the issue, as questions swirled over editorial safeguards in the delayed telecast and why the segment was not removed before streaming became available.\n\n\tInternational coverage of the fallout has also cited Davidson’s comments to Variety, emphasizing that the language was an involuntary neurological tic rather than an act of intent or belief. The BBC later described the failure to edit the moment as a “serious mistake” and ordered a fast-tracked internal investigation.\n\t\n\n\tFor BAFTA, the microphone clarification appears aimed at tamping down a specific theory: that equipment near Davidson functioned as a live pickup that boosted what viewers heard. Bigger questions about broadcast and editorial oversight, duty of care and live-event risk management remain.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Scream” franchise creator Kevin Williams says he has “a lot of ideas” for an eighth movie.\n\n\t“If this film is successful and there’s an audience for it, you know we’ll make it because 1, I think the studio would like to make it, and 2, we the people who make these movies would love to make it because…they’re a blast to make and they’re so much fun,” Williamson, who makes his franchise directorial debut with a “Scream 7.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety reported earlier this week that “insiders suggest plans are already in place for the killer’s lethal return in an eighth film.”\n\n\n\tFranchise executive producer Marianne Maddalena told me that shooting for “Scream 8” may begin in the fall. However, sources say it’s still too early to say when cameras could start rolling.\n\n\t“Scream 7” sees Neve Campbell reprising her iconic role as Sidney Prescott after not appearing in the sixth installment over a pay dispute. Courteney Cox is also back as Gale Weathers. Returning and new cast members include Isabel May, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, Anna Camp, Jimmy Tatro, Joel McHale, Celeste O’Connor, Mckenna Grace, Sam Rechner, Ethan Embry, Victor Turpin and Tim Simons. Past cast members David Arquette, Scott Foley and Matthew Lillard may or may not be in the new movie as well.\n\n\tCox remained hilariously tight-lipped about coming back for “Scream 8.” “How do you know I survived [‘Scream 7’]?” she said, adding, “I think everyone should want to do another ‘Scream.’ It’s fun and it’s great. I don’t think I can make the next one, but maybe we’ll see.”\n\t\n\n\tBack when the original “Scream” was released in 1996, Cox said she never thought she’d still be playing Gale three decades later, “but after the first one came out, I was like, ‘Until I get killed, I’m coming back.’”\n\n\t“Scream 7” is full of imaginative new kills. No gory spoilers here, but will they become as legendary as some of the franchise’s past deaths?\n\n\t“It was always Tatum [Rose McGowan] in the garage door because that’s a classic,” Gooding said when asked his favorite franchise kill. “It’s fantastic. But there’s something about Anika [Devyn Nekoda] falling out of the window onto the dumpster in ‘VI’ that I find incredibly gruesome and cathartic in a lot of ways.”\n\n\tArquette recalled when Tatum’s garage death was shot. “it was just so random. Who thought of that craziness?” he said. “Then when you were there her fake body was hanging there for weeks after they shot the scene and moved on but no one ever pulled the hanging Tatum body down. It was just hanging there for a good two weeks.”\n\n\t“Scream 7” is in theaters now.\n\n\n\tSee more photos from the premiere below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNeve Campbell and Kevin Williamson \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Paramount Pictu\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourteney Cox poses with Ghostface \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Paramount Pictu\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourteney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Matthew Lillard \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Paramount Pictu\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIsabel May \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJimmy Tatro \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMason Gooding \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnna Camp \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJasmin Savoy Brown and Courteney Cox \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCeleste O’Connor and McKenna Grace \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe roaring engine, the downshifting of the gears, tires on gravel, and crowds chanting were all aural elements that give Joseph Kosinski’s “F1” its adrenaline rush.\n\n\tThe team at Formula One Media & Broadcast Center, led by Tim Bampton, Director of Content Delivery, Emma Penney, Engineering Manager, Audio & RF, Wendy Hendrickx, Head of Live Production, and Dean Locke, Director of Broadcast & Media, were vital collaborators in giving Kosinski and his sound team unprecedented access to the 2023-2024 Grand Prix season.\n\t\n\n\tKosinski explains, “Our collaboration with Formula 1 included working very closely with their broadcast team. We integrated our recording equipment into their pipeline which allowed us to capture 4K imagery from over 20 of their trackside cameras simultaneously and uncompressed sound from the nearly 100 microphones surrounding the circuit. I would brief their phenomenally talented camera operators before a race on the types of shots and story beats that I was looking for and they would capture those moments during the actual Grand Prix.”\n\n\n\tBampton adds the collaboration “was a marriage of a big scale Hollywood movie with the pinnacle of live sports broadcasting.” Kosinski wanted to place audiences inside a racing car and have them feel like they were going 200 m.p.h. That unique partnership helped bring the film to life by providing reference material and knowledge to the film’s sound team.\n\n\tThe Apple Original Film stars Brad Pitt as former Formula 1 race car driver Sonny Hayes, a retired driver. Javier Bardem plays Ruben, the boss of an underdog racing team who convinces Sonny to return to the sport to partner with and mentor rookie driver Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris). The film picks up halfway through the Formula 1 season, and by bringing Sonny into the mix, Ruben hopes the team lands a podium finish.\n\t\n\n\tFormula One’s Media and Broadcast Center in Biggin Hill, about an hour outside of London, is the sport’s beating heart. Bampton and the team are no strangers to the twists and turns that they cover in meticulous detail week after week during the Grand Prix season for broadcast.\n\n\tAs engineering manager, Penny placed 150 microphones around the actual tracks. Collaborating closely with supervising sound editor and sound designer Al Nelson, she helped captured sounds from all three practice sessions, qualifying races and the Grand Prix races.\n\n\tWhether they were in Silverstone, Bahrain or Hungary, the key was to be as close as they possibly could. In addition to Penny’s mics, production sound mixer Gareth John used specific DPA microphones, similar to what they use in the actual F1 races, strategically placing them on the cars, around the track and all the various turns.\n\n\tNelson listened to every single audio strand collected by Penny. Those strands proved invaluable to the team. “We could educate ourselves on exactly what it sounded like. It’s very different from track to track.” He adds, “We would find certain angles, and places where we needed to hear a downshift at this turn in this track, and we could filter in.”\n\n\tAs they played through the raw footage, they listened out for the golden moments. Each circuit, car and driver had a distinct sound, and that needed to carry across: “You try and find those unique characteristics and apply them to the drama of our film and our drivers.”\n\n\tOne golden moment came in the scene where Red Bull racer Max Verstappen crashed into McLaren driver Oscar Piastri at Abu Dhabi in 2024. That was an authentic moment, happening in real time, and it was pilfered from the actual F1 event, which Nelson put into the film.\n\n\tWith Penny’s audio strands, and John’s recordings, Nelson was able to make the film’s sound feel as authentic as possible. He says, “Some of the microphones are closer than others, but there’s this visceral feeling that we were trying to evoke. We have a lot more tools with our mix stage and what we can do. We tried to take it to the next level, was to feel like you were on top of the car, as it took the curbs, or as it accelerated off the grid. That took some time and experimentation.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPenny explains that crowd sounds were tricky. “Sometimes the fans don’t’ cheer as much.” But that’s where Whittle would step in. She would “collect crowd sounds, additional ADR, and chants.”\n\n\tF1 superfan and rerecording mixer Juan Peralta spent years following the sport, often getting up at 4:30 a.m. to watch races. He was tasked with putting the film into theaters with that bombastic Imax sound. As a fan of the sport, he felt immense pressure to get it right. The drivers’ helmet camera footage provided by the Formula One Media & Broadcast Center proved useful. He could watch the camera footage to see what gears the drivers were on and what they were doing at certain turns. Peralta says the driver perspective helped him “stay true to the sounds and what was happening with the upshifting and down shifting, and hitting the corners.” He adds, “It helped a lot for me to be able to get creative with some of these sounds and put them in the room and make them bigger and bolder.”\n\n\tWhile the “F1” movie team had unprecedented access, they were also working with the Formula 1 team during Grand Prix weekends. Whether they were in Silverstone or Yas Marina, those action sequences were filmed on those same tracks. Says Bampton, “We found 15 minutes — 20 max — within the schedule. We said to Joe, ‘Once the serious business of racing is done and the track sessions are out the way, we’ll find whatever time we can.’ I can’t underline too much just how integrated the movie became in our world.”\n\n\tLocke adds, “There was a massive challenge around that, doing a feature movie, in a really complicated live event, was immense. Having those two drivers (Pitt and Idris) on the grid at Silverstone, one of our biggest Grand Prix, in front of 450,000 people, but framing them out was quite interesting.” He goes on to say seeing the movie after “was hugely rewarding.”\n\n\tJerry Bruckheimer and Kosinski were often sitting alongside Bampton and Locke. Regarding the film’s dialogue, Bampton says, “On a couple of things, I said, ‘That’s not a line someone would say in that way, and Joe was super open to that input.”\n\n\tFor Rizzo, that reference material was key to maintaining authenticity throughout the sound mix. He says, “The dialogue department is hugely grateful to Formula One for collaborating and providing access to that material. We studied the myriad of tracks F1 shared from practices, qualifying runs and Grand Prix to accurately replicate and depict communications between the team manager and driver as well as to recreate live event environments and PA treatments. Additionally, our Skywalker dialogue crew worked endlessly alongside Formula One to collect paddock, garage and crowd recordings which allowed us to provide a thoroughly convincing race atmosphere in the film.”\n\t\n\n\tUltimately, “F1” roars to life, and the sound is precise because of how Formula 1, for the first time ever, opened its doors to Kosinski and his crew. He says, “The film would not have the sense of scale and level of authenticity without their vital contributions to it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFormula One’s Media and Broadcast Center in Biggin Hill\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFormula One’s Media and Broadcast Center\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFormula One’s Media and Broadcast Center\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFormula One’s Media and Broadcast Center\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIs there a lesser of two evils?\n\n\tThat was the looming question for movie theater owners before Netflix bowed out of the bidding war for Warner Bros. and paved the way for Paramount Skydance to take over the media giant. There’s been fear that any merger — no matter which bidder prevailed — would bring the kind of consolidation that results in fewer new films on the big screen. It’s a major concern because the box office has yet to recover from the pandemic and Hollywood’s 2023 labor strikes, with domestic ticket sales down roughly 20% from pre-COVID times.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s a case of pick your poison,” says an exhibition consultant. “The extended battle over which terrible deal would happen will result in fewer major studio releases.”\n\n\n\tWith the sale to Netflix, exhibitors were worried the streaming behemoth would take a sledgehammer to the theatrical window — the term for the amount of time a movie plays exclusively in cinemas. After all, Netflix’s CEO Ted Sarandos had spent the last decade repeatedly dismissing the moviegoing experience as an “outmoded idea.” However, some cinema operators were starting to (cautiously) warm to Netflix because Sarandos had pledged to not only continue releasing Warner Bros. films in theaters, but also to keep them on the big screen for 45 days. Despite Sarandos’ claims, rival studio executives and movie theater business veterans were skeptical about whether Netflix would make good on that promise over time.\n\n\t“Netflix said all the right things,” says Chris Randleman, chief revenue officer at the Texas-based movie theater circuit Flix Brewhouse. “At the end of the day, we just want as many movies in theaters at a time.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the case of Paramount, CEO David Ellison has positioned the company as the anti-Netflix, a true champion of theatrical. More pointedly, Ellison has promised the joint media behemoth would release more than 30 films in cinemas a year. In theory, it’s the ideal way to execute a massive media merger without crippling the theatrical business in the process. Yet several Hollywood insiders are casting doubt on whether that type of volume is realistic. For context, in 2025 Universal had the largest output with 20 films (including titles from its indie division, Focus Features) in 2025, followed by Disney with 16 (counting those from 20th Century and Searchlight) and Sony with 13 releases. Meanwhile Warner Bros. unveiled 11 films and Paramount released nine in the same timeframe.\n\n\t“Paramount hasn’t put out 15 movies in I don’t know how long,” notes an executive at a rival studio.\n\n\tParamount hasn’t revealed how it’ll operate the two film divisions, but the company is seeking up to $6 billion in cost savings by eliminating “duplicative operations” across the business, according to executives. In the theatrical space, that’ll likely mean the consolidation of marketing and distribution departments. With that in mind, analysts believe a bigger issue in committing to releasing 30 new films over 52 weeks is one of manpower. They think it’s unrealistic to task a studio’s marketing department with successfully promoting a movie every other weekend.\n\n\t“Paramount isn’t going to be able to afford to release that many movies if they cut redundancies,” says the exhibition consultant. “It’s possible to put out 30 films, but you can’t do that with fewer people.”\n\n\tThen there’s the question about the theatrical window. In December, Ellison maintained the company will honor “healthy traditional windows.” But analysts point out that Paramount already has “relatively short theatrical windows” compared to competitors in the distribution space. They don’t expect the windows to get longer given that Paramount’s president Jeff Shell had aggressively pushed to bring movies more quickly to the home while he served as CEO of NBCUniversal. During the pandemic, Shell was the architect of Universal’s controversial 17-day period between cinemas and premium video-on-demand platforms — a considerably shorter timeframe than the already abridged industry standard.\n\t\n\n\t“Last year, Paramount’s exclusive theatrical windows was shorter than the other studios, except for Universal,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. He notes the studio’s 2025 films had been exclusively in theaters for approximately 31 days, adding that since Skydance acquired Paramount for $8 billion last August, “there has been no change in their release strategy.”\n\n\tAnother reason for skepticism about the promise to sustain such a large output of movies? Quality control. That’s because the bar for theatrical — meaning what’ll actually get patrons off their couch and into their local multiplex — has never been higher amid the rise in popularity of streaming.\n\n\t“If any studio could release more than 15 wide releases per year — a little more than one per month — and be successful, they would,” Gross says. “In the course of one year, there aren’t more than 15 broad-appeal stories that a studio can develop, produce, market and distribute effectively around the world; 30 wide releases is extremely unrealistic.”\n\n\tCinema operators are still badly bruised from Disney’s 2019 purchase of 20th Century Fox — whose film library boasted franchises such as “Avatar,” “X-Men” and “Alien” — which left the business with one fewer major studio. Prior to the merger, Fox released 14 films in 2017, 14 in 2018 and 11 in 2019. Under the Disney banner, 20th Century Studios output shrank dramatically with three movies in 2023, four in 2024 and six in 2025. Despite Ellison’s comments about increasing production, exhibitors predict a similar decline if Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros. passes regulatory approval.\n\n\t“A combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. would consolidate as much as 40% of each year’s domestic box office in the hands of single dominant studio,” Cinema United, the trade organization that represents the exhibitors, warned in early February for a Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on anti-trust, competition policy and consumer rights. “The impact will not only be felt by theatre owners, but by movie fans and surrounding businesses in communities of all sizes.”\n\n\tAlthough rival studio executives and cinema operators feel that neither deal is beneficial for the industry, some have expressed a sense of relief that Paramount won out since the company already has the necessary infrastructure to support the big screen.\n\t\n\n\t“Given its history, Paramount has the edge because it’s always been doing theatrical,” Randleman says. “We want to see the creative community have strong support behind them. We need a strong theatrical industry ecosystem. Our hope is they live up to their word.”\n\n\tBut is it realistic to think that Paramount will be able to significantly ramp up its output by combining with Warner Bros. while also finding ways to cut costs and service the massive debt load? Ellison might be saying all the right things to theater owners, but history tells a different story.\n",

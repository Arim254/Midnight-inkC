    "body": "\n\tIndonesian production powerhouse MD Pictures is betting big on remakes and franchise fare for 2026, unveiling a slate anchored by an adaptation of Majid Majidi’s Oscar-nominated Iranian drama “Children of Heaven” and the final chapter of its popular “Danur” horror franchise at the JAFF Market. \n\n\tDirector Hanung Bramantyo is helming the “Children of Heaven” remake, with young actors Jared Ali and Humaira Jahra playing the siblings Ali and Zahra. Bramantyo led a talk at the MD booth titled “Children of Heaven: The Art of Film Adaptation.”\n\t\n\n\tThe company also presented “Danur the Last Chapter,” directed by Awi Suryadi, as the concluding installment of the “Danur” franchise. Cast member Zee Asadel participated in a meet-and-greet with festival attendees.\n\n\n\tMD Pictures’ 2026 lineup includes a Korean horror remake, adapting “Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum” (2018) as “Rumah Sakit Angker Korea,” directed by Anggy Umbara. The cast features Arbani Yasiz, Elang El Gibran, Saputra Kori and YouTuber Jang Hansol.\n\n\tDirector Kimo Stamboel, who led a creative talk about “Janur Ireng: Sewu Dino the Sequel” (releasing Dec. 24) with cast member Gisellma, will return to helm “Ivanna 2,” another entry in the “Danur Universe” franchise.\n\n\t“Our ambition doesn’t stop here – MD can expand internationally even further, proving we are the biggest content powerhouse in Southeast Asia,” said Manoj Punjabi, CEO and founder of MD Entertainment. “Whatever good films exist, we will fight for them.”\n\n\tThe company also hosted a panel titled “Set, Space, Story: When Space Tells a Story with TACO,” featuring TACO Group, an Indonesian supplier of interior-exterior materials for film production. MD Entertainment opened collaboration opportunities for creative projects at the market.\n\t\n\n\tMD Pictures released “KKN di Desa Penari” in 2022, which became Indonesia‘s highest-grossing horror film with over 10 million admissions. The company acquired and launched streaming platform MDTV in early 2025.\n\n\tThe second edition of JAFF Market runs Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at Jogja Expo Center in Yogyakarta.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe second edition of the JAFF Market opened in Yogyakarta with a traditional Hanoman dance performance before market director Linda Gozali – who is also a producer with Magma Entertainment – formally began the program, setting the tone for a year she described as a strategic phase in the platform’s development.\n\n\t“It’s a baby — JAFF is 20 years old, and our market is only in its second edition,” Gozali said, referring to the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival, the long-running Yogyakarta festival whose industry platform is the JAFF Market. “But we believe it is a reliable and structured, future-oriented industry platform.” She announced a major increase in participation: “This year we have 116 exhibitors, 122 companies, and more than 1,400 accreditation badges… Last year it was only about 900 to 1,000.” Encouraging attendees to move through the expanded venue, she said, “One thing I would like to remind everybody — you have to walk to every single corner of this venue. You cannot miss even a single thing.”\n\t\n\n\tGozali positioned the JAFF Market as a regional and global connector. “JAFF Market exists as a strategic bridge connecting projects, talents, companies and investors from Indonesia to the regional and even global industry,” she said. “Ideas find direction, strategies find momentum, creative ambition meets real pathways in production, distribution and even beyond.” The festival, now in its 20th year, presents its top honor, the Golden Hanoman Award, to the best Asian feature in competition.\n\n\n\tGozali then introduced Ahmad Mahendra, Director General of Cultural Development, Utilization and Fostering at the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Indonesia, who delivered greetings from the Minister of Culture. Mahendra noted that JAFF Market provides essential visibility: “JAFF Market is more of a transactional or pitching forum. This is where the ecosystem finds room to meet,” he said, calling it “the only showcase we have to be more visible internationally.”\n\t\n\n\tMahendra detailed the ministry’s initiatives over the past year: “We have facilitated 85 filmmakers to six international festivals… 13 film festivals within Indonesia… 27 Indonesian films entering nominations at international festivals… five films receiving international recognition.” He added that four Indonesian filmmakers served as jurors at major global events and highlighted talent development efforts: “More than 1,200 talents have been produced… 18 of them have received international recognition in Busan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Berlin and Rotterdam.”\n\n\tHe praised Yogyakarta’s cultural ecosystem and said, “Indonesia owes JAFF and JAFF Market. This is our showcase to be more visible internationally.”\n\n\tSultan Baktiar Najamudin, Chair of the Regional Representative Council of the Republic of Indonesia, followed with remarks framing JAFF Market within the cultural and economic fabric of Indonesia. He opened by acknowledging the recent disasters in Sumatra: “The voice of nature has become louder than humans… This is an ecological alarm for all of us.”\n\n\tHe described JAFF Market as “a reflection of the long journey of Indonesia’s film ecosystem,” saying, “Ideas meet craft, craft becomes opportunity, and opportunity creates hope.” Najamudin emphasized the industry’s economic impact: “If the national film industry grows, regional economies will also advance.”\n\n\tCalling Indonesia “the greatest cinematic stage God has given us,” he invoked landscapes “from Sabang to Merauke… from the beaches of Mentawai to the jungles of Sumatra.” Addressing young filmmakers directly, he said, “The world is waiting.”\n\n\tJAFF Market 2025 is held in Yogyakarta from Nov. 29 to Dec. 1.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKleber Mendonça Filho, whose latest film “The Secret Agent” represents Brazil in the international feature film race at the Oscars, sounded the alarm on the disruptive impact of “streaming culture” on moviegoing, especially in countries like the U.S. where theatrical windows are shorter.\n\n\tWhile speaking at the Marrakech Film Festival, where he took part in an on-stage conversation, the celebrated Brazilian filmmaker said, “We’re going through a crisis in terms of going to the cinema, but I think with streaming culture and also with the pandemic, the rules were changed.”\n\t\n\n\t“It’d always been very clear that to see a film, you would see it in the cinema (…). Well, this is not so clear anymore. I think this is taking many people away from the cinema-going experience,” he said, before adding that “the industry, particularly in Hollywood, really has to draw a line if they want to keep filmgoing alive.”\n\n\n\tMendonça Filho, who’s due to attend the Gotham Awards where his movie is nominated, went on explaining that Hollywood should make it a rule “to only release films on streaming after three or four months.” The outspoken helmer pointed out that Brazil’s cinema culture and box office have remained healthy, partly thanks to longer theatrical windows.“Now that ‘The Secret Agent’ is in cinemas in Brazil, we made it crystal clear that this film will be in cinemas only for months, and then only later it will be streaming at some point. If you send that message, if you make it clear, people will come, and this is what’s happening in Brazil now.”He also admitted he wouldn’t want to make a film knowing it will only be available on streaming, but wouldn’t have an issue having it drop on a platform after its theatrical run. “People say never say never, but I don’t feel like making a film only for a stream,” he said. “I don’t think I would concentrate on what I have to do if I knew that the end result would be screened for the first time on a streaming platform.” He joked that he’s heard some people say they watched his 2012 movie “Neighboring Sounds” in 17 parts over the course of two weeks. “It’s fine, watching it in 17 parts. But at some point, I know that that film had its best life in cinemas,” he quipped.Sold around the world by MK2 Films, “The Secret Agent” world-premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won two prizes, best director and best actor for Wagner Moura, as well as the FIPRESCI Prize.\n\n\t“The Secret Agent” is a politically charged thriller featuring Moura as Marcelo, a technology expert on the run during Carnival season in the late 1970s, during the final years of Brazil’s military dictatorship.Addressing the timeliness of “The Secret Agent,” Mendonça Filho said he realized the contemporary resonance while developing it, as he would draw parallels with Brazil’s former far-right populist president Jair Bolsonaro, who’s now serving a 27-year sentence for criminal conspiracy.\n\n\t“I was writing about 1977, but at some point, I began to realize that Bolsonaro brought a lot of the logic from 50 years ago to his government,” said Mendonça Filho. “It really felt like him and his people were trying to bring back the good old days of the military regime, almost like a Halloween party.”\n\t\n\n\tHe said the film has also struck a chord in Spain, because Spain experienced “the Franco regime,” as well as in “the United States, where there have been very strong reactions,” he noted.\n\n\tNeon, which picked it up during the Cannes Film Festival, opened it in New York on Nov. 26 and will next launch it in L.A. on Dec. 5, with a national rollout to follow.\n\n\tThe 22nd edition of the Marrakech Film Festival kicked off on Friday night with the Moroccan premiere of “Dead Man’s Wire.” Bong Joon-ho is presiding over a powerhouse jury comprising Celine Song, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jenna Ortega, Julia Ducournau, Karim Aïnouz, Hakim Belabbes, and Payman Maadi.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesian production company Mandela Pictures has revealed a new film slate and launched BN13, a genre studio dedicated to developing horror and genre content rooted in Indonesian folklore and mythology.\n\n\tThe Jakarta-based company revealed three feature projects set for release over the next two years: “Bisikan Desa Gringsing — Whisper of Fatimah,” “Rumah Singgah” and “Lukisan Berlumur Darah.”\n\n\n\t“Bisikan Desa Gringsing — Whisper of Fatimah” represents a significant milestone as the first Indonesia-Singapore-Malaysia horror co-production and the first regional horror film to utilize virtual production technology. The project, produced by Mandela Pictures and OMG Studios Singapore, is written and directed by Ivander Tedjasukmana and is currently wrapping principal photography. Aghniny Haque leads the cast, joined by Surya Saputra, Kiki Narendra, Khiva Iskak and Fatmah Nahdi. Production took place at OMG Studios’ virtual production facility in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, and on location in Subang, West Java.\n\t\n\n\t“Rumah Singgah” is an emotional drama centered on cancer patients pursuing their bucket list goals. The co-production between Mandela Pictures, Senara and Limelight Pictures is directed by Dyan Sunu Prastowo from a screenplay by Raditya, based on a story by Celvin Jaya Hadi. Zara Adhisty and Devano Danendra star alongside Ciccio Manassero, Messi Gusti, Dewi Irawan and Aming.\n\n\t“Lukisan Berlumur Darah” will remake the 1988 Indonesian horror cult classic. The co-production between Mandela Pictures and Relate Films will be written and directed by Adriyanto Dewo, with production scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2026.\n\t\n\n\tThe newly established BN13 studio will focus on developing intellectual property grounded in cultural research and local folklore, with plans to produce two to three horror and genre projects annually. The studio’s initial slate includes “Istana Ratu Kidul,” “Teror Gaib Satu Malam” and “Warisan Ilmu Hitam.”\n\n\t“Istana Ratu Kidul” is being developed as a cross-format property exploring the relationship between humans and the Queen of the Southern Sea, blending Javanese mythology with contemporary storytelling.\n\n\t“With this new slate and the launch of BN13, we want to show how Mandela Pictures continues to drive collaboration, adopt new technologies, and craft stories that not only entertain but also leave a strong emotional imprint on audiences,” said Manoj Samtani, CEO of Mandela Pictures.\n\n\tBN13 is being developed in collaboration with Dienan Silmy and Sonya Laoh, with projects designed for multiple formats including features, series, documentaries and digital content.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeading Indonesian studio Magma Entertainment has confirmed “Qodrat 3,” the latest instalment of their hit franchise, at the JAFF Market.\n\n\tFounded by siblings Charles and Linda Gozali, the children of pioneering Garuda Films producer, the late Hendrick Gozali, Magma was founded in 2003. \n\n\t“Qodrat 3” was first announced at the inaugural JAFF Market last year. \n\n\n\tProducer Charles Gozali said: “Making ‘Qodrat 3’ isn’t just responding to market demand, it’s about protecting a cinematic legacy. We are approaching this with precision and care to ensure the third instalment stands on firm creative justification, from the directing vision and character evolution to the spiritual depth at the heart of the story.” \n\t\n\n\tFormally announcing the launch of “Qodrat 3,” Magma Entertainment underscored “Qodrat” as the studio’s flagship IP as the cinematic universe expands. The next instalment of Ustadz Qodrat’s story will be slated for Indonesian theaters in 2028. Charles Gozali, as the main producer of “Qodrat” series emphasized the significance of deliberate world-building in a discussion session held at Magma Entertainment’s booth.\n\n\tThe company also unveiled “Mayat Hidup,” billed as as a campy and colorful comedic horror explicitly inspired by iconic vampire flicks of Hong Kong cinema from the 80s and 90s. The producers promise a vibrant, dynamic tone that appeals to nostalgic cultural aesthetics that are valued throughout Asia. Its production is scheduled to start in 2026.\n\n\tThe producers confirmed “Badut Gendong” as the pivotal step in the expansion of the “Qodrat” cinematic universe, which will be released across Indonesia in 2026. Featuring Marthino Lio as the leading role, the main plot navigates a fresh mystery of a haunting clown-doll entity.\n\t\n\n\tUnveiled earlier in the day was “Badut Gendong,” a co-production between Magma Entertainment, Legacy Pictures, Virtuelines Entertainment, VMS Studio, Caravan Studios and Malaysia’s Komet Productions, Skop Productions, Astro Shaw, plus India’s Applause Entertainment. Directed by Charles Gozali, the film also features Dayinta Melira, Clara Bernadeth and Derby Romero in the cast.\n\n\t“‘Badut Gendong’ is the natural evolution of the ‘Qodrat’ universe. We’re not simply making a spin-off, we’re building a larger, more immersive narrative architecture. We are committed to preserving the emotional depth that has always been the DNA of ‘Qodrat,’” producer Linda Gozali said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrance and Indonesia are strengthening their strategic cultural partnership through an expanded suite of cinema initiatives, as the France-Indonesia Film Lab returns for its second edition at JAFF Market.\n\n\tIndonesia is a key priority for the French government, and culture is at the heart of the strategic partnership, according to Fabien Penone, French ambassador to Indonesia, Timor Leste and ASEAN. The partnership recognizes that both countries have important and dynamic cultural industries covering different sectors, especially cinema, he says.\n\t\n\n\tThe collaboration builds on high-level governmental commitments, including state visits by Presidents Emmanuel Macron and Prabowo Subianto. In July, the French culture minister welcomed Indonesian counterparts to Paris, where they adopted a cultural roadmap with particular emphasis on cinema, Penone says.\n\n\n\tThe France-Indonesia Film Lab, running Nov. 27 through Dec. 1 in Yogyakarta, has scaled up significantly from its inaugural 2024 edition. “We are identifying emerging talents in Indonesia, and we are following them, mentoring them,” Penone tells Variety at the JAFF Market. “This year, we have identified six Indonesian teams, producer and film directors who are in the process of developing their first or second feature film. The objective is basically to pave the way for future Indonesia-France co-productions.”\n\n\tThe lab has been reinforced with two key components. “First, cinema scriptwriting, with the support of CNC cinema agency,” Penone says. “We are mentoring those young talents for them to get the tools to be in capacity to meet our producers to pitch.” The second component is an industry lab designed to help filmmakers better understand the French ecosystem, including financing options and institutional support.\n\t\n\n\tLooking ahead, “in 2026, we will organize co-production meetings not only for Indonesia, but some other Southeast Asian countries, and then they will have the opportunity to meet our producers,” he says.\n\n\tFive French experts are participating in this year’s lab, including Thomas Rosso, the general coordinator from Cannes Critics’ Week, and four producers already working in Southeast Asia. “The lab is longer than last year, so we have much more time to accompany these young talents,” Penone notes.\n\n\tBeyond the lab, France is launching multiple initiatives to elevate Indonesian cinema’s international profile. The French Cinematheque will host a retrospective of Indonesian cinema beginning Dec. 10 in Paris, showcasing major Indonesian films from independence to present day and providing visibility for Indonesian cinema to French audiences and industry professionals, Penone says.\n\n\tIndonesian Culture Minister Fadli Zon will attend and meet with French Culture Minister Rachida Dati to discuss further operationalization of the July roadmap.\n\n\tIn 2026, Indonesian filmmakers will gain visibility at specialized French festivals. Gérardmer Film Festival will spotlight Indonesia for the first time, with filmmaker Joko Anwar as guest of honor, Penone says. The ambassador notes this creates opportunities to screen Anwar’s work, describing him as among Indonesia’s most talented horror and fantasy filmmakers.\n\n\tClermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival will also feature Indonesian short films. “We think there are many opportunities for young Indonesian filmmakers because the short movies here are very creative, very interesting. We want to showcase the dynamism of Indonesian cinema,” Penone says.\n\n\tCannes Critics’ Week has announced Next Step Studio Indonesia, a short film co-creation program for emerging Indonesian directors launching in May 2026.\n\n\tThe partnership emphasizes reciprocal learning. “This is real partnership,” Penone says. “We are co-financing all our programs, co-defining the objectives, and co-implementing all the initiatives. We have a lot to learn and gain from our partnership with Indonesia. We consider that both countries are creative with a lot of stories to tell, with a lot of talents. We want to merge our soft power.”\n\t\n\n\tThe collaboration operates on principles outlined in the Borobudur Declaration between the two presidents. France is working with Indonesia’s Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Creative Economy and regional governments including Jakarta and Central Java.\n\n\tWhile France and Indonesia have not formalized a co-production treaty, Penone emphasizes results over bureaucracy. “We want to be very operational. You can sign many papers. What we want is concrete results, and this is the way we are working,” he says. The strategic framework exists through presidential declarations and ministerial roadmaps, with a clear goal to develop co-production through concrete projects rather than just agreements on paper.\n\n\tJAFF Market, Indonesia’s first large-scale film market, is emerging as a key platform. “We consider JAFF Market as very strategic. The market is growing. It is beginning to be one of the most important cinema markets in Asia, and for sure, in Southeast Asia,” Penone says.\n\n\tThe French Embassy has organized Festival Sinema Prancis in Indonesia for 26 years, with this year’s 27th edition coinciding with the Indonesia-France Film Lab at JAFF Market.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesian production company Forka Films has unveiled a production consortium for auteur Kamila Andini’s upcoming feature “Four Seasons in Java,” scheduled for 2026 release.\n\n\tThe announcement came at the JAFF Market 2025 in Yogyakarta. The cast includes Putri Marino, Arya Saloka, Christine Hakim and Hana Pitrashata Malasan. The on-stage event also showcased some first-look footage from the film. \n\n\n\tThe project won two prizes at the inaugural Tokyo Gap-Financing Market Awards in October, securing the Tokyo Projects Award worth $13,225 and the Kongchak Award from Cambodia-based Kongchak Studio, offering sound post-production services valued at $25,000. The film previously participated in the Venice Gap-Financing Market.\n\t\n\n\tThe Indonesian consortium brings together Miles Films, Imajinari, Jagartha, Trinity, Team Up, Julie Estelle and Navvaros. Oriflame has joined as brand sponsor, with Jaris & K serving as out-of-home media partner.\n\n\tThe project’s international co-production partners span eight territories: Storm Films (Norway), Lemming Films (Netherlands), One Two Films (Germany), Ici Et La Production (France), Giraffe Pictures (Singapore), PFX (Poland), Brand Film (Indonesia) and Chada Entertainment (Thailand).\n\n\tDevelopment backing comes from Hubert Bals Fund Development, Hubert Bals Fund + Netherlands Film Fund, and Sorfond – The Norwegian South Film Fund.\n\n\tThe magical realist drama follows Pertiwi, a woman who returns to her village after more than a decade in prison for killing a young man while defending herself from attempted rape. Her homecoming coincides with the arrival of electricity to the remote community.\n\t\n\n\tFormerly known as Fourcolours Films, Forka Films was founded in 2001 and is led by filmmaker Ifa Isfansyah, who also serves as director of the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival. The company’s credits include Eddie Cahyono’s “Siti” (Telluride 2015), Kamila Andini’s “Yuni” (Platform Prize, Toronto 2021) and Andini’s “Before, Now & Then” (Silver Bear, Berlinale 2022). Garin Nugroho’s “Memories of My Body” premiered in Venice’s Horizons strand ib 2018, while Wicaksono Wisnu Legowo’s “Turah” served as Indonesia’s submission to the Oscars in 2018.\n\n\tMost recently, the company produced Netflix miniseries “Cigarette Girl,” directed by Isfansyah and Andini, which won best mini-series at the 2024 Seoul International Drama Awards.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrench actor Vincent Lindon often plays well-meaning characters. But he can’t take credit for their selfless choices, he stressed.\n\n\t“When I made ‘Welcome’ [about a man helping Kurdish refugee] there were people in the street who shook my hand and said: ‘Thank you very much for what you do for the migrants. Really, Mr. Lindon, bravo.’ I replied: ‘Thank you, but it’s not me’.” \n\n\n\t“When I made ‘The Measure of a Man,’ they said: ‘You’re really brave.’ They confuse what I do in films with who I am in real life. But my small contribution is that I’m still making them. I could’ve been making bigger films, earning more money and taking fewer risks.”\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking at Torino Film Festival, where he’s set to pick up the Stella della Mole award during the closing ceremony, Lindon opened up about what drives most of his choices. \n\n\t“If a film I’m in can change even one person, if it can change the opinion of someone who’s racist, anti-Semitic or homophobic, then it’s good that I’m doing this job.”\n\n\tHe said that some of his roles have “prevented him from behaving badly in life.”\n\n\t“I can’t speak badly to those who serve me in restaurants. I can’t go on holiday to Saint-Tropez or drive a convertible. I have to behave like my characters, because there’s nothing worse than making people believe in something yet being the opposite in real life.” \n\n\tHe added: “Famous people like to preach, yet they still use their private jets and eat in palaces. That’s fine, everyone has their own conscience, but then don’t talk to me about carbon dioxide pollution.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m a human being: I am weak. These films force me to be stronger, if only a little.” \n\n\tAt the fest, Lindon presented Stéphane Brizé’s “At War,” about a factory strike: “It’s one of my favorite films, and I shot it with my favorite director.” They’ve also made “The Measure of a Man,” which won him a César and an award at Cannes, “Mademoiselle Chambon,” “A Few Hours of Spring” and “Another World.”\n\n\tHe also introduced the audience to Jean Boronat, one of the non-professional actors from the set, who praised Lindon for “being modest yet doing a lot for people outside of films.” “I’m in love with what he represents and embodies.” \n\n\tLindon’s no stranger to showier roles, having appeared in the controversial Cannes winner “Titane” and played sculptor Auguste Rodin. He has also recently joined the star-studded cast of Ruben Östlund’s “The Entertainment System Is Down.” However, it was “At War” that “touched him especially deeply.” \n\n\t“My character is a trade unionist, but he’s ready to lose his life, lose his job, lose his family. He’s ready to lose everything to help a cause move forward,” he explained.  \n\n\t“We often say ‘I’d give anything for things to go better,’ but we don’t really mean it. We would give a lot, but not everything. Him, he keeps nothing for himself.” \n\n\tThe role was one of his biggest challenges he’d ever faced as an actor.  \n\n\t“I needed to prove to myself that, despite coming from a bourgeois family, I could still embody him. I had to let go of many things and privileges. I know what it cost me, but I don’t regret it. In fact, it brought me a lot.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJenna Ortega sounded off on artificial intelligence at the Marrakech Film Festival, saying “it’s very easy to be terrified” of the “deep uncertainty” it brings to filmmaking and the world.\n\n\tThe “Wednesday” star is serving on the jury at the Moroccan fest, which is being headed by “Parasite” filmmaker Bong Joon Ho. Asked about the proliferation of AI in cinema at the jury press conference on Saturday morning, both Ortega and Bong made their opinions clear.\n\t\n\n\tOrtega said that looking back at the history of humankind, “we just always take things too far and I think it’s very easy to be terrified — I know I am — of deep uncertainty.” She added that, with AI, “it kind of feels like we’ve opened Pandora’s box in a way.”\n\n\n\tHowever, Ortega is hopeful that the growth of AI could lead to a new artistic revolution. “In these difficult and confusing times, oftentimes it pushes the artist to speak out more, to do more, for there to be this new awakening and passion and protection and I want to assume and hope that that’s the case,” she said. “But there’s certain things that AI just isn’t able to replicate. There’s beauty in difficulty and there’s beauty in mistakes, and a computer can’t do that. A computer has no soul.”\n\n\tOrtega said that she hopes AI “comes to a point where it becomes sort of mental junk food and we feel sick and we don’t know why. I think, as terrible as it is to say, sometimes audiences need to be deprived of something in order to appreciate something again.”\n\n\tBong agreed with Ortega, saying AI could be “good” in the sense that “it’s the very beginning of the human race finally seriously thinking about what only humans can do.” But, he added with a laugh: “My personal answer is I’m going to organize a military squad where their mission is to destroy AI all over the world.”\n\t\n\n\tAlongside Ortega and Bong, the Marrakech jury includes “Furiosa” lead Anya Taylor-Joy, “Past Lives” and “Materialists” filmmaker Celine Song, “Titane” Palme d’Or winner Julia Ducournau, Bralizian director Karim Aïnouz, Moroccan filmmaker Hakim Belabbes and Iranian-American actor-director Payman Maadi.\n\n\tSong also didn’t mince her words on the topic of AI, saying: “To quote Guillermo del Toro, who’s going to be here at this festival soon, fuck AI.” She added that it is “completely destroying our planet” and “colonizing our mind and the way that we encounter images, the way we encounter sound.”\n\n\t“I’m very concerned about it because I think that the No. 1 thing that we’re here to defend as artists is humanity,” Song continued. “It’s trying to encroach on what makes our lives very beautiful and very hard and what makes life worth doing … Deeply and not very respectfully, fuck AI.”\n\n\tElsewhere during the conference, Taylor-Joy was asked her thoughts on being part of a jury where she will be judging other actors’ performances. She offered a poignant response: “We live in a world where there’s a lot of premium placed on how loud you can be. If you can out scream somebody else, what your argument is, you’re taught to have an opinion more than you’re taught to have critical thinking. I believe that in silence, even if it is uncomfortable at the beginning, it just teaches you to be a much better listener. I think in general, not only in art but where we’re at in the world currently, I think we’d all be a lot better off if we listened more than we yelled on top of each other.”\n\n\tMarrakech Film Festival, which runs through Dec. 6, officially kicked off on Friday night with a screening of Gus Van Sant’s “Dead Man’s Wire.” Its lineup also includes tributes to Jodie Foster and del Toro alongside screenings of “A Private Life” and “Frankenstein”, as well as conversations with Kleber Mendonça Filho, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences CEO Bill Kramer, “The Matrix” star Laurence Fishburne, “It Was Just an Accident” Palme d’Or winner Jafar Panahi and “Blonde” director Andrew Dominik.\n\n\tMarrakech’s official competition comprises 14 features made by first- or second-time filmmakers from around the world in an effort to discover new international talent. Other films playing during the festival include Chloe Zhao’s “Hamnet,” Maryam Touzani’s “Calle Málaga” and closer “Palestine 36.”\n",

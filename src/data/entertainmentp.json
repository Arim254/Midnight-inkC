    "body": "\n\tKiran Rao‘s production banner Kindling Pictures is backing commercial director Bosco Bhandarkar’s feature directorial debut “Shadow Hill: Of Spirits and Men,” which has been selected for the WAVES Film Bazaar‘s Co-Production Market.\n\n\tThe Bazaar is the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI). \n\n\tThe film follows two men on a treasure hunt in Goa — one seeking closure about a hidden truth and the other looking for an escape from drudgery. A mysterious woman who tells tales of the past helps both men find resolution. Set against the backdrop of Goa’s transformation from a tranquil coastal region to an urban sprawl, the story blends comedic and tragic moments while exploring themes of memory, loss and human connection.\n\t\n\n\t“The idea is to find love as a counterforce to cynicism,” says Bhandarkar, who drew inspiration from childhood summer vacations spent at an ancestral house in a Goan village. “We are living in times when one hopes for some faith in humanity, and I hope our film helps reflect this in some small and beautiful ways.”\n\n\n\tThe director said he wanted to address the ecological destruction caused by Goa’s booming real estate market and political corruption, noting that “the very concepts of space and time have shifted drastically for the locals in present times, and not for the best.”\n\n\tRao, who co-founded Kindling Pictures with producer Tanaji Dasgupta, has known Bhandarkar for over 25 years. “His perspective is unusual, mischievous, and deeply human,” says Rao. “Through humor and irony, he is able to peel back the surface of ordinary life and reveal its hidden layers, often through striking, poetic imagery.”\n\t\n\n\tBhandarkar has spent most of his career directing commercials. He describes himself as a daydreamer who loves “films made by filmmakers who have school bags filled with empathy.”\n\n\tAt Film Bazaar, Kindling Pictures is seeking co-producers, financiers and film funds. The company has invested 25% of the budget and is looking to raise additional financing while attaching strategic partners to help execute Bhandarkar’s vision.\n\n\t“We believe it embodies a rare balance of humor, poignancy, and danger,” said Rao. “We are very excited about this film because it promises to be an extraordinary cinematic experience,” adds Dasgupta.\n",

    "body": "\n\tImmigrant drama “Feather Men” (Khoriya), the debut feature from Delhi-based filmmaker Vishwendra Singh, has been selected for the Work-in-Progress (WIP) section at WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI). \n\n\tThe project comes from Future East Film. The film is produced by Niharika Singh (“Cla$$”) with Ashim Ahluwalia (Cannes, Venice and SXSW-premiering director of “Miss Lovely”) serving as executive producer. Co-producers include Faraz Khan (Going Rogue films) and Prayas Deepti (Inquilab Studios).\n\t\n\n\t“Feather Men” follows two Nepali half-brothers fighting to keep their modest poultry farm afloat as a bird-flu epidemic ravages their flock. As their livelihood collapses, the fissures between the two brothers intensify. A migrant parlour worker contending with predatory labour and the fluorescent exploitation of the city’s beauty industry is the third character in a film that the producers describe as “both an intimate character study and a wider metaphor about those living at the periphery of India’s booming urban expansion.” \n\n\n\tSays producer Niharika Singh, “This is a story about the universal search for dignity in a world changing faster than people can keep up.”\n\n\tDirector Vishwendra Singh has long collaborated with Future East, serving on the teams of “Daddy” (2017), “The Field Guide to Evil” (2018) and “Cla$$” (2023). His debut short “Hauah,” played at festivals including NYIFF and DIFF. “Feather Men” marks his first feature.\n\n\tThe production has been financed independently to date, and the team now seeks completion funding to finish post-production and begin engaging with sales and distribution partners. Debut actors Nilesh Rai, Bhawana Rai and Suman Rai lead the cast of the Nepali-Hindi language feature which is currently in the editing stage.\n\t\n\n\t“At Future East, we are committed to creating space for narratives that rarely find support within either mainstream or arthouse frameworks. Through “Khoriya,” we reaffirm our belief that cinema must also belong to those who exist on its periphery and are often unacknowledged. It is a story not bound by geography, but by the shared human desire to be seen, heard, and remembered,” says producer Singh.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 1, Episode 5 of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tPennywise the Clown feed",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 1, Episode 5 of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tPennywise the Clown feeds on fear, and children are his entree of choice.\n\n\tWhen the first episode of HBO’s “It: Welcome to Derry” introduced an ensemble of young protagonists, audiences might’ve reasonably expected that they would become the series’ main characters, the show’s answer to the Losers Club of early-adolescent heroes from Stephen King’s novel and the “It” films.\n\t\n\n\tHowever, the Episode 1’s shocking conclusion saw more than half of the kids meet a gristly fate, leaving a clear message that no one is safe in the eponymous town.\n\n\n\tTherefore, as new kids were introduced across Episodes 2, 3 and 4, one could be understandably skeptical about their permanence in the show, especially as they enter the story via disparate avenues. However, in Episode 5, they finally team up to go into the sewers underneath Derry, where they come face-to-face with Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe kids are Will Hanlon (Blake Cameron James), Lilly Bainbridge (Clara Stack), Veronica “Ronnie” Grogan (Amanda Christine), Rich Santos (Arian S. Cartaya) and Marge Truman (Matilda Lawler). Variety spoke with the young cast to talk about how they landed their parts on the show, and how they built up the courage to steal some of the series’ most terrifying scenes.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you all learn that you would be playing your characters in “Welcome to Derry”?\t\n\n\tClara Stack: I didn’t find out until months after the audition, so it definitely came as a shock to me. My mom found out through my agent first, so then my family sat me down on my couch in my living room and told me. I was honestly super shocked and super excited. Getting to go to Toronto to film was such an incredible experience. I was honestly honored to get to explore the Stephen King “It” universe.\n\t\n\n\tMatilda Lawler: When I found out that I booked Marge, I was so thrilled. I am obsessed with Marge. She really spoke to me when I did the audition, and it was many months later when I found out that I would be playing her. I think I was doing a dance recital for the weekend. Right before I was about to do this dance show, I found out that I would be able to play Marge, and my heart grew three sizes. I definitely danced better than I usually dance because I was so excited.\n\n\tAmanda Christine: When I got my audition, I only sent in one take. I didn’t even know what the show was, because it was very top secret and they named it something like “Fairview” when I got the audition. It was very intense. It was the scene from Episode 2, towards the end, when my dad gets taken to Shawshank. So it was a very intense scene to send in for me. It was very fun to film. And then when I got the scripts, I was like, “Oh my gosh, I’m Ronnie Grogan.” Then I was learning about the “It” universe and watching the movies with my castmates and really just diving in, taking notes with Andy [Muschietti] and Barbara [Muschietti] and having meetings with our acting coach, Mr. Ben [Perkins].\n\n\tArian S. Cartaya: If I remember correctly, I was at my grandma’s house when my mom opened the email and got the news. I just started bouncing off the walls with excitement.\n\n\tBlake Cameron James: I think that I was downstairs in my basement. Well actually, I don’t know where I was. I can’t remember. Somewhere in my house.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHad any of you seen the “It” movies or read the book by Stephen King?\t\n\n\tBlake Cameron James: Not at all. I hadn’t read the book. I hadn’t seen any of the movies because I was so terrified of Pennywise. He’s always been my biggest fear, like my No. 1 biggest fear. So I never even indulged in any of that.\n\n\tArian S. Cartaya: I watched the first “It” movie once we got to Canada. We all watched it in the movie theater. So yeah, that was a really fun experience. But I still haven’t read the book.\n\t\n\n\tAmanda Christine: I watched the movie a couple months before I knew that I had booked the role of Ronnie. When I had watched it, I was actually in acting class. It was during Halloween time in October and our assignment was to watch Halloween movies. So I watched “It,” and it was scary. I was like, “Oh my God. I’ve never seen a scarier clown in my life!” I’ve since started reading the book. It is huge, but I’m halfway through, and I’m still trying to really dive deep into it and take notes about the “It” universe. Because it is so big, and there’s so much happening — and so much that we dive into in this prequel series with the myths, the nuclear things, the tension of racial traumas and the bullying of the kids and all of us coming together as friends to fight it off.\n\n\tMatilda Lawler: I’m in the same boat as Amanda. I’m trying to make my way through the book. It’s truly unlike anything else. I’m such a fan of Stephen King as an author, I think he’s so powerful. Some of my favorite horror movies are “The Shining” and “Carrie.” I just love his work. So I was a huge fan, and I tried to watch the movie for my sister’s birthday, because that was her birthday wish. And I was so terrified that I forced us to shut it off. I literally couldn’t handle it, and I had a meltdown. And then my sister tried to torment me by showing me pictures of Pennywise, like she would just randomly show a picture of Pennywise to me, because she knew I was so scared. That’s what siblings do. But anyways, when I got the audition, I revisited the movie and was able to make it through without having a meltdown. I was in love with it. I was terrified, but also I love the weird humor that Andy incorporates. I was obsessed.\n\n\tClara Stack: I’m actually a big fan of horror movies. I have been since I was little. I watched the first “It” movie when I was about 9, so I was kind of already a little familiar with the “It” universe. I hadn’t read the book prior to the audition, but I think Stephen King is so talented, and I’m a big fan of his work. Getting to step into the universe with this prequel series was honestly just such an honor.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid it ever feel scary working on the show, or has working on it made horror movies feel less scary?\t\n\n\tMatilda Lawler: I would say it is scary on set, even though sometimes it feels a little bit ridiculous because you don’t actually have anything to react to. Half the time you’re just reacting to air or a piece of tape or Andy screaming weird sounds into the microphone. It’s a bizarre experience, but our acting coach, Mr. Ben, did a really good job of helping us try to create a sense of fear, even when it wasn’t in front of our eyes. We kind of created a safe space to get vulnerable and to get in touch with our own personal fears and our characters’ fears. Sometimes he’d play music, sometimes he’d show us imagery that was scary to us or sometimes we’d touch on personal experiences. Having those acting tools to help us in those moments was really helpful.\n\n\tAmanda Stack: I think some scenes were definitely really scary. There were a lot of intense scenes, but I think having Andy and Barbara on set, as well as our acting coach, Mr. Ben, made everything feel more comfortable. They made set feel like such a welcoming place and they made it feel like such a family, which I’m so grateful for, because I think that made filming all the more fun and easier to get through. Filming was super fun. There were definitely some intense, horrific scenes, but I also think it’s really cool to see the contrast of when we’re filming it versus when it’s on screen, with all the CGI and all the effects added.\n\n\tAmanda Christine: It’s definitely different in-person versus seeing it on the screen with the CGI and the VFX and everything added into it. It’s so amazing to see how everything came together and just how terrifying it is. In person, we had to connect to some deep stuff. Music is a big part of my life, so I would use that to get into character, but to have the tools to build off of our characters and arcs and everything that we need is just amazing to me. So it was really fun. Andy and Barbara made that environment very welcoming for us and so did Mr. Ben and it was just an amazing experience.\n\n\tBlake Cameron James: Honestly, I got a little bit more interested in horror after this, but I still don’t ever watch anything too scary. It’s a very thin line, but I feel like this show helped me a bit because you get kind of desensitized to it after you work with Pennywise and dead bodies and a bunch of blood. You get to see it from a different light once you’ve been on the set. So you’re like, “Oh, that’s a prosthetic. Oh, that’s fake.”\n\n\tArian S. Cartaya: I feel like this experience has helped me conquer my fears a little, but I’m still horrified of other scary movies or shows, so I won’t be watching the other ones. Those are too scary.\n\n\tThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSet within the charged social landscape of Ahmedabad, writer-director Aarti Neharsh’s debut feature “Kanda” or “No Onions” uses psychological horror to probe questions of purity, caste and domestic control.\n\n\tThe film has Shakun Batra (“Gehraiyaan”) of Jouska Films and Dimpy Agrawal of Gubbara Entertainment (co-producer “Shadowbox,” Perspectives at Berlinale 2025) attached as co-producers. “No Onions” has been pre-selected for the Sundance Development Track and is currently in late development. With partial funding in place, the filmmakers are seeking co-producers, financiers and sales partners at WAVES Film Bazaar – the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) – with the goal of moving into pre-production mid-2026. \n\t\n\n\tNeharsh’s script follows a pregnant woman whose growing cravings for foods forbidden in her faith begin to disrupt the order and ritual of her devout household. As her desires intensify, long-standing codes of discipline — dietary, religious, and familial — start to crack, revealing the buried tensions within a seemingly harmonious home.\n\n\n\tFor Neharsh, the story is deeply personal. Raised in Ahmedabad, she recalls the quiet but rigid practices of purity woven into everyday life. “I remember friends sitting apart during lunch, refusing to touch certain tiffins; women being isolated during their periods even in the most “modern” homes. Ahmedabad itself — with its segregated markets, “pure veg” tables, and invisible social divides — carries this obsession of purity. Only later did I realise how deeply that was tied to caste and a social segregation of people,” she says. \n\t\n\n\tWith “No Onions”, she reframes vegetarianism, often understood internationally as an ethical lifestyle, through the Indian lens of caste purity and religious discipline. “No Onions” aims to be a slow-burning psychological-horror that turns the domesticity of a house into a stage for an eerie unravelling while asking whether the hunger of a woman, or the order that seeks to crush it is more horrifying.\n\n\tNeharsh approaches the film as a genre piece rooted in the rhythms of domestic life. She says, “I’ve always been drawn to genre films, especially Korean horrors, because they allow you to explore deeply personal and social ideas within an engaging, cinematic frame. That’s what I wanted to do with my debut feature.”\n\n\tHer debut short “The Song We Sang”, also set in Ahmedabad, had a successful festival run, winning awards at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, Dharamshala International Film Festival, and a Special Jury Mention at the London Indian Film Festival. Neharsh has been directing commercials alongside developing her feature debut.\n",

Norris, the father of Billy Bob Thornton’s main character, Tommy, on the second season of “Landman.”\n\t\n\n\tAudiences first meet T.L. in more of an emotional state than the stoic actor often portrays, as he receives news that his wife has died at a memory care facility. Meanwhile, T.L. is at a separate facility, his body broken down from a life in the oil fields, and he seems to exist only to see the West Texas sunset every day.\n\n\n\tWhen asked how he was able to conjure up such intense emotion on the show, Elliott said it was a naturalistic process.\n\n\t“It’s just on the page,” he said. “I had time to think about it. I just wanted to be open to whatever comes my way. When you have that kind of material, you don’t look at a piece of material, or at least I don’t look at a piece of material, and say, ‘I’d really love to cry here,’ or, ‘Really love to make the audience cry,’ or whatever. It just has to come naturally. One of the great gifts about Taylor’s material is that it just allows that kind of emotion to flow. I spent a good part of my time in tears this entire season, so it wasn’t something I expected, but it’s just something that happened.”\n\n\tFurthermore, Elliott said he feels a deep connection to Sheridan’s storytelling that extends to the quiet life he lives with his wife, actor Katharine Ross, and their daughter, Cleo.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve spent a good portion of my life growing up in the outdoors, and there’s something about Taylor’s material that I feel like it hinges on that in some respect. That really speaks deeply to me,” Elliott said. “It’s this man connected to the ground, what comes up out of the ground. It’s certainly not like ‘1883’ where we’re out in the elements and all that all the time, but there’s something about what I value personally. It’s like where I live. I live on the western end of Malibu. I’ve been there for 50 years with my wife and daughter. That takes me away from LA completely, and it’s a choice I’ve made. It’s probably not the smartest choice in terms of pursuing a career in the movie business.\n\n\t“I’m in the elements, and that’s the life that I chose, that Katharine and I and Cleo, all three of us, embrace,” he continued. “There’s something about this guy sitting in a wheelchair at 81 or 82 years old, however old he is, watching the sun go down. I mean, I don’t know how much more to say about it than that. There’s a reason for that. He’s drawn to that, and he talks about it in Episode 2, the light and the dust and the heat and the lack of moisture and the things we hate about that country. It hates us all day, and then it gives us this sunset. Those elements speak very, very strongly to me.”\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tUdo Kier, a German actor and cult icon who collaborated with everyone from Andy Warhol to Lars von Trier to Madonna, died on Sunday morning, according to his partner, artist Delbert McBride. He was 81. \n\n\tAmong the more than 200 films in his expansive body of work, Kier’s breakout collaborations with Warhol are among his most celebrated. Kier starred in the titular roles in both 1973’s “Flesh for Frankenstein” and 1974’s “Blood for Dracula.” Both directed by Paul Morrissey and produced by Warhol, the films are subversive, sultry reimaginings of the classic Hollywood monsters, with Kier bringing a haunting yet comically inept spin on the title characters. \n\t\n\n\tThat pair of films made Kier famous, and he spent the next two decades working through Europe and collaborating with legendary writer-director Rainer Werner Fassbinder on films like “The Stationmaster’s Wife,” “The Third Generation” and “Lili Marleen.” Then, at the Berlin Film Festival, Kier met future two-time Oscar-nominated director Gus Van Sant, who Kier credits with securing him an American work permit and a SAG card.\n\n\n\tIn 1991, Van Sant widely introduced Kier to American audiences with his coming-of-age drama “My Own Private Idaho,” loosely based on Shakespeare’s “Henry IV.” Kier appeared in a supporting role alongside stars River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. \n\n\tAround the same time, Kier began his lifelong collaboration with von Trier. Starting in the late ’80s with “Epidemic,” Kier appeared in the 1991 film “Europa” before appearing in several episodes of von Trier’s long-running horror-thriller series “The Kingdom” through the ’90s and aughts. Their other film collaborations include “Breaking the Waves,” “Dancer in the Dark,” “Dogville,” “Melancholia” and “Nymphomaniac: Vol. II.” \n\t\n\n\tThe 1990s also saw Kier in several supporting roles in major Hollywood productions, such as “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,” “Armageddon” and “Blade.” He also appeared in Madonna’s book “Sex” in 1992, and made appearances in her music videos for “Erotica” and “Deeper and Deeper” from her album “Erotica.”\n\n\tMost recently, Kier appeared in Kleber Mendonça Filho’s awards darling “The Secret Agent.” The film earned star Wagner Moura the honor for best actor at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\tBorn Udo Kierspe in Cologne, Germany, in a hospital that was being bombed by Allied Forces, he moved to London at 18 after meeting Fassbinder in a bar. \n\n\t“I liked the attention, so I became an actor,” he told Variety‘s Peter Debruge in a 2024 interview. After working between Europe and the U.S. for many decades, Kier settled in Los Angeles and Palm Springs, where he lived in a former mid-century library and cultivated interests in art, architecture and collecting. He was a fixture at the Palm Springs Film Festival, where he warmly received accolades from fans. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJacqueline Bisset had “mixed feelings” when presented a Torino Film Festival lifetime achievement honor for a simple reason: “I have not finished my career!”\n\n\tEven so, she gladly embraced Torino’s invitation to champion the films closest to her heart — many small, independent titles that never found distribution in Italy. “They may not be widely known, but they show an actor’s craft at its best,” Bisset said, noting that she has often been “judged, to some degree, by my earlier work, where the film roles were not great.” \n\t\n\n\tShe brought that same candor and enthusiasm to a Sunday press conference, happily sharing anecdotes about her iconic screen partners, while reserving her most generous praise for lesser-known collaborators. \n\n\n\tOf Paul Newman, she spoke affectionately of “a truly kind man” who was “shy and terrible at telling jokes because he couldn’t keep a straight face — he would start laughing before getting to the punchline.” Of Mickey Rourke, she admitted, “I had a little fear of him because he creates a kind of frenzy; it just builds around him. He’s there, quietly talking, and all around is chaos.” \n\n\tAnd of Kelly Blatz, her co-star in 2022’s “Loren & Rose,” she beamed: “He gave me so much life because he really listened, staying patient through all my long monologues and lines. That’s a real gift, because acting is all about exchange. If you pay particular attention, you can almost force the other actor to be more real — all by simply listening properly.”\n\n\t“Silence is necessary, and men love to talk about themselves,” she added wryly, noting that this advice, passed down from her parents, has served her well “in life and in cinema.” \n\t\n\n\tBisset also offered a more practical tip: abandon the saltshaker. “If you don’t want to age or swell like alcoholics, don’t use salt,” she said. “You will discover the true sensitivity of taste in food. It’s fantastic, and it took me some time to learn this — but in Italy, it’s hopeless; nobody listens.” \n\n\tFood could also become political — a lesson made clear during the shooting of 1974’s “Murder on the Orient Express.” \n\n\t“The production asked if we were willing to go against the union and shorten the lunch break from one hour to half an hour. I did not accept, because lunchtime was the highlight of the day — when we could sit and listen to Lauren Bacall — and they were asking us to break the rules. Vanessa Redgrave, who was fantastic, wonderful, and a born fighter, said, ‘We must not accept, we must not give in.’” \n\n\tWhen it came time to vote, Vanessa led the charge. “I raised my hand and voted, only to realize that no one else did. We completely lost. But Vanessa, truly passionate both as a woman and as an actress, said, ‘That was the only moment of courage in that film.’”\n\n\tThe cookhouse, meanwhile, has become an outlet for Bisset’s self-confessed autocratic instincts. \n\n\t“I have a great visual sense and I am very efficient, so I would be a fantastic director,” she explained. “I’m also very organized, I don’t like receiving help, and I prefer to have my own kingdom entirely to myself. So it’s better that I do it at home, not on a set. \n\n\t“I wouldn’t behave very well,” she continued. “I would certainly have problems with personal interaction — loving the wrong person, wanting to please one person and not another. I might become a monster. So I limit myself to doing my job as an actress, staying in front of the camera. And people don’t enter my kitchen.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tShaboozey and Stephen Wilson Jr. chose the CMA Awards telecast for the live television premiere performance of their theme for the Stephen King adaptation “The Long Walk.” Titled “Took a Walk,” the duet aims to let viewers down easy from the brutal dystopia they’ve just been witness to, and to suggest, in ballad form, that there may yet be unity at the end of the road, as unlikely as that seems right now… er, in the movie.\n\n\tIn a visit to the Variety CMA Awards Interview Lounge — presented by Duke Cannon at Anzie Blue — the two talked about how the collaboration came to be. \n\t\n\n\t“To be honest, how it came about for me was, they used  one of my songs in the trailer, ‘Last of My Kind,’” explains Shaboozey. “I’m very particular… (but) I love a lot of Midwest, Middle America textures… and it was a Stephen King movie. And like Stephen (Wilson) here, I’m also like a huge Stephen King fan as well — ‘Christine,’ ‘Salem’s Lot,’ ‘The Shining, the list can keep going. So I was really like, this is a dream come true, just having a song in the trailer.\n\n\n\t“And then I hit up my team and I was like, ‘Hey, is there any more opportunity to create for this movie?’ The team reached out to the studio and the studio’s like, ‘Hey, we need an end credit song.’  I just got to got to cooking. They showed me a preview, I checked it out, and I was like really moved by it, and then I wrote the song that day. Immediately after watching the movie, I got some members from my band together and we came up with some chords, picked up our guitars and started writing. \n\n\t“And then, Stephen, everyone in my band is a huge fan of you. Like  they would rather play for you than play for me, truthfully,” laughs the “Tipsy” singer. “It’s all right, but they love him so much… I sent him a text, and it just made sense, man; it came from my gut. I didn’t think of anybody else. … He just jumped on it and did his thing. Man, you make me look like a bad-ass.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tWilson refers to it as a “full circle” experience, the circle beginning with his obsession with all things King.\n\n\tThe Big Loud-signed singer-songwriter says that he and Shaboozey “met a couple years ago, actually at a CMA after party. It was right before he like started taking off. I was just about to put out a record and he stopped me — I think he had heard a song or two of mine — and was like, ‘You’re a bad dude.’ And I was like, ‘You’re a bad dude.’ … And then sure enough, two years later, you know, he asked me to be a part of this song. \n\n\t“What’s wild is, I started singing this song called ‘Stand By Me’ because of the movie called ‘Stand By Me,’ based off the Stephen King novella called ‘The Body.’ It’s haunted me my whole life, that song, and I sang it in this dude’s basement and it blew up online. AA big reason why I have a career is because of that song ‘Stand By Me’ and because of Stephen King.” Notably, Wilson’s solo-acoustic rendition of that song, which he performed on the CMAs in addition to the Shaboozey collaboration, was considered by many to be the highlight of Wednesday’s telecast. \n\n\t“Then in the midst of all the craziness of that year, this dude hits me up and says, ‘Yo, I got this song that I want you to be a part of for this Stephen King movie called “The Long Walk.”‘ And they’d teed it up. I mean, they had this incredible verse and chorus and all I could do was screw it up. So I really went into songwriter mode and tried to, I don’t know, just support this in any way possible, not knowing where it was gonna go. I wrote the verse and they loved it. Two days later I sang it. Two weeks later we heard it on a trailer. \n\n\t“And here we are singing it at the CMAs. I’m singing ‘Stand by Me,’ and I’m singing ‘Took a Walk,’ both from a Stephen King movie. My name’s Stephen with a PH. I ain’t no King… It’s just a weird full circle thing. I couldn’t have planned this if I tried. It is a God thing.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStephen Wilson Jr. and Shaboozey in the Variety CMA Awards Lounge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSays Shaboozey, “It’s funny, how he has this whole lore behind it. When I met him, the first thing I said to him was, ‘Has anybody told you you look like Stephen King?’  … Everything he put on the track is just, you did us all proud, man. Honestly, thank you.”\n\t\n\n\tThey worry about giving away spoilers in talking about the way the song succeeds the ending of the film, although the movie has had its run in theaters, so much of the potential audience has seen it. (Mild spoiler alert…)\n\n\t“I also like the way the story ends with two characters, with the duality of the two. I think that’s a beautiful thing… there’s two singers and it ends with two walkers … I think that was just meant to be, whether we meant for it to be or not.”\n\n\tThe journey metaphors come easily. “I’m just walking the walk. He and I both are. And when he and I met each other, it was at the beginning of our walk — at least the busy part of our walk. But when we were singing that during rehearsal, there’s a line in the chorus: ‘I know you’re tired. Hell, so am I, we can’t take the same road again…’ And I think, looking at each other now, singing that line, it comes with a beautiful sting that rings a little bit more true. And I’m grateful to be on that road… especially with you, dude.”\n\n\n\n\n\tShaboozey talked about the tour he recently wrapped up: “I had this concept for doing this tour called the Great American Road Show for a couple years now. I kind of was just talking about how I felt like America has gotten so far from the idea of what it was originally — people coming here looking for a new life to settle in and just be free to practice and worship and live culturally the way they they choose to, as long as it’s not infringing on other people’s rights. So I just wanted people to know that I’m here with them as well, and we just all want for the same thing… to be respectful of each other and embracing other cultures.”\n\n\tSpeaking of the movie, Wilson says “the attempt here is to level the playing field and just remind everybody that we’re all just trying to survive and we all just want the best for one another. A hundred percent trying to live the best life we can because it’s really such a precious thing. Life is so fragile and humanity in itself is fragile, and we need to cherish and protect our civilization and not take it for granted.”\n\n\n\n\n\tWilson talked about his just-released single, “Gary,” off a planned 2026 sophomore album. “I had this epiphany a little over a year ago that there ain’t a lot of boys named Gary anymore. And where I come from, the Garys just know how to fix things. They don’t know why. They just do. And, I think we’re gonna need our Garys, because tech is great and all, but at the end of the day, septic tanks ain’t going nowhere, and we’re gonna need a Gary to show up. … I’d like to celebrate some people that usually are never celebrated. And I think Gary might be one of them, or at least the metaphorical Garys that we’re gonna need that make the world go round and keep our trucks running and keep the tires full of air and keep the plumbing working and, and pretty much all the stuff that nobody really wants to talk about… that keep the world going around.”\n\t\n\n\tShaboozey was more mum when asked about the seemingly likely prospect of a 2026 album.\n\n\tHe’s “just working, honestly,” he said. “I just wanna keep telling my story, and telling stories. I’m a huge storyteller and world builder. So I can’t really speak too much on it, but I’m really excited for anything for what’s coming in 2026. It’s gonna be really, really, really awesome.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStephen Wilson Jr. and Shaboozey at the Variety CMA Awards Interview Lounge presented by Duke Cannon at Anzie Blue on November 18, 2025 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBoth artists were put up in the best new artist category at the CMAs. Ultimately, the prize went to Zach Top. But the competition was anything but cut-throat, as far as these two were concerned.\n\n\t“Being nominated is a huge win for me,” said Wilson. “I’ve never been a cool kid, so I feel like the nerdy kid in the ’90s movie that they nominate as prom king, just so they can make fun of him.”\n\n\t“Don’t be Carrie in there, man,” said Shaboozey. “Don’t rise up and bring down Bridgestone Arena on top of us.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWork stunk on the Anthony Bourdain biopic — and Antonio Banderas relished the experience. \n\n\t“We spent a month and a half filming in Cape Cod and Newport, constantly surrounded by the smell of fish,” he laughed. “Every time I came back to the hotel, I had to shower because I absolutely reeked — I was cleaning fish every single day!” \n\n\tSpeaking at the Torino Film Festival, Banderas shed new light on the Matt Johnson-directed, A24-produced “Tony,” which reimagines the chef-turned-globetrotter as an aimless young man. \n\t\n\n\t“After finishing university, [Bourdain] originally wanted to become a writer,” Banderas said. “But almost immediately, he began struggling with depression and drug addiction, so the film explores the very difficult early years of his life.” \n\n\n\tBanderas plays a Brazilian-born restaurateur who takes the young Tony — played by “The Holdovers” breakout Dominic Sessa — under his wing. “Through this relationship, Tony begins to truly learn how to cook,” he said. “So the film is not just about cuisine or culinary techniques; it’s about his life, his identity, and his way of being — shaped by this unique mentor.” \n\n\tWhile the real Bourdain began as a dishwasher at a restaurant run by Provincetown mainstay Ciro Cozzi, Banderas’ mentor is more of a composite character. He described the part as “a man from Brazil who works in the United States and has travelled the world.” \n\n\t“My character studied at the finest institutions, graduating from the best gastronomy schools, yet he always remained an outsider,” Banderas added. “He created his own restaurant outside the traditional world of elite chefs, developing his own dishes with ingredients accessible to ordinary communities — simple food for everyday people.” \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBanderas and Torino artistic director Giulio Base \n\t\n\n\n\n\tIndeed, Banderas placed great emphasis on mentors while in Turin to accept a lifetime achievement award — even describing his own career as the product of serendipitous encounters.\n\n\t“I am a theater actor,” he explained. “Cinema came by chance, thanks to Pedro Almodóvar — a ‘chance’ that led to 130 films, but still, it was chance. Theater was my first love, and for the past seven or eight years, I’ve returned to my home in Malaga and to my true home on the stage. My life has changed, and now I am finally doing what my life’s project was always meant to be.”\n\n\tActor Paul Newman — the subject of a 24-film retrospective at this year’s Torino Film Festival, and whose piercing blue eyes stare out from the festival poster — was another formative figure in Banderas’ life.\n\n\t“I worked for a year in New York doing a musical,” Banderas recalled. “One day I was on stage, singing, and at a certain point I saw Paul Newman with those eyes staring at me. I froze completely — it was incredibly powerful. We made a couple of films together, and I worked with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in ‘Philadelphia.’ He liked me, so we often went out to dinner in New York. He had this quirky habit: he would always ask for a very specific beer and tell the waiter, ‘In exactly 2 minutes and 45 seconds, please bring me another!’ I still think about that.”\n",

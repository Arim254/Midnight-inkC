    "body": "\n\tThe British Academy has unveiled the make-up of its 14,000 members five years after going through a comprehensive review process aimed at increasing diversity and inclusion. \n\n\tAccording to BAFTA, as of 2025, it has achieved nearly all of the membership targets set out in 2020, with 20% minority ethnic group (actual 19.85%), 12% Deaf, Disabled & Neurodivergent (actually 12.84%) and 10% LGB+ (actual 13.29%). However, while BAFTA did set a target of 50% of its membership identifying as women, this figure is currently 43%. But it noted that 51% of new members joining since 2020 identify as women.\n\t\n\n\tA socio-economic background target was not set in 2020, with BAFTA introducing this question — as determined by the Social Mobility Commission — and beginning reporting on it in 2023. Currently, 19% of members are from working class backgrounds, with 21% of all new members joining since 2020 identifying in this group.\n\n\n\tFrom 2026, BAFTA says it will increase its membership target for Deaf, Disabled and Neurodivergent to 18% by 2030 (based on the UK working age population 2024) and aimed to attract 25% of new members from low socio-economic backgrounds by 2030.  It also claims it will look in more depth at the representation of People of Colour in senior industry leader roles, and focus on increasing women in the games sector and in craft roles where current representation is lower than 40%.\n\n\t“I’m proud of the progress BAFTA has made in growing a diverse membership that reflects the breadth of talent and experiences of those working in film, games and television today,” said BAFTA Chair Sara Putt. “There are areas where systemic challenges continue to limit opportunity, and we must continue to push industry benchmarks where representation lags behind the U.K. working age population — for example, the number of disabled people in our industries and the number of those from working class backgrounds. We will use our membership data to highlight and explore in more depth areas where underrepresentation persists, for example, women in games and craft roles, and people of colour in senior industry leader roles.”\n\t\n\n\tAdded Andrew Miller, BAFTA Board Trustee and Disability Advisory Group member: “Inclusion doesn’t just happen, it takes effort, energy and commitment. So I am immensely proud of BAFTA’s determination to shift the dial around disability. With nearly 13% of our membership now declaring disability and an ambitious stretch target in place for 2030, BAFTA is offering an industry lead in how to deliver real change when it comes to representation of disabled people.”\n\n\tIn total, 10,000 BAFTA members vote across BAFTA annual awards in film, games and television. 782 new full members have joined BAFTA this year. \n",

    "body": "\n\tKirsten Dunst discussed the progress that has been achieved in the film and TV industry since the #MeToo movement took hold, during an on-stage interview on Thursday at Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea Film Festival.\n\n\tAsked by an audience member whether male actors and directors had got the memo on #MeToo, she fired back: “I think we’ve put a lot of people away. I feel like people definitely can’t get away with what they used to. That’s for sure.”\n\t\n\n\tShe added: “Everybody has an eye out now. So I think that it’s a much safer environment for all of us.”\n\n\n\tSpeaking about her experience when she was a young actress, she said: “I was lucky. I had a good family, a good mother. My mother was always around. Like, I never had anything, you know, negative happen to me like that. I was very protected.”\n\n\tDunst preferred to accentuate the positive aspects of the industry in other parts of the discussion, such as when, as an 11 year old, she appeared in “Interview With the Vampire.” She recalled: “I remember everyone treating me like a little princess, that’s for sure. Like I remember it was Christmas time and Tom Cruise put a gorgeous Christmas tree in my dressing room.”\n\n\tSpeaking about Lars von Trier’s 2011 film “Melancholia,” for which she won best actress in Cannes, she said: “I loved making that movie. Even though I was playing someone who was very depressed, I was having the best time making that film.\n\n\t“I felt so safe. Lars … his whole team was women, around him. It was such a calm and nurturing environment, and all the other actors were so wonderful,” she said, name-checking Alexander Skarsgård and Charlotte Rampling, who she said was “one of my favorite actresses.”\n\t\n\n\tShe added: “So just to be there and feel so comfortable and not question anything that I did … it was one of the most freeing acting experiences for me that I’ve ever had.”\n\n\tDunst also paid credit to Sofia Coppola, with whom she worked on 2006 costume drama “Marie Antoinette.” She said the relationship with Coppola “was really impactful, as a woman at 16, for me, because in an industry that wants you to change how you look, or, you know, focuses a lot on vanity, she really just loved me and my weird teeth, you know, things that other people wanted to change about me. \n\n\t“She thought I was beautiful, and at 16, to have someone you look up to so much think that of you really gave me, like, such a huge, huge confidence. You know, I didn’t have an older sister, so that gave me a very big confidence. It’s not like I was overly confident, but it was like a quiet knowledge that I had inside me, that sustained me while I was growing up in this industry.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSingapore-based animated horror anthology “A Banquet for Hungry Ghosts” has expanded its international co-production footprint with the addition of Kucing Hitam, one of Indonesia’s largest independent creative producing and IP management company, the producers revealed at Asia TV Forum. \n\n\tThe Indonesian genre specialist joins Robot Playground Media (Singapore), Xanthus Animation (Taiwan), and Toonz Media Group (Ireland/India) in co-producing and handling sales for the feature. The project adapts the acclaimed book by Chinese-American author and chef Ying Chang Compestine into four standalone but interlinked stories.\n\t\n\n\tCurrently in early-stage production, “A Banquet for Hungry Ghosts” recently won the NMEA Award at Taiwan Creative Content Fest in November, an honor recognizing projects that exemplify cross-sector collaboration bridging industries, technologies and cultures.\n\n\n\tFounded in 2019, Kucing Hitam has built a portfolio of standout Southeast Asian genre properties, including “KKN di Desa Penari,” Indonesia’s highest-grossing horror film released by MD Pictures. The company has cultivated culturally rooted stories with viral grassroots creators including Prasodjo Muhammad, Nessie Judge and Teguh Faluvie. The company formally expanded into film production in 2024.\n\n\t“This project speaks to us,” said Charles Johannes, founder of Kucing Hitam. “The story has the same cultural spirit that drives Indonesia’s new wave of genre films — strong traditions, modern concerns, and the ability to reach audiences everywhere. We’re excited to work with an international team to grow this IP and bring it to viewers far beyond where it began.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Kucing Hitam team has been involved in Indonesia’s highest-grossing films of all time, representing more than $20 million in cumulative box office revenue. Joining them in producing the Indonesian-set elements will be LMN VFX in Jakarta and Indonesia-Singapore investment firm Goshen Group.\n\n\tMediacorp, Singapore’s national media network, has supported the project from its earliest stages, investing in its creative development as a pilot when initially conceived as a television series.\n\n\t“Congratulations to the team on this exciting new chapter for ‘A Banquet for Hungry Ghosts,'” said Angeline Poh, chief customer and corporate development officer at Mediacorp. “It is gratifying to see a concept first seeded at Creatives Assembly — Mediacorp’s call for ideas initiative — evolve from a series pilot into a feature film with regional partners and global ambitions. It is inspiring to see how far the team has taken the project, and we look forward to celebrating their continued success.”\n\n\tTelegael, the multi-Emmy and IFTA award-winning Irish studio within Toonz Media Group, has also come aboard to lead post-production. The collaboration blends Eastern storytelling traditions with European post-production capabilities.\n\n\t“Kucing Hitam’s entrance strengthens the spine and lore of this anthology film,” said Ervin Han, co-founder of Robot Playground Media who created the project. “Their instincts for Asian horror make them an invaluable partner as we deepen the world-building and push the project towards global audiences.”\n\n\tProducer Justin Deimen highlighted the franchise potential: “We’re excited to have Kucing Hitam be a part of ‘Banquet’s kitchen given their expertise in building one of the most outstanding film franchises in Southeast Asia. We see ‘A Banquet for Hungry Ghosts’ in the same vein — supremely scalable and commercial across the region, with the ability to fork into different formats, and being altogether ripe for brand partnerships and the wider involvement of consumer sectors into creative IP.”\n\n\tAllen Jordan, managing director of Goshen Group, added: “The Indonesian audience will connect immediately with the film because it touches on two of the country’s great passions — food and horror. It’s a natural fit for our market, and we’re proud to support its development at this stage.”\n\t\n\n\t“A Banquet for Hungry Ghosts” is slated for theatrical release in early 2027. After being represented by Toonz Media Group at the American Film Market, the project returns to Asia where Toonz and Robot Playground will continue driving presales across the region.\n\n\tRobot Playground Media is a Singapore-based animation and creative studio founded in 2014, known for its Southeast Asian cultural lens and cross-border collaborations.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPortuguese suspense thriller series “The Scream” (“O Grito”), directed and produced by Leonel Vieira, has quickly become one of the key calling cards of Portugal’s fast-evolving drama scene. \n\n\tProduced by Lisbon-based Volf Entertainment in co-production with public broadcaster RTP, the eight-part, 45-minute drama bowed this fall on HBO Max in Portugal and Spain, where it has ranked consistently among the service’s most-watched local titles. It now rolls out from Dec. 8 on free-to-air TV on RTP1 and RTP Play, airing in a weekly primetime slot. \n\t\n\n\tSet in the contemporary Portuguese education system, “The Scream” hinges on the suicide of Vitória Neves (Daniela Ruah), a committed high-school teacher who sacrifices her personal life to hold together her students, colleagues and family. \n\n\n\tUnable to accept that her sister has taken her own life, Sofia (Sara Matos), a London-based visual artist, returns home and retraces Vitória’s final months, uncovering emotional fault lines at home and at school. \n\n\tThe series unfolds across two timelines — Sofia’s present-day investigation and flashbacks to Vitória’s life and impact on those around her — using suspense and mystery to probe mental health, burnout and the hidden cost of public service. \n\n\tIn tone, the show plays as an emotional thriller rather than resort to pure social realism. Its narrative design leans heavily on cliffhangers, withheld information and shifting points of view, pulling viewers through the episodes as Sofia gradually pieces together what really drove Vitória beyond the brink. \n\t\n\n\tWhile the subject matter is sensitive — suicide, depression, institutional pressure — “O Grito” deliberately avoids a somber, punishing register, opting instead for a dynamic visual style, frequent sunlit scenes and a character-driven approach designed to spark mainstream reflection and conversation around schools and teachers in crisis. \n\n\tFor Vieira, one of Portugal’s most commercially successful director-producers, the series marks another step in a long-game to fuse popular storytelling with internationally viable production values. He broke box office records with his 2015 remake of classic comedy “O Pátio das Cantigas,” part of a “Novos Clássicos” trilogy, which ranks among the country’s all-time local hits and cemented his reputation as a crowd-pleasing stylist. \n\n\tAs a producer and director, he has delivered nearly 40 features and TV projects, often working in cross-border structures with Brazil, Spain, France and the U.S., and collecting festival selections and awards along the way. \n\n\tRecent credits range from RTP period drama “The Crime of Father Amaro” — winner of best TV series and pilot at the 2023 Buenos Aires International Film Festival — to Brazilian-shot thriller “The Last Animal” and the coffee-magnate biopic “Sr. Rui,” which topped Prime Video’s local ranking.\n\n\tBacked by an entertainment-focused investment fund managed by Quadrantis Capital, Volf Entertainment has quickly positioned itself as a high-output banner targeting both domestic and international markets. Beyond “The Scream,” its 2025 slate includes theatrical hit “O Pátio da Saudade,” which opened strongly in Portuguese cinemas, and the HBO Max-RTP thriller “Favàritx,” while the company is already developing a new thriller with Spain’s Nadie Es Perfecto for SkyShowtime Spain, with Vieira attached as showrunner, co-writer and director.  \n\n\tFresh off dual wins for best TV series and best director at Buenos Aires International Film Festival, “The Scream” is now being positioned for further international distribution as Volf leans into an emerging Portugal–Spain drama axis.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSara Matos (right) in ‘O Grito’\n\t\n\n\n\n\tVieira fielded questions from Variety as the series is set to roll out on RTP:\n\t\n\n\tSuspense keeps viewers coming back. If it’s suspense around what a character for which the audience feels a large empathy and also investigates their death, even more so – which seems key to “The Scream” – allowing you to dig deep into human nature. But do you agree?\n\n\tYes, I completely agree. In the series, suspense arises directly from the characters’ internal conflicts. I wanted the viewer to feel at every moment that something was about to happen – that subtle uneasiness that something is not quite right, without knowing exactly what. We worked with silences, small decisions and glances that don’t reveal the character’s next move, emphasizing the complexity of their feelings and deepening the mystery that surrounds them.\n\n\tOne of the most interesting aspects of “The Scream” is its use of time. You open in 2008 and, after two scenes, jump a decade. Episode 1 ends on a cliffhanger; Episode 2 starts, however, with son Pedro as a child, even if it’s a nightmare. What were you looking for with those time jumps?\n\n\tThis structure was defined with the writers during development. We opted for a non-linear construction that allows the viewer to piece together the puzzle across the episodes and forces them to follow the different timelines more closely. I believe this approach increases curiosity and also contributes to suspense.\n\n\tIn Episode 2, the series begins to explore the use — and abuse — of authority, both in education and in the family. Does this become one of the core themes of the show?\n\n\tMore than just a theme, authoritarianism emerges as another facet of complex human behavior. In the case of the school principal, her authoritarianism is a pretext to better understand her insecurities, fears and frustrations. We were very interested in exploring the motivations behind human behavior, not just labelling characters as “good” or “bad.”\n\n\tHow did RTP and HBO Max each come on board in terms of commissioning, co-production commitments and the way domestic and international rights were structured?\n\n\tHBO Max read the scripts and believed in the project from the outset, acquiring SVOD rights for Portugal and Spain. RTP has been my main partner in Portugal in developing series and films, involved in practically all my productions. As a public television station, it has shown great interest in collaborating with platforms in co-financing projects and sharing windows, so it acquired free TV rights for Portugal. Volf also received financial support from Portugal’s cash rebate (Pic Portugal) and funding from the Oeiras City Council, where the entire series was filmed, which is why international marketing rights belong to Volf. International distributors have already expressed interest, and we are currently analyzing those opportunities. \n\t\n\n\tVolf Entertainment is backed by the Quadrantis Capital fund, which suggests a clear growth and scalability mandate. How is that financial structure shaping Volf’s international ambitions?\n\n\tThe fact that Volf Entertainment is integrated into an investment fund gives us financial stability and a strong capacity for project development, which we’ve been doing over the last two years. With the new projects and partnerships we’re establishing, we believe that, in the medium term, we can consolidate Volf as a content producer with a clear international vocation. \n\n\tCasting Daniela Ruah, widely recognized internationally for “NCIS: Los Angeles,” opposite Sara Matos as Vitória and Sofia Neves gives “The Scream” both local star power and a global-friendly face. From a creative and strategic standpoint, what were you looking for in this pairing?\n\n\tSara Matos guarantees huge artistic quality and a strong impact on the Portuguese audience. The choice of Daniela Ruah allowed us to have a Portuguese actress who is also of great quality but with major international recognition, which gives the project greater visibility both in Spain and the rest of the world. The chemistry between them as sisters is essential — emotionally it grounds the series. \n\n\tFrom a producer’s standpoint, what key performance indicators will you be watching on “The Scream” — HBO Max viewing data, RTP linear ratings, social conversation — and how might those results shape your next high-end drama with both a streamer and a free-to-air broadcaster?\n\n\tWe don’t have access to the platform’s internal data, but feedback from HBO Max has been very positive. During the eight weeks of rollout, “O Grito” was consistently in the Top 5 in Portugal, and in Spain, Filmaffinity highlighted it for weeks as a must-see HBO Max title. The series will only premiere on RTP in December. I can say that the good performance of “O Grito” is already opening financing possibilities for new projects — I’ll have more news soon. \n\n\tWe’re seeing clear growth in TV drama co-productions between Portugal and Spain, at both broadcaster and streamer level. From your perspective at Volf, what are the most promising models for this Iberian axis and what kinds of stories work best as genuine Portugal–Spain co-productions?\n\t\n\n\tEverything starts in script development. Stories must be organic and incorporate themes and characters that relate to both countries from the outset. Only then are they interesting as real co-productions. Some are already being made and I think there’s a good path ahead. Everyone gains: we increase project funding and expand potential audiences. Iberian production has turned its back on itself for many years; I believe the tide is turning and we need to raise the level and quality of co-productions and multiply partnership projects. It’s a real growth opportunity for both Portuguese and Spanish producers.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGonçalo Almeida plays Pedro, Vitória’s son, in ‘O Grito’\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAMC Entertainment said chairman and CEO Adam Aron suffered a minor stroke while on a business trip in the U.K., but that he remains “at the helm” and expects a “speedy and full recovery.”\n\n\tThe company on Thursday disclosed that while on a recent London business trip related to the international movie theater activities of AMC, Aron, 71, suffered a minor stroke on Nov. 17. He “immediately received state-of-the-art emergency medical care” at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurological Sciences public hospital in London and received a “timely injection of clot-busting thrombolytic medication, staying overnight at the hospital for two nights.”\n\t\n\n\tPer AMC, “there are no indications of loss of cognitive brain function related to Mr. Aron’s ability to process complex information, his memory or his written communications, which are all normal and undiminished.” The company said that his only “meaningful limitation” was an initial slurring of his speech but that Aron has already seen a “remarkable recovery in the quality and tenor of his voice. He expects to make a speedy and full recovery.”\n\n\n\tThe theater chain’s statement continued: “Given his mental acuity and physical resilience, Mr. Aron remains in full command at the helm of AMC and continues to perform his duties as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. He has kept in close and constant communication with the Board of Directors of AMC, with respect both to the prognosis for his recovery as well as the general business affairs of the Company.”\n\n\tAccording to AMC, Aron remained in London before flying on commercial flights back to the U.S. this past weekend to attend Monday’s Los Angeles world premiere of James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Following the premiere, on Dec. 3, Aron returned to his personal residence and AMC’s headquarters location in metropolitan Kansas City. “As has been the case since his brief hospital stay, he continues to work on a full-time basis,” the company said.\n\t\n\n\tAron said in a statement provided by the company: “I so much want to thank the immensely skilled and caring staff of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurological Sciences. In thinking more broadly about what transpired of late, I am a poster child for listening to one’s own body, and immediately seeking emergency medical care at the very first signs of any potentially serious abnormality. I urge any and all not to delay should warning signs ever arise. For those alert enough to obtain such care quickly, the incredibly devoted men and women in emergency rooms the world over save lives every single day.”\n\n\tAron and AMC “thought it wisest to issue this fulsome statement to proactively dispel any conjecture that might arise during any of his public or private appearances. In respect to Mr. Aron’s privacy, however, AMC does not plan to comment further on his recovery,” the company said.\n\n\tAMC is the U.S.’s largest movie exhibition company (as well as the largest in Europe and the largest throughout the world) with approximately 860 theatres and 9,600 screens across the globe.\n",

    "body": "\n\tQueen Latifah captivated a packed crowd at the first of the Red Sea Film Festival “In Conversation” series, where she sat down with Saudi podcaster Mo Islam (“The Mo Show”) to reflect on her evolution from hip-hop pioneer to award-winning actor and producer.\n\n\tLatifah traced her creative foundation back to childhood. “There was a lot of music in my house, a lot of art, a lot of books,” she said. “There was just not much you couldn’t do in my family.” That sense of possibility eventually led her beyond music and into acting, where she found both freedom and challenge.\n\t\n\n\tShe recalled the turning point of her film career: “When I was nominated for my Oscar for ‘Chicago,’ it changed my career. You become known to people in places you never would’ve thought of.” The nomination allowed her production company to “swing toward film,” leading to projects like “Beauty Shop” and “Bringing Down the House,” where she was both on screen talent and producer.\n\n\n\tLatifah described her approach to choosing roles: “It all starts with a good script. Or I look for something in a character I think I can bring to it.” Many of her roles, she said, “weren’t written for a woman. We just saw something in them, changed the role, and then we had a movie.” She gravitates toward characters with strength, even in vulnerability: “Strong means someone who has to overcome something.”\n\n\tOn dealing with studio notes, she said bluntly: “You face pushback either way. The difficulty is when it’s from someone who has no creativity and way too much power.” Still, she emphasized the value of collaboration, adding that occasionally, “a good note can make it better for the audience.”\n\t\n\n\tLatifah closed by urging artists to live fully: “Nothing replaces actually living life. That’s what makes the art real.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFresh off one of the most ambitious shoots of his career, Tahar Rahim landed at the Marrakech Film Festival buzzing about Fred Cavayé’s dynamic new take on Victor Hugo’s classic “Les Misérables” — likening this new telling to “The Fugitive.”\n\tStarring opposite Vincent Lindon’s Valjean and supported by Noémie Merlant, Camille Cottin and Megan Northam, Rahim says “in this version, [director Fred Cavayé] wanted to focus more on the face-off — the cat-and-mouse dynamic between Javert and Valjean.”\n\t\n\t“It’s the same story, but told in a more dynamic way,” Rahim says, before adding It’s become a cultural tradition in France to make this movie every 40 years.” (Rahim’s seen almost all of them — and prefers Raymond Bernard’s 1934 take most of all). \n\n\tTo leave his mark on Javert, Rahim began by working backward from the character’s endpoint. (A spoiler warning feels almost unnecessary for a story told for more than 160 years, but here it is nonetheless.) Starting with Javert’s final moments helped him make sense of everything that leads up to them“I wanted to understand why someone — especially through the eyes of a modern audience — would commit suicide just because he suddenly realizes he was wrong,” he explains. “I couldn’t buy it. We had to find an answer, give it to the audience, and then slowly build the character and his obsession with Valjean from there.”“Now everything is rooted in realism,” he continues. “We can’t really buy the romantic idea of someone who realizes he was wrong and immediately kills himself. We needed an explanation, so we found a little element that’s mentioned in the book but has never been used in any previous version. We took a small seed and made it grow.”Indeed, Rahim has a knack for that kind of advance work — crafting textured psychological portraits and pairing them with rigorous preparation. “Getting out of a character is never difficult,” he says. “Getting into one is much harder.”To play Charles Aznavour in 2024’s “Monsieur Aznavour,” he spent six months in vocal training before production began — and then insisted on singing live on set. “At the end of the shoot, the director came to me with good news and bad news,” Rahim recalls. “The good news was that I did well. The bad news was that I’d now have to rerecord everything again — this time properly, in a studio.”He then shed significant weight to play an addict in Julia Ducournau’s “Alpha,” all while volunteering at a Paris needle-exchange program to better understand his character’s milieu.“I’m not crazy enough to actually go and try drugs,” says, who is presenting “Alpha” at Marrakech alongside Ducournau who sits on Bong Joon Ho’s jury. “But I needed to find a space, something real, some form of truth I could touch. I even developed this funny little addiction to cherry tomatoes and pistachios. I’d catch myself cutting the cherry tomatoes in two, putting a pistachio inside – almost like a ritual — because addiction is as much about the ritual as the chemical dependency. That’s when I realized, ‘Shit, I’m in it now.’”“From then on, I understood that they have a void they need to fill,” he continues. “I realized they were wounded kids, seen by common people like ghosts — and they know it. But they still have this little inner boy, this innocent, goofy energy that suddenly pops up. I talked with Julia a lot about that. I said, ‘We have to bring this into the character. We don’t want just a dark man suffering. We need some silliness as well.’”After unpacking the psychological depths of Javert, Aznavour and the haunted world of Ducournau’s “Alpha,” Rahim shifts gears when the conversation turns to “Madame Web,” in which he played the antagonist in the Spider-Verse spinoff.The actor is all too aware of the tongue-in-cheek social-media half-life of “Madame Web” — just don’t expect him to go scrolling for memes. “I’ve heard about all that,” Rahim deadpans. He admits he kept his distance. “I didn’t look them up because I knew it wouldn’t be a good idea (…) Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. I just did my job!”\n\t“Les Miserables” will be released in French theaters by Studiocanal in December 2026 and is already positioned as one of next year’s major cinema events with its starry cast and splashy budget.",

    "description": "\n\tBritish-Indian filmmaker Rowan Athale (“The Rise”) was just five years old when he first spotted Sylvester Stallone and Mr. T on the cover of a tape",
    "body": "\n\tBritish-Indian filmmaker Rowan Athale (“The Rise”) was just five years old when he first spotted Sylvester Stallone and Mr. T on the cover of a tape in a video store in Sheffield, England. That film was “Rocky 3,” in which Mr. T plays Clubber Lang, Rocky’s rival in the ring. The film would whet the young boy’s appetite not only for film itself but for boxing movies. Three decades later, in a twist of fate, the director would end up working with Stallone himself on his very own boxing drama, “Giant.” \n\t\n\n\tOpening this year’s Red Sea Film Festival on Thursday, the film is inspired by the real-life story of Prince Naseem “Naz” Hamed (Amir El-Masry), a British-Yemeni boxer who held multiple featherweight world championship titles between 1995 and 2000. “Giant” focuses specifically on the trajectory and fall of Naz’s relationship with coach Brendan Ingle, played by Pierce Brosnan. \n\n\n\tOn landing the renowned Irish actor to star in his film, Athale says Brosnan was on his “dream list,” but he believed he was out of reach given the magnitude of his fame — as well as the fact that the veteran actor had several projects lined up, including Steven Soderbergh’s “Black Bag” and Guy Ritchie’s “MobLand.” Still, Athale’s producer, Stuart Ford at AGC Studios, said they should give it a shot. \n\n\tTwo weeks later, the director got a call. “It was a phone call from Malibu, and I thought it was one of Pierce’s agents,” he recalls. “I was at the vegetable section of [food store] Morrison’s when I answered the phone, and it’s Pierce,” he continues. “I walked around the supermarket for 20 minutes giving him the pitch, which was bizarre. A day later, he was in.”\n\t\n\n\tFinding the right Naz was key to the success of the project, and the perfect choice came in the shape of “Limbo” and “The Crown” British-Egyptian rising star Amir El-Masry. With scheduling proving tricky due to Brosnan’s many projects, El-Masry came in with only a few weeks to prepare. “What he did in this film should be talked about in drama classes and film school,” remarks Athale. “Two weeks into prep, Amir had never boxed in his life. By the time we shoot the movie, he looks like [Prince Naseem]. It’s superhuman. I had never seen anything like that.” \n\n\tAs for having Stallone as an executive producer, the partnership happened once Athale’s “Little America,” which had Stallone set up to star, got postponed due to the pandemic. With that project on hold, Stallone, who heads up Balboa Productions, asked the director what else he had on his slate. “I told him I had a boxing film and he said: ‘I know a thing or two about those.’”\n\n\t“He and his producer wanted to read the script, then they came back with notes, but said they wanted to be involved with it and they could help open doors from the boxing side,” adds Athale. “It was this wonderful thing that he was able to do both creatively and in terms of the seal of approval he gave us.” As for “Little America,” the film is now set to shoot in 2026. “The market is there for it, the project sold around the world, which was an incredible reception. So we are ready to turn our heads back to this one.” \n\n\tFor now, Athale is basking in the “honor” of opening the Red Sea Film Festival. “It’s such a prestigious slot,” he says. “I haven’t been to the festival before, but I’ve followed it and seeing Spike Lee there last year, Sean Baker this year, it’s wonderful company to be in.” The screening is even more special to the director given that “Giant” speaks about the difficulties and prejudice faced by Muslims in Britain in the 80s. “To be able to show the film in the Arab world and have a conversation here is meaningful. I’m not Muslim, but I am mixed race and my brothers and I faced many of the experiences you see in the film growing up in Sheffield.”\n\n\tThe director, who will be in Jeddah for almost a week, says he is also interested in getting to know production facilities and producers on the ground. “I have developed a script with [Saudi-based media company] MBC before and that was a wonderful experience,” he recalls. “Part of being in Saudi is seeing the new Hollywood. Many of my colleagues who have been lucky to be invited to Red Sea said the facilities are state-of-the-art and there is a lot of passion behind it. It’s a very hardworking culture and people. If an opportunity arises, that is something I would definitely do.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tBorn on the same day in the same Beirut hospital just a minute apart, while war raged outside, the lovers in “A Sad and Beautiful World” were seemin",
    "body": "\n\tBorn on the same day in the same Beirut hospital just a minute apart, while war raged outside, the lovers in “A Sad and Beautiful World” were seemingly destined to fall for each other, and the universe conspires more than once to make it so. For his evocative and wistful romance to yield its intended effect, writer-director Cyril Aris’ biggest ask of the viewer is to surrender to the serendipitous nature of the couple’s connection — a request that is later supported with a concept that expands the film’s magical realist vein. Contrived by design, the premise eventually earns enough goodwill for one to play along.\n\t\n\n\tAn eternal optimist whose outlook on life emerged from the tragedy of losing his parents, Nino (Hasan Akil) adores Yasmina (Mounia Akl), a worriwart realist, prone to consider the worst-case scenario, who holds a worldview tainted by her parents’ separation when she was a kid. Told with propulsive visual energy — noticeable in the collage-like editing of certain segments, the kinetic camera and the time jumps that help the narrative traverse three decades — their opposites-attract love story gains uniqueness thanks to its form.\n\n\n\tFlashbacks to their childhood reveal that they were classmates whose fondness for one another provided comfort for their respective traumas. When Nino shares that he believes his deceased parents are now on a paradisical island, the image of a shore beyond the ocean’s glistening water becomes a spiritual motif for the two of them. This somewhat fantastical vision doesn’t ultimately represent heaven in the afterlife but a safe haven on earth. Adding to the heightened atmosphere is composer Anthony Sahyoun’s enrapturing electronic score, which sounds at once bright and hopeful and moodily introspective as it reverberates fluidly.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the first act, set approximately a decade ago, where they meet for the first time as adults, “A Sad and Beautiful World” takes on the qualities of a broad romantic comedy, with larger-than-life supporting characters and situations fit for a rose-colored Hollywood rendezvous. In line with divine intervention acting as matchmaker throughout, they find each other after the erratic, yet disarming Nino crashes his car into a business that belongs to Yasmina’s mother. The spark rekindles immediately. Yasmina willingly changes her career plans, and her eagerness to leave Lebanon, a country in constant crisis, for the chance of spending more time with her childhood boyfriend turned bearded agent of chaos.\n\n\tIt’s only as the idyllic bond gains grayer shades — Yasmina doesn’t want to have children and doubts their prospects as a married couple — that one can grasp Aris is using the romance to mimic specific periods in Lebanon’s recent history. This chapter of carefree nights out resembles a bygone, more prosperous time in the embattled country.\n\n\tPassages in which a lower frame rate makes the image jittery portray the frantic rush of emotion that the two are overtaken by now that fate has reunited them. They call to mind the final moments of Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s “Amélie,” a movie that was likely a strong inspiration for several aspects of Aris’ project, including the name of the male lead, and the parallel unfolding of the protagonists’ early lives. To capture their closeness, and the palpable chemistry between Akil and Akl (the lifeblood of the film), cinematographer Joe Saade’s camera invades their personal space to express physical intimacy, often finding clever shots to collapse the distance between them without touching, like an extreme closeup of young Nino and Yasmina’s eyes looking at each other through a door’s keyhole.\n\n\tThe gleeful tone of these moments — and of the lead actors’ performances as they jump on top of cars or playfully run around in passionate ecstasy — gives way to more somber sentiments once they are married and have a daughter, allowing the actors to showcase their range. The charismatic Akil plays Nino with such nearly unwavering positivity that one can vividly understand Yasmina’s frustration with his refusal to confront grim truths. Yet it’s precisely that happy-go-lucky attitude that Yasmina gravitates toward. The stern personality that Akl projects as Yasmine is punctuated with splashes of levity that make her character’s compatibility with Nino believable rather than forceful. The structure ensures that the film always feels like a two-hander, balancing their respective ingrained wounds.\n\t\n\n\tDealing with the collapse of the Lebanese economy and their loved ones’ impending migration, the more mature Nino and Yasmine face the deterioration of their union, finding themselves at a crossroads between their attachment to what they’ve built in their homeland and the possibility of a future elsewhere. Far from revolutionary, “A Sad and Beautiful World” does succeed at adapting the tropes typical of heterosexual romances put on screen to a specific geopolitical context. No matter how much Nino may try to detach their devotion for one another from the problems afflicting Lebanon, the turmoil seeps into their home, proving that even the most personal choices are inevitably tied to larger forces. Their prerogative is whether to let those suffocating circumstances divide them or painfully remove themselves from them in hopes of staying together.\n",

    "description": "\n\tIn 2023, Ibermedia, the biggest pan-regional co-development, co-production and distribution fund focusing on Latin America, Spain and Portugal, came",
    "body": "\n\tIn 2023, Ibermedia, the biggest pan-regional co-development, co-production and distribution fund focusing on Latin America, Spain and Portugal, came to Ventana Sur to announce the 14 winners of the first funding round of Ibermedia Next, a pioneering attempting to fund development on pioneering new animation IPs which yoke artistic ambition, international co-production and cutting edge tech. \n\n\tTwo years later, Ibermedia Next, was back at the Buenos Aires market to present the results of Ibermedia Next 2.0. and Ibermedia 3.0 funding, another 29 projects. On Dec. 2, a Centna Sur round table, Connections That Inspire: Stories From Ibermedia Next, debated for the first time the results of the biggest attempt in history to overhaul the new tech expertise of the region’s animation industry. Moderated by Quirino director Silvina Cornillón, the panel’s speakers were four beneficiaries of Ibermedia Next $150,000 grants per project: Asdrúbal Hiutzilhuitl Rivera, at México’s Sísmica Studio; Jonatan Guzmán, a producer at Polar Studio, also in México: Chile’s Bernardita Ojeda at Pájaro, and Reyes Arnal, a producer, based at Spain’s LaMola Films.\n\t\n\n\tAn initiative of Spain’s ICAA film agency, tapping funding from Spain’s Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan, funded by a NextGenerationEU financing facility, Ibermedia Next was developed with input from Quirino and La Liga de la Animación Iberoamericana. Following five takes on the results.  \n\n\n\tSome Spectacular Animation \n\n\tThe Ibermedia panel was not a showcase. That said, when glimpsed, sometimes in showreels, the animation could be stunning. Guzmán showed brief excerpts from “Azul. The Last Seed,”combining stop-motion and 3D backgrounds, where its young hero, Azul, battles through a dust-storm in the search of the world’s last seed. Ana Ramírez González has already released on Instagram an entrancing work in progress teaser for “Agua Dulce,” where a baby-faced purple water droplet explores beyond its lily pond and finds a friend. Stills from “Pink Punk Delta” vary from an extraordinarily precise landscape scene to smudgy smoke at a street carnival.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAgua Dulce\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA Large Learning Curve\n\n\tIbermedia Next proved a large learning curve. “It’s been an unflagging apprenticeship,” said Arnal, who participated in six projects between the three calls for submissions: “Enoki & Snip,” “Pink Noise,” “CALM (Cuentos de Amor, de Locura, de Muerte),” “Santa Sombra,” “Is There a Dead Body in the Room?” On “CALM, the directors “invited us to make a piece that mixed 3D, stop-motion, live action, shadow puppetry, traditional 2D with graphics, and simulations,” Hiutzilhuitl recalled. “They didn’t always mix easily. It was a great challenge, and we learnt so much. Now we can make these kinds of projects and it’s part of their magic.”   \n\n\tCreativity Boost\n\n\tThe high tech wasn’t, however, just for the sake of high-tech. The technology allowed us to make more art,” said Pajaro’s Ojeda. Coming from illustration, Bernardita Ojeda was “principally, almost stubbornly 2D,” she told a Ventana Sur industry audience. A project such as “Pink Punk Delta” mixes 2D and 3D, which allowed us to make a richer 2D.” Also, “the tools solve more mechanical tasks faster, allowing us to dedicate more time, enthusiasm and energy to things which we left aside because of a lack of energy, she added. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPink Punk Delta\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPink Punk Delta. Courtesy of Pajaro\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCo-Production\n\n\tProducers of winning projects were tasked with making them in international co-production. That wasn’t always a slam dunk. The key to co-production, said Arnal, was to “choose good companies but above all good people.” “I heard somewhere that the people you co-produce with should be people you want to go out to dinner with. If you can’t spend two hours eating, drinking, talking about life, don’t do the project,” said Guzmán. He again learnt some lessons. Cultural differences have to be taken into account as well. “In Mexico, on a big project, a studio works through holidays and weekends,” Guzmán noted. It discovered, working with Mansalva in Madrid, that it took summer holidays off. “You have to learn how to live with others and integrate these differences into a project,” Guzmán concluded.   \n\n\tA Gamechanger\n\n\tAll in all, the funding proved a gamechanger. “A lot of projects turn on development, possible story lines, because they don’t know or experiment with different tools. Knowing that we should use them, for research and experimentation on every project, is fabulous,” said Guzmán. “To learn, you have to make mistakes, but to do so you need time and money and normally there isn’t time and money. Ibermedia aid gave us that,” added Arnal. “We used the first projects to experiment. With ‘Lucila,’ what we’d learnt with Blender and other tools was now part of our thinking about the film. ‘Lucila’ will be made totally in integrated 2D/3D. It’s the first time we’re thinking 3D, and that’s a huge change in the quantity of things which we think we’re capable of doing,” added Ojeda. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Pink Pink Delta’ landscape\n\t\n\n\n",

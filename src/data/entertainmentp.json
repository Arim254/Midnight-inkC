    "body": "\n\tPaul Mescal is looking to take a break from the spotlight after the past few years put his career into overdrive. \n\n\tAfter breaking through in the film world with “Aftersun” in 2022 — which earned the 29-year-old Irish actor his first Oscar nomination — Mescal made his blockbuster debut with 2024’s “Gladiator II” and starred in both indie romance “the History of Sound” and buzzy awards contender “Hamnet” in the past year. Next up, he’ll play Paul McCartney in Sam Mendes’ four anthology Beatles films, due out in 2028 — but hopes to keep a low profile until then, as he told The Guardian in an interview alongside his “History of Sound” co-star Josh O’Connor.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m five or six years into this now, and I feel very lucky. But I’m also learning that I don’t think I can go on doing it as much,” Mescal said. When asked if that means “rationing” his workload, he replied: “I think so. I’m gonna have to start doing that. For sure.” However, Mescal added that “rationing doesn’t necessarily mean less.”\n\n\n\t“It means learning that films like ‘The History of Sound’ take more out of the well,” he clarified. “You can’t keep going back and expect to consistently deliver something you’re proud of. What that rationing looks like, I don’t know. I miss being on stage, so I might have a time when I’m only doing theatre for a couple of years. I also have different priorities in my personal life that I want to attend to.”\n\n\tBut is Mescal worried his burgeoning career might lose momentum if he disappears for a while? “That’s the great fear,” he said. “But what’s the alternative? I don’t want to resent the thing I love. This sounds bold, but I’d rather not be on the train if that is the choice.”\n\t\n\n\tBesides the Beatles biopics — in which he’ll star alongside Harris Dickinson as John Lennon, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison and Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr — Mescal has nothing else on his docket besides occasionally filming Richard Linklater’s “Merrily We Roll Along,” which is shooting over the span of two decades as its actors age. However, he’s currently in the thick of an awards campaign for “Hamnet,” Chloe Zhao’s historical drama in which he plays William Shakespeare. The film has earned rave reviews and sparked Oscars buzz for Mescal and his co-star Jessie Buckley.\n\n\t“Once I’ve finished promoting that, I hope nobody gets to see me until 2028 when I’m doing the Beatles,” Mescal said. “People will get a break from me and I’ll get a break from them.”\n\n\tRead Mescal and O’Connor’s full Guardian interview here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney+ has acquired the Irish narrative short film “Brown Bread” following a successful festival run that began with its world premiere at the Galway Film Fleadh in 2025.\n\n\tThe film is now streaming across Disney+ platforms throughout Europe.\n\n\tWritten and directed by Shaunagh Connaire, “Brown Bread” marks the narrative debut from writer/director Shaunagh Connaire, the two-time Emmy-nominated Irish journalist who has produced documentaries for the likes of the BBC and PBS Frontline and also served as communication director for George and Amal Clooney‘s Foundation for Justice.\n\t\n\n\tThe film — described by Connaire as a “modern twist on the Irish emigration story” — is led by Emmy-winning actress Fionnula Flanagan (“Lost,” “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes”), Katie McGrath (“Merlin,” “Supergirl”) and Dermot Crowley (“Luther: The Fallen Sun,” “The Death of Stalin”).\n\n\n\tInspired by Connaire’s own experience of being unable to travel to Ireland from the U.S. to attend her godmother’s funeral, the story follows Áine (McGrath), a woman whose return to Ireland from New York to attend her godmother’s memorial mass stirs up old tensions, grief, and unspoken affection in her rural family home. Flanagan stars as Betty, a proud but emotionally restrained mother struggling with her daughter’s return, while Crowley plays Áine’s father Seamus.\n\n\t“Having my first scripted film acquired by Disney so early in its life is so wonderful,” said Connaire. “I wanted to tell a story rooted in Irish life but expansive enough to travel. To see that belief reflected in a global acquisition like this is incredibly affirming, and a reminder that small, specific stories can resonate far beyond where they begin.”\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Julie Ryan through her production company MK1 Studios, the film was shot entirely in Connaire’s hometown of Longford, Ireland. Funding was provided by Creative Ireland (Longford), with additional support from Sam and Amelia Dennigan and Anne Heraty, who served as Associate Producers. The film is distributed by Network Ireland.\n\n\t“From the outset, we felt Brown Bread was a very special film, not because it was trying to be big, but because it was precise, truthful and emotionally brave,” said Ryan. “We were always thinking globally, and Shaunagh has an extraordinary instinct for character and tone that allows stories rooted in place to travel. Seeing a film made in rural Longford now finding a home with Disney reinforces our belief that stories rooted in Irish life can resonate well beyond their place of origin.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Asian Film Awards Academy has modified the format of its upcoming 19th edition, eliminating competitive categories and the red carpet ceremony in favor of a scaled-back event focused on special honors following last year’s deadly Hong Kong fire.\n\n\tThe academy announced that the 2026 ceremony, scheduled to take place in Hong Kong, will present special awards “in a dignified and minimalist manner” rather than proceeding with its traditional competitive format.\n\t\n\n\tThe format adjustment follows what the academy described as “the significant incident in Hong Kong last year and its impact on the community.” The decision aligns with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government’s postponement of official celebrations and its recommendation for a restrained approach to public events in the wake of the tragedy.\n\n\n\t“This is a well-considered decision,” said Dr. Wilfred Wong, chairman of the Asian Film Awards Academy. “We believe that, in the current environment, adopting a solemn and minimalist format for the awards ceremony is the most appropriate arrangement. At this time, we have chosen to honor filmmakers in a restrained manner as a mark of respect to all sectors of the community.”\n\n\tThe academy emphasized that while the ceremony format has changed, its core mission remains intact. The organization expressed gratitude to filmmakers and partners for their support of the modified edition, stating that it will “continue to work closely with all sectors to contribute to the future development of Asian cinema.”\n\n\tThe Asian Film Awards, which recognize excellence in pan-Asian filmmaking, have been presented annually since 2007.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tA new documentary from CNN offers an unvarnished look at one of the most polarizing figures in comedy: Chevy Chase. “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” premieres on CNN on Thursday, Jan. 1.\n\n\tCable-cutters can stream the documentary online through a variety of Live TV streamers with access to CNN, such as DirecTV, Sling TV and Hulu + Live TV. DirecTV offers a free trial that you can use to stream the new Chevy Chase doc online for free.\n\n\n\tDirected by Marina Zenovich, the CNN Films project arrives amid renewed scrutiny of Chase’s career and conduct, including his fraught exits “from Saturday Night Live” and “Community,” as well as personal health-related revelations, including that he was put into a coma for eight days during the pandemic after experiencing heart failure. The film — which traces Chase’s rise as a foundational figure of modern TV —  includes interviews with dozens of the 82 year-old comedian’s personal and professional connections such as his daughter Caley Chase and “Community” creator Jay Chandrasekhar, who reveals in the doc that he was on set the night that Chase got fired. \n\n\tThe documentary is highly anticipated not only because of its long-awaited Hollywood revelations but also because Chase’s infamous attitude made the idea of him collaborating with a director — and letting go of all editorial control — feel like an impossibility. Until Zenovich came along. \n\n\t“I’d never done an interview where someone was so rude to me,” Zenovich told Variety last month. “But I was so worried going into that first interview with him about how I was going to say to him, like, ‘Everyone thinks you’re an asshole.’ I thought if I did, he would throw me out of his house. So the minute he said that to me, I had a way in.”\n\n\n\t“I wanted to figure out who was the real person behind the conflicted, guarded and somewhat fragile man we see on camera,” she continued. “What was behind the surface of his slightly intimidating superstar bravado? Was there any self-awareness there? Having interviewed Chevy at length, I have to say that yes, it’s all there – and a whole lot of pain and heartache too.”\n\n\tThe documentary premieres tonight on CNN at 8 p.m. ET/PT, making it accessible to both traditional cable subscribers and cord-cutters alike. Viewers can watch the film live through major TV streaming services that carry CNN, including DirecTV, Sling TV and Hulu + Live TV, both of which include the channel in their standard lineups and allow subscribers to tune in across smart TVs, mobile devices and web browsers. For those unable to catch the premiere in real time, both services also offer cloud DVR options.\n\n\tStream “I’m Chevy Chase and You Are Not” online here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTony Dokoupil, who starts Monday as anchor of the “CBS Evening News,” spoke out on New Year’s Day about where he thinks the press has gone wrong, and vowed that starting Monday, the audience would come first — ahead of advertisers, politicians or corporate interests including CBS owners Paramount Skydance. \n\n\t“People do not trust us like they used to,”he said in a video on CBSnews.com and posted to social media.\n\n\n\t“On too many stories, the press has missed the story,” he continued, “And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates, and not the average American. Or, we put too much weight in the analysis of academics, or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\t\n\n\tThe former “CBS Mornings” host said he has felt that “the most urgent questions simply weren’t being asked” by current TV news journalists. \n\n\tDespite his long career in the news, the incoming anchor’s statement Thursday was notable in that it seemed to agree with critics of mainstream media such as President Trump, implying journalists aren’t doing their jobs competently. In the statement, Dokoupil said he had talked to people around the country who questioned coverage of topics like Hilary Clinton’s emails or the president’s fitness for office. \n\n\tDokoupil, who was previously at MSNBC, The Daily Beast and Newsweek and joined CBS in 2016, could have a challenge ahead of him. When he was named to the “CBS Evening News” post by new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, Variety‘s Brian Steinberg wrote, “The job comes with a difficult mission attached. The program, which has ties to legendary personnel like Walter Cronkite, has been mired in third place behind ABC’s ‘World News Tonight’ and NBC’s ‘NBC Nightly News’ for years.” Dokoupil is likely aligned with some of Weiss’ views, such as her pro-Israel stance, Steinberg wrote.\n\t\n\n\t“I report for you,” Dokoupil promised, “which means I’ll tell you what I know, when I know it and how I know it. And when I get it wrong, I’ll tell you that too.”\n\n\tDokoupil finished his statement by promising to uphold the truth asking viewers to hold him accountable, “It also means I’m going to talk to everyone, and hold everyone in public life to the very same standards. After all, I became a journalist to talk to people. I love talking to people about what works in this country, what doesn’t, and not only what should change, but the good ideas that should never change. I think telling the truth is one of them.\n\n\t“Hold me to it,” he concluded. \n\n\tWatch his message below:\n\n\"On too many stories, the press has missed the story. Because we've taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.\"That changes now.

    "body": "\n\tWill Smith has been sued by a tour violinist who is accusing the rapper of sexual harassment, wrongful termination and retaliation.\n\n\tIn the suit, filed yesterday and reviewed by Variety, musician Brian King Joseph names Smith and Treyball Studios Management as defendants and accuses Smith of “predatory behavior” and “deliberately grooming and priming Mr. Joseph for further sexual exploitation” while on his “Based on a True Story: 2025 Tour” this past spring.\n\t\n\n\tThe suit alleges that Smith hired Joseph in November 2024 to perform at a show in San Diego and was subsequently invited to join his 2025 tour and play on his upcoming album. As their relationship grew closer, Smith told Joseph that “you and I have such a special connection, that I don’t have with anyone else,” among other similar expressions.\n\n\n\tJoseph, who previously competed on “America’s Got Talent,” joined the first leg of Smith’s tour in March 2025 for a show in Las Vegas, where hotel rooms had been booked for the band and crew members. His suit claims that his bag, which contained his hotel room key, went missing for several hours before management found and returned it to him, and that members of management were the “only individuals with access to [his] room.”\n\n\tLater that night, Joseph returned to find that someone had “unlawfully” entered the room and left behind belongings including wipes, a bottle of HIV medication with another individual’s name, and a note that read, “Brian, I’ll be back no later [sic] 5:30, just us (drawn heart), Stone F,” which Joseph interpreted as a warning that “an unknown individual would soon return to his room to engage in sexual acts” with him.\n\t\n\n\tHe notified hotel security and Smith’s representatives and reported the incident to a non-emergency police line. He claims that just days later, a member of the management team “shamed” him for the incident and told him he was being terminated, suggesting that Joseph made the whole thing up.\n\n\tA representative for Smith did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\n\tThe suit claims that due to the termination, Joseph suffered from PTSD and economic loss. He is suing for retaliation, wrongful termination and sexual harassment, and that damages be determined by a jury.\n",

    "body": "\n\tYou’ve probably seen a variation of this news on social media over the past few days: MTV officially shut down on New Year’s Eve, ending their final broadcast the same way the network started: With the clip “Video Killed the Radio Star” by The Buggles. \n\n\tBut those posts are misinformed. It’s New Year’s Day 2026, and MTV is still around. Granted, today the channel is playing a marathon of “The Big Bang Theory” sitcom repeats, so your interpretation of “MTV is still around” may vary. \n\t\n\n\tHere’s where the confusion is coming from: On New Year’s Eve, Paramount Skydance did indeed shut down several MTV-branded music channels in the U.K. According to a source, “MTV’s specialist music channels in the UK will no longer operate as linear channels. The flagship MTV UK channel will continue to broadcast… Paramount is reviewing and adjusting its international Pay TV portfolio, given shifts in audience behavior towards streaming and digital platforms.”\n\n\n\tAs for the U.S., the existing MTV channels will continue to broadcast without change — including MTV and MTV2. MTV hasn’t been “Music Television” for a long time, but the network does still program some digital music channels in the U.S., including “MTV Classic” (playing retro music videos from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s), “MTV Live” (which runs current music videos, as well as other music programming from the Paramount library) and a collection of MTV-branded FAST channels (“MTV Biggest Pop,” “MTV Spankin’ New,” “Yo! MTV” and “MTV Flow Latino”), which play contemporary music videos on Pluto TV. \n\n\tOf course, fans of MTV’s golden 1980s, 1990s and 2000s era still look nostalgically at when the flagship network really was about music. In those days, MTV’s programming consisted of music videos and music-oriented series like “Headbanger’s Ball,” “120 Minutes” and “Yo! MTV Raps.” Later, “TRL” was an afternoon staple for an entire generation of kids. \n\t\n\n\tBut in recent years, MTV has focused on reality programming — which currently includes “The Challenge” and “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” The network has also been criticized for its over-reliance on series like “Ridiculousness,” which often takes up the lion’s share of its programming. (As Variety wrote in 2020, at one point “Ridiculousness” took up 113 of 168 total hours on MTV — 67.3% of its entire schedule.)\n\n\tAnd that’s probably why, while inaccurate, this “news” that MTV is shutting down has resonated across social media — especially among Gen Xers and Millennials. They still remember that music on MTV came more than just once a year on the VMAs. And they’ve also seen the recent reports of how cutbacks have eliminated the last vestiges of MTV as we know it: In 2023, the remaining shell of a once-vibrant MTV News division was shut down, and then last year the legacy MTV News website went dark, and its archives were scrubbed from the internet. \n\n\tThen there was the sense in 2025 that we’ve hit the tipping point when it comes to the decline in basic cable, as companies like NBCU look to shed those once-valuable assets. When Skydance acquired Paramount and started making drastic cuts, its cable networks were hit especially hard: MTV shed most of its remaining comms and talent teams, including top remaining music programming and talent execs. The idea that even a major network like MTV might shut down no longer seems so far-fetched.\n\n\tAccording to Variety‘s 2025 tally of the most-watched linear networks in primetime, MTV rated No. 49 — with an average of 189,000 viewers. In adults 18-49, MTV ranked No. 25. Compare that to 10 years ago: In 2015, MTV ranked No. 36 with 606,000 viewers.\n\n\tSo yes, the MTV as we knew it disappeared a long time ago. But MTV as a channel still exists. For now.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for the series finale of “Stranger Things,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tMatt and Ross Duffer, the creators of “Stranger Things,” didn’t expect the review bombing that took place after the series’ penultimate episode dropped on Netflix on Christmas Day — but they’re still extremely proud.\n\n\tThe three episodes brought the season’s Rotten Tomatoes score down to 56% — the lowest by far, with Season 4 sitting at 89%, Season 3 at 86%, Season 2 at 90% and Season 1 at 96%. “The Bridge,” the seventh episode, during which Will (Noah Schnapp) came out as gay to his friends before battling Vecna, became the lowest-rated episode of the series with a score of 5.6 out of 10 and 96,000 reviews.\n\t\n\n\t“The coming out scene is something we’ve been building to for nine years now. It was a really important scene for us, and a really important scene for Noah — not just from a thematic point of view, but also a narrative point of view,” Ross Duffer tells Variety on Jan. 1 during a lengthy postmortem following the series finale. “This show has always been about our characters overcoming evil, and in order to overcome this evil, Vecna, in so many ways, represents all the dark thoughts and the evil of society. And for our characters to overcome that, it really becomes about embracing themselves, and then also embracing one another and coming together.”\n\n\tThe scene was “the final step in Will’s journey, and Will is, in so many ways, the key to defeating Vecna,” adds Matt Duffer. “Volume 1 is really about self-acceptance, right? I mean, that’s sort of step one. And then step two is Will is talking to Robin — it’s something that he wants to do. He’s trying to figure out how to come out, and he knows that he needs to do that, and that that’s the final step for him. And he finds the courage to be able to do it. And it’s really the ultimate fuck you to Vecna. That was the intention.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX © 2025\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile the episode was torn apart online, that doesn’t change how the creators feel about it.\n\n\t“We’re proud of the episode, and we’re proud of the scene, and proud of Noah, who gave a really brave, very vulnerable performance,” says Ross. \n\n\tThe scene was extremely important for Schnapp, Matt says, and the three of them have stayed close amid the mixed reviews.\n\n\t“I think that’s where Ross and I were most sensitive, was Noah — because of how close to home this hit for him,” he says. “And our goal was to make sure that he was comfortable and happy with the scene. And when he was, we felt good about it. I’ve been texting with him a lot, but texting with him specifically after that scene and after that episode aired. And he’s in a really good place. He’s very proud of the scene, and we’re proud of the scene.”\n\n\tBut still, even in 2025, the online hate surprised them. “No is the honest truth,” Matt says when asked whether he’d anticipated the homophobic backlash. “Because it is, as Ross said, something we’ve been building for a really long time. I always say, Ross and I are many things, but subtle is not one of those things!”\n\n\tAfter the episode dropped, Matt also told Variety that the duo “spent longer writing” the coming out scene than any other — and that it was all about collaboration.\n\n\t“We were so concerned about getting it right. There were a lot of things that went into it. I mean, we’re definitely nervous about how it’s going to go over with everyone. But not as nervous as we were handing it over to Noah. Because ultimately, it needed to resonate and be truthful for him. We really were writing it to and for Noah. He wrote us sobbing after he read it. So it really worked and resonated for him, which was great,” he said. “On the day, frankly, there wasn’t really much direction at all. Noah spent a long time — I mean, months — prepping for that scene, that moment. Luckily, that script was done well in advance. I know he did a lot of work himself… And most of what’s in there is the first take.”\n\n\tKate Aurthur contributed to the reporting of this story.\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• The Duffer Brothers Break Down the Series Finale• The Duffer Brothers on Noah’s Coming Out Scene• Noah Schnapp on His Emotional Coming Out in Volume 2• Stranger Things Finale: How It Ended, Who Survived• Director Shawn Levy on Key Moments of Final Season• Noah Schnapp on His Powers Revealed in Volume 1\n",

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the series finale of “Stranger Things,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAnd so ends the nine-and-a-hal",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the series finale of “Stranger Things,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAnd so ends the nine-and-a-half-year journey of “Stranger Things,” which launched in July 2016 and concluded on Dec. 31, 2025. Creators Matt and Ross Duffer wrapped up the series in a finale that ran just over two hours, and not only premiered on Netflix, but played in select theaters as well. In a media landscape that’s splintered into a million pieces, the conclusion of “Stranger Things” — with its finale dropping precisely at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on New Year’s Eve — felt like a throwback to an earlier time, and a last gasp of monoculture.\n\n\t“The Rightside Up” wrapped up the stories of all the major characters, after Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Will (Noah Schnapp), Nancy (Natalia Dyer), Joyce (Winona Ryder) and the rest of the Hawkins heroes went into the Abyss to defeat the Mind Flayer and kill Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) for once and for all. In Variety’s Oct. 15 cover story about “Stranger Things,” Matt Duffer said explicitly, “This is a complete story. It’s done.”\n\n\tWhich doesn’t mean that every single plot thread was tied up in a neat bow, as TikTok will undoubtedly be telling us for the next few months (and possibly forever). The biggest lingering question that “The Rightside Up” leaves ambiguous is whether Eleven is dead (did she sacrifice herself when the Upside Down was destroyed to thwart the military from weaponizing future clones of her?) or alive (was that last image just a projection of her, as aided by Linnea Berthelsen’s Kali, and Eleven managed to escape?). Viewers will surely reach their own conclusions, but in the spirit of “Stranger Things” and its inspirations, Eleven may very well be alive.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMike (Finn Wolfhard) certainly seems to think so. The show’s final scene — after an 18-month time jump to the class of ‘89’s graduation — is set in the Wheelers’ basement as the gang plays Dungeons & Dragons one last time, in a throwback to the series premiere. It’s then that Mike tells Will, Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Max (Sadie Sink) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) how he sees their stories moving forward, as they each embark on their futures — and it’s where he tells them that he thinks Eleven might be alive after all. As his sister Holly (Nell Fisher), her friend Derek (Jake Connelly) and their other friends come barreling down the stairs, ready to take over the D&D game, Mike closes the door. (For Variety’s full recap of the “Stranger Things” finale, read this.)\n\n\tIn an interview with the Duffer brothers on the morning of Jan. 1, they delve into the uncertainty of Eleven’s fate; staging the final battle with the Mind Flayer and Vecna, and debating who got to deal the death blow; the element unveiled in the finale that will be key to the spinoff — and being unpleasantly surprised by the review bombing of “The Bridge,” the series’ penulimate episode. The New Year’s Day conversation is interrupted only by Brown repeatedly trying to call Matt Duffer, which disrupts the Zoom.\n\n\tSee, everybody? She’s alive!\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve been clear that you’ve known for a long time that the final scene was that D&D campaign with the kids, who are now young adults. But how much of that scene did you know far in advance? Like, did you know Eleven wouldn’t be there, that Max would be there — break it down for me, please!\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Initially, when we came up with it a very long time ago, it was the kids — the “kids,” in quotes — play one final game of D&D, put their books away and go upstairs. And Mike was going to shut the door, closing the door effectively on childhood. So that was the idea. Once we introduced Holly, and this is one of the reasons we were so interested in bringing Holly and her friends and Derek into the show, was to be able to have a passing of the torch moment. To be able to recapture Season 1, it allows Mike to reflect on his childhood and feel happy that his sister and her friends are going to have a magical experience, or adventures like they had — hopefully not as traumatic. But as Dustin said, there was so much good amongst so much bad. It changed them in so many meaningful ways. \n\n\tRoss Duffer: Eleven was never going to be there. It was very early on in the writing process of this season that we figured out exactly how to tell that story and landed on the “I believe” moment. And once we landed on “I believe,” then that sort of cracked it wide open. That was in those first few weeks of the writers’ room, because we started at the end, at that basement scene, and wanted to make sure that we got it to a place where we felt was the right ending for the show. And then we built the season to that moment.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I also love the idea that the original ending of “ET” was them going to be them playing D&D again. So I like the idea of doing that.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of the Eleven ending, and the ambiguity of whether she’s alive, can you talk about when you had that idea and why you wanted to do that?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: A couple things: Eleven represents, in a lot of ways, the magic of childhood. And we knew for our kids to be able to grow up, the magic had leave Hawkins. There was never a version that we had written where it was Eleven down in that basement. It was never going to be that simple and that easy. It was finding a way to come up with an ending where it was not that simple, but also bittersweet, and that there was hope there.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Speaking of Eleven, Millie keeps Facetiming, disrupting the Zoom.\n\n\n\n\tRight now?\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yeah. And Millie, if you don’t answer, just keeps hitting you up.It’s two fronts. Ross is talking about it thematically, in terms of the magic of childhood. And then there’s this story element of it in Eleven’s choice, ultimately. It was a huge debate — she’s calling again, I’m so sorry, Kate. I’m curious, actually, what she’s saying. Everybody’s very emotional.She’s like, “I’m alive, guys!” \n\n\tMatt Duffer: “I’m alive, guys,” yeah — no, she’s very emotional. Everybody’s very emotional. And no one’s here in L.A., so we haven’t gotten to see anyone after it played. I’m so sorry.\n\n\tI know what I was gonna say: From a character point of view, not a thematic point of view, we had so many debates in the writers’ room about what we were going to do with Eleven. And then we tried to actually express everything we were talking about in the room on the screen. So Hopper’s speech to Eleven is vocalizing what a lot of people in the room were saying. And then what Kali was saying to her was vocalizing the other side of the argument. \n\n\tThe question was, which of those choices is Eleven going to choose? And if you, like Mike and the others, choose to believe that she is alive somewhere, then she picked something in the middle. But either way, it’s a completely selfless act and heroic act on Eleven’s part. I mean, you’ve seen all those pregnant women, and how many children are going to be born, potentially, using her blood, how the cycle will exist, and how many other kids will go through what she went through. And she’s making damn sure that that never happens again.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOne discussion online this morning is whether Mike made the whole thing up, or Eleven actually told him what her plan was. Or, that during the graduation, Mike realized that Eleven never could have gotten from the truck to the gate because of the kryptonite, so that’s not really her and was a projection. Discuss!\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: The only thing I’ll debunk is that Eleven does not communicate with Mike in any way. But what you just said at the end — yes, at graduation, he’s hearing the speakers distort because the principal is so angry, and it makes him realize that there was the kryptonite. So how could she have possibly made it all the way to the gate? Not only that. How could she have possibly used her powers to bring him into the void? \n\t\n\n\tBut there are a lot of other questions. Could Kali have actually done that? Could she have possibly been alive? We like that it’s up to the audience. Obviously, we tell you what the characters choose.\n\t\n\t\tAnd when you decided to bring Kali back, was it in your imagination that she could possibly help Eleven with a potential fake-out at the end? And is she alive long enough to do that?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Well, that’s the question. We wanted to bring her back for a lot of reasons. We wanted that story to have existed for a reason, and we’ve been looking for a way to bring Kali back and a reason to bring her back. And we found it this year.\n\t\n\n\tBut it wasn’t just for her ability to project or create these illusions. The other part of it was Hopper and Mike are so close to Eleven. Mike is such — I don’t want to call him naive, but a little bit. And he’s such a dreamer and an optimist. I know a lot of people were frustrated with what Kali was saying to Eleven, and I get that. But what she was saying was accurate in so many ways, and we needed someone to be able to voice that — the dark reality of what potentially exists on the other side of that. So those were two of the main reasons we brought her back into the fold.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s assume Eleven is still alive, because that’s more in the spirit of “Stranger Things.” Can she ever reveal herself again to her friends and family?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: If she were alive, the way I would see it is no. Any contact would risk bringing her back out in the open and starting the cycle again. So, in the story that Mike’s telling, I don’t think he sees a version where they reconnect.\n\t\n\t\tThis is a fandom that I’ve realized over the past month or two does not love ambiguity. How do you feel about the fans who are upset there isn’t more clarity about Eleven?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Are a lot of people upset about that? I really don’t know!\n\t\n\t\tI mean, after Volume 2, people didn’t understand that Jonathan and Nancy broke up. I was like, what are you watching?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: This is obviously intended to be ambiguous, right? With Eleven. At the end of the day, it’s being told from the point of view of Mike and his friends. And they don’t know, and the audience can’t know. If you knew that she was out there and you knew she existed, then she’s very much at risk. So we thought there was something really cool about not knowing for sure, and having our characters choose to believe. We just thought that was more powerful than providing a definitive answer, one way or the other. And I like that the audiences are in Mike, Max, Lucas and Dustin’s shoes, in the sense that they get to choose or not choose. I mean, I’m definitely seeing the majority choosing to believe and side with the kids.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI side with the kids. Can you talk about the final battle between the Mind Flayer, Vecna and our heroes, and how you specifically wanted to stage that?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We were originally going to go to New Mexico to shoot it, and logistically, that became impossible as we moved into the finale. We shot it in some, like, decrepit quarry in Atlanta. But obviously, WETA visual effects, some of the best in the world, did an incredible job.\n\n\tMainly, what we needed was a huge battlefield for this monster. I don’t think we fully realized quite how large it was until once we built the interior sets. And we were like, “Well, if that’s the size of its interior, how big is its exterior?”\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We were thinking about D&D, and I was playing Baldur’s Gate 3 at the time, and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realized — either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to Dungeons & Dragons, and something like Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle.\n\t\n\t\tEleven obviously is the nuclear option, but Will really helps when she’s on her back foot. When did you figure out that part of it?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Well, we knew that Will was obviously going to play a major role in it, and it just came down to, who did we want to deliver the final blow? Was it going to be Will, or was it going to be Eleven? Then we tried to work on a way where it was actually both of them. Eleven throws him into the spike, but Will is the one who allows her to do that. He just breaks him down, rips off his left arm, allowing Eleven that final opportunity. Will was always going to be a key part in defeating Vecna. Without Will, it wouldn’t have happened.\n\t\n\t\tAnd Joyce beheads Vecna. How did you arrive at that moment?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: In the writers’ room, I remember we went through, “Who gets to do the final blow?” It works with all of them in a way. So, we just cycled through, what if Steve does it? What if Dustin does it? And then finally, when we landed on, what if Joyce does it? It felt right for a lot of reasons. She is sort of the mother of this group, the protector. And also, we never got to see her hit anything with that ax, so that felt like such a satisfying way to deliver the final blow to Vecna.\n\n\tBut it was in editorial really, where, as we were working on it, that we had the initial flashbacks to her remembering back to Bob, and building up that anger. It felt right that it’s just not just a “fuck yeah” moment. It was also, in a way, a cathartic moment for our characters, who are purging all this trauma that’s been caused here. It’s not just a stand-up and cheer moment. It’s remembering that this evil has caused them so much pain.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I remember working with our editor and our composer and just talking to them and going, “Let’s make this the most emotional decapitation in history.” That was the goal.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tShe’s, of course, decapitating the kid whom she cast in “Oklahoma.”\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Yeah, I guess so!\n\t\n\t\tWas there ever a scene in the 18 months after Season 4 when Hopper and Joyce realized that Henry Creel, aka Vecna, was the kid they went to high school with?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: Yeah, I’m sure there was. We had a walk a fine line with the play — we don’t want to frustrate, because so much of our audience is unable to see it. To have them start talking about it would have been confusing in the context of someone who hasn’t seen the play. But I’m sure they did have that conversation.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: We really needed the final season to be exactly as it would have been without the play. The play is Henry’s backstory after he’s infected by the Mind Flayer. But this is how the season was going to play out regardless.\n\t\n\t\tThe Mind Flayer is the real evil, which we asked about in our Volume 1 postmortem. But if you had to define what that rock in the briefcase is, how would you describe it?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Hmm. How would we describe it?\n\t\n\n\tWhat is it?!Matt Duffer: I’m gonna be sketchy here, Kate, because I will say that is — can I say this, Ross? Because it’s just hard to not say it. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpinoffy?!\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Spinoffy, yeah. You pinned us down. So annoying. I do want to explain, just because people’s expectations go in certain directions: The spinoff is going to delve into that and explain that, and you’re going to understand it. But it’s a completely different mythology. So it’s not a deep exploration of the Mind Flayer or anything like that. It’s very fresh and very new, but yes, it will answer some of the loose threads that are remaining.Where are you with the spinoff?\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We’re going to start working on it again on Monday. We’ve been working on it on and off. We’ll take a few days off.\n\t\n\t\tOn Monday?!\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: You don’t understand. My favorite part of the show is working on it. It’s not releasing it — that’s just stressful, no matter how it goes when you release it. It’s maybe my least favorite part of the process. I like the creative part. I like making it. So, we’re actually really excited, and it’s very exciting to work with a clean slate: completely new characters, new town, new world, new mythology.\n\n\tAnd no common characters?Matt Duffer: Right. Exactly. No common characters.\n\n\tI wanted to ask you about the review bombing of “The Bridge,” which appears to be a coordinated attack by people who didn’t like Will’s coming out scene. It’s now the lowest rated episode in the series. Can you talk about why it was important to you all along to have Will’s queerness associated with his powers?\n\n\tRoss Duffer: The coming out scene is something we’ve been building to for nine years now. It was a really important scene for us, and a really important scene for Noah — not just from a thematic point of view, but also a narrative point of view. This show has always been about our characters overcoming evil, and in order to overcome this evil, Vecna, in so many ways, represents all the dark thoughts and the evil of society. And for our characters to overcome that, it really becomes about embracing themselves, and then also embracing one another and coming together.Matt Duffer: Right. It was the final step in Will’s journey. And Will is, in so many ways, the key to defeating Vecna. Volume 1 is really about self-acceptance, right? I mean, that’s sort of step one. And then step two is Will is talking to Robin — it’s something that he wants to do. He’s trying to figure out how to come out, and he knows that he needs to do that, and that that’s the final step for him. And he finds the courage to be able to do it. And it’s really the ultimate fuck you to Vecna. That was the intention.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd were you prepared for a homophobic campaign like that? Matt Duffer: No. I mean, no is the honest truth. Because it is, as Ross said, something we’ve been building for a really long time. I always say, Ross and I are many things, but subtle is not one of those things!\n\n\tRoss Duffer: We’re proud of the episode, and we’re proud of the scene, and proud of Noah, who gave a really brave, very vulnerable performance.\n\n\tMatt Duffer: I think that’s where Ross and I were most sensitive, was Noah — because of how close to home this hit for him. And our goal was to make sure that he was comfortable and happy with the scene. And when he was, we felt good about it. I’ve been texting with him a lot, but texting with him specifically after that scene and after that episode aired. And he’s in a really good place. He’s very proud of the scene, and we’re proud of the scene.\n\t\n\t\tHe should be, and so should you. I have another question along these lines. There’s a QAnon-ish conspiracy theory going around that Volume 2 was — and I’m doing air quotes, in case you’re not actually looking at me — “tampered with.” That there were scenes that were cut, including El and Mike going into Camazotz to rescue Will, and a Mike and Will one-on-one scene. Have you seen this Google Doc?\t\n\n\tMatt Duffer: Someone sent it to us, yeah. Obviously, that’s not a real thing. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave you seen the Change.org petition with 370,000+ signatures to release the footage?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: I have not seen that! I don’t think there’s a single cut scene in the entire season. \n\n\tMatt Duffer: The show has just grown so massive. Online, there’s just so much misinformation. Just tons of it. We would be here for hours trying to bat down the stuff that was not true. But at the end of the day, hopefully the work speaks for itself, and it is the show that Ross and I wanted to make. Netflix was, and has always been, incredible. I mean, there’s no interference or direction at all from them on us. They really trust us, and that’s been true from Season 1 on. It’s never changed, even though the show and the size of the audience have grown.\n\t\n\t\tWe do need to wrap, I know, but I saw you guys were at the Americana last night. Did you actually sit and watch it? And how was it?\t\n\n\tRoss Duffer: It was awesome. We never get that experience. I mean, the premieres are one thing, but that’s generally friends and crew. So, to sit there with just true fans — they’re all decked out in merch, and to hear them in real-time responding, whether it’s applauding or laughing or crying. It was an incredible experience. It was really special.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\t\n\t\tInside the Upside Down\t\n\n\t• Variety‘s series finale recap• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 2 Spoilers• The Duffer Brothers Break Down All the Volume 1 Spoilers• Our 13 Burning Questions Ahead of the Series Finale• Noah Schnapp on That Scene in Volume 2• Noah Schnapp on Turning Into the [SPOILER] in Volume 1• Why Will’s Coming Out Is Seismic• Director Shawn Levy on Will’s Huge Breakthrough• Sadie Sink on Max’s Key Role in Volume 1• Nell Fisher on Playing Holly Wheeler in Season 5• The Cast of ‘Stranger Things’ on the Show’s Final Days• Variety’s “Stranger Things” Oct. 15 Cover Story About the Duffers• Cara Buono on Karen’s Kick-Ass Hero Moment (At Last)• The Duffer Brothers on the ‘Stranger Things’ Spinoff\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n",

Johannes Roberts’ film doesn’t take itself too seriously, and the titular antagonist is a performance from an actor versus CGI, which gives it some serious gravitas for a killer animal flick.\n\n\t“28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” (In theaters Jan. 16 via Sony Pictures Releasing) — Just months after the release of the stylish hit “28 Years Later,” Nia DaCosta helms this direct sequel which focuses on Ralph Fiennes’ Dr. Ian Kelson and Jack O’Connell’s wild Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal, who was introduced as a bonkers cult leader at the end of the last film. Early reactions have also been strong for this installment.\n\n\t“Send Help” (In theaters Jan. 30 via 20th Century Studios) — Sam Raimi’s newest thriller pairs Rachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brien as feuding co-workers who are the sole survivors of a plane crash and must survive together on a deserted island. Previews of the film, penned by “Freddy vs. Jason” duo Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, look to be filled with twists and dark humor.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOff the Beaten Path\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Shudder\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“We Bury the Dead” (In theaters Jan. 2 via Vertical) — Zak Hilditch’s nuanced take on a zombie movie is carried by star Daisy Ridley, a woman desperately trying to find her husband as the dead rise. Great production design and a chilling soundscape amp up the tension.\n\n\t“Self-Help” (Debuts on Screambox on Jan. 6) — A young woman tries to rescue her mother from a wellness cult and its creepy guru in “Founders Day” director Erik Bloomquist’s newest feature. \n\n\t“Sleepwalker” (In theaters Jan. 9 via Brainstorm Media) — Hayden Panettiere stars as a grieving mother haunted by visions of her abusive husband, who was put in a coma by the same accident that killed her daughter. Brandon Auman wrote and directed this psychological thriller, which plays effectively with scares shrouded in darkness.\n\n\t“Night Patrol” (In theaters Jan. 16 via RLJE Films) — Ryan Prows’ vampire cop thriller is a genre mashup that brings bloodsuckers to the streets of L.A. With a unique cast led by Jermaine Fowler and Justin Long, and featuring a blend of rappers and character actors in supporting roles, “Night Patrol” also makes room to touch on some real-life social issues.\n\n\t“Savage Flowers” (Debuts on Screambox on Jan. 20) — Brad Watson directed this apocalyptic tale of children who are carriers of a global virus, and a young girl who ends up at a makeshift orphanage and must survive the sinister girls around her.\n\n\t“Return to Silent Hill” (In theaters Jan. 23 via Cineverse) — The first new “Silent Hill” movie since 2012 is an adaptation of the video game franchise favorite “Silent Hill 2,” and early footage looks devoted to the vibe of the game. Christophe Gans, who helmed the first film in 2006, returns to direct this new chapter.\n\n\t“Mother of Flies” (Debuts on Shudder on Jan. 23) — The Adams family’s latest stylish creation is a dark tale about a young woman with cancer (Zelda Adams), who searches for a cure from a witch (Toby Poser). Lots of evil imagery and unexpected twists on magical lore follow.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKiller Series\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of FX\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“The Hillside Strangler” (Premiering Jan. 18 on MGM+) — This four-part true-crime docuseries covers the disturbing real-life murders of young women that took place in L.A. from October 1977 to February 1978.\n\n\t“The Beauty” (Premiering Jan. 21 on FX) — Ryan Murphy’s newest series has a wild concept: An STD causes its carriers to have a gorgeous appearance, but also has more insidious implications. Based on the graphic novel from Jeremy Haun and Jason A. Hurley, the cast includes Evan Peters, Anthony Ramos, Jeremy Pope, Ashton Kutcher and Rebecca Hall.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBloodcurdling Books\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Gallery Books\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“The Bloody Brick Road” by Maude Royer (Released on Jan. 6 via Gallery Books) — Move over, “Wicked.” A wild new take on “The Wizard of Oz” is coming, and it’s a gruesome Canadian serial killer mystery filled with easter eggs.\n\n\t“A Box Full of Darkness” by Simone St. James (Released on Jan. 20 via Berkley) — The “Sun Down Motel” author returns with this haunted house story about a group of siblings who are beckoned to return to their creepy childhood home by the ghost of their brother. Spirits and spooky situations abound in this cozy tome.\n\n\t“The Final Score” by Don Winslow (Released on Jan. 27 via William Morrow) — It’s not horror, but genre fans will still love Winslow’s latest collection of taut and thrilling crime stories. Take our patron saint Stephen King’s word for it, as he calls “The Final Score” the “best crime fiction I’ve read in twenty years.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFrightening Festivals\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Fantasia Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tSundance Film Festival (Jan. 22 — Feb. 1 in Park City, Utah; click here for tickets) — The fest’s final year in Utah is set to deliver strong horror picks in its Midnight section, including A24’s audio-led podcast thriller “Undertone,” “Too Many Cooks” mastermind Casper Kelly’s “Buddy” and haunting queer love story “Leviticus.”\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoah Kahan Reflects on Year of ‘Change and Adaptation’ in Birthday Post\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBeyoncé Is Officially a Billionaire\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlabama, Indiana Bring Stark Contrasts to CFP Clash\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEXCLUSIVE: Dior Releases First Coed Campaign for Jonathan Anderson Collection Launch\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tTen years in the making, puzzle adventure game “Order of the Sinking Star” is set for a 2026 release on PC from Jonathan Blow‘s Thekla and indie publisher Arc Games.\n\n\tThe game hails from the creator of “Braid” and “The Witness.” It’s been in the works since “Witness” was released in 2016, Blow said. The game features more than a thousand “hand-crafted” puzzles that are designed to converge and hundreds of hours of gameplay. \n\n\n\t“Sinking Star” is designed take players “to a realm of curious magic, dangerous contraptions and vicious monsters,” per Arc Games, based in Redwood City, Calif. Players explore four distinct worlds that eventually collide and puzzle systems intertwine. The title’s release date and trailer were unveiled Dec. 11 at The Game Awards ceremony at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Order of the Sinking Star’ is the biggest game I’ve worked on, and also the most collaborative,”Blow said. “It’s a kind of game design supercollider that brings together ideas from many designers to create a puzzle landscape that’s much more intricate and vast than what has come before. We’ve successfully pushed the limits of what is possible in a puzzle adventure. The game is just incredibly complex and deep, and I can’t wait to show more as we move toward launch in 2026.”\n\n\t“Sinking Star” will mark a milestone for Arc Games, according to CEO Yoon Im. \n\n\t“Announcing ‘Order of the Sinking Star’ is a major moment for us, for Jonathan and his team – itrepresents an exciting year ahead for all of us,” Im said. “It’s an honor to support Jonathan to make his most ambitious project yet a reality, as we believe ‘Order of the Sinking Star’ is set to be the premier and innovative puzzle adventure of this generation. This announcement today marks just the beginning of what we have planned for a game-changing year for us next year.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe long-awaited sequel to the critically acclaimed, multi-award-winning video game “Control“ will debut in 2026 according to developer Remedy Entertainment. Formerly known as Control 2 or Codename Heron, the follow-up now has an official title: “Control Resonant.” \n\n\tThe continuation of the “Control” universe sets players back in the same supernatural New York setting as the first. Though this time with the main protagonist is Dylan Faden, Jesse Faden’s brother who was kidnapped years ago following a series of paranormal events. \n\t\n\n\tThe game picks up as Dylan’s former captors, the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), are deploying him at the peak of a supernatural crisis to combat a mysterious cosmic entity. Per the official logline, “Dylan must harness his new found powers to take the fight to the myriad threats overwhelming Manhattan. On the path to unlocking the full potential of his supernatural abilities Dylan will also seek out his sister, FBC Director Jesse Faden, as he struggles to comprehend and contain the dangers that have spilled beyond the confines of the Oldest House to tear the world apart.”    \n\n\tNews of the much-anticipated followup game was announced out of The Game Awards Thursday and comes nearly seven years after “Control” was first released.\n\n\tThe game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, and Mac via Steam and the App Store. Annapurna Pictures are co-financing and co-producing “Control Resonant” as part of a strategic partnership with Remedy Entertainment, who will self-publish. \n\t\n\n\tA cult-classic hit, “Control” sold more than 2 million copies in the first 15 months following its debut. As of August, lifetime sales for “Control” have since exceeded 5 million copies, Remedy announced. \n\n\t“’Control Resonant’ pushes our paranatural action RPG series into an expansive, reality-warping playground of choice, power, and consequence,” said Mikael Kasurinen, the creative director of the game, in a statement. “You don’t have to know the first game to jump into the sequel, we’ve made this one easy to pick up and hard to put down. We’re pushing the scale beyond anything we’ve done before, elevating combat, exploration, and storytelling into a bigger, more memorable experience. It’s ambitious, a little wild, and we can’t wait for players to get lost in it.” \n\n\tWatch the “Control Resonant” announcement trailer below. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBlizzard gave “Diablo” franchise fans what they’ve all been waiting years for Thursday during The 2025 Game Awards: the addition of the Paladin class to “Diablo IV,” followed by the upcoming release of “Lord of Hatred” expansion next April.\n\n\tPer the developer’s description for the Paladin: “The Paladin is Sanctuary’s quintessential holy warrior: a sword-and-shield champion empowered not only by faith, but by the Light itself. More than mere armored knights, Paladins are forged as holy conduits. When their unwavering devotion joins with the Light, the two become an unstoppable force against the darkness. Built on beloved mechanics that have shaped the Paladin identity, the class brings forth iconic abilities with fresh, new skills. Classic skills like Auras, Blessed Hammer, Blessed Shield, and Zeal return with a revitalized feel that blends Diablo II nostalgia with the visceral combat and grounded visual style of Diablo IV. Where Crusaders embody martial might, the Paladin leans fully into divine power.”\n\t\n\n\tBut Blizzard was far from the only video game developer to make a big splash with an announcement during The Game Awards, where many a new title, release date reveal and new teaser debuted. See more announcements from the 2025 Game Awards below.\n\n\t\n\t\tHIGHGUARD \t\n\n\tWild Entertainment has unveiled “Highguard,” a free-to-play PvP raid shooter launching Jan. 26, 2026.\n\n\tAn official description reads, “Players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Battle rival warden crews for control of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure victory in this all-new breed of shooter.” \n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer below. \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBRADLEY THE BADGER \t\n\n\tDay 4 Night Studios announced that “Bradley the Badger,” an action-adventure game with a fourth-wall-breaking narrative, is currently in development for PC via Steam. Evan Peters (“American Horror Story,” “X-Men: Days of Future Past”) provides the voice and live-action performance for Bradley.\n\n\tWatch the trailer below. \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEXODUS \t\n\n\tWizards of the Coast and Archetype Entertainment have released a new trailer for “Exodus,” providing the most detailed look yet at Jun Aslan — the next hero of the sci-fi RPG. According to an official description, the trailer “dives deeper into Jun’s origins as a descendant of a legendary Traveler dynasty, revealing the extraordinary abilities hidden beneath his humble beginnings. Fans also get another glimpse of the enigmatic C.C. Orlev, portrayed by Academy Award–winning actor Matthew McConaughey in his first-ever video game role.”\n\n\tWatch the trailer below. \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWARLOCK: DUNGEONS & DRAGONS \t\n\n\t“Warlock: Dungeons & Dragons,” developed by Invoke Studios, is a single-player, third-person action-adventure that takes players into a dark-fantasy open world inspired by “Dungeons & Dragons.” “The game places players in the role of Kaatri, a veteran warrior who makes a pact to wield otherworldly magic against dark powers,” according to a press release. \n\n\t“Warlock” is currently in development for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox. Additional details, including the gameplay debut, will be unveiled in summer 2026, with a planned launch the following year.\n\n\tWatch the teaser for “Warlock: Dungeons & Dragons” below. \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tINVINCIBLE VS\t\n\n\t“Invincible VS,” a tournament-quality superhero 3v3 tag fighting game that allows players to become a superhero in the bloodiest fight in the universe, will launch for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and PC on April 30, 2026.\n\n\tQuarter Up, Skybound Entertainment’s first in-house game development studio, also revealed an all-new character named Ella Mental, who will join the “Invincible VS” roster. The character is created by “Invincible” co-creators Robert Kirkman and Cory Walker and voiced by rapper Tierra Whack. \n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer below. \n\n\n\n\n\tFrom Larian Studios, “Divinity” is described as a game set in the world of Rivellon. Per the developers, “While Divinity is a brand new game that doesn’t require experience with previous Larian titles, those who’ve played Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin 2 will be able to enjoy greater understanding and continuity.”\n\n\tWatch the teaser for “Divinity” below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t007 FIRST LIGHT\t\n\n\tAlso during the show, IO Interactive revealed Lenny Kravitz is playing a new villain in its upcoming James Bond game “007 First Light.” Kravitz took the stage himself to tease the project, in which he will play Bawma, described as “the unpredictable and charismatic ruler of Africa’s largest black-market hub.”\n\n\tThe game is set to release on March 27, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox ROG Ally X, Xbox ROG Ally, Nintendo Switch 2 and PC. \n\n\tWatch the “007 First Light” teaser featuring Kravitz below.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBandai Namco Entertainment announced the next installment in its beloved flight-shooter franchise “Ace Combat” Thursday to much fanfare during the 2025 Game Awards.\n\n\tTitled “Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve,” the game takes place after the events of “Ace Combat 7” and before “Ace Combat 3.” The title will debut in 2026 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and for PC via Steam.\n\n\tBefore the show, Bandai Namco Entertainment CEO Nao Udagawa gave Variety a sneak peek at the new game, “Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve,” and some updates on A24’s upcoming “Elden Ring” movie (Disney vet Peter Rice has joined the project) and her overall strategy since taking the helm at the Bandai video game studio.\n\t\n\n\t“The graphics are something that we really, really leaned into heavy for ‘Ace Combat 8’ and visual expression of the sky itself,” Udagawa said. “I think of how the clouds are shown and rendered — I would get different development updates and the developer would show me what the progress is, and every time, wow the sky and the clouds, it’s so amazing, and how it ties into the weather change as well. So I think that’s something the fans are going to really And it is a franchise IP, so certainly the gameplay, I think the fans can know what to expect, so keeping everything that worked really well, but we’re really adding value in the story and the narrative and the sort of cinematic presentation of how it’s delivered. It’s gonna feel like this epic movie that you’ll want to see on a big screen.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBandai Namco Entertainment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBandai Namco Entertainment\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPer Bandai Namco’s description for “Ace Combat 8,” “You’re a fighter pilot, adrift at sea in a rescue boat until the outdated aircraft carrier, Endurance, pulls you aboard. Your homeland’s navy is shattered. The aging vessel, its decks crowded with refugees, has already retreated far from the front lines. It’s July 2029. The Federation of Central Usea (FCU) has fallen under a lightning invasion by the Republic of Sotoa. Most of the nation is occupied, the military is scattered, and the Endurance is just one fragment of what remains. On this ship, you’re given a single name: “Wings of Theve.” A legendary ace, a symbol of hope, a name tied to Theve, the FCU capital. But that legend was a lie, mere propaganda—a story to keep morale alive. Now, you must carry that name and take to the skies again. With three new comrades at your side, fight to reclaim your lost homeland.”\n\t\n\n\tFor development on the new game, Bandai Namco Entertainment launched new studio Bandai Namco Aces, so that the “Ace Combat” franchise team could operate as their own business with one targeted IP focus.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“One thing that I’m looking at right now is really the speed and cycles of development that we have,” Udagawa (who has retained her Chief Pac-Man Officer title since being promoted to the company’s overall CEO in 2021) said about her strategy for Bandai Namco’s game studios. “I think it’s great that we’re developing internally and having these discussions to improve the quality of the experience, but at the end of the day, until something reaches the market, the fans aren’t going to be able to get their hands on it. So translating all of these discussions and healthy development into output quicker is something that I’m looking at while maintaining the quality.”\n\n\tBack in the spring, Bandai Namco Entertainment revealed it is working on a film adaptation of its “Elden Ring” game franchise with A24 and director Alex Garland. Little has been said about the project since, but Udagawa can now share the Hollywood vet Peter Rice has joined the project.\n\n\t“Development right now is steady in terms of the project at the moment and catch, yeah, so we have A24 helming up the project with Alex Garland and Peter Rice — a lot of very well-known names and heavy hitters in the film industry,” Udagawa said. “So we’re very excited right now about how it’s going to shape up. But I think that’s kind of where the development and pre-production is.”\n\n\tAs for what aspect of the “Elden Ring” franchise the movie will focus on, Udagawa can only reveal that the focus for her is on pleasing fans.\n\n\t“Our first priority is really the ‘Elden Ring’ fans, so the fans who have supported the franchise for so long, making it sure that they feel like it’s a great movie and a great experience,” Udagawa said. “And for those who have perhaps not been exposed to the game yet and have seen the film, for them, maybe [thinking,] I’ll try the game to see the world and the perspective from multiple angles and experience it that way.”\n\n\tWatch the teaser for “Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Matlock” is undergoing some changes. \n\n\tIn early October, David Del Rio, who portrays associate Billy Martinez, was removed from the set and fired after a sexual assault allegation. Season 2 was already in production when the incident occurred, and Del Rio had already filmed seven episodes. “Prior Bad Acts,” which aired on Dec. 4, marked his final appearance, showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman confirms to Variety.\n\n\n\tThat episode ended with Billy telling his pregnant girlfriend, “I do want to get married,” an odd-sounding line that appeared to have been mashed together later. While Snyder Urman didn’t confirm that was the case, she said, “I’ll just say there were creative changes that we had to make, and we made them. We’re ending up in a different place than what our plans were, but we really stopped and tried to think about how we can have an exit that makes sense in the world of our show and for the character.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the Dec. 11 midseason finale, Sarah (Leah Lewis) reveals Billy has taken a personal day from work, then later learns his pregnant girlfriend has had a miscarriage. “His exit will be explained in the course of the next two episodes, and it is really in line with the character and in line with what’s happening with the firm at large,” Snyder Urman says. “We want to remain true to the character.”\n\n\tWhile Snyder Urman said she’s “not able to discuss the events” surrounding the allegations made against Del Rio that led to his firing, she added: “We just sort of plugged in and kept moving forward. We’re just all happy to be back, and focused on the work. I think that’s the thing — we want the show to be great. We want it to be joyful for the audience to watch.”\n\t\n\n\tThough Lewis has never confirmed her involvement with the allegations, after the news broke that Del Rio had been fired, she shared a message via Instagram in which she wrote, “Mom is here, we’re moving forward in love and strength. I’m in good hands. Thank you to everybody for any kind of support and care. Truly, we’re moving forward in strength. Key word, strength. Please, let that be the takeaway.” Del Rio’s wife, in turn, posted and deleted a photo of her and her own mom with text that read, “Mom is here. We’re moving forward in love and strength after what Leah did to our family. Thank you all for the love and support!”\n\n\tOn the show, Lewis’ character is facing a tough road ahead in Season 2, having been she was removed from Olympia’s (Skye P. Marshall) team during the midseason finale after lying to her boss. Plus, the merger is moving full steam ahead, which means no one’s jobs are safe. One positive note? Olympia and Matty (Kathy Bates) are finally back on the same team again.\n\n\t“That relationship is just everything to me,” Snyder Urman said of Matty and Olympia. “If I could headline the back half of the season, it’s joy, because we have so much fun coming in with some new characters, some returning, and then we start flipping cards left and right. There’s a certain amount of joy that that brings, in terms of telling the story and getting answers. And then we get to have Matty and Olympia working together — this intergenerational friendship that was unexpected, but means everything to them both. They look at all these obstacles, but work on them together, which to me is a relief, because I hate writing them in conflict.”\n\n\tPlus, two new characters will be introduced in the back half of Season 2: Sarah Wright Olsen as Gwen, an efficiency expert analyzing the firm; and Henry Haber as Hunter, a younger associate and “total bro.”\n\n\t“Matlock” returns to CBS with new episodes on Thursday, Feb. 26.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tThe “End of an Era” is finally here. Taylor Swift‘s six-part docuseries premieres on Disney+ at 12 a.m PT/ 3 a.m. ET on Friday, Dec. 12. The series will be accompanied by a new concert film shot at her final show in Vancouver, BC. \n\n\tThe series is an intimate look at Swift’s life during the second leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour, including a behind-the-scenes look at her high-wattage relationship with her now fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and moments with tour opening acts Gracie Abrams and Sabrina Carpenter and guests Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch. The first two of the six episodes will be available to stream tonight, with two more episodes released weekly for the next two weeks.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m very aware of mysterious forces at play that I will never have any control of,” Swift says in a trailer for the doc. “This show created a bonding experience for like 70,000 people all at once. There’s something very special about that.”\n\n\tThe docuseries also takes viewers inside Swift’s planning process for each concert’s surprise song section. At the end of the trailer, Swift explains to her mom: “So it goes ‘New Year’s Day’ verse and chorus, ‘Manuscript’ bridge into ‘Long Live’ bridge, into the down verse of ‘Long Live,’ into ‘hold onto the memories they will hold onto you,’ into ‘Long Live’ chorus but slow it down to half-time, ‘New Year’s Day’ chords underneath it, into the last verse of ‘The Manuscript.’”\n\n\tThe concert film bows at the same time as those first two docuseries installments. It will mark the first time fans have gotten a chance to see the material that was added to the Eras Tour from the “Tortured Poets Department” on the big screen. Her earlier “Eras Tour” theatrical concert film (which also eventually made its way to Disney+) was released before that album came out or songs from it were added to the tour set list.\n\t\n\n\tStream Swift’s “End of an Era” docuseries and concert film on Disney+.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmazon Game Studios and Crystal Dynamics revealed a first look at their highly anticipated new “Tomb Raider” game Thursday during The Game Awards — and announced a remake of the original 1996 “Tomb Raider” title will be launching next year.\n\n\tLaunching in 2027, “Tomb Raider: Catalyst” is a new title from Amazon, which will be preceded by reimagining “Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis” next year. Actress Alix Wilton Regan is the voice and motion-capture star portraying Lara Croft in both games. (“Dragon Age: Inquisition,” “Cyberpunk 2077” and “Mass Effect 3”).\n\t\n\n\tPer Amazon Game Studios and Crystal Dynamics’ description for “Catalyst,” the game “marks a bold direction for the series as Lara Croft embarks on a new adventure across Northern India.” “Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them. When the most notorious treasure hunters from around the world descend on the region, Lara races to uncover the truth buried beneath the fractured landscape and stop those who would use its power for their own gain. As the ancient world collides with the present, Lara must decide who to trust among rivals and allies to prevent a catastrophe and protect a secret that could reshape the future.”\n\n\n\t“Tomb Raider: Catalyst” is set to launch in 2027 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.\n\n\tBefore “Catalyst” releases, Amazon Game Studios, Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog will launch “Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis,” which is described as “a modern reimagining of Lara Croft’s genre-defining 1996 debut.” \n\t\n\n\t“Developed in partnership between Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog, the game features stunning visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, modern game design, and new surprises that honor the spirit and atmosphere of the original game,” Amazon said in a press release announcing the game Thursday during The Game Awards. “As Lara Croft, players will harness their wits and athleticism to explore exotic locations lost to time, traverse treacherous landscapes, solve deadly contraptions, and face lethal predators in their quest for the scattered pieces of the Scion—an artifact of immeasurable power.”\n\n\t“Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis” will launch in 2026 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.\n\n\tBoth games are being developed as Amazon is also prepping a new live-action “Tomb Raider” TV series starring Sophie Turner as Lara Croft.\n\n\t“The two games we announced at The Game Awards and the TV series from Amazon MGM Studios are being developed in parallel; they share a core DNA but each project is making choices that are correct for its medium,” Crystal Dynamics head of studio Scot Amos told Variety. “For now, we’re focused on the games and will have more details to share on Legacy of Atlantis and Catalyst next year.”\n\n\tRegarding the development timeline for the two games, Amos said: “We have two parallel and powerful development teams inside of Fellowship Entertainment, complementing each other yet each owning their respective game, whether that’s Catalyst or Legacy of Atlantis. We are connected by shared technologies and gameplay systems where it makes sense, and by a shared leadership group who oversees the creative alignment and ensures all things are within the Tomb Raider canon. Our partnership with Flying Wild Hog on Legacy of Atlantis has been incredible—they truly feel like a parallel Crystal Dynamics team. This development approach means Legacy of Atlantis can arrive in 2026 to celebrate that meaningful 30th anniversary milestone, while Catalyst follows in 2027 with the scope and ambition that game requires.”\n\n\tWatch the teasers for both games below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Authorities later determined he died from an overdose of cocaine, MDMA -- a type of old school Ecstasy -- and alcohol.\n      \n    \n          Noah was just a teenager when Scott passed away ... and he's dealt with similar demons as his father.

Robinson ultimately surrendered at Utah's Washington County Sheriff's Office, around 10 PM on Sept. 11, the day after the shooting.\n      \n    \n          Utah prosecutors charged Robinson with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice.\n      \n    \n          The aggravated murder charge could get him the death penalty if convicted.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Tyler Robinson\n              \n                          \n                Charlie Kirk\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Charlie Kirk Shooting\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Shootings\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tRevered filmmaker and International Film Festival of India (IFFI) festival director Shekhar Kapur is steering the Goa-based event toward a future emphasizing technological innovation, audience engagement and international co-production opportunities as it enters its 56th edition.\n\n\tIn an interview, Kapur outlines three key priorities reshaping India’s flagship film festival: integrating artificial intelligence and emerging technologies into the festival infrastructure, transforming the WAVES Film Bazaar into a major international marketplace, and positioning IFFI as an audience-focused celebration rather than solely an industry event.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve got an AI hackathon festival as part of the WAVES Film Bazaar,” Kapur says, describing partnerships with Larsen & Toubro and Google to incorporate technology demonstrations throughout the event. “AI is becoming such a big controversy all over the world, but it’s so democratic. It’s a completely democratic medium. It’s trying to give more people more tools.”\n\n\n\tThe festival director highlights India’s enhanced production incentive program, which has increased from 30% to 40% cash rebates for international productions filming in the country. He cites the British-Indian production “Santosh,” which competed for an Oscar nomination as the U.K.’s official submission, as an example of the program’s effectiveness.\n\n\t“The producer of ‘Santosh’ actually got his 30% back, and he said it was the easiest deal he’s ever made,” Kapur says, noting the growing number of Indian filmmakers based overseas who are utilizing the incentives to produce projects in India.\n\t\n\n\tThe WAVES Film Bazaar, IFFI’s co-production market and financing platform, has become central to Kapur’s strategy for attracting international participants. The event serves as a venue where filmmakers can pitch projects and connect with potential collaborators and financiers.\n\n\t“We’re hoping to attract a lot more people to the WAVES Film Bazaar,” Kapur explains. “The interaction between filmmakers of Indian origin or Asian origin coming to make films in India” represents a key growth area for the festival.\n\n\tIn a departure from traditional film festival protocol, Kapur has introduced a Goa carnival-style opening ceremony designed to engage local audiences and residents. The move reflects his broader ambition to make IFFI more accessible to the general public rather than limiting it to industry professionals.\n\n\t“The International Film Festival of India is the only film festival in the world that is called Indian Film Festival,” he says, contrasting it with city-named festivals like Venice, Toronto and Tokyo. “The fact is that they actually do belong to the city, and there are lots of either private funding or funding from the city itself, because the city grows along with the festival.”\n\n\tThe festival currently attracts approximately 20,000 attendees, with Kapur projecting that number will reach 50,000 by next year — a figure that includes general audiences rather than just industry delegates.\n\n\tRegarding programming, Kapur emphasizes that this year’s edition features what he considers the strongest lineup in recent years, with 10 films from the festival having been submitted as Oscar entries from various countries.\n\n\t“This is probably the best lineup of international films,” he says. “We’ve tried very hard to bring the best of world cinema to the audiences.”\n\n\tKapur acknowledges that IFFI faces challenges in attracting high-profile titles to its competition sections, as films selected for competition at established festivals like Cannes generate significant market attention and acquisition interest. However, he expresses confidence in the festival’s alternative strengths, particularly its growing WAVES Film Bazaar and production incentive initiatives.\n\n\tThe director has committed to serving a two-year term in the festival director role, which has required him to pause his filmmaking career during this period. The 55th International Film Festival of India runs Nov. 20-28 in Goa. WAVES Film Bazaar runs Nov. 20-24.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPost-production giant Prasad is showcasing 10 restored Indian classics at the 55th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), running Nov. 20-28 in Goa.\n\n\tThe restored titles, part of an ongoing collaboration between the National Film Development Corporation, the National Film Archive of India and Prasad, span multiple decades of Indian cinema. The lineup includes Muzaffar Ali’s 1981 costume drama “Umrao Jaan,” starring Rekha as a 19th-century courtesan.\n\t\n\n\tThe 10 films screening at IFFI are Ali’s “Umrao Jaan” (1981) and “Gaman” (1978), Kalpana Lajmi’s “Rudaali” (1993), Ritwik Ghatak’s “Subarnarekha” (1965), Baburao Painter’s “Muraliwala” (1927), Govind Nihalani’s “Party” (1984), Guru Dutt’s “Pyaasa” (1957), Shyam Benegal’s “Susman” (1987), Sibi Malayil’s “Kireedam” (1989) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s “Musafir” (1957).\n\n\n\tPrasad’s restoration teams utilized digital restoration techniques, color grading and quality control protocols to preserve each film’s original vision while ensuring technical fidelity across picture and sound elements.\n\n\t“Restoring these films is both a responsibility and a privilege,” said Abhishek Prasad, director and CTO at Prasad. “Each title carries within it a piece of India’s cultural memory — the craft, courage and creativity of filmmakers who defined our cinematic language.”\n\n\tPrasad is also presenting two restored Sri Lankan films at the 47th Nantes Three Continents Film Festival in France, running Nov. 21-29. The company restored D.B. Nihalsinghe’s “Welikathara” (1971) and Prasanna Vithanage’s “Akasa Kusum” (2008) for the festival, which celebrates cinema from Asia, Africa and Latin America. \n\t\n\n\t“It is always an honor when films from our region find new life and new audiences across the world,” said Kavita Prasad, managing director of Prasad Corporation. “Sri Lanka’s cinematic legacy is rich, nuanced and deeply human.”\n\n\tFounded in 1956 by filmmaker L.V. Prasad, the company has worked on more than 30,000 films over six decades. The post-production house operates facilities across India, the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia, offering services including 8K film restoration, digital intermediate work, HDR grading and Dolby Atmos mixing.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVince Gill received the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award during the CMA Awards on Nov. 19. Preceding Gill’s acceptance of the honor, a musical tribute took the stage, featuring Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless covering Gill’s hit song “When I Call Your Name.”\n\n\tAfter the performance, country legend George Strait took the stage to present Gill with the award. He said of the 22-time Grammy winner, “There is not a more deserving person to receive this honor, which bears the name of the true Icon himself, Mr. Willie Nelson.”\n\t\n\n\tGill kept it light with his acceptance speech, opening with a joke before gushing about the award’s history. He told the audience, “It’s not lost on me that we had to have girls come out here and sing for me tonight. None of the boys can get up that high.” He added. “This is amazing. In the history of this award, I think it’s been given to maybe ten people, nine or ten, something like that. And that list of people is astounding.”\n\n\n\tAfter sharing a message of love and gratitude to his management and family, Gill gave a final shoutout to the award’s namesake: “Willie, if you’re out there listening, 92 years old, you’re still inspiring us to this day. God bless.”\n\n\tBorn in Oklahoma, Gill began his career as a session player and solo act, working on David Grisman’s 1983 album “Here Today” and releasing his debut EP the following year. In 1990, he had his first hit single with “When I Call Your Name.” Two years later, he released the quadruple platinum album “I Still Believe in You,” which solidified him as a major star and leading figure in country music. \n\t\n\n\tToday, Gill has released 20 albums, selling over 30 million records and charting 45 singles. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2007 and has previously earned 18 CMA Awards as well as 22 Grammys.\n\n\tHis history with the CMA runs deep. In addition to receiving 18 awards and now the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, he also hosted the show every year from 1992 to 2003 and has become a part of the ceremony’s iconography. \n\n\tGill continues to play and create, performing with the Eagles at the intermittent Sphere concerts in Las Vegas. He also continues his solo career, having just recently reupped his deal with MCA Records and relased the  EP “I Gave You Everything I Had” in October.\n\n\tThe 59th annual CMA Awards took place at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena in Tennessee and were broadcast live on ABC. The event was hosted by Lainey Wilson.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 56th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) kicked off the 19th edition of its industry market — now rebranded as WAVES Film Bazaar — with a promise to support emerging filmmakers through a new cash grant program.\n\n\tSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony in Goa, Information and Broadcasting Secretary Sanjay Jaju announced that the market will award a $20,000 cash grant for the first time. “WAVES Film Bazaar will present its most ambitious slate with more than 300 films this year,” Jaju said. “Each section is crafted to ensure creators at every stage find a place and pathway. For the first time, the bazaar will also award a cash grant of $20,000 to encourage and support emerging filmmakers.”\n\t\n\n\tThe ceremony, held as part of IFFI’s Nov. 20-28 run, drew industry leaders including “Lion” filmmaker Garth Davis, actor Anupam Kher, Indian Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting L. Murugan, Additional Secretary Prabhat Kumar, WAVES Bazaar advisor Jerome Pilloard, actor Nandamuri Balakrishna, and IFFI festival director Shekhar Kapur. Jaewon Kim, member of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, attended as chief guest.\n\n\n\tPositioned as one of Asia’s key film markets, WAVES Film Bazaar serves as IFFI’s dedicated industry platform, connecting creators with financiers, studios, festival programmers and international partners across nine days of screenings, masterclasses and market activities.\n\n\tDr. L. Murugan emphasized the market’s role in India’s growing creative economy. “As our Prime Minister [Narendra Modi] mentioned in WAVES [a market held in Mumbai in May], India is emerging as a global power in production, digital content, gaming, fashion and music,” he said. “WAVES Film Bazaar will bridge the gap between the theatres to the world producers. We are also giving a platform to the young minds.”\n\t\n\n\tThe inauguration featured a performance of India’s national song “Vande Mataram” by Jaewon Kim, with audience participation.\n",

    "body": "\n\tVariety is exclusively unveiling a new clip from “Lullaby for the Mountains,” the debut feature from Armenian filmmaker Hayk Matevosyan that is making its Asian premiere at the 56th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), where it serves as the sole Armenian selection. \n\n\tThe contemplative work, executive produced by Hungarian auteur Béla Tarr, world premiered at Sheffield DocFest 2025 in the International First Feature Competition.\n\t\n\n\tThe film unfolds across 15 dreamlike chapters chronicling a spectral journey through Armenia’s rugged highlands. Shot entirely on location in Armenia, the wordless narrative follows an unnamed figure traversing ancient monasteries, mountain landscapes and underground chambers, blurring boundaries between reality and dreams.\n\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, Matevosyan describes the project as a meditation on collective memory and loss. The director explains the significance of premiering at IFFI, noting the historical connections between Armenian and Indian cultures spanning centuries.\n\n\t“What makes this Asian premiere so special is the deep connection between Armenian and Indian culture that goes back centuries,” Matevosyan says. “Armenian communities have lived in India for a long time, in cities like Kolkata and Chennai, but the connection has always been mutual.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker characterizes the work as exploring themes of displacement and cultural memory. “For me, ‘Lullaby for the Mountains’ is about ghosts drifting through the land, about collective memory, and the quiet traces of lives that have passed and those still to come,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tTarr’s involvement stems from Matevosyan’s participation in the 2019 Locarno Spring Academy Directing Residency, where he created a short film under the legendary director’s mentorship. The collaboration proved transformative for the young filmmaker’s approach.\n\n\t“Spending time with him really changed how I approach filmmaking,” Matevosyan recalls. “He opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about image, atmosphere, landscape, and characters.”\n\n\tThe director emphasizes Tarr’s unorthodox mentoring philosophy: “He dislikes the words ‘teaching’ or ‘education,’ and always says that he is here to liberate us, not to educate.”\n\n\tDuring production of the residency short, Tarr showed Matevosyan paintings by Caspar David Friedrich without commentary. “That’s when I really started thinking of cinematic images more like paintings, rather than only just tools for story or plot,” the director says.\n\n\tAs executive producer, Tarr reviewed multiple cuts and encouraged bold aesthetic choices. This support influenced Matevosyan’s decision to eliminate voice-over narration entirely, allowing soundscape and visuals to carry the narrative independently.\n\n\t“I think ultimately what Béla gave me is the courage to just go and make my debut film without thinking of any cinematic rules and I’m beyond grateful for that,” Matevosyan says.\n\n\tThe filmmaker holds a directing degree from UCLA and has participated in numerous prestigious programs including Berlinale Talents, Sarajevo Talents, IFFR Sessions, the BFC Workshop in Peruvian Amazonia under Werner Herzog’s mentorship, and the Locarno Spring Academy.\n\n\tHis work has screened at major festivals including Locarno, Slamdance DIG, LA Film Festival, Atlanta Film Festival, AGBU Film at Lincoln Center and the Werner Herzog Foundation. Matevosyan also directed the music video “Lives” for System of A Down member Daron Malakian.\n\n\t“Lullaby for the Mountains” is produced by Luiza Yeranosyan and Matevosyan through production company Dolly Bell Films. The cast includes Ashot Matevosyan, Bella Ghochikyan, Sargis Mosinyan, Luiza Yeranosyan and Hayk Mosinyan. Matevosyan served as writer, director, cinematographer and editor on the Armenia-U.S. co-production.\n\n\tWatch the clip here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Friends” diehards can finally watch the conclusion of the short-lived spinoff series “Joey.”\n\n\tThe final eight episodes of the 2004 NBC sitcom, which starred Matt LeBlanc as the wisecracking Joey Tribbiani, never aired in the U.S. after the show was canceled in 2006 during its second season. But now, those eight installments are available to watch on the “Friends” YouTube channel, along with he 38 others that comprise the complete series.\n\t\n\n\tOutside of LeBlanc, other cast members included Drea de Matteo, Paulo Costanzo, Jennifer Coolidge and Andrea Anders. The series followed Joey as he “leaves New York for Hollywood in order to take his acting career to the next level.” While in Los Angeles, he reunites with “his high-strung sister Gina (Matteo)” and “Michael (Costanzo), his 20-year-old genius nephew,” per an official description.\n\n\n\tCreated by “Friends” producers Shana Goldberg-Meehan and Scott Silveri, the show’s pilot debuted to an impressive 18.6 million viewers. However, hype quickly died down through the remainder of Season 1 and Season 2.\n\n\tAfter “Joey” came to an end, “Friends” executive producer and director Kevin S. Bright gave his thoughts on why the spin-off failed to find an audience. He told The Age in 2006, “On ‘Friends’ Joey was a womaniser but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn’t get a job, couldn’t ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs the Doha Film Festival opens its inaugural edition with a robust Spotlight on Sudanese cinema and music, the program arrives at a moment when the country’s films, like its people, are fighting to stay visible. In a year marked by ongoing war and mass displacement, DFF’s showcase feels both celebratory and, quietly, political. Nowhere is that more palpable than in “Cotton Queen,” the debut feature from Sudanese filmmaker Suzannah Mirghani, screening in the festival’s International Feature Film Competition. \n\t\n\n\t“Cotton Queen” has already begun drawing critical attention, winning the Golden Alexander for best feature film at the Thessaloniki Intl. Film Festival earlier this month, a milestone for both the film and the growing visibility of Sudanese cinema.\n\n\n\tSudanese audiences abroad have encountered the film at festivals from Venice, where it world premiered in Critics’ Week, to Chicago, often arriving in small but passionate cohorts. “The first reaction is always: ‘We’re seeing Sudan on screen,’” Mirghani observes. “Especially among younger Sudanese, there’s relief at seeing familiar faces, landscapes, and dynamics.”\n\n\tFor Mirghani, who lives in Qatar and developed the project with longstanding support from the Doha Film Institute, the Doha Film Festival represents a rare instance of a major event positioning Sudanese work not as a sidebar but as a central feature of programming. “It’s meaningful that the festival itself is choosing to spotlight Sudanese culture,” she reflects. “In many parts of the world, Sudanese communities feel overlooked. Here, there’s a sense of being seen.”\n\t\n\n\t“Cotton Queen” began as a script that hovered between short and feature, prompting Mirghani to first make the 2020 short “Al-Sit” as a proof of concept with DFI support. The film became a breakout, winning the Canal+/Cine+ Award at Clermont-Ferrand and laying the foundation for her debut feature.\n\n\tWhat anchored both projects was an unlikely obsession: Sudanese cotton. Mirghani has spent nearly a decade excavating its history and symbolism. “Cotton is central to Sudan in every aspect,” she emphasizes. The crop is entwined with Sudan’s domestic rituals, communal heritage, and the country’s painful colonial past. Women of her grandmother’s generation spun raw cotton into thread — work that allowed them to earn, save, and maintain a quiet economic agency. “Even when others in the house had no income, the grandmother always had cash because she’s selling her thread,” Mirghani explains. “There’s history there, but also women’s empowerment.”\n\n\tAt the heart of the feature lies a jarring discovery Mirghani uncovered during her research: that genetically modified cotton seeds, first introduced in Sudan in 2012, had overtaken the majority of the country’s cotton crop by 2020. “It was a real shock to me to understand that this prize of Sudanese history, which is natural Sudanese fiber cotton, is no longer,” she recalls.\n\n\t“Cotton Queen” builds a fiction around that reality, following teenage Nafisa (Mihad Murtada), who becomes the focal point of a power struggle over the genetically modified seeds that will determine the fate of her village. Mirghani threads a coming-of-age story with an ecological and economic critique without allowing the film to drift into lecture. “The film isn’t a lesson, even though there are lessons within it,” she argues. “You understand the stakes through Nafisa, through her grandmother, through the community.”\n\n\tThe film also draws on the historic Cotton Queen competitions of the 1930s, beauty contests for mill workers in northern England that were also held, with far less documentation, in Sudan. “It was a competition for the prettiest girl working in the mills to put a beautiful face on a terrible industry,” Mirghani explains. “I wanted to reclaim that competition and turn it on its head.”\n\t\n\n\tMirghani had initially planned to shoot entirely in Sudan with a mostly Sudanese cast and crew. But after war broke out in April 2023, those plans collapsed. Many collaborators fled to Egypt, and the production followed. “In Sudan, there was genuine momentum for a film industry,” she observes, citing the recent international reception of “Goodbye Julia” and “You Will Die at Twenty.” “The war disrupted everything: lives, livelihoods, cultural works.”\n\n\tRelocating became a matter of solidarity as much as logistics. “We followed them,” Mirghani notes. “Egypt wasn’t home for them. But it was where they were.” The natural environment along the Nile provided continuity with cotton fields and riverbanks nearly indistinguishable from Sudan, yet the emotional terrain was radically different. Some cast members had arrived only weeks earlier, still processing what they had witnessed on the road out of Sudan. Many of the actors were young, non-professional, and displaced.\n\n\tYet filmmaking became a source of stability. “They wanted the film to bring them together,” she observes. “Sudan is deeply communal, and they found that on set.” The Sudanese village the production built in Egypt felt so lived-in that leaving at night became disorienting. “We’d step outside and remember, ‘Oh my God, we’re not in Sudan anymore,’” she recalls.\n\n\tBuilt as a multinational co-production, the film was shepherded by producers Caroline Daubeand Didar Domehri with Strange Bird, Maneki Films, and Philistine Films, whose coordination proved essential as the project’s circumstances shifted. The wide co-production network also included ZDF/Das Kleine Fernsehspiel, ARTE, Film Clinic, MAD Solutions, JIPPIE Film, and the Red Sea Fund.\n\n\tDFF’s Sudanese spotlight extends beyond cinema to its Sounds of Sudan music program, a connection that resonates with Mirghani, who treats music as a narrative voice. “Cotton Queen” opens with girls singing aghani albanat, “girls’ songs” performed in women-only spaces. “The lyrics are very cheeky,” she points out. “It’s where girls speak freely in a context that otherwise can be quite restrictive.” The score, composed by Tunisian-French musician Amine Bouhafa, weaves in Sudanese instrumentation like the oud and tambour, while Brooklyn-based Sudanese singer Alsarah appears through a modern rendition of a traditional song. “Sudanese people are very lyrical,” Mirghani adds. She even wrote Nafisa’s poems herself, crediting them in the film as their own artistic form.\n\t\n\n\tSudanese filmmaking remains rare, an absence Mirghani feels acutely. “There may be only 10 Sudanese fiction films ever made by Sudanese filmmakers,” she estimates. “We need quantity, quality, different perspectives.” That scarcity makes DFF’s spotlight feel especially meaningful. Many of the film’s Sudanese cast and crew, still scattered across Egypt, are being brought to Doha for the screening. “We’ll watch the film together, on screen, for the first time,” Mirghani reflects. “That’s a gift.”\n\n\tAs for what comes next, Mirghani’s hopes remain rooted in connection. “Right now, we don’t have a country. Right now, the country is destroyed. So to be connected through this film would be my greatest measure of success,” she reflects. With international sales already handled by Totem Films, she envisions the feature traveling as widely as possible, especially to Sudanese communities in the diaspora and in refugee contexts. A global platform could help extend its reach, but for her, the true purpose remains the same: creating a point of connection for Sudanese audiences wherever they may be around the world.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs the Doha Film Festival launches its inaugural edition, the event marks its debut with a bold gesture: a sweeping Spotlight on Sudan that centers a country whose cultural output has often been overshadowed by political upheaval. Among the program’s most urgent titles is “Khartoum,” an inventive hybrid documentary crafted by a five-person directing team: Brahim “Snoopy” Ahmad, Anas Saeed, Rawia Alhag, Timeea Mohamed Ahmed, and British filmmaker Philip Cox. \n\t\n\n\tThe film follows a civil servant, a tea seller, a resistance committee volunteer, and two street boys whose stories converge as Sudan’s capital slides from civic unrest to full-scale war. Their experiences unfold through a blend of images shot on iPhones, stylized green-screen reconstructions, and animated dreamscapes that visualize the characters’ inner worlds and outer realities.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Khartoum”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Native Voice Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat screens in Doha as a centerpiece of the festival’s Sudanese showcase began in far more modest circumstances. The project originated in 2022 as a small documentary workshop led by Cox (Native Voice Films) in collaboration with producer Talal Afifi (Sudan Film Factory), with support from independent Sudanese media house Ayin Network. When war erupted in April 2023, production halted instantly and producers Giovanna Stopponi and Afifi redirected the remaining budget to evacuate the four Sudanese filmmakers to Kenya.\n\n\tWhat might have ended the film instead became its turning point. With the support of DOCUBOX Kenya, the filmmakers found refuge in Nairobi. Determined to continue the film, the team began the painstaking task of locating and extracting their participants Khadmallah, Majdi, Lokain, Wilson, and Jawad from a city at war, navigating treacherous routes and months of uncertainty until eventually reuniting everyone in East Africa.\n\t\n\n\tSince premiering at Sundance and screening at Berlinale, followed by engagements at Bertha DocHouse London and Edinburgh Filmhouse, “Khartoum” has been recognized for both its emotional force and its ambition. Its arrival at Doha’s inaugural festival positions the film at the center of an unprecedented celebration of Sudanese culture, a program that extends beyond cinema to music and art.\n\n\tFor co-director Brahim “Snoopy” Ahmad, whose own displacement echoes that of the film’s subjects, Doha’s focus carries a meaning that transcends the film’s festival trajectory. It is a rare moment when Sudanese filmmakers are invited to define their own narrative in a regional platform carving out space for their voices. In conversation with Variety, Ahmad reflects on collective authorship, the ethics of documenting trauma and the urgency of telling Sudan’s story from within, even when the filmmakers themselves can no longer return home.\n\n\tHow did “Khartoum” begin, and what first drew you to this story?\n\n\tIt actually started as a collaboration between Native Voice Films and Sudan Film Factory. They put out an open call for emerging filmmakers to submit ideas around a specific theme: telling stories about Khartoum in a poetic way.\n\n\tWe all applied, we got selected, and then we went through workshops to develop the stories and figure out how five different narratives could live inside one film. It’s not just five shorts back-to-back, so we had to find a way to intertwine them harmoniously, so it feels like one cinematic experience instead of a compilation.\n\n\tWe started shooting around October 2022 and kept going into early 2023. Then the producers and editor in London felt there were gaps, so we planned additional shoots for the end of April. The war broke out on April 15. Overnight, everything stopped and everyone was displaced. We couldn’t even find each other for a while.\n\n\tHow did the production survive that shock?\n\n\tWhen the war started, the producers were trying to locate us, checking if we were okay, seeing what support they could give. Eventually I relocated to Kenya with our production manager. Then the producers asked, “Could Nairobi be a place to continue the film? To reassemble the team?”\n\n\tNairobi felt calm, vibey, like a place where we could breathe again. So slowly they brought the other directors out of Khartoum to join us. Once we were together, we had hard conversations: Do we finish this film? Do we change it? What does it mean now?\n\t\n\n\tWe decided we had to finish it because of the war, not in spite of it. It felt like a responsibility, a form of advocacy, because there wasn’t enough media coverage of what was happening in Sudan. In those first days I was filming for European TV, running around with a camera, and I realized cinema might be one of the few ways to explain what we’re going through in a deeper way.\n\n\tThe next challenge was: our characters were scattered too. So we started helping them get out of Khartoum and into Nairobi. Only once we were all in the same city again could we ask, “Okay, what story are we telling now?”\n\n\tThe film has five directors, which is unusual for a feature. What appealed to you about that collective approach?\n\n\tThe original idea was to show people living in Khartoum across very different social classes. Each director brought a distinct vision through the person they followed: from kids collecting bottles on the street, with no stable education and histories of displacement, all the way up to Majdi, a civil servant working in a secure government job.\n\n\tHonestly, someone like Majdi is not from my usual world. I’m always on the street, so I know that level very well. But people like him, we see them, we don’t really know them.\n\n\tPeople assume five directors means constant fights. Of course you have disagreements, and sometimes you have to step back from your “million-dollar idea” because, at the end of the day, it’s a team sport. When a team wins, the whole team wins, not one star player.\n\n\tWhat helped is that I already knew all the other directors and had worked with them on shorts and videos before. That created a sense of camaraderie and safety. We weren’t starting from zero trust.\n\n\tYou’re filming people who’ve gone through extreme trauma. What were the toughest challenges for you on set?\n\n\tFrom a logistics point of view, I don’t want to dramatize it too much. When you have experience and you prepare for what can go wrong, you hit fewer surprises.\n\n\tThe real challenge was emotional: how do we get these stories from our participants without re-traumatizing them? We had hours and hours of interviews, and we were always on standby. If someone started to feel overwhelmed, panic, sadness, any sign they were going back to a difficult moment, we’d hit what we called the “emergency button.” We’d stop filming, hug them, move to a safe space, remind them, “You’re here with us now. You’re not there anymore.”\n\t\n\n\tThe city of Khartoum almost feels like a character in the film. What did you want audiences to understand about it, beyond the headlines?\n\n\tWhenever a city is destroyed, people remember it only as a city that was destroyed, the numbers of people that died, all of the rubble and the destruction. But every city has a soul, a culture. We wanted to archive that soul.\n\n\tWe were lucky to start filming before the war, when the city was still alive: Sufi rituals, coffee stalls on Nile Street, all those everyday events are what make Khartoum unique, what bring people together.\n\n\tOf course, you can’t only show the beauty of the past and ignore the present. It’s not just memory, it’s the living condition. So the film holds both the destruction and what existed before. You see what has been lost, but you also understand what people are fighting to get back.\n\n\tThe film is full of hardship, but also moments of hope and humor. How did you find that balance?\n\n\tWe always focused on the human side. Humans don’t live only in tragedy, right? Even in the darkest times we have jokes, dreams, small joys. Those moments are what keep you going. When you lose hope, there’s nothing left to wait for.\n\n\tWe weren’t trying to give a fake hope. History shows that wars end, cities come back to life in some form. It might not be exactly the same, maybe less, maybe more, but there is a future.\n\n\tFor Sudanese people in the diaspora, what they miss most is the texture of Khartoum: the smell of rain, watering your backyard, coffee with family, eating together. By showing that, we’re saying: “This can exist again. We can go home.” That’s also our personal wish.\n\n\t“Khartoum” has already screened at Sundance and Berlin. What surprised you about the reaction from international audiences?\n\n\tHonestly, the size of the reception. Sudan rarely makes international headlines, and when it does, it’s usually overshadowed by “bigger” conflicts. So we didn’t expect packed screenings every time, but that’s what’s been happening.\n\n\tPeople are showing up and really engaging with Sudan. I’m not saying our film alone changed the media landscape, but I do think it shook something. It gave people a clear, emotional explanation of what Sudan has been through in the last 30 years, both politically and in everyday life.\n\t\n\n\tHave you been able to show the film to Sudanese audiences?\n\n\tYes, absolutely. In Nairobi, in Berlin, and in different cities where there are Sudanese communities. Wherever we have a screening, I try to make sure Sudanese people are in the room. I’ll post online, reach out to friends, and then they bring their friends, and it becomes a community event.\n\n\tThe reaction is always very emotional. People cry a lot. Even if they haven’t personally lived through war, many have left Sudan to study or work. Before, they always had the option of going home if things got too hard. Now that option is not so simple.\n\n\tThe film reconnects them with Khartoum, the city itself, the feeling of it. After the screenings, they often tell us it’s a powerful, deep film, but you can tell they still have so much more inside that they can’t even put into words yet.\n\n\tDoha Film Festival is giving Sudanese cinema and music a major spotlight this year. What does it mean for you to be part of that showcase?\n\n\tWhen I saw the DFF program and realized it wasn’t just our film and other films, it’s also Sudanese music, a whole dedicated Sudanese focus, I felt real joy.\n\n\tAs a filmmaker, of course I want my film to be seen. But to see music, art, all these other parts of Sudanese culture getting space too? That makes me proud. It means someone actually cares enough about Sudan to dedicate a whole section to it at a festival.\n\n\tI’ve been to festivals that have small Sudan programs, or a human-rights sidebar. But a big regional festival like Doha building a full, visible platform for Sudan, I haven’t really seen that before.\n\n\tAnd what does it mean that this focus is happening in the region, not just in Europe or North America?\n\n\tThis is our neighborhood. As much as I want the wider world to connect with us, it’s crucial that countries around us understand what’s happening because these are the places where we’re displaced the most.\n\n\tI want people in the SWANA region (Southwest Asia and North Africa, used as a decolonial alternative to MENA) to realize displacement isn’t a choice. Staying home can mean risking your life, your health, everything. The moment it’s truly safe, we’ll go back.\n\n\tYou can be impressed by the roads, the buildings, and the malls in other countries. But after a while you realize: this isn’t life for you. Life is the community, the shared meals, the familiar smells and sounds. That’s what we’ve lost, and that’s what we want our neighbors to understand.\n\t\n\n\tWhat do you hope the film’s festival run leads to?\n\n\tThe film is already traveling nicely in Europe, across the SWANA region, in Africa. I’d love for it to reach Latin America too, because there are so many parallels there like guerrilla warfare, resistance movements, dictatorships, people pushing back.\n\n\tI don’t care if it’s on the biggest streaming platform or a smaller regional one. I just want “Khartoum” to be accessible in different parts of the world so people can get to know Sudan properly, through a film made by Sudanese filmmakers.\n\n\tWestern media has often misrepresented Sudan with its own agenda. A film like ours won’t be a perfect, objective portrait, nothing is, but it’s at least a depiction from the inside.\n\n\tAnd what do you hope “Khartoum” does for Sudanese cinema?\n\n\tI hope it inspires people. It’s not every day that a bunch of young Sudanese filmmakers make a film together and take it around the world.\n\n\tMy personal approach is to inspire by example: work hard, stay humble, and trust that it will pay off, even if it takes time. Making cinema in Sudan is extremely hard. There is no real industry. You’re building everything from scratch.\n\n\tSo as much as we want to keep making films, we also want to light a spark in others, to show that it is possible, and that their stories are worth telling.\n",

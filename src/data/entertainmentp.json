    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tLululemon has teamed up with the NFL for its first-ever officially licensed apparel collection, marking the retailer’s entry into professional sports merchandising.\n\n\tThe collection, which officially launches  Oct. 28, spans all 32 NFL teams and includes men’s and women’s apparel and accessories featuring signature team marks. Fans can shop the assortment on NFLShop.com, Fanatics.com, team retail locations and at stadium stores. It will be available internationally through local NFL Shop sites.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tDeveloped in partnership with Fanatics, the drop reimagines signature Lululemon styles like the men’s Steady State franchise and women’s Define, Scuba and Align collections through the lens of team pride. The result is a hybrid of fan gear and lifestyle fashion in an era when game-day apparel doubles as everyday wear.\n\n\t“Together with Fanatics, we are introducing an elevated collection that redefines modern fan apparel and is uniquely designed for everyday comfort,” Renie Anderson, executive vice president and chief revenue officer at the NFL, said in a statement. Celeste Burgoyne, president of the Americas and global guest innovation at Lululemon, added, “True NFL fans wear their pride. For them, fan gear is more than apparel — it’s a badge of loyalty and a way to instantly connect with a community that is like a family.”\n\n\tTo celebrate the launch, the brands rolled out a “Welcome to the Fam Club” campaign featuring NFL legends Joe Montana, Nick Foles, Ryan Clark and Emmanuel Acho alongside their families.\n\n\tFor Lululemon, long known for its yoga roots and premium athleisure, the partnership represents a bold expansion into licensed sportswear. The deal arrives as the company seeks to diversify its consumer base and tap into the lucrative fan-merch market.

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tBarbie is once again partnering with Stevie Nicks in their latest celebrity doll release. The Mattel toy brand’s first collaboration with the rock legend was in 2023, with a doll inspired by Fleetwood Mac’s 1977 album “  Now, in time with Nicks’ ongoing solo tour, Barbie has unveiled the Stevie Nicks Bella Donna doll.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTogether, Barbie and Nicks pay homage to the 43rd anniversary of “Bella Donna,” the rock and roll legend’s debut solo album, capturing the iconic style and spirit of Nicks. The tribute serves as a powerful reminder to follow the beat of your own drum, trust in your unique talent and embrace your individuality with confidence.\n\n\n\t“I’m so honored to be part of the Barbie universe once again,” Nicks said in a statement .”As I return to the stage and reflect on the release of Bella Donna, my very first solo album, I’m reminded of the courage it took to step into the unknown and discover my voice as a solo artist. My Stevie Nicks Bella Donna Barbie is more than a doll – she symbolizes my musical journey, and the strength that comes from staying true to yourself. My hope is that she inspires fans, and especially young dreamers, to take that leap of faith and believe in their limitless potential.”\n\n\tFollowing a tour last year and a series of performances in North America and Europe — including “Saturday Night Live” — the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer is back on the road for a slate of dates through mid-November.

    "body": "\n\tJason Kelce and Garage Beer have teamed up with the upcoming “Predator: Badlands” film for a new short titled “Thermal Buzz.”\n\n\tMade in collaboration with 20th Century Studios and the latest “Predator” installment — coming to theaters Nov. 7 — “Thermal Buzz” is Kelce’s homage to the original 1987 “Predator” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the trailer, Kelce and former Philadelphia Eagles player Beau Allen sport head-to-toe camo as they face off against Predators in the jungle and, of course, enjoy some refreshing Garage Beer.\n\t\n\n\t“Thermal Buzz” was directed by Jordan Phoenix and filmed outside of Orlando. In addition to Kelce and Allen, the 11-minute film features pro wrestler Matt Cardona. The full short will debut on Friday, but fans can now check out the trailer as well as the 30-second ad that played during commercial breaks of select NFL games on Sunday viaYouTube and Garage Beer’s socials.\n\n\t“As a ’90s kid, there’s nothing I loved more than a good action movie,” Kelce said in a statement. “In my mind, it’s hard to find a movie more iconic than ‘Predator.’ From the memes to the epic quotes, nothing compares in terms of action-packed entertainment. We’re just pumped that our short film can be part of the moment; I can’t wait to see ‘Predator: Badlands.'”\n\n\t“Thermal Buzz” is Kelce and Garage Beer’s third short film, following “Brewmite II,” in which he and brother Travis Kelce went head-to-head with MMA superstar Chuck Liddell, and the original “Brewmite.”\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Thermal Buzz” below.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“America,” the latest short film from award-winning Brazilian director Aly Muritiba, has released its first trailer.\n\n\tThe 22-minute short, which marks Muritiba’s English-language debut, stars Cheyenne Jackson (“American Horror Story,” “Behind the Candelabra”) and model and TV host Luca Castellani. \n\n\t“A tender and cinematic exploration of love, identity and belonging, ‘America’ follows Tom (Castellani), a young Brazilian immigrant in search of the American dream, and Josh (Jackson), a writer chasing his next story,” the short’s official synopsis reads. “When their paths cross, an unexpected romance blossoms, until an encounter with an ICE police officer changes everything.”\n\t\n\n\tThe trailer shows the beginnings of Tom and Josh’s love story, set against the backdrop of ICE raids in Los Angeles. “They’re not gonna find you,” Josh tells Tom as he grows increasingly concerned for his safety. The clip ends with a tense scene of Tom yelling “Josh!” as he runs for his life. \n\n\tMuritiba has been recognized at the Cannes, Sundance and Venice film festivals, and his 2013 short “The Factory” made that year’s Oscar shortlist. He directed “The Evandro Case,” a true-crime series that scored nominations at the International Emmy Awards, and his feature “Private Desert” was Brazil’s Oscar submission in 2022. His other credits include “Rust” (2018), “Tarantula” (2015) and episodes of HBO’s “The Hypnotizer,” Netflix’s “Brotherhood,” Globo’s “Jailers,” “Cangaço Novo” at Amazon Prime Video and more. \n\n\t“America” was produced by Castellani, Eric Michael Kochmer and Nate Lipp under Muritiba Filmes, Cinesthesia Factory and Aspen Studios.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “America” below.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“What do we do, Wanda?”\n\n\tWanda Sykes is onstage at the Chevalier Theatre in Medford, Massachusetts, launching into her newest material about the Trump administration, when a woman in the balcony shouts this earnest plea.\n\n\t“Pray and speak up,” Sykes responds, and the audience roars. It’s the advice they expected, and what Sykes thinks they need to hear. “I don’t know if they want me to tell them what to do,” Sykes muses the next morning, recovering from a late night at a Boston casino with a plate of eggs and a mug of green tea. “They want some relief. They want someone to tell them, ‘No, you’re not crazy.’ That’s what I give people.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSami Drasin for Variety Magazine\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOf course, if they are crazy, she’ll tell them so. Onstage, Sykes gets more I-love-you’s than Obama in ’08. “That’s exactly what we need more of!” she calls back, until the repetitive cries start to interrupt her flow. “I love you. Now shut the fuck up!”\n\n\tAt 61, Sykes calls herself “blessed to be in a position where I get asked, ‘What do you want to do?’” Right now, that’s live comedy: Her current tour, titled “Please & Thank You,” began in March 2024 and runs through March 2026. “Stand-up is the hardest thing I do,” she says, but it’s also her first love. While working a day job at the National Security Agency after college, Sykes spent nights and weekends telling jokes, eventually nabbing a gig opening for Chris Rock. She joined his mid-’90s “Bring the Pain” tour for just one weekend, but she made an impression. “You’re funny — I’m gonna look for you,” she remembers him saying. Soon after, she got a career-changing call.\n\t\n\n\t“Everything started for me with ‘The Chris Rock Show,’” Sykes says. Her work on the writing staff of the late-night series, plus her occasional screen time, opened new doors: comedy specials, movie roles, even her own spot in late night. “I don’t miss that. I had too much on my plate,” she says of “The Wanda Sykes Show,” which Fox canceled in 2010 after one season. But she’s proud of it all. “I can’t think of anything that’s like, ‘God, why did I do that?’ Maybe ‘Pootie Tang’ — but people love ‘Pootie Tang,’” she says, chortling.\n\n\tIn 2009, during Obama’s first term, Sykes became the first Black woman and the first openly queer person to headline the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. “When I got the call, the first thing I said to my publicist was ‘They know I’m gay, right?’ Because they were doing a horrible job of vetting people in his administration. I was like, ‘He knows?’ She was like, ‘Yes, everybody knows.’” Later that year, HBO released “I’ma Be Me,” her comedy special that she says “took me to another level. People were like, ‘Pay attention to what she’s doing.’”\n\n\tThey’ve paid attention ever since. A look through Sykes’ recent press tours reveals her as your favorite cultural commentator’s favorite cultural commentator; prominent liberal voices like Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel regularly seek out her thoughts on the state of the world. And in a moment when several of Sykes’ contemporaries, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Burr, spout off hot takes about the industry and what can and cannot be done “these days,” Sykes offers an alternate point of view.\n\n\t“I’ve never been one to pontificate about comedy,” she says. “When I hang around comedians and they’re all really into talking about comedy, I’m like, ‘Just go tell your jokes.’ I’m not a yapper.”\n\n\tThat may be true, but she doesn’t hold back either.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve said that your tour title, “Please & Thank You,” is about wanting our culture to return to civility. What does that actually look like?\t\n\n\tEven that has changed. I was like, “That’s the basics. That’s square one.” I was trying to say, “Can we hit the reset and just get back to that?”\n\t\n\t\tYou wouldn’t call it that today?\t\n\n\tProbably not. But we got the tour jacket. The posters are up, so we gotta stick with it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDo you interact much with Trump supporters?\t\n\n\tI have friends who are — I mean, they’re Republican. But yeah, they voted for him, so I guess they are Trump supporters. But it’s best not to talk. We don’t bring it up.\n\t\n\t\tYou were supposed to be on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the night ABC pulled it from the air. Tell me the story of that day.\t\n\n\tI was doing some last-minute makeup. My publicist called and said he’d been preempted, and they didn’t know when he would come back. I was like, “Well, what did he say?” I was texting with him. A lot of people work on that show. Jimmy was like, “I have a lot of people to protect.” It was a real — I don’t want to say a wake-up call, because we were aware of how bad things were. But this is crazy now. I still don’t see how what he said was outlandish or hurtful.\n\t\n\t\tHas it made you think twice about the things you say onstage about Trump?\t\n\n\tYou can’t really censor yourself like that and give people a good show. I can’t. So I don’t.\n\t\n\t\tThe Kimmel situation has recirculated conversations about “cancel culture.” What’s your relationship to that term?\t\n\n\tBefore, it was just a bunch of people who were upset that they couldn’t say stuff that they wanted to say. Well, what is it that you want to say? Because you can say anything that you want, but you got to deal with the fallout when people say, “Hey, we don’t like what you said,” and stop buying your tickets. But what happened to Jimmy, that’s real. People online are losing their jobs for stuff they post. It’s not about what a comic says — now, the guy who works at the post office says something on Facebook, and people jump all over him and want that person fired. So now it applies to everybody.\n\t\n\t\tIs there any truth to it when established comedians say they wouldn’t be allowed now to make the jokes they used to?\t\n\n\tAgain, you can say whatever you want to say, but I want to know: What is it that you want to say? What is it? What’s the problem? You want to say it — just say it! I don’t get it.\n\t\n\t\tWhat did you think about the American comedians who performed at the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia?\t\n\n\tI’m sure it was a nice paycheck. And hey, these comics feel comfortable going there. I wouldn’t. I’m a Black gay woman. I have no business there; I wouldn’t feel comfortable with the treatment of the LGBT. But then again, I think Jessica [Kirson] went, and said she was gonna talk about being a lesbian. I guess that worked for her. But I wouldn’t.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tShe later apologized and donated her profits. And Atsuko Okatsuka shared that the Riyadh contract required comics not to criticize the Saudi government.\t\n\n\tTo me, that’s anti-comedy. If you complain about cancel culture, but then you go and take money to not say things, I mean …\n\t\n\t\tYou’re at a significant moment in your career with the final season of “The Upshaws” coming to Netflix in early 2026. As co-creator and star, how has it felt to say goodbye to your character, Lucretia, and the show?\t\n\n\tIt was pretty cool seeing the kids grow up, and I think people will be happy with the way we wrapped everything up. With Lucretia, we wanted her to put herself first. Her whole thing had been taking care of her sister [Regina, played by Kim Fields] and making sure the family was OK. It was nice getting her to a place where she had to make a decision about “This is something I really want for myself.”\n\t\n\t\tLucretia’s disability is rarely a topic of conversation on the show, but it’s visible because she uses a cane. What’s the story behind that?\t\n\n\tI just know so many families where the one relative who’s well off, it happened because of some accident. So I wanted to show that. She has money, but she got it from a lawsuit.\n\t\n\t\tWhy did you decide to make your character straight?\t\n\n\tWe knew we wanted one of the kids to be queer, and for Bennie [Mike Epps] to have to deal with it. So if Lucretia was gay, that takes away [the surprise he feels]. Hopefully, it will help somebody, seeing how that guy can love his son and stand up for him. He was still uncomfortable with it, and that’s OK, but he showed up for his son.\n\t\n\t\tHad you been wanting to try acting in a drama before you joined the upcoming indie movie “Undercard”?\t\n\n\tI wasn’t looking for it. The director-writer, Tamika Miller, reached out to me, and she was so confident I could do it that it made me go, “OK, yeah.” I just really like the story: a former boxer whose career ended with drugs and alcohol. Now she’s a trainer, and she gave her son up when he was very young. It’s about trying to reconnect, overcoming her demons — but it’s not perfect. It’s still messy.\n\t\n\t\t“The Chris Rock Show” launched your career. What did being in your first writers’ room teach you?\t\n\n\tChris is very generous. I remember writing a sketch and I said, “Your lines are too straight. I gotta add some jokes for you.” He goes, “It doesn’t matter who’s saying them — if it’s ‘The Chris Rock Show,’ they’re my jokes.” I’ve been in situations where another person, if it’s their show, they usually take the best jokes. But he wasn’t like that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou hosted the Oscars in 2022, which is usually a career highlight for a comedian.\t\n\n\tI forgot about that.\n\t\n\t\tYour work got overshadowed when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock.\t\n\n\tMm-hmm.\n\t\n\t\tDo you still celebrate that night as an achievement? Or is the memory soured?\t\n\n\tI mean, I loved working with Regina [Hall] and Amy [Schumer]. But like you said, it got overshadowed. People talk to me about that night without even mentioning, “Oh yeah, you hosted, right?” Like I was in the audience or at home, watching TV. But I was there.\n\t\n\t\tAfter Smith publicly apologized to Rock, you once said that he hadn’t apologized to you. Did he ever end up reaching out?\t\n\n\tHe did. He called. I had COVID or a bad cold. I just texted to say, “Hey, I got your message. Thank you. I can’t talk.” But he did call.\n\t\n\t\t“Monster-in-Law” was one of your first big acting roles. Any favorite memories from that set?\t\n\n\tJane [Fonda] was the best. One time, she came to my house, and the kids were 1 or 2. She had these big boxes, and she built tunnels and was crawling through them with the kids. She’s amazing.\n\t\n\t\tWhat kinds of offers are you getting these days?\t\n\n\tUsually, people write things with me in mind. Sometimes the character’s even named Wanda. I’m like, “Come on, guys. Let’s stretch a little.”\n\t\n\t\tWhat advice would you give people trying to break into comedy right now? What advice do you wish you had at the start of your career?\t\n\n\tIt’s funny. I look at my path and I go, “If somebody had given me advice, would I have listened?” Some comedians go to a class to learn how to do stand-up. But I automatically go, “I bet 100 bucks this person is not funny at all.” It’s not something that you can learn. I think you have it, or you don’t.\n\n\t\n\t\tCharity Spotlight: The Ruth Ellis Center\t\n\n\tThe Ruth Ellis Center is a Detroit area nonprofit that offers housing and resources to homeless, runaway and at-risk queer youth. In 2022, the organization opened a 44,000-square-foot facility, complete with apartments, a library, an art studio and more. Its new home is a huge improvement from when Wanda Sykes first visited 15 years ago — in part because of her efforts.\n\n\t“I was doing a show in Detroit, and one of the administrators there reached out and asked if I would come by and say hello to the kids. It was this shady-looking building on the corner — I had my security with me on the visit,” she recalls. \n\n\tWhen Sykes arrived, she joined a group of young people sitting in a circle of chairs. “The kids expressed how much that place meant to them — and you could see it.” Their stories still get to her. “Remember,” she says, “this is the Midwest. It gets cold. Imagine you’re a kid, and you’re kicked out of your house just because of who you are. Immediately I was like, ‘I’m on board. What do y’all need? What can I do?’” \n\t\n\n\t“One of the young boys, Frank, is now a man,” she says, speaking of a Ruth Ellis Center client who later became one of its administrators. Getting to witness the growth of individual community members reminds Sykes why she’s been fundraising for the center all these years. “Coming through the center, they prepared him for life. And now,” she says with a smile, “he’s doing great.”\n\n\t\n\t\tStyling: Susan Cho; Hair: Larry Sims/Forward Artists; MU: Tammy Yi/Tracey Mattingly Agency; Top and pants: LAPOINTE; Shoes: Gucci; Jewelry: XIV Karats \t\n",

    "body": "\n\tTonislav Hristov takes on fake news in doc “Truth or Dare” – and the people influencing voters in Bulgaria. \n\n\t“Some go: ‘No one cares. No one cares if a person claims ‘the Earth is flat’ because it doesn’t affect my life.’ But at the end of the day, those behind it don’t believe in democracy. I’ve lived through communism and believe me – there is a difference,” he says. \n\n\n\t“When all of a sudden you have people in the parliament who are anti-vaccine and pro-Russia, it affects your life. In Bulgaria, fake news certainly influenced voting turnout.”\n\t\n\n\tHristov, based between Bulgaria and Finland, often uses his outsider-ish status to look at certain issues with fresh eyes. “It’s a comfortable position. I can stand on the viewer’s side,” he admits.  \n\n\tAlready behind Berlinale awardee “The Magic Life of V” and “The Good Postman” – he’s also co-produced Ji.hlava opener “Virtual Girlfriends” – he is now developing a music documentary about Finnish rock band The Rasmus, best known for hit song “In the Shadows.”\n\n\t“I’ve been following them for some time. It’s going to be a story of the band, about where they are and where they’ve been, their ups and downs,” he says. \n\n\t“Musicians want to keep their image intact [in music docs], which I understand, but I already know them. They are good people and honest about their feelings, which Finns usually are.”\n\n\tBefore making “Truth or Dare,” he first came across fake news spreaders around the 2020 US presidential election. \n\t\n\n\t“I interviewed some Macedonian guys who were doing this. They were in their 20s, suddenly making a lot of money. They were hired by a U.S. political party and the moment the election was over, so was the job.”\n\n\tAccording to multiple outlets, including the BBC, North Macedonia saw a surge of fake news directed at U.S. readers. One of its secrets? Coming up with a lie so outrageous no one will question it. \n\n\t“You see it and think: ‘Come on, no one is kidnapping your child,’ but then they talk about family and kids, and it starts building up [Hristov refers to the ‘Save the Children’ conspiracy theory]. Political parties use it to divide people, because that’s how they win elections.” \n\n\tIn the doc – shown at Ji.hlava Intl. Film Festival – he follows “both sides”: experienced journalist Genka Shikerova, who finds herself under fire, and content creator Ivan spreading misinformation on his growing channels. \n\n\t“To be honest, I actually like him. He believes in these things. The difference between him and the Macedonians is that the Macedonians never cared – they just wanted to make money. He likes the attention, sure, but he also gets excited about the things he ‘discovers,’” says Hristov. \n\n\t“Ivan doesn’t realize he’s being used until after the elections. They discard you when you’re no longer of service. So I like him, but he’s like a child. I like my children too, but I don’t agree with their views on playing computer games.”\n\n\tHristov sees the story as “extremely personal.” \n\n\t“I have two boys and I’m trying to moderate what they access on their phones. But it’s actually the older generations who cannot distinguish what’s true and what’s fake.”\n\n\tAccording to Hristov and his research, most Bulgarians don’t watch news anymore – they get all their information online, and over 60% of them believe this information is the truth. “They know what to feed you and how to use you, and that’s why during the elections, all this money goes to Facebook or X [formerly Twitter],” he notes.  \n\n\t“As a journalist, you can’t reach these people anymore, because they don’t watch TV. Genka has fewer viewers than Ivan: a construction worker who at one point started believing that someone tries to control his destiny and he needs to fight back.”\n\t\n\n\tWhile the process seems irreversible, with Mark Zuckerberg announcing in January that Meta will end fact-checking and replace it with a “community notes” program – “They don’t want to take responsibility for moderating the content, because then you are losing customers.” \n\n\tHristov adds: “There’s this extremely important scene in the film where Genka is teaching kids. She says: ‘Look, the internet is wide open. You can find anything, but you have to be able to distinguish truth from a lie.’ The only way to do that is by education.” \n\n\t“It’s important to teach our kids – and our parents – that not everything online is true. And if you’re not sure about something, check it. That’s the only solution to the problems we have.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe anticipated spinoff of the French hit show “Call My Agent” is bound to have a glamorous flavor. \n\n\tAfter George Clooney, who broke the news while promoting “Jay Kelly” over the weekend that he’ll have a cameo in the Netflix original film, Variety has learned that Eva Longoria is in talks to appear in the movie which Mediawan is producing. \n\n\tNetflix declined to comment on Longoria’s casting, but confirmed Clooney’s involvement alongside a string of popular French actors, including Laurent Lafitte (“The Count of Monte Cristo”). As previously announced, Laetitia Casta (“Consent”) and Vincent Macaigne (“Irma Vep”) will also star.  \n\t\n\n\tThe feature, titled “Call My Agent (The Movie),” will also bring back the beloved cast of the International Emmy award-winning series, including Camille Cottin as the fearless and funny talent agent Andréa Martel, as well as Laure Calamy, Grégory Montel, Thibault de Montalembert, Nicolas Maury, Fanny Sidney, Liliane Rovère, Ophélia Kolb and Anne Marivin.\n\n\tThe series ended in 2020 with a bittersweet plot twist after four seasons, as Andréa retired from the industry to devote herself to family life, grieving over the fate of A.S.K., the talent agency she couldn’t save.\n\n\tThe film – penned by the series’ creator, writer and showrunner, Fanny Herrero — picks up five years later, and sees Andréa back in the business, but this time behind the camera, as an emerging director. But there’s still some drama involved, in typical Andrea style. “When she loses her lead actor just days before shooting starts, she has to bring her old team back together, sparking old friendships — and rivalries,” says the synopsis.\n\t\n\n\tMost of the French key cast of “Call My Agent” broke through thanks to their performances in the show and saw their careers take off. Cottin, for instance, has become one of France’s best-known actors who’s worked with international filmmakers such as Michael Mann (“Allied”), Ridley Scott (“House of Gucci”), Tom McCarthy (“Stillwater”) and showrunner Phoebe Waller-Bridge (“Killing Eve”). Calamy, meanwhile, won a Cesar Award for her role in “Antoinette dans les Cévennes” in 2020 and has since been nominated twice in the best actress category, in 2022 and 2023. \n\n\t“Call My Agent” has also become a cultural phenomenon, sparking local versions in a number of countries with top talent attached, including the U.K., Spain, Italy, Germany, South Korea, Indonesia, the Middle East, Philippines, Malaysia and Poland.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Mediawan-owned Mon Voisin Productions and Mother Production, with the participation of French broadcaster France Télévisions. The latter initially co-developed and commissioned the series in 2015, before Netflix came on board.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMilly Alcock found out she’d booked the coveted role of Supergirl in one of this year’s biggest hits when “Superman” director (and co-CEO of DC Studios) texted her a link to an article announcing her casting. She admitted she had a moment of doubt. “My first thought was: What have I done?” Alcock told a packed audience at the Newport Beach Film Festival. “It’s just scary.” But she enjoyed her cameo in “Superman” and went on to shoot her own film, “Supergirl,” set to be released next year. “I’ve learned a lot from it, and it’s such an honor to play her and be that person for young girls.”\n\t\n\n\tAlcock was one of this year’s class of Variety’s 10 Actors to Watch, an annual honor that’s been bestowed since 1998. Past recipients include more than 30 Oscar nominees and winners, including Octavia Spencer, Brie Larson and Timothée Chalamet. All 10 were present at the festival’s Honors Brunch, where awards were also presented to actors like Brendan Fraser, Mark Hamill and Diane Lane. Scarlett Johansson, who recently made her feature directorial debut with “Eleanor the Great,” was honored with Variety’s Groundbreakers and Legends Award. And Steven Gaydos, who recently retired from Variety after over 30 years with the publication, was honored with the festival’s Arts Champion Award.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA – OCTOBER 19: Scarlett Johansson, recipient of the Variety Legend & Groundbreaker Award, speaks onstage during the Newport Beach Film Festival HONORS at The Balboa Bay Resort on October 19, 2025 in Newport Beach, California. (Photo by Tiffany Rose/Getty Images for Newport Beach Film Festival)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Newport Beach\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis year’s class of 10 Actors to Watch included several thespians making their film debuts: Miles Caton, the star of Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” Chase Infiniti from Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” and Guillaume Marbeck, who stars as Jean-Luc Godard in Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague.” Caton joked about how his life has changed since starring as Sammie, a guitarist so talented it attracts supernatural attention. While saying strangers have come up to him and called him Sammie, he noted, “I can still go out and have fun and chill and be with my family.”\n\t\n\n\tInfiniti’s film debut found her holding her own against heavyweights like Oscar winners Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro. “I took every single moment and I treated it like a Master Class,” Infiniti revealed. “I really wanted to make sure that I observed and I learned, and I was there every second of the way to watch what makes the greats great.”\n\n\tMany of this year’s class found themselves sharing scenes with major stars. In “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” Tonatiuh stars in his first leading film role – or roles, as he plays both a queer man in an Argentine prison and the Golden Era movie star whose film he escapes into. His costars include Jennifer Lopez and Diego Luna. When he won the role, the actor says he was ready. “It felt like it was the opportunity that I’ve been training for my entire life for and my mother immigrated here and worked at a drive-thru,” he said. “And to be in a cast with Jennifer and with Diego, and in a Bill Condon musical, all of that, it felt like I was getting invited to the Olympics.”\n\n\tHe added that his prisoner character, Molina, “is this beautiful, genderless expression” and that the film features an all-Latin cast. “And I feel like in a time where Latinos and LGBTQ people are being attacked, our film is saying: We love you, we see you and we’re going to give you the Hollywood treatment.”\n\n\tBritish thespian Jay Lycurgo finds himself starring opposite Cillian Murphy in “Steve,” now streaming on Netflix. The recent Oscar winner plays a troubled teacher at a school for young men with societal and behavioral issues. Lycurgo had a personal connection to the material – his father works a similar job. “Some of you may be struggling today with your mental health and for me, personally, I struggle every day with it,” Lycurgo revealed. “So I’m just very happy about the film, very passionate about it, and even more so that I get to tell my dad’s work.”Also sharing scenes with big names in upcoming films: Ella Anderson, who plays the daughter of Kate Hudson’s character in “Song Sung Blue,” the true story of a couple who form a Neil Diamond tribute band. The film, which also stars Hugh Jackman, comes out in December. Norwegian actor Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas plays the level-headed daughter of Stellan Skarsgård’s film director in Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” the follow-up to his Oscar-nominated “The Worst Person in the World.” And Edmund Donovan, an Obie and Drama Desk Award winner for his work in the play “Greater Clements,” finds himself playing an admirer of Willem Dafoe’s forgotten poet in “Late Fame.”\n\n\tMari Yamamoto will be seen later this year in “Rental Family,” starring Brendan Fraser, who visibly teared up as she talked about working with him. She told a story about shooting a scene on a precarious balcony in Japan and how even though he wasn’t on camera, he “wanted to be there for me so badly that he was leaning out.” She continued, “He’s just leaning out so much to put his face as close as he can to me, and he’s worried about that, but I’m worried about the Oscar winner falling from the balcony. That’s a story that tells you how he is as a person and an actor – that he will do anything to catch you if you fall, he will always be there for you. I learned that that’s how I want to be as a person and as an actor. So thank you, Brendan Fraser.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA – OCTOBER 19: (L-R) Marilou Hamill and Mark Hamill attend the Newport Beach Film Festival HONORS at The Balboa Bay Resort on October 19, 2025 in Newport Beach, California.

She had traveled to Basel, Switzerland, where she chose to end her life at Pegasos, a nonprofit clinic for assisted dying.\n      \n    \n          Jackie was based in NYC, where Medical Aid in Dying (MAID) isn’t legal -- and in the U.S. states where it is legal, patients have to be terminally ill, which she wasn’t. That’s why she traveled to Switzerland, where the law doesn’t require someone to be terminally ill.\n      \n\n          Important to note ... medical aid in dying isn’t the same as euthanasia. Euthanasia is illegal in the U.S., and that’s when a doctor gives the drugs. With medical aid, the patient takes the meds themselves.\n      \n    \n          Jackie recently told \"The New York Times\" that even though she was in good health, she felt ready to go -- explaining that after taking two falls in the past year, she never wanted to end up dependent on others.\n      \n    \n          Jackie was 95.\n      \n    \n          RIP\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

The BBQ platter, chicken yakisoba noodles, and a pistachio cream funnel cake are making a return.\n      \n    \n          Fans will need all the energy they can get ... as the series is tied at 1-1 following the first two games in the 6ix.\n      \n    \n          Perhaps those attending can get some to-go boxes for the rest of us??\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Food & Travel\n              \n                          \n                Los Angeles Dodgers\n              \n                          \n                Toronto Blue Jays\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                MLB\n              \n                          \n                Baseball\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tIn 2018, Iliza Shlesinger wrote down, “what if high school came back to bite you in the ass?” \n\n\tOver many, many rewrites, as well as several false starts and stops, that germ of an idea culminated in “Chasing Summer,” a comedy about a 30-something woman who returns to the Texas hometown she fled decades ago only to find herself embracing a summer of parties, menial jobs and carefree romance. That may sound like the premise of an Apatow-ian exercise in arrested development, but Shlesinger wasn’t interested in just landing punchlines. \n\t\n\n\t“I knew what I wanted,” Shlesinger said during a Zoom interview a week before “Chasing Summer’s” Sundance premiere. “I wanted to make a film. I wanted to make art. I thought it’s time to make something beautiful, not just a straightforward comedy, because this very easily could have been that, and I wanted it elevated.”\n\n\n\tTo realize her vision, Shlesinger turned to Josephine Decker, an indie filmmaker best known for moody thrillers and dramas such as “Shirley” and “Butter on the Latch.” It was an unconventional match, but there was something about Decker’s style that Shlesinger thought would be perfect for “Chasing Summer.” \n\n\t“This is the kind of movie that always speaks to me and that I want to be directing,” Decker said. “Instead, the things that get sent to me are like, serial killer movies. For some reason, the only things I ever get submitted are like this woman is murdered in the first three minutes.”\n\n\tShlesinger, who is a popular stand-up and sketch comic, wasn’t worried about delivering laughs. Working with Decker, she re-examined her script to make sure that the humor didn’t come at expense of exploring her character’s wounded heart. It helped that Decker, like Shlesinger, is also from Texas and had an innate understanding of the region, its idiom and its rhythm of life. When it came to casting the picture, they sought out people who could believably hail from the Lone Star state, such as Megan Mullally, an Oklahoma native who plays Shlesinger’s mom, and Garrett Wareing, the Texas-born “Ransom Canyon” star who plays her younger lover. \n\t\n\n\tIn “Chasing Summer,” Shlesinger’s character Jamie, is a humanitarian aid worker who is constantly jetting off to disaster areas around the world. But after she endures a messy breakup, she returns to her parent’s house to recover, spending her days working as a janitor at her sister’s skating rink. She also meets the 21-year-old Colby (Wareing) at a keg party, sparking a steamy affair. \n\n\t“What I wrote in the script is, like, ‘Jamie and Colby kiss and they fall out of frame,’ and I show up to set and Josephine is like, ‘okay, he’s going down on you and then the camera is going to pan over you both from behind,” Shlesinger jokes. \n\n\tThere is indeed a lot of sex in “Chasing Summer,” but Shlesinger and Decker were intent on staging the hookups in a way that would be sexy to women, as well as men. That meant making sure that the cinematography was beautiful, as well as sensual, instead of replicating what Shlesinger dismisses as “full ’90s Michael Douglas, Skinemax.”\n\n\t“Josephine, was putting this through a female gaze and thinking about, what do we want to see as women?” Shlesinger said. “What’s the kind of intimacy that we want? How do we want to feel? We wanted this to be beautiful for women to enjoy it. She could just stand there for six seconds and a guy’s gonna enjoy it.”\n\n\tThat meant having the scenes last longer than they might in a more conventional romance, something that divided audiences down gender lines during a recent test screening. \n\n\t“I made them so long,” Decker says. “We did a screening for 30 or 40, people to just see how everything was landing in early December. And it was so funny, because some guy was like, ‘I don’t know, these sex scenes feel a little long.’ And literally, all of the women there rose up and were like, ‘sit down! They’re perfect!”\n\n\tDecker and Shlesinger also relied on intimacy coordinators. \n\n\t“The coordinator created an emotional safety net and worked so closely with the actors who are going to be having sex scenes to talk about consent and comfort,” Decker said. “It’s kind of like having a fight coordinator who makes your action scene cooler and more interesting. It just deepened the storytelling.” \n\n\t“Chasing Summer” is one of many films at Sundance looking for distribution, and though the filmmakers insist they just want it to find a good home, you get the sense they’d prefer for it to be seen with as big a crowd as possible. \n\t\n\n\t“I mean the best way to answer that is we want to make a lot of money, and we want a lot of people to see this,” Shlesinger said. “Hopefully people feel the same way when they watch it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSir Rod Stewart once counted himself a friend of President Donald J. Trump, but that is being pushed even further back into the past now that the pop superstar has slammed him as a “draft dodger” in a video statement condemning the president’s disparaging remarks about the courage of NATO troops.\n\n\tIn the Instagram clip, Stewart adds his voice to the chorus of Brits expressing outrage at Trump for “unbearable” and “disgraceful” remarks about NATO troops, in which the president suggested that European allies held back from being on the front lines during the Afghanistan conflict, leaving the true bravery to American troops. And he calls on the U.K.’s leaders to demand an apology from Trump for what he considers an insult to fallen soldiers.\n\t\n\n\t“Hi there. I may just be a humble rock star. I’m also a knight of the realm, and I have my opinions,” Stewart begins, standing in formal dress in a stately living room. “I was born just after the war [World War II], and have great respect for our armed forces that fought and gave us our freedom. So, it hurts me badly, deeply, when I read that the draft dodger Trump has criticized our troops in Afghanistan for not being on the front line.”\n\n\n\tStewart continues, “We lost over 400 of our guys. Think of their parents. Think about it! And Trump calls ’em almost like cowards. It’s unbearable. So I’m calling on you, Prime Minister [Keir] Starmer and [Reform UK leader Nigel] Farage. Please, make the draft dodger Trump apologize, please.” \n\n\tWith that, the singer then gives the camera a salute before walking off-camera. In Stewart’s final moments on-screen, messages are flashed on the screen, including “We shall never forget,” “So disrespectful,” “Honor them,” “Disgraceful,” “Take a stand” and “Thank you.”\n\t\n\n\n\tThe fury directed at Trump and other Brits is in response to an interview Trump gave to Fox News in Davos on Thursday, where his seemingly offhand remarks generated shocked international headlines. In the Fox interview, the president said of NATO: “We’ve never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them… You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did ‚ they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.”\n\n\tIn Afghanistan, 457 British troops were killed, second only to the U.S. soldiers who fell.\n\n\tPrime Minister Starmer has been among those speaking out against Trump’s disparagement of the allies’ contributions. “I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “There were many also who were injured, some with life-changing injuries. I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling, and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\n\tWhile he did not quite fulfill Stewart’s demand that the U.K. formally request an apology from Trump — a president who famously does not do apologies — the prime minister made it clear he thought one was in order. “If I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologize,” Starmer said, in response to a question about whether the U.S. president should be penitent about the insult.\n\n\tPrince Harry — who did two tours of duty in Afghanistan as an Army Air Corps co-pilot gunner — also responded to Trump, while not referring to the president by name.\n\n\t“In 2001, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first — and only — time in history,” said Harry. “It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call. I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there. The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed. Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace.”\n\n\tAnger about Trump’s remarks crossed party lines in Britain. Reform U.K. leader Nigel Farage, the Trump ally who was among those Stewart said should demand an apology, said on social media: “Donald Trump is wrong.” Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch had stronger words, calling Trump’s knocking of NATO troops’ efforts “flat-out nonsense… British, Canadian, and NATO troops fought and died alongside the US for 20 years. This is a fact, not opinion. Their sacrifice deserves respect, not denigration.”\n\t\n\n\tStewart had been critical of Trump’s seeming lack of support for the allies before, saying in June 2024 that he “has moved away from Europe, as America were our strongest allies.” But referring to him twice as a “draft dodger” signaled a new level to the rocker’s upset with his neighbor and former friend.\n\n\tStewart is not exactly known as an arch left-winger. Last year, he spoke encouragingly of Trump’s ally in the U.K., saying to The Times, “We’re fed up with the Tories. We’ve got to give Farage a chance. He’s coming across well. What options have we got? I know some of his family. I know his brother, and I quite like him.”\n\n\tAs for his past relationship with the president, Stewart said last year, ““’m not a great fan of Trump. I knew him very, very well. I used to go to his house. I live literally half a mile away (in Florida)… We’re both on the beach. I used to go to his Christmas parties. He’s always been a bit of a man’s man. I liked him for that. But he didn’t, as far as I’m concerned, treat women very well. But since he became President, he became another guy. Somebody I didn’t know.”\n\n\tStewart has been critical in recent times of Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, calling the actions against Palestinians in Gaza “annihilation,” and supportive of Ukraine, flying that nation’s flag during performances during the song “Rhythm of My Heart.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“King,” the keenly anticipated next project from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, has locked its 2026 release date. \n\n\t“King” reunites Khan with his “Pathaan” director Siddharth Anand, marking the superstar’s first theatrical release in three years. The cast also includes Khan’s daughter Suhana Khan, Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Arshad Warsi and Rani Mukerji.\n\n\n\tWriters on the action thriller include include Sujoy Ghosh, Anand, Suresh Nair, Sagar Pandya and Abbas Tyrewala. The film is produced by Gauri Khan, Siddharth Anand and Mamta Anand for Red Chillies Entertainment and Marflix Pictures.\n\t\n\n\t“King” is due a Dec. 24 release. \n\n\tKhan, often referred to by his initials SRK, has been a dominant force in Bollywood since his breakthrough role in the 1993 thriller “Baazigar.” His charisma and versatility quickly established him as a leading man, with romantic comedies like “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (1995) cementing his status as Bollywood’s “King of Romance.”\n\n\tThroughout the ’90s and early 2000s, Khan’s star power seemed unstoppable. He delivered a string of box office hits, including “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai” (1998), “Devdas” (2002), and “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003). These films not only dominated the domestic market but also found significant audiences in the Indian diaspora, helping to expand Bollywood’s global footprint. Notably, his 1998 film “Dil Se” became the first Indian film to break into the U.K. box office top 10, signaling Bollywood’s growing international appeal.However, Khan’s career hasn’t been without its challenges. The mid-2010s saw a series of commercial disappointments, including “Fan” (2016), “Zero” (2018) and “Jab Harry Met Sejal” (2017). These setbacks led to speculation about whether the actor’s reign at the top was coming to an end.\n\t\n\n\tYet, true to form, Khan has demonstrated resilience. The year 2023 marked a triumphant return after a four-year hiatus with three major releases: “Pathaan,” “Jawan,” and “Dunki.” Both “Pathaan” and “Jawan” have joined the ranks of India’s all-time highest-grossing films, reaffirming Khan’s enduring appeal and his ability to evolve with changing audience tastes.\n\n\tIn 2024, Khan was accorded a career achievement award at the Locarno Film Festival. \n\n\t“King” is IMDb’s most anticipated Indian film of 2026. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tChhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnudev Sai presided over the foundation stone ceremony for Chitrotpala International Film City and Tribal & Cultural Convention Centre on Saturday, marking a significant infrastructure push for India‘s central state to position itself as a production destination.\n\n\tThe 95-acre first-phase development is being spearheaded by creator Tarun Rathi through Rajnandini Entertainment Ltd. and Indradeep Infra Ltd. The project is receiving support under the Special Assistance Scheme from India’s Ministry of Tourism, signaling central government backing for the facility positioned as the country’s first fully-equipped international film city.\n\t\n\n\tIndustry interest is already materializing, with early discussions reportedly exploring the venue as a potential shooting location for upcoming tentpoles including “Golmaal 5” and “Gadaar 3,” alongside other titles in pre-production stages.\n\n\n\tThe development extends beyond soundstages, incorporating exhibition and convention infrastructure through partnerships with India Exposition Mart Limited and the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts. IEML chair Rakesh Kumar and EPCH chair Neeraj Khanna are developing facilities including an exhibition center, convention hall, hotel, business showrooms and helipad, aimed at creating economic opportunities for local artisans and tribal communities.\n\n\tVeteran filmmaker Anil Sharma (the “Gadar” franchise) attended the ceremony, lending industry credibility to the state’s filmmaking ambitions.\n\n\tThe state government is committing INR150 crore $16.3 million in the initial phase, with subsequent funding of INR250–300 crore ($27.2 million to $32.7 million) earmarked for later development stages from the developers.\n\t\n\n\t“There has long been a demand from the people of the state for our own film city, which will help take stories from Chhattisgarh to global audiences,” Sai said at the event. “I am glad that the government is supporting this new world-class film city with INR150 crore in the first phase and INR250–300 crore in later phases. It should take us about two years to fully develop this dream project.”\n\n\tRathi emphasized the facility’s positioning as a turnkey production solution. “We are trying to support filmmakers with all possible equipment and a complete ecosystem so that producers and crews from Mumbai and across India can come to Raipur to shoot and execute everything seamlessly,” he said. “The accessibility and the shooting friendly environment will help the filmmakers from start to finish.”\n\n\tThe project represents Chhattisgarh’s bid to diversify India’s production geography beyond established hubs in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai, while leveraging the development to boost local employment in creative industries and related sectors.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following review contains mild spoilers.\n\n\tFor decades, the Motion Picture Association’s film ratings system — devised by the American studios to advise parents and avoid censorship — offered clear guidelines on whether the material contained in any given Hollywood release was appropriate for children. The organization was mostly concerned about sex and violence, though it also cautioned audiences about something vaguely described as “adult situations,” which young viewers might find overwhelming or otherwise difficult to process.\n\t\n\n\tThe standout of this year’s Sundance Film Festival competition, in terms of both audacity of subject and maturity of execution, “Josephine” is a movie in which the eponymous child (vulnerably embodied by newcomer Mason Reeves) is prematurely forced to deal with adult situations. Inspired by traumatic events in writer-director Beth de Araújo’s own childhood, it’s the story of an 8-year-old girl who witnesses something no child should see — a sexual assault between two strangers — and her ensuing struggle to make sense of a crime she can’t begin to comprehend.\n\n\n\tEarly one Sunday morning, while running through Golden Gate Park with her father (Channing Tatum), Josephine takes a wrong turn. From her spot on a hill, she happens to observe a strange man following a female jogger into one of the public bathrooms. Then come the screams. When the woman exits, her assailant throws her to the ground, rips off her clothes and overpowers her. Even (or perhaps especially) seen from a distance, the attack is disturbing to watch, and though the culprit is swiftly apprehended, thanks to the quick action of Josephine’s sporty dad, the damage is done.\n\t\n\n\t“Josephine” eventually builds to a big courtroom scene where its title character courageously agrees to testify, but de Araújo seems less concerned with the verdict (which the movie withholds) than she is with recognizing how the experience impacts Josephine, reshaping how she views the world going forward. Developed through the Sundance Labs, de Araújo’s second feature (following 2022’s stunning single-shot thriller “Soft & Quiet,” about white supremacists hiding in plain sight) fits the dominant theme of this year’s festival — coping with trauma — but does so in a psychologically complex way.\n\n\tAs Josephine’s mom (Gemma Chan) eventually tells her daughter, there’s no way to go through life without bad things happening: “It is your responsibility for you to fix your own pain,” she says, and in that advice,\n\n\tIt may sound strange to use the word “subtle” to describe a film that opens with a brutal assault, and yet, the sensitive writer-director excels in constructing a universal human experience out of incredibly specific details (whether drawn from memory, research or her imagination). The moments immediately following the crime are especially powerful, as the filmmaker puts us in Josephine’s place. “Don’t move!” her dad orders — which also happens to be the title of de Araújo’s autobiographical segment for The Moth — before dashing after the perp.\n\n\tLeft behind with a police officer, Josephine must have felt like she was the one being punished, as he locked her in the back of his squad car with the survivor (Syra McCarthy). The moment stretches into a kind of eternity, marked by tactile details: searching for a seatbelt, wanting to console this crying woman, identifying with a bug trapped against the window. In a telling moment, Josephine seems to feel helpful when asked to find the woman’s hair tie among the weeds. And then there’s the long moment, which will haunt her for the rest of the film, in which she locks eyes with the suspect (Philip Ettinger).\n\n\tRaised in a household that never discussed sex, Josephine has no way of understanding what she’d seen. (Watching the scene a second time, it’s admirable to recognize how de Araújo protected her child star from the truth of what she was playing. Even more impressive is how much Reeves conveys without fully knowing.) As the girl’s ignorance begets further consequences, from acting out at school to the way she looks at unfamiliar men from then on, the filmmaker’s skill comes in embracing a certain ambiguity.\n\t\n\n\tInstead of forcing an interpretation upon her audience, de Araújo trusts us to make sense of her characters’ contradictory, if not downright counterproductive mindsets. For example, no one here has the slightest idea how to handle Josephine after the incident. When she asks her dad, “What was that man doing?” he immediately changes the subject, acting like nothing happened. At home, Josephine’s mom acknowledges the family’s tradition of avoiding tough subjects, describing it as the reason she never goes to her own mother for help as an adult. And yet, she’s helpless to discuss what happened with her daughter, who’s clearly desperate for an explanation.\n\n\tOverhearing an unfamiliar word (but not knowing how to spell it), Josephine types R-A-I-P into the search engine, researching the concept “of rape” on her own — which anyone can agree is the wrong way to learn. Her mom suggests they bring Josephine to a psychologist (a response a child might misconstrue as some kind of penalty), while her adversity-makes-us-stronger dad enrolls Josephine in self-defense classes. From here on, one of the movie’s more nuanced developments is how the girl gravitates toward — or else rejects — each of her parents at different stages. Arguably the film’s most moving scene occurs between Josephine and her mother in the car, when the child bluntly asks, “Were you ever raped?” and the truth comes indirectly, contradicting her answer, through a single tear.\n\n\t“Josephine” serves up multiple reasons for audiences to cry, nearly all of which come from moments of solidarity. (The director dealt with her own trauma by volunteering for a crisis hotline, and that experience clearly informs her screenplay.) In her testimonial for “The Moth,” de Araújo describes never getting closure with the survivor of the assault she was privy to as a child. As if to rectify that, she gives Josephine her moment in court, where the girl is cross-examined by a skeptical female lawyer (Dana Millican), as well as a symbolic reunion near the end of the film. In real life, de Araújo’s father warned, “You’re not a welcome memory for her.”\n\n\tWhile some might find it triggering, “Josephine” dares to confront the life-shattering intersection of sex and violence in our culture, facing the toughest of “adult situations” with clear eyes.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Moment” kicks off with black-and-white strobe images of Charli xcx writhing on the floor in skimpy torn clothing, as an industrial beat pounds away with apocalyptic fury on the soundtrack. In other words, this could be one of her videos. The movie then mixes in a montage of news clips reporting on Brat Summer, the music/culture/style/celebrity/marketing juggernaut that was spun out of “brat,” the 2024 Charli xcx album that became a global phenomenon.\n\t\n\n\t“The Moment,” in theory, is a mockumentary, set during the weeks when Charli is preparing to launch a massive worldwide brat tour. But the word “mockumentary” has connotations that, in this case, need to be instantly dispelled. The movie isn’t a cheeky satirical pop-music spoof, like “This Is Spinal Tap” (the film that invented the form) or Christopher Guest’s “A Mighty Wind” or Andy Samberg’s “Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping.” It’s a mock documentary played straight. And it’s not just that the jokes are understated (a generous way to put it, given that the jokes are so understated you’re barely going to laugh at them). It’s that Charli xcx, in “The Moment,” really is playing a close-up version of herself, and what the movie presents isn’t so much a comedy landscape as an alternate-reality version of the world in which Charli xcx actually exists.\n\n\n\tFerried around in SUVs, surrounded by frenetic handlers, she’s the eye at the center of the pop-media storm, whirling from photo shoots to brand endorsements to appearances on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and a British Vogue “What’s in My Bag?” segment. At the same time, the executives at Atlantic Records, led by the formidable Tammy (Rosanna Arquette), attempt to raise the ante on all this by pushing ahead to the question: How can Brat Summer be extended? They’re really asking: How can we keep the money flowing? Even the way Charli’s handlers confront her with a never-ending onslaught of fawning praise mixed with nattering demands, to the point that they make Jay Kelly look like someone in danger of being ignored, is all about the money. The Charli we see is a true artist of dance pop, and one of the hottest celebrities in the world, but what that really means is that she’s the golden goose: the one everyone puts on a pedestal so the golden eggs can keep coming.\n\t\n\n\tThe first idea they come up with is that Charli should endorse a new credit card, launched by Britain’s Howard Stirling Bank, aimed at young queer people. (It’s hipster capitalism.) And when it’s proposed that Charli should now, of course, do a concert film, that seems a bull’s-eye extension of where she’s at, and everyone is onboard. Amazon MGM Studios will back the project. The only question is: Who will be the director? The name that bubbles to the surface is Johannes (Alexander Skarsgård), a hot helmer who, according to Celeste (Hailey Benton Gates), Charli’s creative director and close confidante, “basically makes adverts for women.” That’s supposed to be a red flag. But after a hastily assembled Zoom meeting in which Charli tells Johannes that she simply needs someone to record the show, and he agrees, the concert film seems set, and Brat Summer looks ready to roll on.\n\n\tAidan Zamiri, the 29-year-old Scottish photographer and music-video maven who’s the first-time director of “The Moment,” does a good job of staging the early scenes of the movie as, in essence, a documentary. The Charli xcx we see is simply herself, and she’s quite captivating, with her dark eyebrows and fuck-it-all attitude and middle-class-princess-of-Essex-gone-bad-girl way. And the hubbub that surrounds her is an effective enactment of the multitasking pressures a contempo pop star faces.\n\n\tThen Johannes shows up. Alexander Skarsgård, who resembles a very tall version of Jim Carrey, plays him with a passive-aggressive fatuousness that is, in itself, a bit Carrey-like. Johannes thinks that everything about Charli and her show is fantastic! Except for everything about it that he’d like to change.\n\n\tIf you wanted to tell the forces of Christian nationalism why tradwife culture is never going to take hold the way they want it to, you could explain it all in two words: Charli xcx. Just watch the video for “Guess,” the song she did with Billie Eilish — though the video is ruled by Charli, which means that it’s all come-hither-but-be-warned erotic abandon, from the liquid way she moves her body (every inch of it seems to quiver) to the way she tosses off words in her accent that’s equal parts posh and punk to her whole captivating air of dominatrix delirium. What Robert Plant was to the ’70s, what Madonna and Prince and Axl Rose were to the ’80s, what Britney Spears was to the ’90s…Charli xcx is to today. She’s an intoxicating siren song of sexual danger you’d be hard-pressed to resist. In a world with Charli xcx, how trad is a wife really going to want to go?\n\t\n\n\tIn “The Moment,” everyone onscreen seems to understand what Charli is about: the handlers, the record-company executives, the talk-show hosts, the advertisers, the Tim Gunn costume person, the surge of fans. But there’s one person who, for some reason, doesn’t get it at all: Johannes, the director of the concert film. Early on, when he sees that Charli is flashing a nasty sexual word on stage and singing a song about cocaine, he asks if she can tone it down. He wants the movie to be presentable for a “family” audience. Johannes, in other words, is the same stooge we’ve seen in a thousand satires — the lame voice of corporate blanding, the one who fights the artist-hero to neuter her voice. The argument made by Johannes is the same one this character always makes. He’s saying: Let’s make more money! It’s what Col. Parker said to Elvis and what movie producers have said to every great director in the history of cinema.\n\n\tBut in the case of Charli xcx, Johannes’ demands are more than oppressive. They’re eccentric, because they make no sense. Charli xcx is an awesome dance-pop star, a saturnine goddess who has the world in her hand. But apart from how electric her music is, her brand is bad-girl subversion. That’s how she moves product. So when Johannes, the doofus dictator, tells her to scale it back, to lose the naughtiness, to cut down on the strobe-light aggression and substitute what everyone in the movie says looks like an onstage lava lamp, he’s literally asking her to neuter the thing that makes her successful. Why would Charli go along with it?\n\n\tThe answer is supposed to be that she’s still fighting the tyranny of a male-dominated music industry. But Charli xcx, as “The Moment” presents her, has already shot far beyond that. She has used her own raw aggression as a pop star to put the male suits in their place. And so the scenario that unfolds in “The Moment” doesn’t parse, either as satire or as mock drama. It hinges on Charli, in a tizzy, going to Ibiza for a quick vacation, where she runs into Kylie Jenner (playing herself), who talks up Johannes as a genius and as a director she herself wanted to use (but couldn’t because he had already committed to Charli’s project). This is supposed to set off a fatal fit of jealous insecurity on Charli’s part.\n\t\n\n\tAnd then…there’s the credit-card disaster. Charli, through a text on social media, somehow sets off a chain reaction, so that all the queer folk who got the brat card try to win free concert tickets…which crashes the system…and brings the Howard Stirling Bank to ruin…but I can’t truly explain how any of this happens, because it’s all presented in such a slipshod manner. I’m sorry, but this is not how an effective mockumentary works. I actually think “The Moment” should have pushed further into crackpot satirical extremes. In that case, it wouldn’t have been a movie that featured a “real” version of Charli xcx. But it might have made you laugh more, because it would have been genuinely outlandish rather than just unconvincing.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“I Want Your Sex,” an erotic thriller starring Olivia Wilde as a sexually assured artist who embarks on a sadomasochistic relationship with her gallery assistant, got Sundance’s pulse racing on Friday night. Cooper Hoffman plays Elliot, the sub to Wilde’s dom in Gregg Araki’s latest piece of boundary-pushing provocation, one that Sundance programming director Kim Yutani dubbed a “return to form” for the filmmaker in her introductory remarks.\n\t\n\n\tBoth stars go for it — baring all in a relationship that is kinky, but also tender at times. Not in a conventional way, of course. Wilde’s character, Erika Tracy, opens a sexual Pandora’s box for Hoffman, one that comes with ball gags, stilettos, whips, chains, and a cornucopia of dildos and strap-ons. There’s even a disastrous threesome that goes comically off the rails.\n\n\n\tWhen Araki heard that Wilde was interested in playing Erika, he made it clear what would be required. \n\n\n\t“We had a meeting, and I just said, ‘you know, to do this part, you gotta just not give a fuck, and just want to just fucking take the plunge,'” Araki recalled during a post-screening Q&A. “‘Because I don’t want to compromise it. I don’t want to water it down.’ And she said, ‘Let’s go.'”\n\n\tWilde said she never looked back after signing up to play the role of an artist whose swagger masks her dwindling self-confidence.\n\n\t“I was just so excited by Gregg’s enthusiasm for the medium, for the process,” Wilde said. “I wish more people made movies like [Gregg]. You just said, ‘Let’s do it. Let’s get cool people together who want to tell a story, and let’s just do it. And it doesn’t have to be a whole thing, and it doesn’t have to feel like this corporate project. It has to just come from the heart.’ And I wanted to be a part of something like that.”\n\t\n\n\tHoffman, who turned heads in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Licorice Pizza,” wasn’t sure he was right for the part of a bumbling boy toy. Araki was drawn to Hoffman because he reminded him of Dustin Hoffman in “The Graduate” and thought he could bring the same nebbish intensity to the part.\n\n\t“I honestly didn’t think I’d get cast,” Hoffman admitted. “I just threw my hat in the ring and kept getting closer and closer. And then they said I got the job. And I was like, ‘Ah, shit. I gotta go do this.’ And I’m very happy I did.”\n\n\tOn the red carpet prior to the premiere, Wilde told Variety that Gen Z wants to see less sex in movies and TV because they “don’t want to see inauthenticity anymore.”\n\n\t“The way that sex has been portrayed in film for a long time hasn’t been particularly realistic,” Wilde said. \n\n\n\tThat may not be a critique that’s leveled at Araki and company. The nudity and S&M mean “I Want Your Sex” will push the R-rating to the breaking point, but it was the film’s heart that the cast kept emphasizing on stage.\n\n\t“Ultimately, the sex feels secondary,” Chase Sui Wonders, who plays Hoffman’s best friend and roommate, said. “It’s a story about being obsessed with someone…It’s just a tragic love story.”\n\n\tMason Gooding, Daveed Diggs and Charli xcx round out the ensemble. Black Bear produced the film, which is looking for distribution. The packed auditorium included executives from indie labels like Magnolia, Roadside and Mubi, and the room was so crowded that Patrick Schwarzenegger was spotted walking up and down the aisle looking for an empty seat.\n\n\t“I Want Your Sex” is Araki’s eleventh feature at Sundance, with the director having previously debuted the likes of “Mysterious Skin” and “The Doom Generation” at the mountain festival. Before the film screened, Araki praised Sundance founder Robert Redford, who died last year at the age of 89.\n\n\t“There’s been nobody in the history of fucking Hollywood movies who says, ‘I want to use my fucking incredible star power and all my fucking clout to create this place in the world for those fucking weird filmmakers, those outsider filmmakers, those different voices,” Araki said. “It’s all about DEI.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSure, the devil wears Prada, but what does an aggressive contemporary artist wear to work? How about a see-through dress and stiletto heels? Kinky costumes are just a fraction of the fun in Gregg Araki’s “I Want Your Sex,” which stars Olivia Wilde as Erika Tracy, the most domineering movie boss since James Spader in “Secretary” (the last BDSM-themed workplace comedy to premiere at Sundance). Cooper Hoffman plays her all-too-eager subordinate in a film that’s fully liberated where sex and nudity are concerned, but kind of old-fashioned when it comes to the interpersonal dynamics between its lusty leads.\n\t\n\n\tSurprisingly enough, “I Want Your Sex” shares a decent amount of common ground with screwball classics like “The Shop Around the Corner” and “His Girl Friday” — not that anyone in the target demographic will be making the connection. For Araki, who most recently tried remixing familiar themes for a new generation with “Now Apocalypse,” this unconventional rom-com feels like a natural extension of the queer indie pioneer’s sex-positive sensibility, even as he steers things into novel territory.\n\n\n\tInfinitely less punk that his early work, though still edgier than nearly everything else out there, “I Want Your Sex” represents a sincere attempt by Araki to connect with the kids, whose relationship to sex couldn’t be more confusing to a child of the ’60s: Whereas Araki is a child of the Swinging ’60s, the neuter-minded audience for this movie grew up overexposed to porn and insecure about intimacy, but relatively considerate when it comes to consent. That’s why Hoffman’s Elliot seems so thrilled to find himself at Erika’s service: When she’s in charge, “I don’t have to make any decisions,” he beams, more than happy to relinquish control. But even that freedom can go too far.\n\t\n\n\tAs the movie opens, Elliot stumbles out of Erika’s posh mansion in a blood-splattered pink bra and panties, only to discover his boss floating face down in the pool. Cut to a police interrogation room, where a straight-faced Margaret Cho and Johnny Knoxville grill Elliot about what happened. “9 1/2 weeks earlier,” reads the fluorescent pink caption (Araki is second only to Almodóvar when it comes to ultra-saturated color schemes), winking at ’80s cine-kinkster Adrian Lyne.\n\n\tMost erotic movies come with an element of danger, and though this one starts off with Elliot under suspicion for Erika’s death, Araki can’t resist leaning into the comedy — and why not? Sex should be joyful, and even when there’s degradation and pain play involved (pig masks and ball gags, handcuffs and sharp heels), he clearly thinks it’s more fun to laugh alongside the participants than to go down whatever dark black rabbit hole directors like David Cronenberg and the Wachowskis do with their leather and latex.\n\n\tAraki movies are color-coded like candy, and “I Want Your Sex” is no exception, especially when it comes to Erika’s art studio, where Elliot is hired as one of her assistants. They’re the grunts who paint the papier-mâché phalluses and chew gum all day, sticking the bright pink wads to a labia-shaped canvas. “Contemporary art is a scam,” opines Erika. “The real art is convincing people you’re making something meaningful.” With those words, Araki could be criticizing fellow queer director Bruce La Bruce, who has somehow figured out how to get each new film (no matter how terrible) invited to prestigious international film festivals.\n\n\tBy contrast, Araki belongs to the John Waters school of outsider filmmaking, poking fun at uptight mainstream culture, whether that’s via a stoner comedy like “Smiley Face” or a nihilistic cri de coeur like “The Doom Generation,” without paying much mind to such square notions as “good acting.” Wilde delivers a pure-camp performance here, trying to one-up Miranda Priestly with her imperious workplace attitude, cover-girl eyeliner and droll line deliveries. More ferocious than any cougar, she lures Elliot into her spider’s web of an office and threatens to report him to HR, before propositioning him for sex. She wants it without strings. He’s too naive to realize she’ll have him whipped in every sense of the word.\n\t\n\n\tElliot already has a girlfriend (Charli xcx), though she’s too distracted with grad school to satisfy him sexually. So he turns to his friends for advice, whether it’s Chase Sui Wonders as the roommate who lives vicariously through his exploits or Mason Gooding as his insatiably gay co-worker. The script (which Araki wrote with “Now Apocalypse” partner Karley Sciortino) never fully makes the case for how this vixen figured out her employee’s deepest fantasies, though nearly all of Araki’s characters are sexually fluid, so maybe Elliot’s awakening isn’t such a stretch.\n\n\tIn Hoffman’s hands, Elliot looks like a cross between the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman (the young actor’s dad) and a roguishly handsome member of the Kennedy clan. He amounts to a less confident version of his “Licorice Pizza” character, still plenty enthusiastic about crawling around on all fours or taking a sex toy in the backdoor (the look on Elliot’s face after Erika penetrates him for the first time says it all). Tellingly, when thinking about Erika on his own, Elliot entertains more traditional desires, like getting married and starting a family.\n\n\tHoffman and Wilde’s commitment makes the film feel more important than it is. It’s better to think of this either as pure, irreverent escapism or a guiltless pleasure. There’s no important message or perceptive social insight to be gleaned from “I Want Your Sex,” beyond Araki giving the kids enthusiastic permission to test their own boundaries. Once you get past the shock, the plot falls apart. But that hardly matters, since Araki’s achieved his main goal: getting a repressed generation to loosen up about sex by pushing the boundaries between profound and profane. How’s that for a happy ending?\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Once upon a time, there lived an extraordinary man who connected all of us in this room,” Ethan Hawke narrated to kick off the Sundance Institute’s annual gala, fittingly a tribute to the film festival’s late founder.\n\n\t“We wouldn’t be here without the love and appreciation for Robert Redford,” Hawke said.\n\n\tThis year’s event was emotional, not just because it’s the last hurrah in Park City, but also because it was held shortly after Redford died in September at the age of 89. The actor-turned-director, a sought-after leading man through much of the ’70s and ’80s through films such as “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Way We Were,” and “All the President’s Men,” founded Sundance Film Festival in 1978 as a launchpad for independent filmmakers. Friends of the filmmaker and alumni of the festival, including Woody Harrelson, Chloé Zhao, Ava DuVernay and Taika Waititi, trekked on Friday night to the Grand Hyatt Deer Valley one last time to toast to Redford.\n\t\n\n\t“For some of you younger folks who didn’t live in the ‘60s, ‘70s or ‘80s, it might be hard for you to understand what Robert Redford meant to my generation,” Harrelson said. “He was part of my childhood.”\n\n\n\tHarrelson described a sense of “unbridled euphoria” when he got to know Redford while filming the erotic thriller “Indecent Proposal” in the early ‘90s. “I admit he’s the only man on earth I’d sell my wife to,” Harrelson cracked. “And I also admit, unabashedly, that he’s the only man I’d return the money to, to take me for a night.”\n\n\tFriday night’s event also honored Zhao, who just made history as the first person of color and second woman to be nominated twice for the best director Oscar for “Hamnet,” with the Trailblazer Award. Nia DaCosta, who recently directed “Hedda” and made her Sundance debut with 2018’s “Little Woods,” was feted with the Vanguard Award.\n\t\n\n\t“Being part of this community taught me something very important, which is trailblazing or leadership is not about dominance. It’s about interdependence. It’s about community,” Zhao said. “I want to thank Robert Redford for knowing the importance of interdependence in nature and human nature.”\n\n\tHawke, a Sundance regular over the decades in films such as “Before Sunrise” and this year’s drama “The Weight,” shared the story of the first time he met Redford. Hawke had auditioned for the 1992 drama “A River Runs Through It” but didn’t get the role. Hawke remembers that Redford, who directed the film, told him: “You’re too young for this part. But I just want you to know, you’re going to have a wonderful career, and I can’t wait to watch it.”\n\n\tHawke’s takeaway from the exchange? “He believed in me. He followed up. He came to see me in a play. It was 99-seat theater; $10 a ticket. What the fuck?” Hawke recalled. “He championed other people. The fact that he had time to care about all of us is so meaningful.”\n\n\tA recurring theme of the emotional evening was Redford’s passion for cultivating and supporting new talent, as well as his insistence that they called him “Bob.” However several filmmakers, including DuVernay and DaCosta, admitted they were uncomfortable using a casual nickname for someone they considered a hero.\n\n\t“When I think of Robert Redford, I think of how frustrated he was when I never called him Bob,” DuVernay shared. “When he asked why, I’d say ‘Because you’re Mr. Redford.’ He’d said, ‘Ava, please call me Bob.’”\n\n\t(That didn’t apply to Waititi, who later in the evening joked, “Robert Redford — Bob to me, not to you.”)\n\n\tBefore Patti LuPone made a surprise appearance to perform a heartfelt rendition of “Forever Young,” Robert’s daughter Amy Redford honored her father and said the evening felt “like a homecoming.”\n\n\t“I can’t help but think of all the galas my dad had no interest in showing up to,” Amy said, “and how he might have actually enjoyed this one.”\n",

On the book's jacket, a naked couple engages in oral sex.\n      \n\n          Inside a drawer, there's a package labeled \"Incognito Wigs,\" and there are also neatly folded costumes apparently used for cosplay ... along with a stethoscope and nurse's headband.\n      \n    \n          The FBI confiscated Epstein's X-rated paraphernalia during a search of his Manhattan townhouse around the time of his July 2019 arrest on charges of sex trafficking minors.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          One month later, Epstein died by suicide in his cell at the now-shuttered Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial.\n      \n    \n          As you know, the DOJ was required by federal law to release all the Epstein files by now -- and President Trump signed off on the bill. But the agency has slow-walked the process to the point where less than 1 percent of the files have seen the light of day.\n      \n    \n          Will the DOJ keep its promise to all Americans and roll out the more than 2 million additional Epstein documents?

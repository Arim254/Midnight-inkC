    "body": "\n\tJon M. Chu is taking his talents to Paramount Skydance. The “Wicked” director has inked a multi-year first-look film and TV deal with the David Ellison-led studio.\n\n\tThough Chu most recently helmed the blockbuster musical “Wicked: For Good” for Universal, he and his Electric Somewhere production banner previously had a deal at Warner Bros., where he made “Crazy Rich Asians” and “In the Heights.” Now, Chu joins an impressive roster of talent with new pacts at Paramount Skydance, including Matt and Ross Duffer, James Mangold and Will Smith.\n\t\n\n\tThe three-year producing deal goes into effect on Jan. 2. Chu and his production company will be based on the Paramount lot and work closely with Paramount Pictures co-chairs Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, Motion Picture Group president Don Granger, and Paramount Television Studios president Matt Thunell.\n\n\n\tChu’s move comes as “Wicked For Good” continues to break box office records and garner awards buzz, like its predecessor, which won two Oscars from 10 nominations among numerous other accolades. (Earlier on Wednesday, “For Good” was named one of the National Board of Review’s 10 best films of the year.) 2024’s “Wicked,” starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, became the highest-grossing film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever, earning more than $756 million worldwide. The follow-up, which launched in November, now holds the record for the biggest global opening ever for a movie based on a Broadway show, and the second-highest opening at the domestic box office this year. To date, “For Good” has earned $393.3 million globally, including $122 million internationally and $270 million domestically.\n\t\n\n\tFollowing “Wicked,” Chu has a full dance card of projects in the works at a few different studios: he’s attached to direct the forthcoming Britney Spears biopic at Universal, as well as a live-action Hot Wheels movie at Warner Bros. and the animated film adaptation of Dr. Seuss’s “Oh the Places You’ll Go,” with Ariana Grande and Josh Gad leading the voice cast. He’s also set to helm another stage-to-screen musical in “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.”\n\n\tChu is repped by UTA, Artists First, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson and Christopher, LLP, and ID PR.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPhil Upchurch, a guitarist who played with Quincy Jones, Donny Hathaway and Michael Jackson, died on Nov. 23 in Los Angeles. He was 84.  \n\n\tDuring his career, Upchurch recorded nearly 30 albums and appeared on more than 1,000 recordings with some of the biggest artists in Hollywood. Among the hit singles he took part in creating were Chaka Khan’s “I’m Every Woman,” which charted Billboard’s R&B charts for three weeks in 1978, and Jackson’s “Workin’ Day and Night,” from his 1979 solo album “Off the Wall.”\n\t\n\n\tThe guitarist was also featured on all of Hathaway’s solo studio and live albums, Curtis Mayfield’s soundtracks “Superfly,” “Claudine,” “Let’s Do It Again” and “Sparkle” and composed George Benson’s single “Six to Four.”\n\n\n\tUpchurch grew up in Chicago with a father who was a jazz pianist. His first introduction to music began at 13 years old when his father gave him a ukulele. That gift prompted him to explore other instruments, and he mastered playing the guitar, bass and drums.\n\n\tInfluenced by jazz musicians Oscar Peterson and Jimmy Smith, Upchurch’s entry into the music industry started with his first tour performing with the singing group The Spaniels after graduating from high school in 1958.\n\n\tUpchurch served two years in the U.S. Army in the mid-‘60s as a radio reporter stationed in Germany and performed as a musician in the unit’s glee club. After returning home, he took his talents to Chicago record labels where he worked on sessions with jazz and blues artists such as Ramsey Lewis and John Klemmer, Muddy Waters,  Howlin’ Wolf, The Dells and Etta James, and eventually recorded his first single, “You Can’t Sit Down (Parts 1 & 2).”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to being a musician, Upchurch published two books and was working on an autobiography at the time of his death.\n\n\tHe is survived by his wife, Sonya.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrincipal photography is set to begin Thursday in Pasadena on Matt Kelsey’s independent drama “Above Ground.”\n\n\tKelsey makes his directorial debut with the feature, which he also wrote.\n\n\tAn official summary of “Above Ground” reads, “When a once-successful writer Tom (Kelsey) retreats from the world after a devastating loss, he’s forced to confront his isolation and the ghosts of his past. Through unexpected connections and painful self-discovery, he begins to uncover what it truly means to come back to life.”\n\t\n\n\tKelsey describes the screenplay as being “written in the vein of a Chekhov play.”\n\n\n\tHe said in a statement, “No superheroes, no car chases, drug cartels, shootings, just how we live, love, process loss, and ultimately carry on. I wrote ‘Above Ground’ as an ode to loss and hope for the future.”\n\n\tA graduate of London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, Kelsey’s 2021 short “Her Place” earned multiple awards as it made its way through the film festival circuit.\n\n\tThe “Above Ground” cast also includes Christian Zuber (“Fly Me to the Moon,” “The Morning Show”), Marion Kerr (“Her Place,” “Criminal Minds”), Craig Thomas (“Source Code,” “I’m Not There”) and Austin Woods (“American Horror Story,” “American Horror Stories”).\n\n\t“At its core, this is very much a hero’s journey, Tom is sort of an Odysseus, except he can’t go back to Ithaca, his home is his deceased wife,” Kelsey said. “How do you survive when there is no home to go back to? It’s also a deeply personal admission of my own battle with the demons of mental health, hopefully showing others that it’s a very human trait, and none of us are totally ‘normal’ or ‘OK.’ It’s OK to not be Ok.”\n\t\n\n\tKenn Viselman joined the project as producer under his production company, Kenn Viselman presents.\n\n\t“It’s very rare to experience a story so raw, so authentic, so vulnerable and so real,” Viselman said. “One minute you find yourself grappling with the pain of losing someone you love and then you find yourself unexpectedly laughing at the joy of being alive. This is a very special little film.”\n\n\tDirector of photography is Charles Schner (“Captain America: Civil War,” “The Big Lebowski,” “Insurgent,” “American Horror Story”) with Dallin Burns (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Rebel Moon 1” and “2” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 2”) as composer and music supervisor. Celebrated Hollywood stylist Johnny Wujek (“Legendary,” “America’s Next Top Model,” “Project Runway All Stars”) serves as costume designer and art director. Michael Yanivich (“Waltzing with Brando,” “Face Off”) is the editor.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBeverley McGarvey, president of Network 10 and head of streaming at Paramount Australia and New Zealand, opened the Asian Academy Creative Awards National Winners Conference in Singapore on Dec. 3 with a rallying call for the region’s content industry, praising the diversity and youthful energy of Asia-Pacific programming while emphasizing the critical importance of strategic deal-making in today’s fragmented media landscape.\n\n\tSpeaking at the two-day conference ahead of the Grand Awards Gala on Dec. 4, McGarvey, who also serves as chair of the Asian Academy Creative Awards, reflected on her experience judging one of the 40 categories among the record 340 judges this year, marking a 30% increase from 2024.\n\t\n\n\t“The diversity has been great across the board this year,” McGarvey said. “Every genre has been covered in terms of what’s been nominated, and every market has been covered.”\n\n\n\tComing from a background in English-language content across Australian, U.K., Canadian and American markets, McGarvey said she was particularly struck by the age demographics of Asia-Pacific programming. “There were lots of shows that really featured lots of young people and featured lots of stories that I think would really resonate with younger audiences,” she said. “In lots of platforms in the English-language speaking markets, things are aging up quite a bit. And that’s just not true in all the content that I’ve seen here.”\n\n\tThe conference precedes the gala ceremony featuring 331 national winners from 16 countries competing for the Golden Goddess trophies, with high-profile contenders including Jacob Elordi for Prime Video’s “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” and Cate Blanchett for Apple TV’s “Disclaimer.”\n\t\n\n\tMcGarvey devoted significant attention to the evolving economics of content production, arguing that strategic deal-making has become as crucial as creative execution in the current marketplace. “A great idea doesn’t make a great show — great execution makes a great show,” she said. “To get to that point of great execution, it kind of starts with the deal.”\n\n\tThe exec highlighted the increasing complexity of rights management in an era of multiple platforms and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. “Twenty years ago, 15 years ago, we started to buy less broad rights, and we didn’t use them for about five or six years,” McGarvey recalled. “Now you move forward to today, and you have to buy so many different rights. You have to construct a deal that allows you to do so many different things.”\n\n\tMcGarvey cited examples from Paramount’s recent Australian productions that demonstrate the company’s flexible approach to windowing and platform strategy. “NCIS: Sydney” airs on Paramount Plus in Australia and other markets, on CBS in the U.S., and on Network 10 in Australia as a second window after Paramount Plus. Conversely, the Australian version of “Ghosts” launched on Paramount Plus before airing weekly on Network 10, allowing the free-to-air broadcasts to promote the streaming service.\n\n\t“Every show is different, every genre is different, every market is different,” McGarvey said. “Although you can create guardrails, we’ve got to be clever and construct things that service that product the best way possible.”\n\n\tBeyond content partnerships, McGarvey highlighted the growing importance of technology collaborations. Network 10 recently partnered with LG to carry the network’s signal on the electronics manufacturer’s electronic program guides as a live stream. The deal addresses the reality that less than half of Australian households plug in a terrestrial aerial, ensuring discoverability for free-to-air content.\n\n\tMcGarvey also pointed to Network 10’s reimagined “Big Brother” as an example of multi-platform strategy targeting younger audiences. The reality format now includes a live TikTok stream alongside traditional broadcasts, with episodes also available on YouTube. “If you’re whatever age you are and you haven’t watched free-to-air possibly since you were born, you might watch the TikTok stream, and then it brings them back into our ecosystem,” she said.\n\t\n\n\tDespite the complexity of modern content distribution, McGarvey returned to a fundamental principle. “A great show will always find an audience,” she said. “A great show, well executed, will always find an audience. Maybe not tomorrow, but it will eventually work if it’s got great stories and great characters.”\n\n\tThe National Winners Conference continues Dec. 4, featuring panels on generative AI and copyright, platform strategy and deal-making. The Grand Awards Gala takes place at Capitol Theatre on the evening of Dec. 4.\n\n\tThe 2025 Asian Academy Creative Awards marks the seventh edition of the ceremony. \n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tDIRECTV is serving up even more ways for customers to watch television at home, with the introduction of seven new “multiview Mix Channels” on their streaming platform.\n\n\tOne of the leading over-the-top media services (OTT) in the market today, DIRECTV’s latest offering allows customers to stream up to four live television channels at once from a single screen. It’s an ideal proposition, say, for sports fans wanting to keep up with multiple games; for tuned-in viewers who like to always have the news on; or families divided over the type of content they want to watch. You can toggle among the audio feeds on each of the four channels, or switch to a single channel with the click of a button.\n\n\n\tDIRECTV’s multiview experience is currently available on packages that include DIRECTV “Mix Channels,” a selection of pre-curated channels based on genre and interests. Current Mix Channels include a Sports Mix with ESPN, ESPN2, FS1, NBC Sports Now; a League Sports mix with MLB Network, NBA TV, NFL Network and NHL Network; a News Mix with CNN, Fox News Channel, Fox Weather, MSNBC; and a Kids Mix with Disney Channel, Disney Jr., Disney XD, Nickelodeon.\n\n\tDIRECTV also offers a Business Mix package of multiview channels, a Locals Mix (ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC) in select markets, and a special Sunday Sports Mix that lets you watch live sports on CBS, FOX, ESPN and FS1 all at the same time – and on the same screen. Choose to watch all four pre-selected Mix Channels at once or select the one you want to watch full-screen.\n\n\tMost multiview channels are included in all of DIRECTV’s streaming packages, with some also available in select Genre Packs. Availability varies based on service selection and only includes channels in your DIRECTV package. Feature only available on your television; not available on other devices.\n\n\n\tDIRECTV has long been a pioneer of multi-channel viewing technology, having first introduced mix channels to its satellite TV subscribers back in 2008. The company is now offering the same experience to its OTT service, with viewers able to watch live TV over the internet without needing a satellite dish or cable box.\n\n\tIn a blog post, DIRECTV says this “next generation of mix channels brings this technology fully to streaming, delivering curated, genre-based layouts and local channel mixes for even more ways to watch.”\n\n\tYou can find out more about the multiview experience and see the latest DIRECTV deals and offers at directv.com/affiliates/stream.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmidst the pomp and spectacle of the opening ceremony of the Hainan Island International Film Festival (HIIFF), a quiet remembrance stole the show.\n\n\tXing Bo, VP of China Media Group, remembered the victims of the recent Tai Po apartment complex fire in Hong Kong, which has claimed some 159 victims thus far, with some 30 people still missing.\n\n\t“Distinguished guests and friends, as the moon hangs low in the sky, we feel a profound sorrow for the lives lost in the Hong Kong fire and for their families. May the departed be at rest, may the survivors find strength,” said Xing, in a speech before more than 1,000 guests.\n\t\n\n\t“Cinema has always allowed us to realise our shared humanity and inspires us to keep going in the toughest of times. Let us join together to create that beautiful image.”\n\n\n\tThe heartfelt message also acted as a reminder of the outsized role the city has played in Chinese cinema.\n\n\tClips from classic Hong Kong films like “Comrades, Almost a Love Story,” provided a backdrop to one of the night’s big spectacle set pieces, a medley of popular songs from films, as the Hainan International Film Festival celebrates not just its 7th edition, but also the 120th anniversary of Chinese cinema.\n\n\tJames Cameron referred to the anniversary in a video message to the audience.\n\n\t“[Celebrating 120 years of Chinese cinema] is a testament to your passion, both as brilliant creators and as devoted audiences,” said the “Avatar” director.\n\n\t“I’ve always believed in the cinema’s unparalleled big-screen experience. This spectacle, driven by innovation and the boundless spark of imagination, is the very heart of the ‘Avatar’ films. It’s with that same spirit we eagerly anticipate sharing our next chapter,” Cameron said.\n\t\n\n\tHIIFF will host the Chinese premiere of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” later this week, with Cameron in attendance.\n\n\tThe opening ceremony was held at a purpose built outdoor arena on the man-made Phoenix Island in Sanya City, Hainan.\n\n\tThe guestlist for the opening ceremony was heavy on local celebrities such as renowned actor Guo Tao (“I Am Not Madame Bovary”), though light on international attendees. Argentinian director Mariano Llinás and French documentary filmmaker Sylvian George were some notable exceptions, both serving on the festival’s juries.\n\n\t“This year it is obvious that in terms of film artistry and market impact, Chinese films have taken a big step forward,” said jury president Marco Müller.\n\n\tThe 7th Hainan Island International Film Festival runs through Dec. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Trump has granted a pardon to Tim Leiweke, the live entertainment executive accused of rigging a bid to build an arena on the campus of the University of Texas.\n\n\tIn a proclamation signed on Tuesday, Trump granted a “full and unconditional pardon” to Leiweke in connection with the charge.\n\n\tLeiweke, the former CEO of Oak View Group, was indicted by Trump’s Justice Department in July and was due to go on trial next year. He was accused of persuading a rival bidder to drop out in exchange for subcontracts on the arena project. OVG ended up as the sole bidder on the arena project, which was completed in 2022.\n\t\n\n\tThe 68-year-old Leiweke could have faced as much as 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine had he been convicted at trial.\n\n\tIn a statement, he thanked the president for his clemency.\n\n\t“I do not have the words to adequately convey my profound gratitude to President Trump,” he said. “This has been a long and difficult journey for my wife, my daughter, and me. The President has given us a new lease on life with which we will be grateful and good stewards.”\n\n\tLeiweke’s lawyer, David Gerger, also issued a statement.\n\n\t“This is the right result, and we are happy for our client and his family,” Gerger said.\n\n\tAfter the indictment, Leiweke stepped down as CEO of Oak View Group, the company he co-founded with Irving Azoff a decade ago. He also denied the allegations.\n\n\t“Mr. Leiweke has done nothing wrong and will vigorously defend himself and his well-deserved reputation for fairness and integrity,” his spokesperson said at the time.\n\t\n\n\tAs a result of the Justice Department’s investigation, OVG agreed to pay a $15 million penalty, while the rival bidder, Legends Hospitality, agreed to pay $1.5 million.\n\n\tLeiweke is a former CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group and Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. A New Yorker profile in 2012 dubbed him “The Man Who Owns L.A.,” citing his work developing Staples Center — now Crypto.com Arena — and the L.A. Live entertainment complex in downtown L.A.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“We’re not an independent label. We’re a pissed-off startup. That’s what I call it,” says producer Joey Moi, one of the three chiefs of Big Loud Records, along with Seth England and Joey Moi. It’s good rhetoric, but at the very least, Big Loud gets to be both those things, when they’re not being mistaken for a major, with a level of success that includes the biggest male artist in the music business, Morgan Wallen.\n\n\tAsk the three principals which labels that preceded them were most inspirational in Big Loud’s path, and they don’t cite any of the most obvious Nashville antecedents. Instead, England quietly walks over to his shelf and pulls down what is apparently the personally most treasured piece of physical music product in his office: a Motown boxed set that came in a package shaped like the house at 2648 West Grand Blvd. in Detroit, where it all began.\n\t\n\n\t“Hitsville USA,” he says, naming the boxed set he’s proudly holding up. “I obsessed over the Berry Gordy story… \n\n\n\t“But I had read stories of folks for years. It’s not just Motown. Craig would say A&M…” (Early in his journey to becoming a label head, Wiseman was signed to Rondor Publishing, a division of A&M, as an up-and-coming songwriter.) “I mean, it can come in all shapes and sizes, like John Janick and Fueled by Ramen,” England continues. “Just from an entrepreneurial side of things, I’d give a shout-out to Clive Calder and Jive Records and Zomba [Publishing, the mecca of ’90s boy bands]. As a nerdy student of the game, I found there was something to be learned about his strategy as an entrepreneur when it came to his global distribution deals.\n\t\n\n\t“But Motown… One time I was in Detroit and they let me take a tour of the building by myself, and it was a day that just changed me forever. You know, we were already on our cultural path, but it really just reinforced for me that you don’t have to be the big major label in the big building to do something that they even envy. And Motown was a very much a Smokey Robinson company too; Smokey had just as much insight and effect on what was going on, and I think about that all the time.”\n\n\tWhich ties directly on how Big Loud Records was founded 10 years ago and built upon the earlier foundation that was Big Loud Publishing. England says Motown’s mojo — and or his own company’s — is “hard to harness and really hard to create. But you’ve gotta do it by including the songwriters and the creators. You know, we have a staff lunch here in the record label building, and sure enough, our songwriters in sweatpants start coming through and filling up their plates, and they’re on staff too. That’s got complexities to it, but more times than not, the supernatural happens because of it. And the artists and songwriters end up becoming often best friends.”\n\n\tIn fact, England continues, “Morgan and Ernest [the songwriter-artist who goes by a single name] met in the hallway of Big Loud, and they sat down for an hour and realized they played against each other in high school, in two back-to-back state championship games. They reconnected in our hallway, and now they’re creatively inseparable. And that just wouldn’t have happened if we didn’t create that environment much like Motown, A&M and others.”\n\n\tOf course, a huge point of pride is that they literally own that environment. “We are absolutely and adamantly independent,” says Wiseman. “In early days, even as a publishing company, I turned down many, many, many, many offers, to stay independent. We’ve remained independent. And of course there’s things we have to do, distribution deals and ancillary things. And we’re very good friends with Universal staff and work with them some. But nobody owns us. Nobody finances us. Everything has been out of pocket. People ask, ‘How’d you start your label?’ Well, we all put in money, and nobody got a paycheck from this label for frigging years. With other guys around Nashville, their whole idea of ‘here’s how you start a label’ — ‘well, first you gimme a million dollars, then…’ No. Guess what? If you wany yo do an independent label, you’re like any small business, you get paid last, and so you don’t get paid at all for a long time.”\n\t\n\n\tSays England, “I can say to Joey, I agree, I’m a pissed off startup. I don’t care how big we get — if we ever lose that, then we’ve lost the mission. … (Big Machine founder) Scott Borchetta is his own kind of entrepreneur too. Through the prime Florida Georgia Line years, we were helping steer that ship [when that duo was a Big Machine management client, signed to Big Machine], I bet I went to a thousand marketing meetings in his building, so I got such a close front-row seat. And he himself was a pissed off startup. Not to speak for him, but he was offered many times to go take the keys to the big building — you know, ‘Which major one would you like?’ — because of his skill set and resume. But I think in his very fabric, he enjoys being the chip-on-his-shoulder entrepreneur, because he gets up quicker out of bed for that.\n\n\t“And so there was a lot to be learned from Scott in the early days. The only difference is, he didn’t have a publishing company, originally — but if you look now, they have one of the most competitive publishing companies in town. He just did it a little bit in reverse, but kind of got to that destination all the same. He’s got a great development engine there. And yeah, he’s definitely a pissed-off startup.”\n\n\tWhat they feel makes their label so different is that it was basically founded atop an already successful song publishing company. It’s no coincidence that two of their more thriving artists, Hardy and Ernest, are country music Supermen — sorry, touring headliners — who still double as mild-mannered songwriters by day. Wiseman was a country writing titan before he became a label mogul, and still gets his hands dirty, as it were, co-writing with relative newcomers. Even recent signee Miranda Lambert gets involved in co-writing songs for other artists. And Morgan Wallen has been known to write 2-3 fresh tunes a day if that particular writers’ room is a fruitful one.\n\n\t“On our business cards, it all says ‘publisher’ first,” says Moi. “And that stat wouldn’t exist — and Morgan wouldn’t exist — without all of the great songwriters and collaborators that have come along the way. To me that’s the nucleus, and we’re just trying to be as close to the nucleus as we can, and push it in the right direction and use it for our advantage. But there’s dozens and dozens of really great kids that have shown up along the way and offered their best ideas and best moments for those projects.”\n\t\n\n\tWiseman: “And because Morgan is so brave, [songwriters] will say, ‘Oh my God, I can say shit that I was never supposed to say in a song. In fact, if I don’t say it, I’ll never even make the cut for Morgan.’In fact, one of our dear friends that used to write for us and has a bunch of Morgan cuts, when the album was over, told me, ‘Man, writing is hard when I’m not writing knowing Morgan is out there to listen to it. God, man, it’s just so boring.’ And I was like, how proud that we’re a part of that, where these songwriters are just going, ‘That’s what it’s all about.’”\n\n\tIt would be tempting to call Big Loud Records the house that Wallen built — his success has been that oversized in an environment where fewer superstars are coming along, let alone ones who are breaking records for No. 1 chart streaks. But it’s more the house that songs built, and Wallen just turned it into a castle.\n\n\tEngland says, “Another superpower Morgan has is he’s such a self-starter. We don’t have to call him to say, ‘Hey, are you ready to make some music? Are you feeling creative again?’ Our text thread with Joey this morning was a very active thread and it was Morgan excited to get going; he’s written eight or 10 things [for the next record following “I’m the Problem,” the chart-dominating 36-song collection that came out in May]. He’s intense when he is in that mode too; he’s all-consumed with it.”\n\n\tMoir adds with a laugh “I got a terrifying text message from him just a few weeks after [‘Problem’] was released: ‘Man, I think I’m ready to start cutting more songs.’ The record just dropped! He is ready to go, and I’m going, ‘All right, let me get this calendar sorted here, buddy.’ As soon as I got that text, I was like, ‘Uh-oh, shit… time to get going again.’” \n\n\tBut that’s how it goes in Hitsville, Tennessee.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDrama production expenditure in Australia reached an unprecedented AUD$2.7 billion ($1.78 billion) in 2024/25, marking a substantial 43% increase over the previous year, according to Screen Australia‘s newly released Drama Report.\n\n\tThe record spending reflects comprehensive growth across the sector, fueled primarily by high-budget feature films and subscription video-on-demand production. International activity accounted for AUD$678 million ($448 million) of the increase, with foreign productions contributing significantly to the overall uplift.\n\t\n\n\tOf 174 titles that entered production during the period, 71 were Australian productions, representing AUD$1.1 billion ($727 million) in spending on local content — a 14% year-over-year increase. However, this marked a decline in Australian productions’ share of total expenditure, dropping from 50% to 40% compared to 2023/24.\n\n\n\t“This strong result is a testament to the hard work and creativity of our screen practitioners, who are navigating a rapidly evolving landscape,” said Screen Australia CEO Deirdre Brennan. “The numbers reflect a complex story of production value and content volume. While there is moderate growth in local drama expenditure, fewer TV titles entered production across free-to-air, subscription-video-on-demand and children’s content, showing ongoing shifts in commissioning behaviour.”\n\n\tThe international production surge proved particularly dramatic, with 20 foreign features filming in Australia generating a record AUD$1 billion ($661 million) in spending. International television and VOD productions added another AUD$458 million ($303 million).\n\t\n\n\tKate Marks, CEO of Ausfilm, attributed the international boom to Australia’s reformed Location Offset incentive program. “This activity helps sustain the ecosystem that supports Australian stories by keeping our crews working, funding training, enabling investments into screen businesses and building capabilities,” Marks said.\n\n\tAustralian theatrical features saw expenditure jump 76% to AUD$379 million ($250 million), though this was driven by a limited number of high-budget films exceeding AUD$50 million ($33 million). Productions in the AUD$1-5 million ($660,000-$3.3 million) range remained the most common.\n\n\tThe television landscape presented a more challenging picture. While subscription TV and SVOD productions spent AUD$492 million ($325 million) on 18 titles (up 5% from the previous year’s 28 titles), free-to-air television expenditure declined 14% to AUD$162 million ($107 million) across 14 titles. Overall, Australian general TV/VOD drama spending remained relatively flat at AUD$654 million ($432 million) across 32 titles, though volume metrics including total titles and hours decreased.\n\n\tChildren’s content experienced a particularly sharp decline, with expenditure falling 41% to AUD$34 million ($22.5 million).\n\n\tStreaming platforms — both Australian and international — now represent 73% of investment in TV/VOD drama, though fewer titles and hours were produced despite increased spending. Cost-per-hour increased notably, reflecting both demand for premium production values and broader industry cost pressures.\n\n\tGeographically, Queensland emerged as the top state for screen production for the first time, achieving a record AUD$925 million ($611 million) in local expenditure and capturing 34% of the national market. This represented a 32% increase over the state’s 2022-23 record of AUD$700 million ($462 million). The surge was driven by a steady pipeline of high-budget productions including “Godzilla x Kong: Supernova,” “Voltron” and the second season of “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.” International features proved the largest growth area for Queensland, with expenditure more than tripling from the previous year through productions such as “Balls Up,” “Runner” and “Spa Weekend.”\n\n\tNew South Wales captured 31% of spending, followed by Victoria at 27%.\n\t\n\n\tGovernment support remained substantial, with total contributions reaching AUD$430 million ($284 million), including AUD$317 million ($209 million) from the Producer Offset. Post-production and visual effects work generated AUD$762 million ($504 million) in spending, up 33% year-over-year.\n\n\tBrennan emphasized the importance of data-driven decision-making in the current market environment. As part of Screen Australia’s Corporate Plan 2025-2029, the agency plans to expand its research program, including an updated Production Infrastructure and Capacity Analysis in 2026 and a comprehensive Screen Currency report measuring the economic, social and cultural value of Australian screen and games production.\n",

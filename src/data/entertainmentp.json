    "body": "\n\tSteven Spielberg probably doesn’t know this, but he served as an unlikely source of inspiration when it came to editing “Pillion,” the kinky and sexually graphic British sub-dom rom-com getting a limited release with A24 in the U.S. on Feb. 6 (before it expands wide on Feb. 20).\n\n\tIndeed, should the legendary filmmaker ever watch Harry Lighton’s acclaimed directorial debut — which recently landed three BAFTA nominations — he may notice how it adopts his ethos from “Jaws,” where he was famously frugal about revealing the actual shark.\n\t\n\n\tThat said, in the case of “Pillion” the monster from the deep isn’t a pneumatic Great White with notorious mechanical difficulties, but Alexander Skarsgård’s impressively-sized prosthetic penis.\n\n\n\tIn a pivotal early scene of the film, timid loner Colin (Harry Melling) has his first sexual encounter with hunky biker Ray (Skarsgård) in a dark alleyway. But for the moment when Ray unzips his leather trousers as a wide-eyed Colin kneels before him, the decision was made in post-production to, as it were, “not show the shark,” says editor Gareth C. Scales.\n\n\t“It’s a good-looking prosthetic penis,” he asserts. “But I think it was really important to see it through Colin’s eyes. You really want to it see it, but this way it makes you go, ‘Oh my gosh.’ You know who he is so you know he’s going to have some sort of incredible member, but it just felt fun to kind of keep it more as a mystery.”\n\n\tOf course, as anyone who watched the film on the giant screen of the Palais at its Cannes premiere or in the U.K. (where it released last year) will know, the “incredible member” isn’t kept entirely a mystery.\n\t\n\n\t“You do see the shaft coming out, but not the whole penis — we cut right before you think you’re going to see something,” admits Scales.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is flying its broomsticks and bubble chairs into homes, as the musical blockbuster will become available to stream on Peacock on March 20.\n\n\tIt will include a sing-along version, full-length commentary from director Jon M. Chu, deleted scenes and more bonus content.\n\n\tUniversal Pictures’ follow-up to 2024’s “Wicked” sees the return of Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba (a.k.a. the Wicked Witch of the West) and Ariana Grande’s Glinda in an Oz on the brink of chaos. Coinciding with the events of the original “Wizard of Oz” novel by L. Frank Baum and the 1939 Victor Fleming film, “Wicked: For Good” completes the alternate retelling of the iconic story from the Elphaba’s empathetic perspective.\n\t\n\n\tAlongside Erivo and Grande in the leading roles, “Wicked: For Good” sees the returns of Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero, Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard of Oz, Michelle Yeoh as Madam Morrible, Ethan Slater as Boq, Marissa Bode as Nessarose, Bowen Yang as Pfannee and Bronwyn James as ShenShen from the first film. Chu also returns to the sequel in the director’s chair.\n\n\n\tBoth “Wicked” films are based off of the 1995 novel, “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West” by Gregory Maguire and its Tony-award winning musical adaptation from Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman, which first hit broadway in 2003. Marc Platt and David Stone produced the play as well as both films.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” hit theaters on Nov. 21 and grossed $223 million at the worldwide box office during its opening weekend. It broke its 2024 predecessor’s record for the highest grossing opening weekend for a Broadway adaptation. The sequel went on to make $525 million worldwide, and Grande landed an Actors Award nomination for best supporting actress.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift has released the music video for “Opalite,” the second single off her latest album “The Life of a Showgirl,” featuring a slew of celebrity cameos — and a pet rock.\n\n\tThe video – which is currently only available to watch via Spotify or Apple Music — begins with a ’90s-style advertisement for Opalite, a cleaning spray promising to “magically transform your problems into your paradise. Using our state-of-the-art chemical potion, it works on friendships, couples, pets and co-workers.”\n\t\n\n\tAs the song “Opalite” begins to play, Swift unboxes a pet rock meant to be her new BFF. She and the rock make friendship bracelets, sing karaoke and go out to the bars together. The cameos then start coming — and there’s a pattern here, as it becomes clear that the video stars everyone Swift appeared with on “The Graham Norton Show” in October.\n\n\n\tGreta Lee cameos as a singer-songwriter on MTV, Jodie Turner-Smith is an exercise show host and Domhnall Gleeson is in an abusive relationship with his pet cactus. Tired of the constant cuts, Gleeson orders Opalite and sprays his cactus, causing Swift to magically appear in his house. The two then begin a relationship, even taking cheesy mall photos to solidify their bond (with Lewis Capaldi as the photographer). Murphy shows up not in person, but as an Opalite spokesperson pictured on an ad that Swift and Gleeson see at the mall, and Norton himself is an Opalite salesman.\n\n\tThe video ends with Swift and Gleeson performing at a dance competition in sparkly mint-green-and-orange tracksuits, concluding with a meta moment in the credits showing the video’s stars on “The Graham Norton Show.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a post on X about the video, Swift wrote that she remembers “thinking I got ridiculously lucky” with the group she was paired with for “The Graham Norton Show” and they were “all people whose work I’ve admired from afar.”\n\n\t“When we were all talking during the broadcast, Domhnall made a light hearted joke about wanting to be in one of my music videos. He’s Irish! He was joking! Except that in that moment during the interview, I was instantly struck with an *idea*,” Swift continued. “And so a week later he received an email script I’d written for the ‘Opalite’ video, where he was playing the starring role. I had this thought that it would be wild if all of our fellow guests on ‘The Graham Norton Show’ that night, including Graham himself, could be a part of it too. Like a school group project but for adults and it isn’t mandatory. To my delight, everyone from the show made the effort to time travel back to the 90’s with us and help with this video.”\n\n\tOn Wednesday, Swift teed up the release of the “Opalite” music video with a countdown on her website, much like many of the reveals in the “Showgirl” era. But this time she made it clear that the countdown was ticking toward 8 a.m. ET on Friday, when the visuals would debut on Apple Music and Spotify Premium. Those streaming services will have the video exclusively until Feb. 8 at 8 a.m. ET, when it will become available on YouTube.\n\n\t“Opalite” previously debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the first tracking week for “Showgirl.” The song has soldiered on as one of the higher-performing singles from the set, most recently lodging at No. 10 on the chart in its 17th week.\n\n\tDuring the rollout for “Showgirl,” Swift explained that “Opalite” is her fiancé Travis Kelce’s favorite song and elaborated on the meaning behind the track. “I think that’s his favorite. He loves that one,” she said. “That one was like, I have favorite words, favorite phrases, things I’ll put in an endless file of lyrics that I’m constantly going to go and cherry-pick from when I’m writing, and I had written down the word ‘opalite’ because I learned that it’s actually a manmade opal. Opal can be manmade just like diamonds, and Travis’ birthstone is opal so I’ve always fixated on that, I’ve always loved that stone and I thought it was a cool metaphor that it’s a manmade opal and that happiness can be manmade, too.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Life of a Showgirl” arrived in October, selling 2.7 million copies on its first day and later outpacing Adele’s “25” as the most-consumed album in Billboard 200 history. Swift focused first on lead single “The Fate of Ophelia,” releasing a music video as part of her “Official Release Party of a Showgirl” screenings and later putting up the video on YouTube. On the Hot 100, “Ophelia” became her 13th No. 1 single and spent 10 non-consecutive weeks atop the chart.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWegovy, a weight-loss drug that helps people slim down, is bulking up for its first appearance in the Super Bowl.\n\n\tNovo Nordisk, the drug’s manufacturer, purchased enough ad time from NBC to run a 90-second commercial in the third quarter of the game, expected to air Sunday, February 8. What’s more, the company has enlisted a broad team of famous faces — Kenan Thompson, DJ Khaled, Danielle Brooks, Ana Gasteyer, John C. Reilly and Danny Trejo — in a bid to appeal to many different viewers likely to be among the tens of millions watching the Big Game.\n\t\n\n\t“We chose to show up at the big game because it gives us a rare chance to speak to so many people atonce — to cut through clutter and start honest conversations about weight for people who wantto take a step toward better health.” says Ed Cinca, senior vice president, marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk.\n\n\n\tNovo Nordisk is putting so much into its Super Bowl appearance because it is touting Wegovy tablets that can be taken once a day, rather than the injectable format for which the drug is more commonly known. The drugmaker offers the pill as the market for weight-loss drugs is taking off. Indeed, two telehealth providers, Ro and Hims & Hers, will take to the Super Bowl this weekend to discuss the benefits of using their services to gain access to such medications.\n\n\tBut Novo’s introduction of the pill may be a bigger announcement. Experts believe making the drug available as an oral medication could spur even more interest from consumers, some of whom may be loath to inject themselves. As pricing for Wegovy and similar medications continues to decline, launch of a pill could spur new purchasing volume. Novo Nordisk said earlier this week that it expected sales and operating profit to fall in 2026. Compounding matters, Hims & Hers said it was launching a copycat version that would cost significantly less, though Novo’s CEO said that the discount medication would not be absorbed as easily.\n\t\n\n\tPart of the reason the ad is so long — most unveiled so far last just 30 or 60 seconds — is the mandate that pharmaceutical commercials disclose potential side effects. But another is to feature the spot’s diverse cast. The ad opens with Kenan Thompson, quickly followed by scenes of the other cast members, with many of them sharing different scenes. “Big news America!” Thompson shouts from the top of a water tower. “Wegovy now comes in a pill.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump posted a racist video to his Truth Social account late Thursday with an AI-generated video of the Obamas as apes.\n\n\tThe 62-second video, shared at 11:44 p.m. ET by the U.S. president, mostly runs through a conspiracy theory about the 2020 election alleging that voting machines in certain battleground states were rigged to favor Joe Biden. In the final few seconds of the segment, Barack and Michelle Obama are shown with their heads superimposed on ape bodies, smiling and dancing in a jungle setting to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”\n\t\n\n\tAs of Friday morning, the clip was still available on Trump’s account.\n\n\n\tIn a response to a request for comment from Variety, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an emailed statement, “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King. Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”\n\n\tThe full AI video that the White House cited was posted in October 2025. In addition to portraying the Obamas as apes, Trump is shown as a lion. Democrats featured in the video included Joe Biden as a baboon, Kamala Harris as a tortoise, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as a zebra, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries as a meerkat, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a donkey, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani as a hyena, and Hillary Clinton as a warthog.\n\n\tThe watermark on the “Lion King” video indicated it was created an account called @xerias_x. That’s the same account that made the AI-generated video Trump shared in October 2025 on Truth Social showing Trump as a king in a fighter jet dropping a huge payload of fecal matter on “No Kings” protesters in New York City.\n\t\n\n\tCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom’s press office on X called the video post with the Obamas as apes “disgusting behavior by the President” and called on “every single Republican” to “denounce this.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMotion Picture Exchange (MPX) is launching worldwide sales at Berlin’s upcoming European Film Market on slasher film “Big Baby,” which is directed by Spider One and executive produced by Cher.\n\n\tSpider One — who besides being a director is the founder and frontman of the rock band Powerman 5000 and is also Rob Zombie’s younger brother — recently helmed 2024 horror movie “Little Bites,” which was released exclusively on AMC Networks’ Shudder streaming service. Cher also executive produced “Little Bites.”\n\t\n\n\t“Big Baby” is about a horror screenwriter named Adam Lewis, whose latest script is inspired by a recurring nightmare of a maniacal killer in a baby mask. “When those visions begin to bleed into real life, Adam must confront his unraveling mind and stop the nightmare he may be bringing to life,” says the film’s synopsis.\n\n\n\tLeading the film’s cast are Brandon Scott (“Dead to Me,” “Channel Zero”) and Krsy Fox (“Terrifier 3”), alongside Cameron Cowperthwaite (“Fallout”), Catherine Corcoran, Torio Van Grol, Adam Marcinowski, Sierra McCormick and Chaz Bono (“American Horror Story”).\n\n\t“Big Baby” is written and directed by Spider One and produced by OneFox Productions, which is led by Spider One and Krsy Fox, with Cher executive producing.\n\n\t“I’m thrilled to be partnering with MPX,” said Spider One in a statement. “They immediately connected with the insane, psychological, meta, slasher madness of ‘Big Baby!'” The director went on to point out that MPX execs “recognized how the film brutally carves out its own distinctive space in the genre.”\n\n\tCommented MPX co-founder and president Ryan Bury: “What grabbed us about ‘Big Baby’ wasn’t just the premise, it was how far Spider One pushes it.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “The film is bold, personal and unapologetically twisted, with a voice that feels distinctly its own. This is the kind of psychological slasher that horror fans will talk about for ages and we’re excited to bring it to buyers at EFM and introduce them to the new killer in town.”\n",

An encore presentation will air at 8 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock. Cable-cutters can tune into the global event through a variety of Live TV streamers with access to NBC such as DirecTV, Hulu + Live TV and Sling TV (in select markets).\n\t\n\n\tMariah Carey will be singing in Italian at the opening ceremony, while Andrea Bocelli will belt out arias in Italian, English, French and Spanish, duetting with Chris Stapleton and Colombia’s Karol G. Other performers include one of Italian cinema’s leading men, Pierfrancesco Favino; actor Sabrina Impacciatore, known for her breakout role in “The White Lotus”; Italian popstar Laura Pausini; Chinese pianist Lang Lang, accompanied by opera singer Cecilia Bartoli; and rapper Ghali.\n\n\n\tSports veteran Mary Carillo will take up co-hosting duties for NBC’s coverage of the ceremony, replacing Savannah Guthrie, who is focused on the abduction of her mother, Nancy. Carillo, who will be working her 17th Olympic Games, will join Terry Gannon, who had previously been announced as a co-host.\n\n\tThe Milan Cortina Games will also be the most spread-out Olympics ever. Besides airing from Milan, the curtain-raiser will beam from three Alpine venues — Cortina d’Ampezzo, Livigno and Predazzo — to a global audience estimated at more than 2 billion viewers. In the U.S., the Games will get full-court-press treatment from NBC and Peacock. In Europe, HBO Max will stream the competition alongside local broadcasters. \n\t\n\n\tStream the Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony live online here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tRotten Tomatoes‘ parent company Versant is denying any tampering is going on with the “Melania” audience scores on the review aggregator website. The Amazon MGM-backed documentary has a 99% audience score compared to a disastrous 7% critics score as of the Friday morning heading into “Melania’s” second weekend of release. The huge divide between the scores has led many to wonder if MAGA-supported bots are being used to drive up the audience score.\n\t\n\n\t“There has been no bot manipulation on the audience reviews for the ‘Melania’ documentary,” Versant said in a statement to Variety. “Reviews displayed on the Popcornmeter are VERIFIED reviews, meaning it has been verified that users have bought a ticket to the film.”\n\n\n\tJimmy Kimmel questioned the documentary’s audience scores during his Feb. 4 monologue when he said: “As of tonight, Melania has a score of 5% on Rotten Tomatoes from the critics. That is very low. To put that in perspective, that is 1% lower than ‘Gigli.’ The audience score for ‘Melania’ is 99% positive, which is 1% higher than ‘The Godfather.’ And I’m sure Donald J. Corleone had nothing to do with that at all.”\n\n\tKimmel added, “We need to get to the bottom of this. Send in Tulsi Gabbard and the FBI! Seize the ticket machines, the popcorn buckets, the box office receipts, at every multiplex in America!”\n\n\tPer Rolling Stone: “Melania Trump’s new documentary is now the film with the biggest disparity between critic and audience reviews in Rotten Tomatoes history.”\n\n\t“Melania,” directed by Brett Ratner, follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to her husband Donald’s second presidential inauguration. The film opened to $7 million domestically, a strong start for a documentary feature but not the best start for a movie that Amazon bought for $40 million and then spent $35 million to market.\n\t\n\n\tAs Variety reported, the audience for “Melania” during its opening weekend was 72% female and 83% over the age of 45. Nearly 75% of ticket buyers were white, according to PostTrak data.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Recording Academy Honors Presented by the Black Music Collective has established itself as one of Grammy Week’s most prominent fixtures, and the 2026 edition, held last Thursday at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles, was no exception.\n\n\t“Honoring Brandy, Kirk and Pharrell at this year’s Recording Academy Honors was a powerful reminder of how visionary artistry and fearless creativity shape our culture,” said Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy. “It was an honor to recognize their legacy and continue our commitment to celebrating and uplifting excellence in the Black music community.”\n\t\n\n\tPharrell Williams received the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, recognizing a career that has reshaped pop, hip-hop, fashion and creative culture. Brandy and Kirk Franklin were honored with the Black Music Icon Award for their foundational roles in R&B and gospel, while Eve was recognized for her contributions to the Roots’ 1999 smash “You Got Me,” a moment that helped rectify a notable error in hip-hop history from more than two decades ago.\n\n\n\tFor honorary chair Valeshia Butterfield, the night served as a marker of how far the Black Music Collective has come since its formation during the early months of the pandemic. “Almost six years later,” she said, reflecting on the organization’s origins, “to see what happened last night is just the testament.”\n\n\t“I remember when I first got the call from the Academy and from [CEO of The Recording Academy] Harvey Mason Jr., who was the chair of the board at the time: ‘Hey, you know, we’re looking for a new and our first ever chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer,’” recalled Butterfield. “These were the early days of COVID, no one knew how long it would last.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJustin Timberlake (left) with producers Massah David and Miatta Johnson (Photo: Jorge Meza) \n\t\n\n\n\n\tOne week into that role, George Floyd was murdered. Butterfield says the moment accelerated the work. “I knew what to do, which was to build out a real plan,” she said. That plan eventually became the Black Music Collective, sparked by an idea from trustee Rick Morales and developed over months alongside Mason and Jerry O. Johnson. “Almost six years later,” Butterfield added, “to see what happened last night is just the testament.”\n\n\tOnstage, that evolution played out through performances that treated legacy as something living, not frozen. Music director Adam Blackstone approached each tribute with tight parameters and clear intent. “I could [play] Brandy for two hours,” he said. “But they say, all right, bro, you got 10 minutes.”\n\n\tThat constraint produced one of the evening’s most talked-about sequences. British girl group Flo delivered a confident take on “The Boy Is Mine,” bridging eras and highlighting Brandy’s direct imprint on contemporary R&B. Another generational throughline came via Coco Jones, who performed “Full Moon,” a nod to Brandy’s 2002 single and album. Earlier in the evening, Kehlani performed “I Wanna Be Down” which Blackstone intentionally selected as Brandy’s latest release is a remix of Kehlani’s Grammy-winning “Folded.” “I always want to tell a story through the music,” Blackstone said. “And make sure people go on this journey.”\n\n\tWhen Brandy accepted her honor, she struck a characteristically grounded tone, describing herself as “humbly just a vessel,” a sentiment that echoed the evening’s broader framing of legacy as stewardship.\n\n\tSurprise remained part of the program’s DNA. Justin Timberlake appeared in a 10-minute performance tied to Pharrell’s honor, a moment kept tightly under wraps. Executive producer Massah David described the logistics as “a beast,” noting that Pharrell’s involvement was managed under an alias simply listed as “special guest.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPharrell, Dr. Dre and Harvey Mason Jr. (Photo: Jorge Meiza)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJorge Meza\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“His name wasn’t on anything,” David said. “We were very methodical about the way that we handled it.” According to co-executive producer Miatta Johnson, even close collaborators were left guessing.\n\t\n\n\tNow in its fifth consecutive year under the executive production of David and Johnson’s MVD Inc., the BMC Honors has developed a reputation for precision rather than excess. “They’re not just events,” Johnson said. “When you are amplifying voices and putting people on a platform globally to appreciate and understand and experience Black music, that’s not a small feat.”\n\n\tDavid echoed that philosophy, emphasizing that recognition doesn’t always align neatly with award cycles. “Not every year is going to be your year,” she said. “But we want to make sure that we never miss those moments.”\n\n\tBeyond the ceremony, BMC continues to expand its reach through education initiatives, masterclasses and partnerships with Amazon Music and the Quinn Coleman Fund. “A lot of this work we do quietly,” Butterfield noted, “but you’ll be hearing more about it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Laura Friedman are seeking assurances from Netflix and Paramount Skydance that they will protect Hollywood jobs if allowed to acquire Warner Bros.\n\n\tIn a letter to the heads of both companies, the Democratic lawmakers cited a dramatic decline in domestic production, and noted with alarm that both companies have pledged to cut billions in costs as part a potential merger.\n\n\n\t“We’ve continued to watch as these jobs, and many companies, have left the United States altogether for foreign venues abroad,” they wrote. “We expect and look forward to your companies’ public commitments to protecting, growing and reassuring the hundreds of thousands of industry workers and their families in your respective bids.”\n\t\n\n\tThe letter follows a Senate antitrust hearing on Tuesday, at which Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos promised to increase domestic production levels, focusing in particularly on the development of its new studio in New Jersey.\n\n\n\tBoth Schiff and Friedman hail from a San Fernando Valley district where much of the industry’s below-the-line workforce resides. The letter seeks commitments specifically to Los Angeles, which has seen a sharp downturn in production since 2022.\n\n\t“How will your company ensure that Hollywood and California remain central to your production and investment strategy?” the lawmakers wrote. “What concrete steps will you take to preserve and expand good-paying film and television jobs in Los Angeles?”\n\n\tSchiff and Friedman also noted that they are working on bipartisan legislation to create a federal film incentive, which would augment state-based tax credits.\n\t\n\n\tThey wrote that the bill — yet to be introduced — will be “modeled after successful state programs in California, Louisiana, Georgia, and many others, so that the United States can remain competitive in the global market. We view this as a tool to not just protect but encourage more domestic filming and sustainable job creation on American soil.”\n\n\tThey invited Sarandos and David Ellison, CEO of Paramount Skydance, to offer their support for such a measure and explain how it would help them keep production jobs in the U.S.\n\n\tThe letter also seeks commitments that the studios will continue to employ union labor and that they will use AI in a way that does not displace workers.\n\n\tNetflix has agreed to buy the Warner Bros. film and TV studios business and HBO Max for $83 billion. Paramount has pursued a hostile bid — which has been repeatedly rebuffed — for all of Warner Bros. Discovery. Either deal would have to win the approval of the Justice Department to move forward.\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount hopes a new sequel to “Paranormal Activity” will get the summer of 2027 off to a spooky start. The studio will release the latest film in the found-footage horror franchise on May 21, 2027. It currently lacks a title.\n\n\tJames Wan and Jason Blum will produce the picture through their company, Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, which is co-financing with Paramount. Oren Peli, the director of the 2007 original, will also produce through his Solana Films banner. The first film was shot for $15,000, made a stir on the festival circuit and then was acquired by Paramount, which spent $200,000 more to create a new ending. When it opened in theaters in 2009, it went on to earn $194 million globally, becoming one of the most profitable films in history.\n\t\n\n\tThere have been seven films in the series, including “Paranormal Activity 2” (2010), “Paranormal Activity 3” (2011), “Paranormal Activity 4” (2012), “The Marked Ones” (2014), “The Ghost Dimension” (2015), and “Next of Kin” (2021). The franchise has grossed over $900 million at the worldwide box office.\n\n\n\tThe new “Paranormal Activity” is directed by Ian Tuason. Plot details are being kept under wraps, but they probably involve something demonic and creepy (we’re just guessing!). Paramount announced plans for the sequel shortly after the company was acquired last year by Skydance Media, which has been actively trying to bolster the studio’s moribund film slate.\n\n\tThe latest “Paranormal” will face off against “Bad Fairies,” a Warner Bros. animated family comedy that’s geared to a very different demographic. The next weekend brings “Star Wars: Starfighter,” Shawn Levy and Ryan Gosling’s attempt to revitalize the space opera saga for the big screen.\n\t\n\n\tWan is the director of “Saw” and “The Conjuring.” Blum has produced such horror hits as “Get Out” and “The Purge.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMatt Damon and Ben Affleck continued their press tour for Netflix’s “The Rip” with an interview on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” where the eponymous podcast host and Damon reflected on cancel culture in Hollywood. The Oscar nominee said some canceled actors probably would’ve preferred to gone to jail and serve time than deal with the never-ending turmoil that comes with “cancel culture.”\n\n\tRogan described being “canceled” as “this idea that one thing you said or one thing you did, and now we’re going to exaggerate that to the fullest extent and cast you out of civilization for life” (via The Daily Beast).\n\t\n\n\t“In perpetuity,” Damon replied about the forever nature of cancel culture. “Because I bet some of those people would have preferred to go to jail for 18 months or whatever, and then come out and say, ‘I paid my debt. Like, we’re done. Like, can we be done?’ The thing about that getting kind of excoriated, publicly like that, it just never ends. And it’s the first thing that… you know, it just will follow you to the grave.”\n\n\n\tDamon knows a thing or two about surviving internet outrage. He infamously combated cancel culture in 2021 when an interview he gave to the The Sunday Times earned backlash due to the actor saying he had stopped using the F-slur only “months ago” because his daughter wrote him a “treatise” on “how that word is dangerous.” Damon clarified in a statement to Variety soon after that he never used the word in his “personal life” and does not “use slurs of any kind.” He also affirmed that he understands why the interview “led many to assume the worst.”\n\t\n\n\t“During a recent interview, I recalled a discussion I had with my daughter where I attempted to contextualize for her the progress that has been made – though by no means completed – since I was growing up in Boston and, as a child, heard the word ‘f*g’ used on the street before I knew what it even referred to,” Damon wrote in a statement. “I explained that that word was used constantly and casually and was even a line of dialogue in a movie of mine as recently as 2003;  she in turn expressed incredulity that there could ever have been a time where that word was used unthinkingly. To my admiration and pride, she was extremely articulate about the extent to which that word would have been painful to someone in the LGBTQ+ community regardless of how culturally normalized it was. I not only agreed with her but thrilled at her passion, values and desire for social justice.”\n\n\tDamon continued, “I have never called anyone ‘f****t’ in my personal life and this conversation with my daughter was not a personal awakening. I do not use slurs of any kind,” Damon continued. “I have learned that eradicating prejudice requires active movement toward justice rather than finding passive comfort in imagining myself ‘one of the good guys’. And given that open hostility against the LGBTQ+ community is still not uncommon, I understand why my statement led many to assume the worst. To be as clear as I can be, I stand with the LGBTQ+ community.”\n\n\tDespite the controversy, Damon’s career was not impacted in any major way and he went on to have starring roles in “Air,” “Oppenheimer” and more. He’ll be back on the big screen later this year in the lead role of Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey.”\n\n\tWatch Damon and Affleck’s full interview on “The Joe Rogan Experience” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo new guests are checking into “The White Lotus” Season 4. Variety has learned that both Steve Coogan and Caleb Jonte Edwards have been cast in the upcoming season of the hit HBO series.\n\n\tAs is usually the case with “The White Lotus,” exact character and plot details are being kept under wraps. The two new additions join previously announced cast members Alexander Ludwig and AJ Michalka. While there has been speculation about other actors joining the show, these are the only confirmed castings to date. \n\t\n\n\tAs previously reported, Season 4 will take place in France, including Paris and multiple locations along the French Riviera. Series mastermind Mike White is the writer, director, and executive producer. David Bernad and Mark Kamine also executive produce. \n\n\n\tThe role will mark one of Edwards’ first onscreen credits. Prior to this, his only credited television role was an episode of the Australian crime drama “Black Snow.”  \n\n\tCoogan is a highly-accomplished comedian and actor. He is known for multiple projects in which he has played the character of Alan Partridge, most recently in 2025’s “How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge)” for BBC One. In film, Coogan is known for parts in features such as the “Night at the Museum” franchise, the “Despicable Me” films, “Philomena,” and “Tropic Thunder.” In addition to starring in “Philomena,” he also co-wrote it and shared in its Academy Award nominations for best adapted screenplay and best picture. He and Rob Brydon have also aired multiple entries in their successful “The Trip” series, with the fifth entry — “The Trip to the Northern Lights” — being announced in summer 2025. \n\t\n\n\tCoogan is represented by CAA and Independent Talent Group. Edwards is repped by Echo Lake Entertainment and Eaton Management.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere’s a key and somewhat disturbing element to “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” that might get lost in translation as it moves from the U.K. to the U.S. \n\n\tIn Nia DaCosta’s wild and bloody sequel to “28 Years Later,” much of the story is focused on Jack O’Connell’s Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal, the devil-worshipping and sadistic cult leader of a gang of murderous misfits. Their name: The Jimmies (among the members are Jimmy Ink, Jimmy Jones, Jimmy Shite and Jimmima). Their look: colourful tracksuits and long, white-haired wigs.\n\t\n\n\tMany viewers — especially those outside the U.K. — may assume the distinct choice of name and appearance is simply to add a further splash of lunacy to an already bonkers film. After all, “The Bone Temple” also features a scene in which the gigantic, head-from-body-ripping Alphie zombie Samson dances to Duran Duran with Ralph Fiennes’ skull-collecting doctor while stark naked and absolutely ripped on morphine.\n\n\n\tBut there’s more to it. The Jimmies — and their disturbed, pseudo-evangelical head — take their inspiration from one of the U.K.’s most notorious figures, Jimmy Savile.\n\n\tInstantly recognizable on home soil for for his eccentric appearance (tracksuits, white hair and plenty of bling), Savile was an icon in the U.K., a longstanding radio and children’s TV star on the BBC who was knighted in 1990 for his services to charity. But not long after his death in 2011, he was found to have been a prolific sex offender for upwards of six decades. Hundreds of allegations emerged, with many of his victims including young children and the elderly. The revelations, exposing how one of the country’s best known and most beloved personalities could abuse their fame in such a horrific manner, shook the U.K.\n\t\n\n\tFor DaCosta, who freely acknowledges that audiences in the U.S. are unlikely to get the reference, with Savile never a well-known figure Stateside, The Jimmies are there because the “The Bone Temple” deals with the “intentional perversion” of various societal themes.\n\n\t“So there’s the perversion of dogma and religion, but there’s also the perversion of childhood memories and childhood media,” she says.\n\n\tThe zombie franchise’s crucial Rage virus broke out in the first “28 Days Later,” set in 2001. At the start of “28 Years Later,” we see the young Jimmy Crystal watching children’s TV right before he witnesses his dad become an infected zombie in exceptional brutal fashion. Crucially, this is it all set before Savile’s crimes would come to light 10 years later. So in Jimmy’s eyes in the alternative reality of the films, he’s still someone to look up to and — later — emulate.\n\n\t“So there’s a world that ends in 2001 and for a character like Jimmy, whose life is destroyed in such an intense way, he sees these things — the ‘Teletubbies’ are on TV and his dad’s then body surfing on these infected — so what is the media he’s consumed?” she says. “Because of that, I think he uses these images and perverts them — and that was really important to us.”\n\n\tDaCosta admits she first read Alex Garland’s script and didn’t think for a second about Savile (although she says she knew about him, having been in the U.K. shooting “Top Boy” when the story broke). For O’Connell, as a Brit of a certain age, it was a different matter.\n\n\tFor the actor, his understanding of the reference is also a comment on the “unchecked power” Savile was able to wield in his lifetime.\n\n\t“He’s a hangover for Sir Jimmy of a time when popular culture existed — he doesn’t know what we know,” he notes. \n\n\t“But he’s definitely there to be unsettling.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Lawrence said during a recent “Happy Sad Confused” podcast interview that she missed out on playing Sharon Tate opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt in Quentin Tarantino‘s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” because her internet critics said she was not “pretty enough.” Margot Robbie landed the role. \n\n\t“Happy Sad Confused” podcast host Josh Horowitz was reminiscing on how Tarantino once expressed interest in working with Lawrence and having her play Tate in the movie, to which the Oscar winner replied: “Well, he did, and then everybody was like, ‘She’s not pretty enough to play Sharon Tate.’\n\t\n\n\t“I’m pretty sure it is true,” Lawrence continued (via Entertainment Weekly). “Or it’s that thing where I’ve been telling the story this way for so long that I believe it. No, but I’m pretty sure that happened. Or he just was never considering me for the part, and the internet just, like, went out of their way to call me ugly.”\n\n\n\tTarantino appeared on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast in 2021 and revealed he had “flirted” with the idea of Lawrence starring in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” only at the time he was interested in casting her as Manson girl Squeaky Fromme.\n\n\t“I couldn’t be happier with what Dakota Fanning did — it’s one of the best performances in the movie. She’s amazing as Squeaky Fromme. She becomes her. But early on, I investigated the idea of Jennifer Lawrence playing Squeaky,” Tarantino admitted. “So she read it, and afterward we talked about it a little bit… something didn’t work out.. But she’s a very nice person, and I respect her as an actress.”\n\t\n\n\tIt turns out this was not the first time Tarantino had courted Lawrence, who also revealed on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast that she turned down an offer to star in “The Hateful Eight” as the battered Daisy. The role was played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who earned an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. \n\n\t“I turned it down,” Lawrence said. “I should not have done [that].”\n\n\tAs for “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” word about Lawrence and Robbie both being up for the role of Sharon Tate became widespread enough at the time that Tate’s sister, Debra, issued a statement to TMZ saying she was more in support of Robbie landing the role.\n\n\t“They are both extremely accomplished actresses, but I would have to say my pick would be Margot,” Debra said at the time. “Simply because of her physical beauty and the way she carries herself — it’s similar to that of Sharon. I don’t think as much about Jennifer Lawrence — not that I have anything against her. She’s just, I don’t know, she’s not pretty enough to play Sharon. That’s a horrible thing to say, but I have my standards.”\n\n\tDebra later spoke to Vanity Fair after the film opened and praised Robbie’s portrayal of Sharon, saying: “She made me cry because she sounded just like Sharon. The tone in her voice was completely Sharon, and it just touched me so much that big tears [started falling]. The front of my shirt was wet. I actually got to see my sister again… nearly 50 years later.”\n\n\tWatch Lawrence’s full interview on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn “Night Patrol,” now in theaters via RLJE Films and Shudder, two cops (Jermaine Fowler and Justin Long) work to protect the Los Angeles streets. But when Long’s officer is inducted into an all-white vampire cop squad, violence escalates in wild ways.\n\n\tRyan Prows, who directed the film and wrote it with Shaye Ogbonna, Tim Cairo and Jake Gibson, blends comedy, drama and real-life anxieties into this horror-action movie. Prows spoke with Variety about how modern concerns about race and policing ended up in a fantastical film.\n\t\n\n\t“How do you talk about something very current and real and scary?” he said. “If you’re making a horror film, but it’s what really scares you, you don’t want a soapbox. That’s the cool thing about genre and horror: You can still couch that in having fun and having the release valves in there. Hopefully, it’s a fun ride and you care about the characters and the tension is there, but afterwards you can grab a coffee and talk about what the movie meant or deeper stuff. But I make sure it’s still character first, then scenario, and obviously we’ve built this bigger point that we want to talk about, but not poke you in the eye with it.”\n\n\n\tFor a movie that throws a lot of complex ideas at audiences, Prows knew he needed a cast willing to push themselves and work in the film’s dark vibe. To achieve this, he mashed up a group of unique actors (including Long, Fowler, CM Punk and Dermot Mulroney) and musicians (like Freddie Gibbs, YG and Flying Lotus).\n\n\t“You have these colliding forces from all these different worlds,” Prows says. “The strength of the film is that they’re coming from opposite ends. When we were casting and building out the film, the big thing to me was, ‘Are you committed?’ Everyone was game to show up and ready to throw in. Those are the folks you want to surround yourself with and bring into the film.”\n\t\n\n\tUltimately, all of these game artists were able to create a genre-shifting movie that aims to entertain and provoke discussion. Yet Prows says finding the right tone and tightroping genres was an exercise in trial and error.\n\n\t“We’re writing the script, and it’s like, ‘Okay, we’re forcing the joke here a little too much,’ or maybe, ‘This feels a little too dry,’ or, ‘We’re kind of missing the mark here,'” he says. “But there’s not a big wide berth between the most heinous stuff in your life and when you’re laughing at someone who tripped and split their pants or whatever goofy shit. To me, that’s life.\n\n\t“I think it also helps when you have no clue where the movie’s heading,” Prows continues. “As a filmgoer, I’m always excited about the ‘Wow, that did not end where I thought that was going to!'”\n\n\tWatch the “Night Patrol” trailer below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers from the series premiere of “Star Trek: Starfleet Academy,” titled “Kids These Days.” \n\n\t“Star Trek: Starfleet Academy” comes out phasers blasting right out of the gate, with a premiere episode that ranks not only among the best of the newest “Trek” series but with any throughout the franchise. \n\n\tWe open with a narration from the half-Lanthanite Capt. Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter), explaining the cataclysmic impact of The Burn, a deadly cosmic event in the 32nd century that occurred during the events of “Star Trek: Discovery.” In the aftermath of The Burn, the United Federation of Planets all but collapsed, and some of the high-minded ideals of Starfleet fell by the wayside.\n\t\n\n\tCut to a remote Federation outpost. Anisha Mir (Tatiana Maslany) is accused of aiding a space pirate by the name of Nus Braka (Paul Giamatti) — a part-Klingon, part-Tellarite — in attempting to hijack a Federation food supply shuttle, with the pilot of the shuttle dying during the attempt. Ake serves as the judge overseeing the proceedings, sentencing Braka to life in prison. \n\n\n\tBraka has a definite over the top, theatrical quality to him, something Giamatti was all too happy to play. “He’s a bit of a ham bone,” Giamatti says with a laugh. “So it was really fun to do. He was meant to come across as more of a buffoon than he actually turns out to be.”\n\n\tAlthough Ake wants to be merciful, Anisha aided a crime that resulted in the death of a Federation officer. Given that, Ake sentences her to a rehabilitation camp and separates her from her young son, Caleb. Before she is dragged away by the guards, Anisha screams to Caleb, “Don’t trust [the Federation]!” \n\t\n\n\tAke attempts to comfort Caleb, but he quickly escapes Federation custody and strikes out on his own. \n\n\tFast forward 15 years. A now adult Caleb (Sandro Rosta) is a wanted fugitive who is still desperately searching for his mother. An epic fight on an alien prison transport is not enough to free himself, and Caleb ends up in lockdown. \n\n\tRosta, who is fresh out of drama school and had never done stunt work before, credits the show’s stunt team with helping him through that fight. “They helped me throughout the entire process, and they knew that I was into it,” Rosta says. “They knew that I was game. So they let me do as much of it as possible, even the slamming against the walls and stuff.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Ake has resigned her commission and is living a peaceful life. But when she hears they are reopening Starfleet Academy and want her to be the new chancellor, she cannot refuse. \n\n\tShe’s finally able to track down Caleb and offers him a choice — join the Academy or stay in prison. She sweetens the offer by promising to help him locate his mother, whom she says broke out of prison one year ago.\n\n\tCaleb, a perpetual lone wolf, is none too happy to be at the Academy. In addition to the campus in San Francisco, the students spend a great deal of time on the U.S.S. Athena, a fully-functioning starship that functions as a sort of mobile classroom. We also get a greater sense of Ake’s leadership style, which includes a much more laidback approach than a traditional Starfleet captain — laying out across the captain’s chair, not wearing shoes, etc. \n\n\t“My character’s name, Nala, in one translation means ‘water in the desert,'” Hunter says. “I thought that was really fantastic for so many different reasons. I thought of water not just to drink, but kind of maybe to feel. I wanted to be fluid. Then I also thought about like being almost a cat, almost a feline energy, but also a fun energy. When you’re 423 years old, there are many, many things that fall away, and the most important things distinguish themselves.”\n\n\tUpon arrival, Caleb meets his fellow classmates, including: pacifist Klingon Jay-Den Kraag (Karim Diané), the holographic (or photonic) Kasqian student Sam (Kerrice Brooks), the hard-driving Dar-Sha cadet Genesis Lythe (Bella Shepard), and the cocky Khionian Darem Reymi (George Hawkins). Caleb also quickly runs afoul of cadet master Lura Thok (Gina Yashere), a half-Klingon half-Jem’Hadar, as well as The Doctor (Robert Picardo). \n\t\n\n\tThe Athena begins its journey to Earth. Caleb uses an old subspace frequency his mother taught him to send her a message, but receives no reply. But when the Athena attempts to investigate a space anomaly, they are ambushed by Nus Braka and his gang. They disable the ship using programmable matter, with Braka telling Ahke that they tracked the Athena using Caleb’s message. Nus demands that Ahke surrender the Athena’s warp core or risk the whole ship and its crew being destroyed. \n\n\tIn keeping with Braka’s theatrical nature, his appearance includes funky clothes, unique finger armor, and ritual tattoos and scarring. “Earth pirates of the 18th century, they kind of went everywhere on the planet,” Giamatti says. “I thought, ‘Well, this guy’s been everywhere in the galaxy.’ And I thought it’d be interesting if he’s kind of a map of where he’s been.”\n\n\tCaleb is devastated that he put others at risk, telling Ake that he can get the programmable matter off the ship. He and his classmates get to work, with Ake stalling Braka for time. Genesis and Darem set off to gather programmable matter off the hull, with Darem able to briefly survive in the vacuum of space thanks to his Khionian nature. \n\n\tAt the same time, Jay-Den is forced to perform emergency surgery on Thok, who was injured in Braka’s initial attack. Although at first he is nervous, Jay-Den manages to save her life. Darem is able to get to the programmable matter, but he is on the verge of death as he does so. Genesis uses the ship’s tractor beam at the last minute to pull him back to safety. \n\n\tAke fakes a core breach to get Braka off the ship, with the Klingarite reluctantly leaving. That gives Caleb the window he needs to rush to engineering and attempt to pull off his plan. He is caught in a sneak attack by Braka, who goads Caleb by telling him he broke Caleb’s mother out of prison. The two engage in a knockdown drag out fight, with Caleb eventually coming out on top and disabling the programmable matter. Braka jumps into a nearby escape pod and gets away. \n\n\tRosta praises Giamatti’s willingness to make space for him despite the great difference in their experience levels as actors.\n\n\t“That part of the scene where he smashes my head on the console, that came from a suggestion that I that I had in the moment,” Rosta says. “I was like, ‘Man, if I bust your head on it and you bust my head on it, I think that’d be kind of cool.’ And Paul was like, ‘We’re doing that. We’re freaking doing that!’ — and we did it. And that just shows how much he’s willing to give space to me, a younger and less experienced actor, to have a moment of expression.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Athena arrives safely at Starfleet Academy in San Francisco. Caleb could very well be kicked out for what happened on the journey, but Ake is able to convince the higher ups to simply punish him and allow him to stay. She and Caleb have a heart to heart, where she reveals her own son was killed in The Burn. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAs of 5 p.m. PT, Oscar nomination voting is officially closed.\n\n\tMultiple conversations with Academy voters all throughout this week have revealed a race far more unpredictable than the pundits’ consensus suggests. While some categories appear locked, others are poised for the kind of upheaval we haven’t seen since 2003, when “The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King” dominated, but nominations surprised across multiple categories, such as Keisha Castle-Hughes, Samantha Morton, Djimon Hounsou, Shohreh Aghdashloo and Marcia Gay Harden, along with a rare lone director nomination for another Brazilian auteur, Fernando Meirelles).\n\t\n\n\tHere are some of the revelations learned this week from voters:\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe “F1” factor\t\n\n\tJoseph Krasinski’s “F1” from Apple Original Films is very well-liked among voters and feels like a viable entry in the best picture race. The old Academy guard loves it. Voters repeatedly describe it as “great” and “good old-school entertainment,” the kind of movie that could easily claim one of the 10 best picture slots despite a solid, albeit not overtly passionate, critical reception. Don’t underestimate the power of the older voters who built this industry. This Brad Pitt and Damson Idris vehicle could zoom into the race, also given it has support to land three tech noms such as film editing, sound and visual effects and mimic a previous contender like “Ford v Ferrari” (2019).\n\n\t“I fucking love that movie,” one anonymous voter of the Producers Branch says.\n\n\tThink of it like “comfort food” with AMPAS members.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeon\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe International Film Split\t\n\n\tThe international enthusiasm is genuine, but it’s also fractured. Neon has flooded the zone with non-English-language films, creating an unexpected problem: vote splitting.\n\t\n\n\tNorway’s “Sentimental Value,” Brazil’s “The Secret Agent,” South Korea’s “No Other Choice” and France’s “It Was Just an Accident” all have aspirations beyond the international feature category, particularly in best picture. More importantly, they are vying for attention from voters who frankly don’t watch as many movies as industry insiders assume.\n\n\t“Sentimental Value” is undoubtedly the priority watch among the titles, sailing toward multiple nominations, including best picture, possibly director, and three or four acting nods. But here’s the revelation that matters: “It Was Just an Accident,” while admired and respected, may not have the broad support to crack picture, director or screenplay. Some conversations with voters also suggest it could be one of the big snubs of the day, including in international feature, where the race is surprisingly competitive.\n\n\t“That movie [‘It Was Just an Accident’] never came up in my algorithm,” one voter admits. “I don’t know what that is.”\n\n\tTunisia’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” has considerable support. Also watch for “Kukoho” from Japan, “The President’s Cake” from Iraq, Switzerland’s “Late Shift,” Taiwan’s “Left Handed Girl” (co-written by last year’s four-time Oscar winner Sean Baker) and Germany’s “Sound of Falling.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“One Battle After Another“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett C\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhy the surplus rule could decide the director race.\t\n\n\tThis year’s director race may be decided less by passion and more by mathematics.\n\n\tUnder the Academy’s preferential nomination system, voters rank their choices. Once ballots are cast, a “magic number” — the quota required to secure a nomination — is calculated. For most categories, that number is determined by dividing the total ballots by six and adding one. For the best picture category, it’s the total ballots divided by 11, plus one.\n\n\tHere’s where the surplus rule comes in.\n\n\tIf a contender receives significantly more votes than needed to hit that quota, those extra votes are not discarded. Instead, they are redistributed — at a reduced, fractional value — to the voter’s second choice (or third, if the second choice is already safe). In best picture, this redistribution is triggered when a film receives 10% more than the quota; in other categories, it’s triggered at 20%.\n\t\n\n\tThe goal is to prevent wasted votes and reward consensus.\n\n\tThis is why Paul Thomas Anderson’s strength could quietly reshape the director lineup beneath him. If Anderson overwhelmingly clears the quota (which many think he might), his surplus votes could be redistributed across secondary choices — and those choices are not uniform. Some Anderson voters lean toward Josh Safdie, others toward Guillermo del Toro, Joachim Trier or Ryan Coogler.\n\n\t“I love Guillermo,” one voter declares. “I’ll vote for him every time, no matter what.”\n\n\tI have found that a “One Battle After Another” voter tends to be a “Marty Supreme” voter, but what is clear is that loving “One Battle” does not automatically translate to voting for Safdie. That fragmentation makes the director race unusually fluid and dangerously close.\n\n\tThis may be one of the tightest director lineups in years.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsabrina lantos\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucky number seven in best actor, but which will be the luckier five?\t\n\n\tBest actor appears to be a genuine toss-up between Timothée Chalamet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ethan Hawke, Michael B. Jordan, Wagner Moura, Jesse Plemons and a potential surprise in Joel Edgerton for “Train Dreams.”\n\n\tThe key factor isn’t always the performance itself but the movie’s overall strength and what I call “coattail votes.” If Emma Stone ranks high among best actress voters, Jesse Plemons benefits from voters who put both on their ballots. Ethan Hawke enjoys similar advantages, given his popularity within the Actors Branch and his film’s likely original screenplay nomination (and even a potential surprise in best picture), which could even help it snag the last best picture slot.\n\n\t“That is my favorite movie of the year,” one artisan branch member tells Variety about Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” “I don’t know how you don’t vote for Ethan Hawke and Andrew Scott.”\n\n\tWagner Moura won the Golden Globe for best actor (drama) at the perfect moment. I know many feel like his trajectory (along with the film) is mimicking Fernanda Torres and “I’m Still Here” last season. However, based on current voter sentiment, Moura feels far more vulnerable than Torres did at this stage.\n\n\tMichael B. Jordan in “Sinners” has landed all the essential nominations he needs, but I would be lying if I didn’t say I won’t feel secure about his inaugural Oscar bid until the names are read. Based on the feedback from voters and strategists, he seems to be in.\n\t\n\n\tThen there’s Joel Edgerton for “Train Dreams,” whose support may have quietly grown if the film overperforms down the ballot.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Bugonia”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBest Actress is the category most likely to implode\t\n\n\tBest actress has the most potential for a complete facelift. I feel secure declaring only one lock: Jessie Buckley for “Hamnet.”\n\n\tEmma Stone (“Bugonia”) has entered what I’m casually referring to as her “Cate Blanchett-era” — a phase in which her respect and love carry enormous weight, even without having to campaign. Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”) benefits from international support and overlaps with voters backing Stellan Skarsgård and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas.\n\n\tKate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”) is walking into next week with The Actor Awards and Golden Globe nominations, along with the support of her very well-liked parents, Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. The legendary Hollywood couple have been stumping for her the past few weeks and have helped make her a viable contender.\n\n\tThen there’s Chase Infiniti from “One Battle After Another,” the newest and least well-known name of the group. She could suffer a shocking miss that would mimic Richard Gere in “Chicago” or Joseph Fiennes in “Shakespeare in Love,” only to be forgotten despite being in the best picture winner.\n\n\tThat leaves a couple of potential candidates whose names came up with a few voters, such as Amanda Seyfried (“The Testament of Ann Lee”), Tessa Thompson (“Hedda”), and maybe even Eva Victor (“Sorry, Baby”).\n\n\t“Even though I didn’t really like the movie,” one voter say regarding “The Testament of Ann Lee” and her performance in Mona Fastvold’s drama, “I thought Amanda was astounding, and I haven’t seen a better performance this year.”\n\n\tLong story short, I don’t know where we end up on this one. It’s easy to follow the tea leaves. It’s harder to pick out potential cracks that could emerge.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDocumentary and international races are a trap.\t\n\n\tDocumentary Feature remains one of the most unpredictable categories, with voters acknowledging a pattern of snubbing presumed frontrunners. Admired films like “The Perfect Neighbor,” “The Alabama Solution,” or “2000 Meters to Andriivka” may still be vulnerable, particularly with an increasingly international voting body.\n\t\n\n\tInternational Feature is just as treacherous. Beyond the expected titles, there is genuine enthusiasm for films from Tunisia, Japan, Iraq, Taiwan, Germany and Switzerland — several of which voters describe as personal discoveries rather than consensus picks.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGwyneth Paltrow in “Marty Supreme”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSupporting Categories: Safe and Surprising\t\n\n\tProbable supporting actor noms include Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn from “One Battle After Another,” Jacob Elordi from “Frankenstein,” Paul Mescal from “Hamnet,” and Stellan Skarsgård from “Sentimental Value.” Andrew Scott for “Blue Moon” has support but no clear path to replacing anyone. Watch for Miles Caton from “Sinners” or a Delroy Lindo surprise, similar to the Judd Hirsch/Paul Dano swap we saw with “The Fabelmans.”\n\n\tSupporting actresses feel safer with Amy Madigan (“Weapons”), Teyana Taylor (“One Battle After Another”) and Wunmi Mosaku (“Sinners”) the most likely to score nominations. “Sentimental Value” discovery Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas is most viable from her film, while Elle Fanning may narrowly miss (yet again) after last year’s snub for “A Complete Unknown.”\n\n\tAriana Grande for “Wicked: For Good” feels solid given her Globe, SAG and BAFTA shortlist. If there’s a surprise, Odessa A’zion (“Marty Supreme”) from the SAG lineup could appear, or even her co-star Gwyneth Paltrow as a replacement nominee, given her Oscar-winning status, much like Judi Dench replaced Caitriona Balfe from “Belfast.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Hamnet”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe artisans have the wildcards\t\n\n\t“Sinners” could make history with its nominations totals, especially if it picks up two original song nominations for “I Lied to You” and “Last Time (I Seen the Sun).” Netflix’s “Train Dreams” might score in score or song given the love for the movie, but did enough voters get to it in time? “Wicked: For Good” could emulate “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” with an acting nomination and a couple of tech nods, and the Stephen Schwartz factor is something to consider for music categories.\n\n\t“Hamnet” missed both the American Society of Cinematographers and the British Society of Cinematographers nominations, which could signal a potential miss on Oscar morning. Meanwhile, Darius Khondji’s legendary status helps “Marty Supreme” as a potential for cinematography.\n\t\n\n\tJames Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg” has considerable support that many aren’t currently clocking. That could translate into nominations for costume design, original score, adapted screenplay, and perhaps even picture.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSo what does it look like on Oscar nomination morning?\t\n\n\tTwo potentials are out there.\n\n\tIt’s business as usual. Go with the precursor clues, and you’ll likely score 80% in your predictions.\n\n\tOr…\n\n\tWe could be heading for a 2003-style upset year. That year, despite “The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King” dominating, we saw Fernando Meirelles nominated for his beloved Brazilian film “City of God,” Jude Law nominated for best actor for “Cold Mountain” after missing SAG, and a complete upheaval in the best actress category. Charlize Theron and Diane Keaton were joined by Naomi Watts for “21 Grams,” Keisha Castle-Hughes (who switched from supporting to lead for “Whale Rider”) and Samantha Morton for “In America” with zero precursor support.\n\n\tThose nominations replaced presumed locks like Scarlett Johansson (campaigning in supporting but kept appearing in lead categories for “Lost in Translation”), Evan Rachel Wood for “Thirteen,” and Nicole Kidman for “Cold Mountain,” coming right after her Oscar win for “The Hours.”\n\n\tVariety’s final predictions drop next week before nominations are announced Jan. 22. \n\n\tBased on what voters are actually saying, chaos feels inevitable. Below are five of the most interesting best picture ballots that were shared with me by anonymous Oscar voters.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©20th Century Studios/Courtesy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tVoter #1 (Artisan Branch Member)\n\n\n“Blue Moon”\n“Train Dreams”\n“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”\n“Marty Supreme”\n“Nuremberg”\n“One Battle After Another”\n“Wicked: For Good”\n“Ella McCay”\n“Hamnet”\n“Nouvelle Vague”\n\n\n\n\n\tVoter #2 (Acting Branch Voter)\n\n\tActor in a Leading Role\n\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, “One Battle After Another”\nTimothée Chalamet, “Marty Supreme”\nJesse Plemons, “Bugonia”\nHugh Jackman, “Song Sung Blue”\nGeorge Clooney, “Jay Kelly”\n\n\n\n\tActress in a Leading Role\n\n\nKate Hudson, “Song Sung Blue”\nRose Byrne, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”\nJennifer Lawrence, “Die My Love”\nEmma Stone, “Bugonia”\nAriana Grande, “Wicked: For Good”\n\n\n\n\tVoter #3: (Producers Branch Voter)\n\n\n“Sinners”\n“Wake Up Dead Man”\n“Weapons”\n“Hamnet”\n“Sentimental Value”\n“F1”\n“Frankenstein”\n“Rental Family”\n“Warfare”\n“Marty Supreme”\n\n\n\n\n\tVoter #4 (Costume Branch)\n\n\n“Nouvelle Vague”\n“Nuremberg”\n“Sinners”\n“Bugonia”\n“Frankenstein”\n\n\n\n\n\tVoter #5 (Executives Branch)\n\n\n“Train Dreams”\n“Bugonia”\n“One Battle After Another”\n“Sinners”\n“Marty Supreme”\n“The Lost Bus”\n“Sentimental Value”\n“A House of Dynamite”\n“Black Bag”\n“The Secret Agent”\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tProlific international content studio Mediawan is in advanced negotiations to acquire Peter Chernin‘s North Road Company, multiple sources told Variety. The intention behind the deal is to combine both operations and create a hulking independent production force to serve global markets. \n\tChernin, a longtime media investor and former chairman of Fox, and his assets have been bandied about in the rampant mergers and acquisitions craze that has consumed Hollywood in recent years. His goldilocks moment seems to have arrived in Mediawan, the French studio that’s been quietly building a strong portfolio through equity investments in companies like Brad Pitt’s Plan B (“Adolescence,” “F1”) and the British shop See-Saw (“Slow Horses”). \n\t\n\tFinancials surrounding the pending deal were not immediately known, though insiders said North Road’s valuation is well north of $500 million. A timeline for the transaction close was vague, though two individuals familiar with the deal said the deal would be papered in the coming weeks. Mediawan and The North Road Company had no comment on the matter. \n\n\tNorth Road is comprised of numerous labels, including: Chernin Entertainment, Kinetic, Perro Azul, Omaha and Words + Pictures. The Chernin banner is responsible for hits like Academy Award-nominated features “Ford v Ferrari,” “Hidden Figures,” and “The Greatest Showman,” as well as “Spy,” “The Heat,” and the “Planet of the Apes” franchise. The company also most recently produced “Back in Action,” one of Netflix’s biggest movie debuts in years, the “Fear Street” trilogy, “Slumberland,” and “Luther: The Fallen Sun,” all with Netflix. They recently signed a new multi-year first-look film deal with Apple TV+. Upcoming series include “Age of Innocence” and “Man on Fire,” both for Netflix. North Road was formally established in 2022 by Peter Chernin. In addition to Chernin, it counts Kinetic Content, the top reality production company led by Chris Coelen, creator of “Love Is Blind,” and Words + Pictures (led by Connor Schell). Since its launch, North Road has expanded its portfolio with the creation of an independent scripted television studio led by Amy Israel and acquisitions of Little Rooms Films (established by Jason Hehir), the Turkish production company Karga Seven, and the Mexican production company Perro Azul. North Road is also a strategic investor in notable ventures, including Peyton Manning’s Omaha Productions, Questlove and Black Thought’s Two One Five Entertainment, NBA star Chris Paul’s Ohh Dip!!! Productions, and GenAI content studio, Promise.\n\t\n\tMediawan was founded in 2015 by Pierre-Antoine, French telecom billionaire Xavier Niel and financier Matthieu Pigasse. In just over a decade, the company has come to control over 75 smaller European media shops. The company estimates it produces more than 400 titles annually, across films, series, family content and unscripted. ",

'cause according to bride Jaque, the woman actually asked if she could keep going down the steps, only realizing way too late she’d taken the wrong route.\n      \n    \n          Luckily, a group of guys nearby jumped in to help, guiding the driver and steering the car back out the correct way.\n      \n    \n          Despite the shock, no one was hurt ... and while the couple looked understandably rattled, -- especially the groom -- they could breathe easy. The shoot survived, the vows stayed intact!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Insane Videos\n              \n                          \n                Viral\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Burke had his mug shot taken ... and he looks none too happy to be in lockup -- giving the camera a death stare.\n      \n    \n          If you haven't seen the video yet, fair warning -- it's upsetting. It's unclear what sets the man in the clip off, but he's screaming at a security guard ... calling him the n-word multiple times and seemingly squaring up to throw a punch.\n      \n\n          Ultimately, the coward walks away ... throwing a series of slurs over his shoulder as he retreats. This altercation reportedly went down outside the Social Security Administration office in Norcross.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          According to cops ... Burke wasn’t at the scene when they arrived, so an arrest warrant was issued. But, he caused another disturbance on Thursday at a Courtyard Marriott hotel, where he was staying as a guest ... and he got a police escort outta there straight into the clink.\n      \n    \n          Gwinnett County police tell TMZ ... a front desk employee called and told police Burke was being hostile and asked for him to be removed and criminally trespassed. Police report he was being \"aggressive, yelling at the employees, and he was also talking to himself.\"\n      \n    \n          When officers arrived at his room, he initially refused to leave, but eventually complied. Robert told police he suffers from schizophrenia, paranoia, and mental health disabilities.\n      \n    \n          Burke has since been released on $1,000 bond.\n      \n    \n          We've reached out to Burke ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Insane Videos\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive Details\n              \n                          \n                Viral\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

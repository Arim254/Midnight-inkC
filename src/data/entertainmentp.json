    "body": "\n\tThe Kansas City Chiefs are the undisputed NFL team of choice for Swifties — but the team’s ultimate goal is total world fandom domination.\n\n\tFollowing the success of the 2024 Hallmark Channel Christmas movie “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story” — a rom-com loosely inspired by the real-life love story of Taylor Swift and Chiefs star Travis Kelce — the franchise decided to go all in on Hollywood with the launch of production arm Foolish Club Studios.\n\t\n\n\tWith this venture, a first for an NFL team, the 2023 and 2024 Super Bowl champs are asserting confidence in their ability to transcend a sports-fan audience and obtain “the World’s Team” status through scripted and unscripted content that might only be sports-adjacent, per Kansas City Chiefs executive VP and chief media and marketing officer Lara Krug.\n\n\n\t“For me, it really starts with the heart and humble nature of the Midwest,” Krug says. “The Chiefs brand feels unassuming and approachable, yet it’s paired with excellence on the field and a championship mindset. People everywhere are drawn to that combination: ambition without ego. It’s also genuinely fun. Our players look like they’re having as much fun with each other on the field as they do off of it, and that joy translates no matter where you live or whether you’re a football fan.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHallmark’s “Holiday Touchdown” – Hallmark Media/Photographer: Matt Hoover\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMatt Hoover\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHallmark’s “Holiday Touchdown” was just the first step. Produced by Skydance Sports in partnership with the Chiefs and filmed at Arrowhead Stadium and other team facilities, the project — which spurred a follow-up NFL-themed film, “A Bills Love Story,” in November — showed the appetite for sports content that ultimately has little to do with sports.\n\t\n\n\tThe Chiefs are looking to capitalize on interest from fans who care more about the culture surrounding football than the game itself. The ones who watch the team’s social media accounts for behind-the-scenes clips of the players or tune in to the games for a look at the WAGs (wives and girlfriends, including one famous showgirl) cheering from the sidelines.\n\n\tBut that largely women-dominated demographic is far from the only one the Chiefs are after. They want international viewers, kids and families, hardcore sports fans and anyone with a passing interest in football culture willing to give the content a shot.\n\n\tThe push began in earnest in August with the debut of “The Kingdom,” a six-episode docuseries for Disney+ and ESPN that followed the Chiefs during their 2024 season. In October, the Chiefs announced plans for a documentary about a Kansas City soccer team of teen refugees who are on a journey to the USA Cup.\n\n\tOn Christmas Eve, the Chiefs pair up with the Elf on the Shelf brand for the Claymation short film “Merry Mischief” (get it?), which features animated versions of Patrick Mahomes, Trent McDuffie, Chris Jones, Travis Kelce and head coach Andy Reid, with narration by Kelce’s mother, Donna Kelce.\n\n\tMoving forward, Krug says she is interested in developing a project about women’s football teams and is exploring opportunities to produce kids-focused sports content in the tradition of classics like “Little Giants,” “The Sandlot” and “The Mighty Ducks.”\n\n\tThe trickiest aspect the studio must navigate as it grows its slate is how much the Chiefs players (and their famous other halves) are actually featured in the content that’s produced. Krug notes that several of the projects in development “aren’t necessarily built around the players themselves.”\n\n\t“Their journeys, their mindsets, their culture and their impact inspire ideas that we can bring to life in ways that don’t always require them to be physically present,” Krug says. “We can capture the essence of what they represent — the grit, the joy, the humanity — without asking for more of their time or intruding on their private lives.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Van Der Beek joined “Today” for a new sit-down TV interview amid his cancer diagnosis and fought through tears as he remembered his family getting a rapturous standing ovation during September’s “Dawson’s Creek” reunion. The actor missed the event after being “hit with some stomach bugs,” but he made a video appearance via Zoom and got to see “Dawnson’s” fans warmly embrace his family members.\n\n\t“As crushed as I was not being able to go to that ‘Dawson’s Creek’ reunion, my family got to go,” Van Der Beek said. “And I was zooming in on that night and they got a standing ovation just for taking their seats. And all that love that would have otherwise been directed at me, was directed at my family. It was just one of the most beautiful moments I’ve ever gotten to witness. I’m just so grateful to the fans for doing that.”\n\t\n\n\tVan Der Beek was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer last year. He sparked concern among fans when he skipped the “Dawson’s Creek” reunion, but he stressed to “Today” co-host Craig Melvin that missing the event was due to a stomach virus and was not directly cancer related. The bug is also why Van Der Beek appeared with such a dramatic weight loss on Zoom at the event, although he assured fans: “I feel much, much better than I did a couple months ago.”\n\n\n\t“I’d lost so much weight because of the stomach virus, yeah,” Van Der Beek. “No, it was not cancer related. Although with cancer everything’s like, ‘Why don’t we super size that stomach virus?'”\n\n\tThe “Dawson’s Creek” reunion was held in September as featured the show’s original cast together for the first time since the series wrapped in 2003. The event, which raised money for F Cancer and Van Der Beek’s own treatment, featured a table read of the show’s 1998 pilot episode. Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson, Mary Beth Peil, John Wesley Shipp and more all appeared. Lin-Manuel Miranda jumped in to replace Van Der Beek for the script reading.\n\t\n\n\tWatch Van Der Beek’s full interview on “Today” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony has unveiled the first trailer for Eric Appel’s family comedy “The Breadwinner” ahead of its March 13, 2026 release date. \n\n\tFirst-time film star Nate Bargatze (Nate Wilcox) and Mandy Moore (Katie Wilcox) lead the film as a married couple whose lives get turned upside down after supermom Katie lands a once-in-a-lifetime deal following an appearance on “Shark Tank.” The catch? It requires her to set out on an extended business trip — and leave her husband in charge. \n\t\n\n\tNate thus assumes the role of a stay-at-home dad for the very first time. “With three young daughters and little experience handling their day-to-day needs, Nate finds out quickly that running the household is the toughest gig he’s ever had,” adds the official logline. \n\n\n\tThe trailer gives audiences a glimpse into the wobbly beginning of Nate’s “dad era,” showing the former car salesman as he trips over laundry, struggles to cook eggs, locks his family out of their house and gets lost en route to his children’s school drop-off. He exclaims: “She makes it look so easy, but it’s so hard!” \n\n\tWhile Bargatze makes his big screen debut in “The Breadwinner,” the fan-favorite comedian has been doing standup for over 20 years, selling more than a million tickets in 2024 and earning the reputation as “the nicest man in standup,” Known for classics like “A Walk To Remember” and “Tangled,” seasoned star Moore most recently appeared in Peacock’s “Dr. Death.” Previously, she starred in NBC’s “This Is Us” as Rebecca Pearson for six seasons.  \n\t\n\n\tColin Jost, Zach Cherry, Martin Herlihy, Kate Berlant, Kumail Nanjiani and Will Forte are set to round out the cast, with Birdie Borria, Charlotte Tucker and Stella Fitzgerald playing the three daughters. \n\n\tBargatze penned the script for the film alongside “Christmas with the Campbells” writer Dan Lagana. Jeremy Latcham, Bargatze and Lagana are producing. JoAnn Perritano, Michael Musgrave and Tyler Zacharia serve as executive producers. \n\n\tSee the full trailer below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMubi, the indie film company behind “The Substance” and “Die, My Love,” has restructured its content leadership as it navigates industry headwinds. \n\n\tMubi, which had scaled aggressively in recent years, currently employs approximately 400 staff across 14 international and U.S. offices. The restructuring comes as Mubi offered voluntary exit packages. About a dozen people across different divisions have left and many of these roles will be replaced, Variety has confirmed.\n\t\n\n\tAs part of the overhaul, longtime chief content officer Jason Ropell is transitioning to a senior advisory role at Mubi focused on strategic and creative counsel. He will be working closely with Mubi founder and CEO Efe Cakarel. Mubi will not be hiring a new CCO, and the company has now divided its content operations into four pillars. \n\n\n\t“Mubi is making some proactive changes to its content operations to better meet the company’s needs going forward. Mubi’s mission and vision are not changing at all, but the new configuration will allow the company to make faster decisions in a competitive market,” the company’s spokesperson said. \n\n\tArianna Bocco, the well-respected former IFC executive who joined Mubi at the start of the year, has been promoted to oversee all acquisitions and distribution globally.\n\n\tMichael Weber, the longtime head of leading German sales company The Match Factory, will become Mubi’s head of global production. The Match Factory, which became part of Mubi in 2022, will now be fully integrated into its parent company; but it will continue handling international sales in territories where Mubi doesn’t have direct distribution operations. The Match Factory will still acquire third-party titles from leading filmmakers. \n\t\n\n\tChiara Maranon and Uriel Kuzniecki have been named co-heads of programming and licensing, while Danny Kasman continues to lead publishing.\n\n\tMubi has had a tumultuous year. After securing $100 million from Sequoia Capital Investment in the Spring, the company faced some backlash surrounding its new investor’s ties to the Israeli military. Mubi had also been challenged by the theatrical market’s decline for indie movies, in the back of a cycle of splashy acquisitions at festivals. The banner splurged $24 million at Cannes to acquire Lynne Ramsay’s “Die, My Love,” starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, but the movie has underperformed in theaters.\n\n\tDespite these setbacks, Mubi said is bullish on the future. Its releases scored seven Golden Globes nominations, including a best actress nom for Lawrence. The company is also the distributor of several Oscar-shortlisted films, including “Sentimental Value,” Oliver Laxe’s “Sirat,” Park Chan-wook’s “No Other Choice” and Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident.” Mubi recently hired veteran publicity executive VJ Carbone as VP of communications in the U.S. as it gears up for a busy awards season.\n\n\tOur sister publication Deadline was first to report on the leadership restructuring.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA BBC-commissioned review has concluded there is no need to rewrite the broadcaster’s editorial editing guidelines following the controversy over a “Panorama” program that misleadingly edited President Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 speech, instead pointing to failures in judgment, escalation and oversight.\n\n\tThe findings of both the review of the Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC) and a further examination of issues raised in a leaked memo by former adviser Michael Prescott were unanimously accepted by the BBC board and approved for publication at a board meeting on Thursday.\n\t\n\n\tIn the review published Friday, director of editorial complaints and reviews Peter Johnston said existing BBC rules governing editing are “sufficient,” even in light of the “Panorama” error, but acknowledged that lessons were not acted on quickly or decisively enough across the organization. The report forms part of the BBC board’s most substantive response yet to the Prescott memo, which became public last month and triggered heightened scrutiny of the broadcaster’s editorial governance.\n\n\n\tThe BBC has already acknowledged that the “Panorama” edit constituted an error of judgment. The program spliced excerpts from different points in Trump’s speech in a way that created the impression of a single continuous passage, mistakenly suggesting a direct call for violent action, before cutting to footage of the Proud Boys.\n\n\tJohnston noted that the BBC’s editorial guidelines already prohibit such practices, stating that commentary and editing must never be used to give audiences a materially misleading impression of events, and that content makers should not inter-cut sequences where the resulting juxtaposition distorts meaning.\n\t\n\n\t“I do not believe any changes are required,” Johnston wrote. “But we will ensure these lessons are reinforced.”\n\n\tRather than revising the guidelines, the BBC board is moving to overhaul how editorial risks are identified, escalated and tracked. A separate review of the EGSC, commissioned by BBC chair Samir Shah and conducted by Caroline Thomson with support from Richard Sambrook, calls for a refocused remit centered on managing major areas of editorial risk, alongside a new triage system designed to ensure individual editorial issues are handled swiftly at the appropriate executive level while flagging potential systemic problems for deeper review.\n\n\tThe EGSC review also recommends resetting the committee’s composition to reduce executive dominance and broaden non-executive voices, clarifying the role of external editorial advisers to ensure they inform rather than direct decision-making, and proceeding with the recruitment of two new advisers under revised role definitions.\n\n\tThe Trump “Panorama” issue emerged from a broader examination of BBC coverage of the U.S. presidential election. While internal research found much of the coverage to be of a high standard, it identified shortcomings including excessive weight given to the Selzer Iowa poll late in the campaign and inaccuracies in some reporting of Trump’s remarks about former Rep. Liz Cheney. Some of those issues, particularly on linear output, can no longer be corrected, though online material has since been amended.\n\n\tTo strengthen U.S. coverage, the BBC has appointed a regional director for the Americas, expanded reporting beyond Washington power centers and reallocated resources toward more granular regional and economic storytelling.\n\n\tJohnston’s review also examined editorial concerns raised in Prescott’s memo beyond U.S. coverage, concluding that more corrective action had been taken than the document acknowledged, with further steps implemented since it became public. Those included updates to guidance on data and statistics, changes to sex and gender coverage following a recent Supreme Court ruling, and new editorial leadership, training and oversight structures for BBC News Arabic amid scrutiny of Israel and Gaza reporting.\n\n\tShah said the reforms were aimed at ensuring faster and more transparent action when editorial risks arise. “Along with the BBC board, I am now ensuring immediate changes are made to the EGSC to ensure swift, appropriate and transparent action is taken to address editorial issues as effectively as possible, whenever they occur,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tThe reviews come as Trump pursues a $10 billion defamation lawsuit in Florida over the “Panorama” edit.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMiyake Sho‘s “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” emerged as the big winner at the 30th International Film Festival of Kerala, claiming the festival’s top honor, the Suvarna Chakoram for best film, for its “exploratory, subtle, beautiful, and thought-provoking cinematic expression of human relationships set within the natural world.”\n\n\tThe film previously won the Golden Leopard at Locarno.\n\n\tIn the directing categories, Carina Piazza and Lucía Bracelis earned the Rajata Chakoram for best director for “Before the Body,” praised for their “distinctive and exploratory approach to the genre.”\n\t\n\n\tTanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi’s “Shadowbox” (Baksho Bondi) won the Rajata Chakoram for best debut director and the FFSI KR Mohanan Award for best debut director from India. The Kolkata-set drama centers on a working-class woman struggling to hold her family together while her husband, suffering from stress disorder, faces a murder charge. Tillotama Shome’s lead performance earned a special jury mention, with jurors praising “her precise and detailed performance in creating a character defined by agency and choice.”\n\n\n\tSanju Surendran’s “If On a Winter’s Night” (Khidki Gaav) claimed three awards including two Netpac prizes and the Fipresci Award for best film in international competition. Jurors celebrated the big-city romance for its “fantastic performances and a precise directorial gaze,” singling out its depiction of “the precarious lives of cultural workers with such care.”\n\n\tUnnikrishnan Avala’s “Life of a Phallus” (Thanthapperu) resonated with both critics and audiences, taking home the Audience Poll Award alongside the Jury Prize and a Netpac Award for best Malayalam film. The drama, set within a Native Indian tribal community, earned recognition as “a distinctive and singular cinematic experience” for its examination of patriarchal customs.\n\t\n\n\tGözde Kural’s “Cinema Jazireh” won the Netpac Award for best Asian film in competition, telling the story of a widow forced to change her sexual identity to survive extremist violence. Meanwhile, Fazil Razak’s “Desire” (Moham) secured the Fipresci Award for best Malayalam film of a debut director, with jurors noting the film “conveys the intense pain at the heart of this story without resorting to cliché.”\n\n\tShahram Mokri’s “Black Rabbit, White Rabbit” received a special jury mention for technical excellence for its “exploration and pursuit of new forms of cinematic expression.”\n\t\n\t\tComplete List of Winners\t\n\n\tSuvarna Chakoram for Best Film“Two Seasons, Two Strangers” — Miyake Sho\n\n\tRajata Chakoram for Best Director“Before the Body” — Carina Piazza and Lucía Bracelis\n\n\tRajata Chakoram for Best Debut Director“Shadowbox” (Baksho Bondi) — Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi\n\n\tFFSI KR Mohanan Award for Best Debut Director from India“Shadowbox” (Baksho Bondi) — Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi\n\n\tNetpac Award for Best Malayalam Film“If On a Winter’s Night” (Khidki Gaav) — Sanju Surendran“Life of a Phallus” (Thanthapperu) — Unnikrishnan Avala\n\n\tNetpac Award for Best Asian Film in Competition“Cinema Jazireh” — Gözde Kural\n\n\tFipresci Award for Best Film in International Competition“If On a Winter’s Night” (Khidki Gaav) — Sanju Surendran\n\n\tFipresci Award for Best Malayalam Film of a Debut Director“Desire” (Moham) — Fazil Razak\n\n\tJury Prize“Life of a Phallus” (Thanthapperu) — Unnikrishnan Avala\n\n\tSpecial Jury Mention for Performance“Shadowbox” (Baksho Bondi) — Tillotama Shome\n\n\tSpecial Jury Mention for Technical Excellence“Black Rabbit, White Rabbit” — Shahram Mokri\n\n\tAudience Poll Award“Life of a Phallus” (Thanthapperu) — Unnikrishnan Avala\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel fought back tears during his final monologue of 2025 as he thanked fans for helping him get through a tumultuous year, one that started with the L.A. fires and continued through Kimmel’s ongoing feud with Donald Trump. Of course the low point of Kimmel’s year was when ABC pulled his late night talk show off the air after two large owners of affiliate TV stations, Nexstar and Sinclair, complained about a monologue in which Kimmel discussed Charlie Kirk’s alleged shooter.  \n\t\n\n\t“This has been a strange year. It’s been a hard year,” Kimmel said at the beginning of the last “Jimmy Kimmel Live” episode of the year. “We’ve had some lows, we’ve had some highs. For me, maybe more than any year of my life. I’m crying already, I’m sorry.”\n\n\n\tKimmel fought through tears and continued, “I just want to say that we appreciate your support, your enthusiasm, and not just for watching. This year, you literally pulled us out of a hole, and we cannot thank you enough personally.” \n\n\tBut it wasn’t just Kimmel’s suspension that made 2025 such a turbulent year for the late night host. Without naming any one specific tragedy, Kimmel noted that “many awful and destructive acts” engulfed the United States this year.\n\n\t“When I hear from people who tell me that they watch our show, and the shows that my friends and colleagues do on the other channels, and that it makes them feel less crazy, it makes me feel less crazy too,” Kimmel said. “I also believe it is important that we as Americans let our friends in other countries… know that a lot of us are not ok with what is happening. There is still much more good in this country than bad, and we hope that you will bear with us during this extended psychotic episode that we’re in the middle of.”\n\t\n\n\tVariety reported earlier this month that Kimmel struck a new deal with Disney to extend his late night run for another year, which will keep “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on the air through 2027. Kimmel’s previous deal with Disney was believed to expire in 2026. \n\n\tSince returning to the air after his suspension, Kimmel has not gotten any softer when it comes to attacking Trump. The host recently condemned Trump’s response to the murder of filmmaker Rob Reiner, who Trump called “deranged” and speculated that his death was “due to the anger” he caused others by being anti-Trump.\n\n\t“What we need at a time like this, besides common sense when it comes to guns and mental health care, is compassion and leadership. We did not get that from our president, because he has none of it to give. Instead, we got a fool rambling about nonsense,” Kimmel said. “It’s so hateful and vile. When I first saw it, I thought it was fake. My wife showed it to me this morning. I was like, ‘Even for him, that seemed like too much.’ But nothing is ever too much for him.”\n\n\tWatch Kimmel’s final monologue of 2025 in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\n\tJosé Luis Cienfuegos, an indefatigable force for the modernization, international vision, new talent focus and industry and popular impact of three ",
    "body": "\n\tJosé Luis Cienfuegos, an indefatigable force for the modernization, international vision, new talent focus and industry and popular impact of three important Spanish film festivals, died from a stroke on Dec. 2. He was 61.\n\n\tTwo weeks later, Spain’s Council of Ministers announced that Cienfuegos will receive its Bellas Artes Golden Medal of Merit. The honor has been applauded by a huge sweep of politicians, cineastes, journalists and Spain’s industry across any divides. That’s how things should be. Cienfuegos’ death has left Spain’s industry with a sense of incredulity. Effusive, affable, hard-partying, Cienfuegos also worked as hard as hell for 30 years to share his passion for cinema beyond studio fare, first as director of the Gijón Film Festival (1995-2012), then the Seville European Film Festival (2013-2022) and finally the Valladolid Film Festival, from 2023. \n\t\n\n\tCienfuegos’ Gijón Revolution\n\n\n\tIt is hard to overstate the joyous impact of Cienfuegos when he took over in 1995 the film festival in Gijón, a post-industrial city nestling on the wave-lashed northern coast of Spain, backed by green hills, in Cienfuegos’ native Asturias. \n\n\tDressed de riguer in black, down to his big-rimmed plastic glasses, he looked like an academic parachuted in from a post-punk academy. But he had nothing of a professor’s elitist distance nor traditionalism. \n\n\tIn the early ‘90s, most Spanish film festivals drew much of their big plays from Europe’s grand auteurs. Passionate but accessible to even the humblest of festival goers, talking 19 to a dozen, Cienfuegos looked elsewhere –  U.S. indie cinema, then in its first and only full flush, and edgier European auteurist fare.\n\t\n\n\tGreg Araki’s homage in 1996, Gijón’s second year under Cienfuegos, was, he said, “a declaration of intentions and new directions” for the Northern Spanish event. Within a few years, U.S. indie icons were fest regulars. Todd Haynes presented film shorts in 2000; Tom DiCillo inaugurated Gijón in 2001 with “Double Whammy.” Hal Hartley announced “The Girl From Monday” at Gijón in 2003. From Europe, Ulrich Seidl, Abbas Kiarostami, Bruno Dumont and Claire Denis received retros.\n\n\tCienfuegos also had a knack of picking up on young directors which went on to great things. From Argentina, he screened Lisandro Alonso’s debut “La Libertad” in 2001 and a decade later, Jonás Trueba’s first feature, “Every Love Song Is About Me” and a year later, Santiago Mitre’s “The Student.” \n\n\tVariety’s first interview with Ruben Östlund was not in Cannes nor his native Sweden but in Gijón where he presented and won for “Play” and announced “Tourist.”   \n\n\tBy the 1990s, however, Gijón’s young were leaving for Madrid or Barcelona. Cienfuegos wanted them back, or at least to see films in theaters. So the film festival he conceived tapped deep into and channelled the burgeoning local music scene, the Xijón Sound. 1999 was a case in point, with tributes to DiCillo and Aki Kaurismaki, a first Saturday concert with the Pretenders, followed by a rocking party at a local bar by with music from just formed Spanish rock group Sidonie.   \n\n\tGijón was his masterpiece, José Luis Cienfuegos unleashed. Under him, Variety wrote in 2007, “Gijon has become one — if not the — favored meet of sophisticated young Spanish film buffs.” Attendance quadrupled from 15,000 admissions in 1995 to 67,000 in 2006, 75,000 by 2010.  \n\n\tIt couldn’t last. Spanish film festivals depend heavily on local government funding for finance. In 2011, hard-right politician Fernando Álvarez Cascos was elected president of the Asturias Region. In January 2012, he summarily sacked Cienfuegos, prompting a letter signed by Pedro Almodóvar, Atom Egoyan, Isabel Coixet and Todd Solondz and 400 other filmmakers or writers, asking for him to he brought back. \n\n\tCienfuegos at the Seville European Film Festival…. \n\t\n\n\tOther festivals, however, wanted him elsewhere. Javier Martín Domínguez, had resigned just a week before as artistic director of the Seville European Film Festival, protesting at budget cuts. Martín Dominguez had already built Seville up as a vibrant meeting point in November sun for European producers, distributors and institutions. \n\n\tUnder Cienfuegos, Seville continued to stage the nominations announcement for the European Film Awards, converted Seville into the entry point for annual waves of European auteurs, while he battled to increase the festival’s impact on the city of Seville itself. \n\n\tAnd at Valladolid’s Seminci\n\n\tThat last point for Cienfuegos really mattered. It became a later-life crusade. When sacked at Gijón in 2012, Cienfuegos simply produced statistics underscoring its attendance surge under his mandate. At the time that he was appointed director in 2023 of the Valladolid Film Festival-Seminci, Spain’s traditionally second-biggest arthouse event, Spain’s box office languished post-pandemic at just 62% of 2019’s total annual gross. Young spectators were among the most likely to return to theaters. Cienfuegos’ new-fit reboot immediately honed in on movies from exciting new directors such as Laura Ferrés’ feature debut “The Permanent Picture,” Brit Molly Manning Walker’s Cannes Un Certain Regard victor “How to Have Sex” and U.S. indie doc icons Bill and Turner Ross with their first fiction outing, “Gasoline Alley.” \n\n\tHe also installed Spain’s 3rd Independent Film Market (Merci), hosting distributor screenings which fairly hummed in 2025. By this year, he was concerned that Spanish films selected should include more uplifting commercial propositions, underscoring the crowd-pleasing potential of national movies. Yet, at one and the same time, focusing on first and second features, Meeting Point prize monies was near doubled to $45,000 for distributors of its winning films.\n\n\tAdmissions for 2025 ran at 103,000 up 30% on 2022, box office up 53%, with Meeting Point tripling its audience, and attendance of film industry professionals and journalists soaring 68%, reaching 2,180.\n\n\tWhat makes Cienfuegos’ death so shocking is not just his relative youth but that he was not done yet. He and the Valladolid festival were still a work in progress. The old Gijón excitement was on once more.   \n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s time to return to Pandora because James Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” is here.\n\n\tThe third “Avatar” movie has made $12 million in domestic previews at the box office. In international markets, it grossed $43.1 million from 43 markets.\n\n\t“Fire and Ash” is expected to lead the pre-Christmas box office with $90 million to $105 million in its opening weekend and hopes to join 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water” as a fellow billion-dollar grosser. The third film is estimated to earn another $250 million to $275 million in its international debut for a global launch between $340 million to $365 million.\n\t\n\n\tBoth of the previous “Avatar” movies had similar debuts but excelled in staying power over the holidays. The first “Avatar” launched with $77 million domestically and was No. 1 spot at the box office seven weeks, eventually making $760 million in North America and $2.92 billion worldwide. It still stands as the highest-grossing movie of all time. “The Way of Water” opened with $134 million domestically and eventually swam to $688 million in North America and $2.3 billion worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film ever. It will take similar staying power and pricey Imax and 3D screenings for “Fire and Ash” to join its predecessors on the all-time charts.\n\n\n\tJake Sully (Sam Worthington), Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their blue alien family are back for another Na’vi adventure in “Fire and Ash.” After meeting the aquatic Metkayina clan in “The Way of Water,” they now face off against the evil Mangkwan tribe, raiders who reside in a volcano, in “Fire and Ash.”\n\t\n\n\tIn other releases, Lionsgate’s adaptation of the novel “The Housemaid,” starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, is on track to open with $20 million to $25 million this weekend after making $2.2 million in previews. Angel Studios also has the animated biblical film “David,” about the story of David and Goliath, which looks to make a similar debut. Paramount’s animated kids film “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” is tracking for the No. 4 spot with $15 million to $20 million; it made $1.4 million in previews.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Academy Museum of Motion Pictures has set a major horror-themed exhibition for Sept. 20 to July 25, 2027. The Horror Show at the Los Angeles museum aims to “bridge the gap between cinema and experience, honoring horror’s enormous cultural impact and enduring popularity.”\n\n\tThe Horror Show will celebrate horror cinema, centered around the question “Why do horror films matter so deeply to so many?” the museum said in a statement.\n\n\n\t“The Horror Show recognizes horror as one of the most emotionally resonant and innovative types of filmmaking, and celebrates its radical creativity and artists,” said Amy Homma, Academy Museum Director and President. “I am excited for visitors to explore and experience filmmaking that has influenced generations.”\n\t\n\n\t“Throughout film history, horror has thrilled and moved audiences, acting as a powerful outlet for expression and a tool for social commentary,” said Senior Exhibitions Curator Jessica Niebel. “Through these stories, people have found catharsis and community among fellow horror fans around the world. I can’t wait for everyone — from horror enthusiasts to the horror-curious — to see The Horror Show.”\n\n\tThe exhibition will unfold with an introductory sound installation leading into a hallway that introduces six galleries with themes of gothic, psychological, science, slasher, religion and ghosts.\n\n\tVisitors will encounter their favorite creatures, monsters and objects, and get a behind-the-scenes look at storytelling and production, the museum said. The exhibition will also “explore representations of identity, sexuality and ability” in films including “Alien” (1979), “A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984), “Black Swan” (2010), “Dracula” (1931), “Frankenstein” (1931), “Get Out” (2017), “Halloween” (1978), “Ju-on” (1998), “Midsommar” (2019), “Misery (1990), “Poltergeist” (1982), “Ringu” (1998), “The Blair Witch Project” (1999), “The Exorcist” (1973), “The Shining” (1980), “The Silence of the Lambs” (1991) and “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974).\n\t\n\n\tThe Horror Show will incorporate public programming including screenings, gallery talks and tours. The museum advises that “parental guidance is suggested for younger visitors.”\n\n\tThe exhibition is organized by Senior Exhibitions Curator Jessica Niebel, Assistant Curator Nicholas Barlow and Curatorial Assistant Alexandra James Salichs. \n\n\tThe Horror Show follows other large-scale exhibitions in the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Gallery since the museum’s opening: Hayao Miyazaki, Regeneration: Black Cinema, John Waters: Pope of Trash, Color in Motion: Chromatic Explorations of Cinema and the current “Jaws” exhibition, which closes July 26.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter more than two decades as both creative and life partners, Arcade Fire’s Win Butler and Régine Chassagne have confirmed their separation. On Friday morning, the pair announced their split on Arcade Fire’s official Instagram, adding that they “look forward to seeing you on tour,” even though the band currently has no scheduled concert dates.\n\n\t“They continue to love, admire and support each other as they co-parent their son,” the message reads. It continues with the statement that their “bond as creative soulmates will endure, as will Arcade Fire.”\n\t\n\n\tButler and Chassagne became husband and wife in 2003 and welcomed their son in April 2013. Seven years later, Butler was publicly accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women who alleged they were victims of his emotional and sexual abuse. \n\n\tButler denied these allegations but did confess he’d had extramarital relations with the people who came forward, but denied that any of them had been nonconsensual. Chassagne supported her husband throughout the scandal. \n\n\t“Win is my soulmate, my songwriting partner, my husband, the father of my beautiful boy,” Chassagne said in a statement at the time. “I know what is in his heart, and I know he has never, and would never, touch a woman without her consent, and I am certain he never did. He has lost his way and he has found his way back. I love him and love the life we have created together.”\n\n\tArcade Fire’s last LP, “Pink Elephant,” was released in May of this year. The band supported the release with the “Don’t Think About Pink Elephant Tour.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tSports fans looking for ESPN this weekend will have to look elsewhere if they’re subscribed to YouTube TV. The live TV streaming service announced Friday that it was removing ESPN, ABC and other Disney-owned channels from its lineup, after the two sides failed to come to a new carriage agreement, with a reported rate hike being the main sticking point.\n\n\tThe loss of ESPN is the latest snag to hit YouTube TV — the streamer was on the verge of losing all NBCUniversal channels in September, before a last-minute short-term extension averted a total blackout.\n\n\n\tOther streamers are using YouTube TV’s recent woes as an opportunity to introduce their own offerings to customers. One of these companies is Sling, which offers ESPN as part of its Sling Orange and bundled Sling Orange & Blue packages.\n\n\tRight now, Sling is offering the Orange & Blue package for up to 50% off for new users. Regularly $65.99, users can get the package starting from just $33 for their first month. The deal gets you access to 50+ live TV channels, including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3 and a local ABC feed.\n\n\tESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN3 are also available on the Sling Orange plan, which starts at $45.99/month for 35+ channels that you can stream on your phone, computer, tablet or smart TV (rates vary by region and you can check current deals and offers here). Sling is currently one of the best YouTube TV alternatives online.\n\n\tIf you’re just hoping to catch one of the college football games or any of ESPN’s other weekend offerings, Sling also offers affordable Day Passes, which get you access to Sling Orange for 24 hours with unlimited streaming. A Sling Day Pass is just $4.99. A Weekend Pass (Friday-Sunday) costs $9.99 for unlimited streaming across one device of your choice. \n\n\n\tSling also carries ESPN channels like SEC Network and ESPNU; both are available by adding on the Sports Extra pack to your Pass, starting at $1.\n\n\tThis is one of the best ways to watch and stream ESPN online without YouTube TV, and the Day and Weekend Passes allow you to test out Sling’s offerings without commitment. See more Sling deals and offers here.\n\n\t“From short-term subscriptions to monthly packages to add-ons, flexibility is at the heart of what we do at Sling,” the company says in a blog post on its website. “If you’re frustrated by the ESPN takedown on YouTube TV, Sling lets you flex on them.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney‘s top brass told the troops that the media company’s leaders are going to continue to fight for a “fair deal” with Google’s YouTube TV, after the internet service pulled ESPN, ABC and other Disney networks Thursday night.\n\n\tDisney Entertainment co-chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro sent a memo to company employees Friday morning regarding YouTube TV’s blackout.\n\n\n\tAccording to the three execs, YouTube TV pulled Disney’s channels from the service — prior to the midnight ET expiration of the previous carriage deal — with “no advance notice to their subscribers, or to us. In doing so, they not only cut off access to our live programming but also deleted all previously recorded shows and events from their subscribers’ libraries.” \n\t\n\n\tWalden, Bergman and Pitaro continued: “Their actions make clear how little regard they have for their customers and are consistent with an attitude which has been prevalent throughout our negotiations — YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us. Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.”\n\n\tThe executives told employees that it will continue to work for a beneficial deal for Disney with Google and YouTube. “We are asking nothing more of YouTube TV than what we have gotten from every other distributor — fair rates for our channels,” they wrote.\n\n\tRead the memo from Walden, Bergman and Pitaro:\n\n\tTeam,\n\n\tAs you are no doubt aware, last night YouTube TV pulled our channels from their service, prior to the midnight expiration of our deal, and with no advance notice to their subscribers, or to us. In doing so, they not only cut off access to our live programming but also deleted all previously recorded shows and events from their subscribers’ libraries. Their actions make clear how little regard they have for their customers and are consistent with an attitude which has been prevalent throughout our negotiations — YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us. Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.\n\t\n\n\tWe are enormously proud of the work done by so many of you to create the highest quality and most compelling content. At ESPN and ABC in particular, we have made significant investments in programming, including the best line-up of live sports in the industry — bar none. On ABC alone, we have increased the number of live games by nearly 80% over the past several years. The lineup for this weekend is incredible and includes 13 of the top 25 college football teams on our platforms, a double header of NWSL games on ESPN, and leads right into Monday Night Football featuring the Arizona Cardinals vs. the Dallas Cowboys on ABC.\n\n\tThe bottom line is that our channels are extremely valuable, and we can only continue to program them with the sports and entertainment viewers love most if we stand our ground against tactics that threaten the integrity of our business and the value of our creative work. We are asking nothing more of YouTube TV than what we have gotten from every other distributor – fair rates for our channels.\n\n\tWe will keep you informed as this matter progresses. For those of you who are YouTube TV customers and have lost access to our channels, there are other ways you can watch, which you can find here: KeepMyNetworks.com.\n\n\tWe know how hard so many of you work every day to create, promote, and support our programming. We’re deeply grateful for your continued focus, professionalism, and commitment.\n\n\tAlan, Dana & Jimmy\n",

    "body": "\n\tRyan Coogler, Tessa Thompson, Octavia Spencer and Daniel Kaluuya lead an A-list lineup of presenters for Michael B. Jordan‘s American Cinematheque tribute. The “Sinners” star and “Creed III” director is set to become the 39th recipient of the honor during a ceremony held Nov. 20 at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.\n\n\tCoogler and Jordan’s longtime collaboration is one of the most prolific in recent history, making five films as director and star: “Fruitvale Station,” “Creed,” “Black Panther,” “Wakanda Forever,” and culminating with the box office blockbuster “Sinners.” Jordan played twin brothers, gangsters Smoke and Stack, in the R-rated vampire epic, which has earned $367 million worldwide and become one of the highest-grossing original horror movies of all time.\n\t\n\n\tThompson stars opposite Jordan in the “Creed” franchise, where Jordan assumed the role of director for the latest installment, “Creed III.” Spencer starred in 2013’s “Fruitvale Station,” where she portrayed Wanda Johnson, mother of the late Oscar Grant (Jordan). The film, directed by Coogler, won the grand jury prize and audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, establishing Jordan as a major talent to watch. Kaluuya appeared opposite Jordan in “Black Panther,” which was the first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture.\n\n\n\tBen Affleck, Mahershala Ali, Bradley Cooper (who received the American Cinematheque tribute in 2018), Delroy Lindo (“Sinners”), Phylicia Rashad (“Creed”) and producer Irwin Winkler (“Creed”) round out the star-studded list of presenters honoring Jordan’s achievements in cinema. \n\t\n\n\tThe show will also feature a special musical performance by “Sinners” breakout talent Miles Caton, Ludwig Göransson and Raphael Saadiq of their original song “I Lied to You,” from the film. Plus, Donna Langley will honor the Motion Picture Association’s Charles H. Rivkin with the Power of Cinema Award, presented by Hill Valley.\n\n\tPrevious American Cinematheque honorees include Denzel Washington (who directed Jordan in 2021’s “A Journal for Jordan”), Eddie Murphy, Bette Midler, Robin Williams, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Sean Connery, Michael Douglas, Rob Reiner, Mel Gibson, John Travolta, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jodie Foster, Bruce Willis, Nicolas Cage, Nicole Kidman, Steve Martin, Al Pacino, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Samuel L. Jackson, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Ben Stiller, Jerry Bruckheimer, Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Ridley Scott, Amy Adams, Cooper, Charlize Theron, Spike Lee, Scarlett Johannsson, Ryan Reynolds and Helen Mirren.\n\n\tThe 38th American Cinematheque Award was presented to Jessica Chastain last year.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Love Language,” the upcoming rom-com starring Chloë Grace Moretz (“The Peripheral,” “The Miseducation of Cameron Post”) has been boarded by Protagonist Pictures, which will introduce the film to buyers at the American Film Market next month. \n\n\tThe feature reunites Protagonist with Oscar-winning indie production company Caviar, having worked together on the films “Sound of Metal” and “War Pony.”\n\n\n\tWritten and directed by Joey Power (“After Everything,” “Banana Split”), “Love Language” also stars Anthony Ramos (“Twisters,” “In the Heights”), Manny Jacinto (“The Acolyte,” “Freakier Friday”), Isabel May (“1883,” “Masters of the Air”), Lukas Gage (“The White Lotus,” “Euphoria”) and Billie Lourd (“The Last Showgirl,” “Booksmart”). It is currently in post production.\n\t\n\n\tFollowing a failed engagement, Lou (Moretz), discovers she has a talent for writing other people’s wedding vows. Word spreads across Chicago’s wedding scene and Lou’s services are in high demand. She even has a new admirer in Dash (Ramos). But everything changes when she’s asked to write vows for Olivia (May), who’s marrying Warren (Jacinto), Lou’s old college flame.\n\n\n\tCaviar arranged full financing for “Love Language,| with Bert Hamelinck and Allison Hironaka producing for Caviar alongside Ari Lubet for 3 Arts Entertainment and Colin Jost and Jeff Grosvenor for No Notes Productions. Executive producers include Michael Sagol for Caviar, Joey Power and Tyson Bidner. CAA Media Finance is representing U.S. rights.\n\n\t“Protagonist Pictures continues to be a trusted partner for us and they are an ideal match on ‘Love Language’ — Joey’s unique vision, combined with the top class cast he’s brought, makes this a standout launch for AFM,” said Bert Hamelinck, head of films and global managing director of Caviar. “We can’t wait to see international audiences fall in love with this sharp, offbeat rom-com in the same way we did.”\n\t\n\n\tProtagonist Picture’s CEO Dave Bishop added: “From the moment we read Joey Power’s script, we knew ‘Love Language’ had that rare mix of heart and humor audiences crave. It’s a fresh, funny, and deeply relatable take on modern love — the kind of film that makes you laugh, ache, and fall a little bit in love yourself. With this incredible cast, Joey’s created something truly special. We’re thrilled to be partnering again with our friends at Caviar and bring it to the international buyers.”\n\n\tBehind the camera on “Love Language” alongside Power are director of photography Andrew Wehde (“The Bear,” “Eighth Grade”), editor Jennifer Vecchiarello (“Reality,” “My Old Ass”), production designer Merje Veski (“The Bear”, “Jupiter Ascending”) and costume designer Matthew Simonelli (“The Wedding Banquet,” “Birds of Paradise”).\n\n\tRounding out the “Love Language” cast are comedian and social media star Morgan Jay, Zach Zucker (“The Joe Schmoe Show”, “Stamptown Comedy Night”), Bobbi Althoff (“Coulda Been Love”), Chloe Fineman (“Saturday Night Live”, Father of the Bride, Babylon), Stephen Schneider (“The Righteous Gemstones,” Bumblebee) , Dan Perrault (Strays, “American Vandal”) and Christian A. Pierce (“PBC,” “The Real Bros of Simi Valley”).\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Ridiculousness” has been canceled at MTV after 14 years and 46 seasons.\n\n\tThe comedy clip series, hosted by Rob Dyrdek, will continue into 2026 with previously shot first-run episodes, but no new episodes will be produced. Season 46 will be the last installment of the series as reruns continue to air on MTV and select seasons stream on Paramount+.\n\n\tAccording to a source familiar with the decision, the cancellation comes as MTV (which is under the Paramount umbrella) looks to feature a more curated slate of content that “embraces its experimental DNA” and represents “different creative voices” and a “refreshed programming.”\n\t\n\n\t“Ridiculousness” debuted in August 2011 and was co-hosted by Chanel West Coast and then Lauren “Lolo” Wood. The series showcases viral videos of failed stunts and “Jackass”-style buffoonery, as Dyrdek and co. deliver comedic analysis and mockery.\n\n\n\tWith more than 1,700 episodes, “Ridiculousness” is one of the longest-running series in MTV history. Its reruns dominated MTV’s linear programming. As Variety reported in 2020, the series once took up 113 hours out of the network’s week-long 168-hour lineup. To many, the show became a symbol of MTV’s glut and lack of original programming. \n\n\tOne day before news of the cancellation broke, Bloomberg reported that MTV was paying Dyrdek, a former professional skateboarder, at least $32.5 million per year, according to court documents reviewed by the publication. Per Bloomberg, that paycheck includes bonuses, a $21,000-per-episode executive producer fee and an escalating $61,000-per-episode on-camera fee. (Those fees add up when the network orders hundreds of new episodes per year.)\n\t\n\n\tKilling “Ridiculousness” marks a big cutback for the network as Paramount restructures its brands after its $8 merger with David Ellison’s Skydance.\n\n\tTMZ broke the news.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEven before he had doppelgängers of his most famous character from an iconic horror franchise roaming Hollywood Boulevard, Robert Englund spent a lot of time on that particular stretch of pavement. He attended premieres at the Chinese Theatre with his parents, the same spot where he would later go on dates before stopping by C.C. Brown’s for hot chocolate and ice cream sundaes. And he dreamed of a career as an actor, particularly after one showing of “West Side Story.” Says Englund, “I remember snapping my fingers up the aisle at the end, wanting to be a Jet or a Shark, and stepping out into the lobby and being blinded by daylight because it was a matinee.” His first agent even had an office there. So it makes perfect sense that Englund will become a part of its history when he receives his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Oct. 31. “It’s very special to me, that great old broad of a street,” he jokes.Englund started out young, landing theater roles by age 12. He later studied several places, including Oakland University’s Meadow Brook Theater, then a branch of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. It was there that a tutor gave him some career advice. “He said, ‘If you had no talent at all, you’re kind of a funny-looking kid — you’ll work.’ Gee, thanks,” Englund says with a laugh.Of course, Englund’s most famous role would involve obscuring that face under layers of prosthetics and makeup to portray Freddy Krueger, the child killer burned to death who wears a glove of metal claws and hunts people in their dreams in “A Nightmare on Elm Street” films. When director Wes Craven first cast him in the 1984 film that started it all, Englund had no idea how it would affect his career. “I don’t even have much to say in the first movie,” he points out.Englund thinks the character struck a chord because Freddy was the symbol for a loss of innocence. “There’s these kids, dreaming of the future, and Freddy is polluting those dreams,” he notes. “He has no future, and so he kills the future. There’s a dark, subconscious poetic feel to it.” Englund laughs and admits, “Now I’m not saying every teenager in the octoplex with a bucket of buttered popcorn is thinking about that intellectually, but they do sense it emotionally. And there is an unrepentant, politically incorrect villain with a dose of personality. Those things together are some of the reasons for the popularity of the character.”But Englund proved to be more than a mascot, using his training and talent to parlay his role into a robust career as actor and director. He has also found steady employment in voice acting — he’s currently lending his vocal talents to the Cricket in the upcoming horror film “Pinocchio: Unstrung.” And over the years, he’s been at the forefront of watching the respect for the horror genre grow. “Something I love is that it’s really opened the door for the imagination,” he notes. “Anything you can conceive of, anything you can imagine, you can do.”And now it’s led him to a star on the Walk of Fame, one he promises to visit when he can. “I’ll go by a couple times a year with a little bottle of Windex and clean it up,” he jokes. “I’ll take my claws to scrape the gum off.”TipsheetWHAT Robert Englund receives a star on the Hollywood Walk of FameWHEN Oct. 31, 11:30 a.m.WHERE 6644 Hollywood Blvd., HollywoodWEB walkoffame.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Stranger Things” creators Matt and Ross Duffer and cast members Gaten Matarazzo, Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin and Finn Wolfhard are spending Halloween with fans at Italy’s Lucca Comics and Games Festival, where they reminisced about their long journey to Season 5 and played up its grand finale.\n\n\t“Obviously, it’s stressful trying to figure out how you want to end the show,” Ross Duffer told the panel’s packed crowd. “Luckily, it was about six or seven years ago that we knew at least what the final scene is. We always knew what the last 40 minutes were going to be.”\n\t\n\n\t“You are having to let go in a way and say goodbye,” added Matt. “So we weren’t thinking about that too much when we were writing that final episode. But once we read it through with [the actors], we realized how much it reflected our own experience. And hopefully that emotion that we felt writing it — and our actors felt performing it — is going to come through to the audience.”\n\n\n\tAsked about how their characters evolved over time and more specifically in the final season, Wolfhard — who plays Mike Wheeler and was just 13 years old when “Stranger Things” catapulted him to international fame — said his character “evolved in a lot of ways that kids and people generally evolve and grow up, but under incredibly weird and sort of disturbing circumstances.” Wolfhard added that the show “does sort of mirror our own lives … obviously, for us, we weren’t like fighting inter-dimensional monsters or anything. But we did have an unorthodox sort of childhood that we went through being with each other.”\n\t\n\n\tAs for Mike’s role in the upcoming season, Wolfhard teased: “I think he’s specifically more into sort of keeping the group together, and a bit more active in his leadership role of the group.”\n\n\t“I was super stoked about jumping into this [season],” said Matarazzo, who plays Dustin Henderson. “I like the fact that Matt and Ross were kind enough to write in some new challenges for me as an actor, which I think have been really fun to tackle.” He added that it was also “a little nerve wracking. But I always think that I do my best work when I’m under pressure and when I’m a little bit anxious.”\n\n\tMcLaughlin noted that Lucas Sinclair has become “a very complex character over the years,” adding: “Starting from Season 1, we do kind of see him being this defensive, skeptical character and we try to understand where that comes from. But then, in Season 5, I feel like I’ve kind of come to a full circle of who that guy is. He’s very caring, very sensitive, and I feel that Max [Mayfield, played by Sadie Stone] has brought that out in him.”\n\n\tNoah Schnapp, who plays Will Byers, called his evolution “specifically a great one.”\n\n\t“I mean, all the characters are amazing, but I really do resonate with Will. I think what’s beautiful about his story is that he doesn’t struggle with one single insecurity or worry. He’s always going through different things,” he said. “And I think that’s what makes him so real is that people aren’t defined by one struggle, but they are always juggling multiple different things.”\n\n\tSchnapp added: “I think what the Duffers did so beautifully is that in each season they explore his personal struggles and his trauma with being taken to the Upside Down, and then his abusive father, and his identity with himself and his self-exclusion from his friends. And so many different things that he’s he’s juggling. This makes him such a real person. I think you could never do that realistically and authentically in one season.\n\n\t“What our show embraces so well is that it’s told over such a long period of time. So that slow burn and slow understanding of who you are is is just what makes it so real,” he continued. “I appreciate that the Duffers did take their time with it, and when we get to the final season, I feel particularly satisfied with how you know it all closes up. Will learns to finally find his voice, and learns that it’s OK to be just who you are, and that’s kind of one of the core themes of our show.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix‘s fandom event at Lucca, which is Europe’s biggest comic convention, is part of the hit show’s global goodbye tour across 25 cities and six continents comprising immersive events, screenings and experiences inspired by Hawkins, the Upside Down and every era of the series.\n\n\tThe Lucca stop included a trailer reveal — that was not open to the press — a fan Q&A and an immersive “Stranger Things” pavilion set up by Netflix in the medieval town’s Piazza San Michele square. It will be followed by an exclusive fan screening of Episode 1 of “Stranger Things” Season 5 on Nov. 13 at the Odeon Luxe theatre in London’s Leicester Square.\n\n\tThe presence of “Stranger Things” at Lucca marks a high spot for the event. “Netflix is creating a major narrative around Lucca. Getting [to launch] their top content, places us on a par with the world’s major capitals that we certainly can’t compete with in terms of number of inhabitants,” Lucca Comics director Emanuele Vietina told Variety. Milan-based entertainment marketing company QMI-Cova leads programming of Lucca’s film and TV strand. The festival runs Oct. 29-Nov. 2.\n\n\tThe final “Stranger Things” season will have eight episodes, with Netflix releasing the first four (Volume 1) on Nov. 26, the next three (Volume 2) on Dec. 25 and the two-hour finale on New Year’s Eve. In an unprecedented move, the streamer is also releasing the finale in more than 350 movie theaters on the same night, playing through Jan. 1, 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s official: Saoirse Ronan, Anna Sawai, Aimee Lou Wood and Mia McKenna-Bruce have joined the cast of “The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event,” playing, respectively, Linda McCartney, Yoko Ono, Pattie Boyd and Maureen Starkey, who each married one member of the Fab Four at the height of the band’s fame and success in the 1960s.\n\n\tWhile Variety previously confirmed the actors would appear in the ambitious project from director Sam Mendes, their deals all closed this week, leading Sony Pictures to make the formal announcement of their casting.\n\t\n\n\t“Maureen, Linda, Yoko and Pattie are four fascinating and unique figures in their own right — and I’m thrilled that we’ve managed to persuade four of the most talented women working in film today to join this amazing adventure,” Mendes said in a statement.\n\n\n\tThe four movies will each take the perspective of one member of the Beatles — John Lennon (Harris Dickenson), Paul McCartney (Paul Mescal), George Harrison (Joseph Quinn) and Ringo Starr (Barry Keoghan) — as they climb from unknowns from Liverpool in the early 1960s to the biggest band in the world before their breakup in 1970. Its the first time that the band and their descendants have given music and life rights to a theatrical feature film about them.  \n\n\tLinda (née Eastman) met McCartney in 1967 while working as a photographer. They married in 1969; after the Beatles broke up, she was a member of McCartney’s band, Wings. They remained together until her death from breast cancer in 1998. \n\n\tOno and Lennon first met in 1966 when the latter took in the former’s conceptual art at a London gallery. Lennon was still married to Cynthia Powell at the time (a role that has not yet been cast), but they divorced in 1968, and Lennon and Ono married the next year.\n\t\n\n\tBoyd was working as a model when she met Harrison on the set of the Beatles’ 1964 film “A Hard Day’s Night.” They married in 1966, then divorced in 1977. (She later was married to Eric Clapton from 1979 to 1989.) In an Oct. 10 post on X (since deleted), Boyd said she was “looking forward (hoping) to meet” Wood “at some point in the future.”\n\n\tStarkey (née Cox) began dating Starr (whose real name is Richard Starkey) in 1962, when she was 16 and working as a hairdresser. They married in 1965, and they had three children together; they divorced in 1975. She died from leukemia in 1994.\n\n\tRonan, a four-time Oscar nominee, will next be seen in the dark comedy “Bad Apples.” Sawai recently won an Emmy for her performance in the FX series “Shogun,” and she’ll next appear on Season 2 of the Apple TV series “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.” Wood first rose to prominence on the Netflix series “Sex Education,” and was nominated for an Emmy this year for her performance on Season 3 of HBO’s “The White Lotus.” And McKenna-Bruce won the BAFTA rising star award and British Independent Film Award for her breakout role in 2023’s “How to Have Sex”; she’s set to star opposite Natalie Dormer in the British miniseries “The Lady.”\n\n\tRonan is repped by CAA. Sawai is repped by WME, 42, United Agents and Chris Abramson. Wood is repped by CAA, Independent and Sloane, Offer, Weber, Dern. McKenna-Bruce is represented by 42 Management, UTA and Luber Roklin.\n",

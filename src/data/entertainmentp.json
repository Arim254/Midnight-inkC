    "description": "\n\tGeorgian filmmaker George Ovashvili, best known for 2014 Karlovy Vary Crystal Globe winner “Corn Island,” is bringing his most personal work to date",
    "body": "\n\tGeorgian filmmaker George Ovashvili, best known for 2014 Karlovy Vary Crystal Globe winner “Corn Island,” is bringing his most personal work to date, “The Moon Is a Father of Mine,” to Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (PÖFF), where it premieres in the main competition.\n\n\tThe film follows 12-year old Toma, expelled from school after being bullied. When he returns home, he finds his father Nemo, absent since Toma was two, waiting to take him to their ancestral village in the Caucasus mountains. Recently released from prison, Nemo is not welcome by the locals. But he is determined to pass down the ancient tradition of deer hunting to the boy. Over the course of this fateful weekend, Toma confronts the wilderness, a pack of wolves, his father’s shadowy past and his own fears.\n\t\n\n\tOvashvili says “The Moon is a Father of Mine” intertwines two true stories from his childhood: the father figure is based on an uncle who passed away, while Toma’s ordeal echoes the experiences of a boy he knew – possibly himself. Both threads, he tells Variety, are rooted in memories that shaped him, but at the heart of the film is his lifelong fascination with the father-son bond.\n\n\n\tUnlike the clear physical connection between mother and child, he reflects, the father’s place is more uncertain: “[He is] someone you’re told is your father, but you don’t really know who he is. Yet you love him and this connection is very strong,” he says.\n\n\tThat ambiguity echoes in Ovashvili’s own memories. He recalls that his own father’s death left him unable to cry. “I couldn’t understand why – until I remembered that, as a child, I used to cry in my bed every night when I thought of my parents dying. I had already done all the crying.”\n\t\n\n\tThe title comes from an old Georgian poem that refers to the moon as a father, a metaphor that shapes the film’s tone: “The Moon Is a Father of Mine” unfolds more as a meditation than a conventional narrative. Its rhythm is slow and deliberate, its images layered with metaphor and its dialogue sparse. “Cinema is a language of visuals, not words,” Ovashvili says. “You only use words when you cannot tell something with images.”\n\n\tThat visual approach, developed with cinematographer Christos Karamanis, mirrors the director’s own blurred perception of waking and imagined worlds. “I wanted to be on the line between dream and reality,” he explains. “I’m always a little out of reality myself,” he continues, “Sometimes I don’t know where the line is. There were periods in my life when I switched them – I lived my dreams as reality, and reality felt like the dream. I turned it upside down.”\n\n\tOvashvili again teams up with longtime collaborators Roelof Jan Minneboo – with whom he co-wrote the Karlovy Vary winning “Corn Island” – and Joseph Bardanashvili who crafted a soundscape blending silence, natural sounds, and melodies.\n\n\tAs with his acclaimed debut “The Other Bank,” Ovashvili cast his young lead, Giorgi Gigauri, from a chance encounter in a Georgian village during location. The father is played by well-known Georgian actor Givi Chuguashvili, rarely seen in leading roles. Both are expected to attend the Tallinn premiere.\n\n\tThe shoot, a co-production between Ovashvili’s Wagonnet Films, and Germany, Luxembourg, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Turkey, took place in hard winter conditions, stretching from 32 days to 42 – a process Ovashvili describes as “the hardest film of my life.”\n\n\tWhile the backdrop evokes Georgia’s post-Soviet upheaval, Ovashvili stresses the film is driven not by history but emotion. “My earlier films were tied to my country, to its history. That was a different kind of pain,” he says. “But this film is my personal pain. It’s about the father-and-son relationship.”\n\n\tAfter Tallinn, Ovashvili plans to continue developing new projects, including another story drawn from his childhood inspired by a tragic accident in his village, and one centered on a family tragedy.\n\t\n\n\t“The Moon Is a Father of Mine” has its world premiere at PÖFF on Nov. 20. The festival runs through Nov. 23.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIconic Italian actor Franco Nero, who gained worldwide fame in Sergio Corbucci’s 1966 classic Spaghetti Western “Django,” will be the top honoree of the upcoming 11th edition of Filming Italy — Los Angeles, the event bridging Italy and Hollywood set to run Feb. 10 to 14, 2026.\n\n\tAs previously announced, Nero — who after “Django” appeared in over 200 movies and TV shows, working with directors such as John Huston, Luis Buñuel, Claude Chabrol, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Quentin Tarantino — will also be celebrated on Feb. 12 by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the Motion Pictures category.\n\t\n\n\t“This is a particularly important milestone for Filming Italy, which has now secured its third star dedicated to an Italian artist, following the awarding of stars to Gina Lollobrigida in 2018, on the occasion of her 90th birthday, and Giancarlo Giannini in 2023,” said Italian marketing guru and festivals specialist Tiziana Rocca in a statement. Rocca noted her “great satisfaction” for being the promoter of this third Italian Hollywood Walk of Fame star.\n\n\n\tNero, who riffed on his role in the original “Django” in a cameo he had in Tarantino’s “Django Unchained,” has also acted in “Camelot,” “Die Hard 2,” “Letters to Juliet” and “John Wick: Chapter 2,” among other Hollywood films. His most recent appearances include a role as mob boss Don Lecco in Julian Schnabel’s “Hand of Dante.” Nero is married to actress Vanessa Redgrave, with whom he has a son, Carlo Gabriel Nero. \n\n\tNero will honored with a retrospective by the Filming Italy fest that will feature a program including Italian cinema world premieres, restored classics, television series, short films and documentary films, many of which previously unseen.\n",

    "body": "\n\tChinese streaming giant iQiYi posted an 8% revenue decline and deepened losses in the third quarter of 2025, though executives emphasized the platform’s drama market leadership and growing international operations.\n\n\tTotal revenues fell to RMB6.68 billion ($938.7 million) for the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company said. That compares to a steeper 11% drop in the previous quarter, when revenues hit RMB6.63 billion ($925.3 million).\n\n\n\tThe company reported a net loss attributable to iQiYi of RMB248.9 million ($35 million), compared to net income of RMB229.4 million ($32.2 million) in the same period in 2024. The loss widened from the previous quarter’s RMB133.7 million ($18.7 million) deficit.\n\t\n\n\tOperating loss was RMB121.8 million ($17.1 million), compared to operating income of RMB238.9 million ($33.5 million) in Q3 2024. This marked a deterioration from the previous quarter’s operating loss of RMB46.2 million ($6.4 million).\n\n\tDespite the financial headwinds, CEO Yu Gong struck a positive note. “The success of our recent drama hits underscores our consistent ability to amplify IP value through high-quality storytelling and advanced production, to connect with broad audiences, and to build our business model with IP at its core,” said Gong, the company’s founder and director. “We continue to scale our IP-centric ecosystem by expanding from online to offline, growing from domestic to overseas markets, and leveraging AI to revolutionize content creation and consumption.”\n\n\tCFO Jun Wang highlighted market gains. “Our investments in new initiatives have started to bear fruit, as demonstrated by the robust growth of our overseas operations in recent quarters,” Wang said. “Meanwhile, we have maintained our leadership in the domestic market, holding the top position in total drama viewership market share for the third quarter of 2025, according to Enlightent data.”\n\t\n\n\tMembership services revenue declined 4% year over year to RMB4.21 billion ($591.7 million), an improvement from the prior quarter’s 9% drop. The company attributed the decline primarily to a lighter content slate compared to the same period last year.\n\n\tOnline advertising services revenue fell 7% to RMB1.24 billion ($174.3 million), also an improvement over Q2’s 13% decline. Brand advertising business achieved solid year-over-year growth, though this was offset by decreases in performance-based advertising.\n\n\tContent distribution revenue dropped 21% to RMB644.5 million ($90.5 million). Revenue from distribution of theatrical movies invested by iQiYi recorded robust year-over-year growth, but this was offset by declining drama series distribution revenue. Other revenues fell 20% to RMB585 million ($82.2 million), mainly due to altered business cooperation arrangements.\n\n\tCost of revenues decreased 3% to RMB5.47 billion ($768 million), with content costs declining 1% to RMB4.04 billion ($567.9 million). Research and development expenses fell 8% to RMB412.1 million ($57.9 million), primarily due to reduced personnel-related compensation.\n\n\tAs of Sept. 30, iQiYi held cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and long-term restricted cash of RMB4.88 billion ($686 million), down from $705.7 million at the end of the previous quarter. The company also had a loan of $522.5 million to PAG, recorded under amounts due from related parties.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmanda Seyfried is pitching another blonde bombshell to join her in a potential third “Mamma Mia” movie.\n\n\tThe Oscar-nominated star has said before that she’d be open to pop star Sabrina Carpenter joining the franchise, and recently told Entertainment Tonight that she wants her “The Housemaid” co-star Sydney Sweeney to get in on the fun.\n\n\tIn an interview with ET at the Governors Awards, Seyfried was asked about the status of a third “Mamma Mia,” to which she replied: “Maybe I’m just naive, but I’m pretty sure ‘Mamma Mia 3’ is a done deal.”\n\t\n\n\tThe second film in the jukebox musical saga was prequel “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,” but Seyfried says she sees “Mamma Mia 3” catching back up with her character Sophie in present day — along with some fresh faces. Though Carpenter has previously been floated as playing her daughter, Seyfried suggested the singer take on a different family member.\n\n\t“I love portraying a mom, so I would love to see Sophie with her kids,” Seyfried said. “Maybe she has a cousin she hasn’t seen in a while, and that could be Sabrina Carpenter. And then Sydney Sweeney could show up. There’s a bunch of girls that really want to be a part of it, and I’m all for it.”\n\n\tThough “Mamma Mia 3” has not been made official yet, producer Judy Craymer has confirmed that there is a script. Of the plot, Seyfried added: “I just know the three dads are going to come back, and we still won’t know who the dad is because it doesn’t matter. Meryl [Streep] is a ghost, obviously, so she’ll be around. And Julie [Walters] and Christine [Baranski] will be back singing and looking hot and we’re all going to be somewhere tropical. And ABBA will be playing.”\n\t\n\n\tSweeney has, in fact, expressed interest in joining the “Mamma Mia” universe. She told Variety back in 2023: “I’ve always wanted to go to Greece. I love ‘Mamma Mia’ — something like that would be really fun.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe streaming industry delivered a significant economic boost to Taiwan‘s creative sector in 2023, contributing NT$9.7 billion (approximately $300 million) to the economy while supporting more than 100,000 jobs across the broader entertainment landscape, according to a new report released Wednesday.\n\n\tInternational consulting firm Frontier Economics unveiled the findings at a Motion Picture Association forum titled “How Streaming Services Drive Taiwan’s Creative Economy” held in Taipei. The study reveals that video-on-demand platforms have become integral to Taiwan’s audiovisual ecosystem, with market penetration reaching over 7 million subscribers.\n\t\n\n\tThe research indicates that 87% of internet users in Taiwan access VOD services at least weekly, with locally produced content accounting for nearly half (48%) of viewing activity. This robust local consumption has prompted major global streaming platforms to significantly increase their investments in Taiwanese programming.\n\n\n\t“Taiwan’s audiovisual sector has a very promising outlook,” said Clive Kenny, economist at Frontier Economics, in a video statement to the forum. “The country provides a mature economic environment, an energetic VOD industry, and is attracting substantial investment.”\n\n\tThe report found that the broader film and television sector directly employed 31,132 people in 2021, with ripple effects supporting approximately 103,000 jobs throughout Taiwan’s economy.\n\n\tHowever, forum participants cautioned that the global streaming landscape is entering what they termed a “post-growth period,” characterized by industry consolidation, rising subscription prices and the expansion of advertising-supported models.\n\t\n\n\tJames Cheatley, MPA VP of VOD, digital affairs and intellectual property, emphasized the need for collaborative approaches over restrictive regulation. “Today’s report confirms that VOD services are a powerful engine for Taiwan’s creative economy – driving investment in local stories and talent, and propelling Taiwanese content to the world,” Cheatley said. “To sustain this momentum, government and industry need to closely collaborate on ‘market incentives’ and skillful ‘investment guidance,’ rather than imposing restrictive regulations that could, as the Frontier report warns, stifle growth and reduce exports.”\n\n\tNational Taiwan University economics professor Feng Bohan highlighted how emerging commercial models are accelerating local content development. “Data shows that when a market launches lower-priced, ad-supported plans, it leads to a significant increase in viewing for local content, encouraged by zero or lower cost entry barriers and attracting new users who prefer local-language programming,” Feng said.\n\n\tAtomic 76 managing director Yang Zhiguang underscored streaming platforms’ role in elevating production standards. “Streaming services are catalysts for upskilling, bringing international standards, new technologies, and creative collaborations that elevate the entire industry,” Yang said. “Taiwan’s creators are proving they can meet global demand when given the opportunities and support.”\n\n\tThe Frontier Economics study warns that heavy-handed regulatory approaches could undermine the sector’s export potential. The research projects that enforcing local content quotas and other restrictive policies on VOD platforms could reduce content export revenue by 4.3%.\n\n\t“Policymaking that increases barriers and restrictions must be approached with care, as this could dampen investment motivation for the industry,” Kenny added.\n\n\tForum participants concluded that strengthening copyright protection, supporting talent development and infrastructure, and providing production incentives could create a positive cycle attracting further investment – establishing a foundation for Taiwan’s globally influential “T-Wave.”\n\n\tThe report was commissioned by the MPA and conducted by Frontier Economics using economic modeling, stakeholder interviews and a survey of 1,000 internet users in Taiwan.\n\t\n\n\tThe MPA’s member studios include Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Netflix Studios, Paramount Pictures, Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Universal City Studios and Warner Bros. Discovery. Charles Rivkin serves as chair and CEO.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe future couldn’t look more vertical than from the 76th floor of the Lotte Tower, the sixth tallest building in the world, where microdrama key stakeholders attended the conference Future Is Vertical: The Global Rise of Short Form Media. The intentional choice from organizer Crisp, a short-form scripted video content company, underscored ambitions to shape an industry racing toward $26 billion in global revenues by 2030.\n\n\tThe summit, held at Seoul’s Signiel Hotel, brought together platforms, content creators and technology providers from the Americas, Europe and Asia to discuss an industry transforming from its origins in gaming and web novels to mainstream entertainment.\n\t\n\n\tThe event opened with a keynote by Adrian Cheng, chair of Crisp and the newly formed Almad Group. He emphasized that microdramas represent not a fad but a global phenomenon emerging from Seoul to Sao Paulo where “every frame is intentional, every moment carries intention.” In Lagos, he noted, comedians thrive in two- to three-minute vertical short-scripted videos.\n\n\n\tChen Bo, chief executive of Neorigin, traced the format’s evolution from gaming methodologies during a panel on how games and web novels shaped short-form drama. “Our microdrama team at NeoOrigin is actually a spin-off from the game publishing team,” Chen explained. “We use the same methodologies, business models and publishing tools, like Meta or Google.”\n\n\tProduction timeline and budget emerged as key differentiators. While game development typically requires hundreds of thousands of dollars and several years, microdramas can be produced in one to two months for under $100,000, according to Chen. Zou Jianfeng, chair of MoboReels, emphasized that cost remains the main barrier when adapting complex stories to short-form formats.\n\t\n\n\tMarket intelligence firm Media Partners Asia presented data showing the sector grew from virtually zero five years ago to $5 billion in 2023, with projections reaching $12 billion by year-end. China currently drives nearly 80% of global revenue, though growth is accelerating in the U.S., Japan, Southeast Asia and Korea.\n\n\tCassandra Yang, chief executive of RisingJoy, highlighted emerging territories during the Short Form Going Global panel. “India has seen huge growth this year,” Yang noted. “It went from zero to the biggest growth market of independent microdrama apps since September 2024. Thailand and Indonesia have emerged, with Indonesia becoming the second-largest download market after India.”\n\n\tMartin Moszkowicz, veteran German producer and former Constantin Film chair, emphasized budget discipline while suggesting intellectual property development would determine success. “There are going to be hundreds of series that are going to flop in the market,” he said. “Who gets the genius creators is what’s going to be important.”\n\n\tYang reinforced the content quality imperative. “Companies I work with run microdrama apps with a game-industry methodology for user acquisition,” she said. “But I tell them that if you don’t have good content, your retention rate will drop in seven days.”\n\n\tRonan Wong, CEO of AR Asia Productions, identified untapped creative territory including unscripted content, horror and formats targeting Gen Z audiences. The animation segment drew particular interest, with Emily Yang and Maciej Kuciara, Emmy-awarded co-founders of Shibuya studio, presenting their vertical animated microdrama “White Rabbit.”\n\n\t“Within traditional Hollywood structure, there’s a lot of politics and bureaucracy,” Yang observed during The Future is Empowering Creators with Short Form Animation panel. “I’m very optimistic that the short-form drama market will be a more vertical place for artists to express themselves.”\n\n\tKuciara emphasized format advantages. “Going vertical means going much shorter,” he said. “By telling mini-stories, it’s much easier and allows creators to be more creative with the medium and cut the cost.”\n\n\tThe “White Rabbit” production incorporates audience participation through episode greenlight voting. The series follows Mirai, a character unaware of her artificial intelligence nature, a theme that resonated throughout conference discussions.\n\t\n\n\tMinhong Lee, co-founder of Carpenstreet, projected cautious optimism about AI applications. “I think we can reduce the microdrama production budget with AI,” Lee said. “But it’s like with airplanes. There are very high-tech models now, but the pilot is still essential.”\n\n\tYang framed AI as a creative tool rather than replacement. “You give two directors the same camera; one can tell an amazing story, and another will tell a very lazy one,” she said. “The story matters, not the technology.”\n\n\tTikTok presented its microdrama distribution strategy during a keynote titled Unlocking Global Traffic Codes, with representatives Ben Yang and Liya Li outlining metrics for early hit identification. The platform’s data showed multilingual dubbing increases ad consumption by 102% compared to single-language content, while multi-country deployment increases consumption by 258 percent.\n\n\tMedia Partners Asia analyst Myat Pan Phyu detailed market dynamics in her presentation on the microdrama economy, noting that standalone apps like ReelShort and DramaBox currently dominate app store entertainment charts globally. The sector targets predominantly female audiences aged 25 to 45, though demographic patterns vary by market.\n\n\tInvestment activity signals industry maturation. Recent deals include Krafton’s $86 million investment in Spoon Labs, parent company of Vigloo, and Fox’s backing of Holywater for vertical video production. DramaBox’s participation in the Disney Accelerator program indicates major studio interest.\n\n\tThe conference highlighted infrastructure advantages in embedded ecosystems, particularly WeChat mini-programs in China, which integrate discovery, payment and distribution within existing super-app frameworks.\n\n\tProfitability remains elusive for most players despite revenue growth. Among major platforms, DramaBox reported $12 million profit on $323 million revenue, while ReelShort projects $800 million in revenue but continues operating at a loss due to premium production costs and paid traffic acquisition.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis year’s two-day Industry @ Tallinn & Baltic Event’s TV drama showcase TV Beats Forum which closed last night, was about celebrating togetherness and how to survive the changes in the industry. The top awards reflected Europe’s capacity to forefront heart-warming and entertaining stories from its past, as well as suspenseful myths, while rejigging co-production partnerships.\n\n\tThree of the winning shows among seven contenders from the TV Beats Co-financing Market had garnered industry attention at earlier TV showcases.\n\t\n\n\t“Wool,” winner of the coveted Council of Europe €50,000 ($58,600) Series Co-Production Development Award, was first pitched at this year’s Series Mania. Last night, the international jury consisting of Cia Edström (Göteborg TV Drama Vision) Marc Lorber (The Art of Coproduction), and Clementine Trolong-Baily (Series Co-Productions Pilot Program) praised “Wool” as a “true story that knits together fashion with female empowerment in a rural-meets-international setting, making it as relevant today as it was then, backed with a killer soundtrack that does the same.”\n\n\n\tCreated by producer Milena Dzambasovic for her Belgrade-based Film Road Production, the six-part series, set in 1960s Yugoslavia, centres on a visionary woman who overturned a patriarchal society by uniting village housewives into a knitting collective. Their traditional crafts become a global fashion sensation, transforming rural lives and defying norms. \n\n\tDzambasovic co-wrote the screenplay with Mladen Maticevic, Stephie Theodora and seasoned writer Birkir Blaer Ingolfsson (“Reykjavik Fusion”). Ingolfsson’s partner at Act4 Hörður Rúnarsson is co-producing, together with high-powered Berlin-based Danna Stern of In Transit Productions, former founder of Tel-Aviv’s Yes Studios. Pre-production is set for next year.\n\t\n\n\tEdström also handed out the TV Drama Vision Select Award to the Spanish mystery drama “Dark Waters” (“Aigües de Foscor”) which bowed recently at Serielizados Mind the Gap co-production session in Barcelona. \n\n\t“We’ve chosen a supernatural mystery, a story about climate change, a tale that intertwines the mythological world of Iceland and the Ebro Delta of Catalonia,” she said.\n\n\tProduced by Federation Spain’s Juan Solà and Lastor Media’s Tono Folguera, the eight-part series is co-penned by Amèlia Mora (“Undercover,” “La Unidad”) and Héctor Manteca, with idea creator Maria Rocher of Federation Spain serving as exec producer.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCia Edstrom, Maria Rocher, “Dark Waters” winner \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Annika Pham\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnother buzzy project pitched earlier at Series Mania, the cold war satire “Nuclear Sunset Cruise” (“MS Völkerfreundschaft”), walked off with the TV Beats Co-Production Market Public Favourite Award, after collecting 496 votes from industry delegates gathered on Monday at Tallinn’s Apollo Kino Plaza. Created and directed by Florian Gallenberger, an Oscar-winner for the short film “Quiero”, the German series, produced by Schiwago Film, has received backing from broadcaster ARD Degeto Film.\n\n\tElsewhere, the Polish comedy “We Are Still Here,” pitched alongside eight projects part of the Midpoint Series Launch training program, took home the program’s Favourite Award. The show was penned by Aleksandra Hulbój for producer Piotr Śmiechowski.\n\n\tTaking centre stage at the Kinomaja Bar & Stage in Tallinn’s medieval Old Town last night, TV Beats Forum co-heads Petri Kemppinen and Roosa Toivonen also handed out the Honorary TV Beats Producer Awards to heavyweight co-winners Gudny Hummelvoll from Norway and Jevgeni Supin from Estonia.\n\n\tIn a separate awards ceremony on Monday, the inaugural Serial Bridges Baltic Best Project Award went to the Lithuanian comedy drama “Therapies,” produced by Just a Moment, which also picked the section’s Audience Award.\n\n\tWritten and directed by Birute Kapustinskaite from her own hit play, the drama comedy turns on a cancer-stricken professor who shares her cancer-ward with six loud women. “We believe that the all-female ensemble, offering drama and chaos but finally support and friendship, will be a pleasure to watch”, said jurors Dominika Erhart-Braná (Serial Killer), Erik Pack, (Boat Rocker Studios), and Finnish screenwriter Anna Ruohonen, recipient of last year’s top TV Beats Co-Production Development Award.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRoosa Toivonen and Petri Kemppinen, TV Beats Forum awards\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: Karolin Linamae\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBaltic TV Push\n\n\tCommenting on the first Serial Bridges Baltic training workshop in Tallinn, set up to boost series from the Baltics and their ties to the European market, Pierre Ziemniak, director of program at the Series Mania Institute said the six selected writer-producer duos from Estonia, Latvia and Estonia made “remarkable progress during the five-day workshop under the mentorship of Hungarian writer/producer Gabor Krigler, Finnish writer Jemina Jokisalo (“Money Shot”) and support from TV experts Emmanuelle Guilbart (About Premium Content), producers Emmanuel Eckert, and Patrick Nebout. “All six Baltic teams fine-tuned their vision and made their project more appealing for an international audience,” he said.\n\n\tZiemniak said the Lithuanian creators of “Therapies” will join all the winners of the Series Mania Institute’s Serial Bridges initiatives in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Rio de Janeiro at Series Mania’s first Serial Bridges ceremony in 2026.\n\n\tIn a separate new initiative to champion Baltic TV drama, three upcoming premium shows looking for partners were presented by their respective creators: realistic Estonian cop show “Crossing the Line,” Lithuanian drama “Hijacked Life,” about a father and son’s hijacking of a Soviet airplane in search of freedom in 1970, and Latvian thriller drama “The Hostages.”\n\n\tKemppinen and Toivonen said TV Beats Forum was attended by nearly 30 key buyers and commissioners including Beta Film, Bavaria Film, About Premium Content, Eccho Rights, Rainmaker, and all key Baltic players including the streamers Elisa, Go3, pubcasters EER in Estonia, LRT in Lithuania and LSM in Latvia. More than 200 closed meetings and over 100 1:1 sessions were facilitated over Nov. 17-18.\n\n\t“We are here to build bridges between the Baltic region and the rest of the world, and help local producers from those smaller nations, navigate the changes in the shifting and complex global audiovisual industry,” noted Kemppinen and Toivonen, themselves producers.\n\n\tA first-time attendee at TV Beats Forum, Ziemniak said, “I loved the mid-size of the event-allowing for quality meetings with key decision-makers from the Baltics and beyond. “\n\t\n\n\tFor him, Baltic TV Drama and talents are yet to conquer the world. “Baltic feature films have been taken seriously for a long time, but series are in their starting blocks. Only a few series so far have managed to breakthrough,” he said, citing the Jevgeni Supin-produced period drama “Von Fock,” the first Estonian series ever to receive support from both Creative Europe’s Media Program and the Council of Europe’s Pilot Program for Series Co-Productions, and psycho thriller “My Dear Mother” showcased at this year’s Berlinale Series Market Selects program. “We are therefore pleased with Serial Bridges Baltics to accelerate Baltic shows’ global push.”\n\n\tAlso in attendance at TV Beats Forum for the first time, French-Swedish producer Patrick Nebout who has shot several Swedish high-end productions in Lithuania, including Disney+/SVT’s “Whiskey on the Rocks”  said: “I’m overwhelmed by the vivacity, the energy, the creativity, the agility of drama producers and creators in the Baltic region. These are tiny markets in comparison to the Nordic countries, and yet, they demonstrate such positivism and entrepreneurship in times of severe shifts within the global industry.\n\n\tThis stands in striking contrast to the atmosphere of gloom and doom that prevails right now in most markets across the Nordics and Continental Europe. We should take an example from such a forward-oriented stance.”\n\n\tThe seasoned producer said he is in talks with an Estonian producer to source scripted formats and perhaps co-develop projects and IPs, aimed at international audiences.\n\n\tEdith Sepp, CEO at the Estonian Film Institute (EFI) which has a €80,000 ($92,600) budget earmarked towards the development of mini-series and the post-production of TV docu series said “TV Beats Forum supports the goal of strengthening co-production, improving story scale and quality, reaching international audiences, aligning very well with EFI’s strategy of boosting export and visibility of Estonian screen work.”\n\n\tShe said this year’s involvement of the Series Mania Institute and French Institute via Serial Bridges Baltics “signals that the Baltic region is taken seriously; it raises our regional standing, but above all, it proves that we do make interesting series and we have stories to tell.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event runs through Nov. 21, Tallinn’s Black Nights Film Festival until Nov. 23.\n",

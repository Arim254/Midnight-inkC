    "body": "\n\tTurkish AI production company Spongeworthy, the pioneering studio behind buzzy AI-generated doc “Post Truth,” has announced their second AI movie, titled “A Woman Asleep.” The company will be shopping it to buyers at Berlin’s upcoming European Film Market.\n\n\t“A Woman Asleep,” to which Variety has been given exclusive first trailer access (watch above), is a piece on contemporary alienation inspired by the 1974 cult French film “The Man Who Sleeps,” directed by Bernard Queysanne and Georges Perec. That movie, in turn, was based on Perec’s novel “A Man Asleep.”\n\t\n\n\tThe AI feature film, which examines contemporary alienation and numbness in today’s world of hyper-connectivity, will mark the directorial debut of artist and filmmaker Vikki Bardot. Her AI short “Dreamt by Another” screened in more than 20 festivals and was recently acquired by Mubi for Turkey.\n\n\tBardot is partners in the Spongeworthy studio with Turkish director and artist Alkan Avcıoğlu, who created the groundbreaking AI doc “Post Truth.” The doc delves into man’s relationship with technology and has been making the festival rounds after making a splash at the Warsaw Film Festival and getting a theatrical release in Turkey. “Post Truth,” which was co-written by Avcıoğlu and Bardot, will be in competition at the upcoming Fantasporto International Film Festival in Portugal.\n\n\tThe script for “A Woman Asleep” is penned by the same duo as “Post Truth.”\n\n\tThe narration for “A Woman Asleep” is generated using an AI voice clone trained on the director’s own voice. “This choice extends the film’s conceptual framework and dreamlike qualities, allowing the narration to exist in a space between the human and the synthetic, consistent with the world the film portrays,” the promotional materials say, citing the storytelling approaches of Alain Resnais, Michelangelo Antonioni, Chris Marker and Apichatpong Weerasethakul as references.\n\t\n\n\t“The dominant narratives around AI in the media tend to revolve around Hollywood, budgets and click-driven debates,” Bardot said. “What remains underestimated is the sheer potential these tools offer for independent cinema and auteur-driven storytelling.”\n\n\tBardot recently served as a panelist on AI filmmaking at Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea International Film Festival. She is regarded as one of the early practitioners of photographic AI art and video art series. She delivered a TEDx talk on AI and art in 2023, and her artworks have been exhibited worldwide, including New York, Paris, London, Berlin, Rome and Miami.\n",

Rowling has sought to clear up online speculation concerning her rumored connections to disgraced financier and convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\tWithin the latest tranche of Epstein files released by the DoJ was an invitation to the official Broadway opening of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” on April 22, 2018 — after he had been convicted — prompting critics on social media to claim that he had been invited by Rowling. \n\t\n\n\tResponding to an X user who asserted she had been was “sending invitations to Epstein 10 years after he was convicted,” the author replied: “This is beyond silly. Neither I, nor anybody on my team, ever met, communicated with or invited Jeffrey Epstein to anything.”\n\n\n\tFurther scrutiny of the Epstein files have shown that the tickets were sent to Epstein, not by Rowling, but the hit stage show’s producers following a request by Epstein associate Peggy Siegal, who emailed Playground Entertainment head Colin Callender saying that a “very important friend” wanted to “come see the spectacle.” There is no indication that Callender was aware who the friend in question was and he confirmed to Variety‘s sister publication Deadline that he did not. \n\n\tIn any case, the DoJ files also confirm that Epstein was stopped from attending the “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” opening. While he was sent the correct tickets, in an email to Siegal the following morning he claimed he “could’t get in” as his name was not on the guestlist. “No biggy but thought you should know,” he added. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tWearing sunglasses and a brown Givenchy suit, Timothee Chalamet was welcomed like a proper rockstar at the French premiere of “Marty Supreme” at Le Grand Rex theater in Paris on Tuesday night. \n\n\tAddressing people in the crowd from the stage, Chalamet playfully called out the Paris venue for charging attendees overpriced tickets to attend the premiere of the A24 movie. “I know you were charged a lot,” said Chalamet, who appeared to somewhat still be in character as hustling table tennis champ Marty Reisman. “It has nothing to do with me! I’m not getting any money from it, I would have liked for it to be free.” \n\t\n\n\tThe actor, who is also producing the film, was alluding to the fact that Le Grand Rex sold tickets for the Paris premiere that went up to €50 ($60) for reserved seats in the orchestra. \n\n\n\tChalamet, whose performance in Safdie’s movie has won him his first Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination, also paid tribute to France’s cinephile culture and delighted fans by speaking French to present the movie alongside Josh Safdie and Ron Bronstein.\n\n\tHe praised “the French people who love movies.” “There is a big cinema culture in France,” he said, “and even if the film is successful in the United States, it’s a miracle movie.”  \n\n\tSafdie, who’s nominated for best director at the Oscars, said the part of Marty Reisman “was written for (Chalamet).”\n\n\t“I met him when he was in his early 20s, and I met a young man who had eyes bigger than his head,” said Safdie. “I met a young man who was present in the room but not where he wanted to be, and I met Timmy Supreme. I met a kid who had a vision for himself. He could see the world, he could see the arts, but he was so far away. He needed to be at the center.”\n\t\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” will be released in France on Feb. 18 by Metropolitan FilmExport. \n",

    "body": "\n\tU.K.-based sales and distribution company Blue Finch Films has picked up worldwide sales rights, excluding Canada, to “Unholy Night,” a holiday horror feature marking the directorial debut of Michael Gabriele.\n\n\tThe film recently completed production in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and Blue Finch will launch sales at Berlin’s European Film Market.\n\n\tThe festive horror centers on Gino, whose traditional Italian family Christmas Eve celebration descends into chaos when his deceased grandmother returns from the dead and embarks on a killing spree. As more dead relatives begin appearing throughout the neighborhood, Gino must find a way to eliminate the holiday revenants and make it through the family gathering alive.\n\t\n\n\tGabriele, whose award-winning short films include “Get Away,” wrote the screenplay and produced the project with Jenna MacMillan of Club Red Productions (“The Snake,” “Who’s Yer Father?”) and Jason Levangie and Marc Tetreault of Shut Up & Colour Pictures (“Sharp Corner,” “Kids vs Aliens”). Executive producers are Tina Carbone, Jef Burnham, Mike Chapman and Fatima Hayward.\n\n\n\tThe cast is led by Marc Bendavid (“Dark Matter,” “Reacher”) and Shailene Garnett (“Fire Country,” “Diggstown”), with supporting performances from Al Sapienza (“The Sopranos,” “House of Cards”), Ron Lea (“The Recruit,” “Orphan Black”), Ton Ellwand (“Mafia Inc.”), Cristina Rosato (“Mother!,” “Assassin’s Creed”), Jaqueline Robbins (“The Monkey”) and Joe Pingue (“Station Eleven,” “Star Trek: Section 31”).\n\n\t“We all know holiday family gatherings can feel like a survival horror, but Unholy Night takes that relatable tension to an extreme,” Gabriele said. “Growing up in my Italian family, Christmas Eve was always a huge event that was loud and full of love, but also incredibly intense. I wanted to take those real pressures we all feel with family and combine them into a visceral, festive nightmare. Audiences can expect a violent ride that is hilarious, heartfelt, and frightening – as it explores the burden of family traditions and overcoming regret – amidst total chaos.”\n\t\n\n\tMike Chapman of Blue Finch Films added: “‘Unholy Night’ is an impressive debut from Michael, taking the idea of unwanted family guests for Christmas to a whole new level. Mixing bold horror, dark humour, and heart, he has created a seasonal slam dunk.”\n\n\tBlue Finch’s current international slate includes Rotterdam-selected horror “Bowels Of Hell,” SXSW-selected sci-fi thriller “Imposters” and “Dolly,” which premiered at Fantastic Fest and will be released by IFC and Shudder this year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAnimated feature film “On the Edge” has revealed its voice cast, which is led by Daryl McCormack and Mia McKenna-Bruce, and also features Chris O’Dowd and Mark Rylance. The cast also includes Anna Maxwell Martin, Paterson Joseph and Vincent Tong.\n\n\tOctavio Rodriguez, whose credits include “Ron’s Gone Wrong,” “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” and “Coco,” directed the film, and spoke to Variety about what we can expect (see below).\n\t\n\n\tInternational rights are held by Studio 100 Film, and Viva Kids will distribute in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\n\tMcCormack broke out with “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande,” and has since appeared in “Wake Up Dead Man” and “Twisters,” among other titles, while McKenna-Bruce came to attention as the lead in Cannes hit “How to Have Sex” and won the BAFTA Rising Star award. She is set to play Ringo’s first wife Maureen Starkey in Sam Mendes’ Beatles movies.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“On the Edge”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Studio BlueGreen\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRylance’s credits include “The BFG,” “Bridge of Spies” and “Wolf Hall,” while O’Dowd has appeared in “Bridesmaids” and “This Is 40.”\n\n\t“On the Edge” stars a motley crew of endangered animals, led by Donnie, a Cuban solenodon with a nose for adventure, on a worldwide quest in search of survival, freedom, and as many free snacks as they can eat.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“On the Edge”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Studio BlueGreen\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDonnie and friends refuse to go extinct quietly, setting out on an epic quest to crash the world tour of Peng – the superstar panda and hero of Pandaland – to discover how fame and “huggability” kept him alive.\n\n\tAlong the way, Donnie haphazardly recruits, amongst others, Vy, a sassy, loyal, and fiercely independent Aye-Aye; Kiki, a flightless Kakapo parrot and powerhouse of kindness and optimism; and Roman, an overly dramatic Jamaican Funnel-Eared Bat.\n\t\n\n\t“On the Edge” is written by Laura Dockrill and Michael Ryan, and is a collaboration between Studio BlueGreen, Studio 100 International, On the Edge Animation AIE, Able & Baker, Telegael and Viva Pictures. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“On the Edge” voice cast\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Studio BlueGreen\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe film was originated by Studio BlueGreen, a not-for-profit creative studio “telling nature stories in unique entertainment-led formats to increase our connection with nature and support global conservation efforts,” according to a statement.\n\n\tBeth Blood, producer and founder of Studio BlueGreen, said, “Many movies claim to be so much more than a film. ‘On the Edge’ is one of the very few premium-quality, globally animated releases to live up to this claim because we originated this film not for our personal profit but to achieve impact. At its heart, this movie is about using the joy and emotive power of the very best in animated storytelling, to foster a love of our planet and the incredible animals, species, and ecosystems that populate it.”\n\n\tRodriguez tells Variety that what interested him about the project was that it featured voices that don’t get be heard often. “A lot of movies or stories that I gravitate toward are those of the underdogs, the ones that have to do a little bit more to get to where they need to go,” he says.\n\n\tHe adds that for him it was about finding a message “that cross-pollinates between families and generations.” He adds, “It’s like having a conversation with your child. There’s a curiosity when I see my children, and a wonder that they have, and I’m trying to find a way to get back to that.”\n\n\tWhen the characters go on their adventure, we see “how humans have affected the environment for these animals,” he says. “It’s interesting seeing it from the point of view of Donnie, who’s never seen it before, so everything is surprising to him.”\n\n\tHe refers to a scene inside of a truck and another in an airport, and the difference in scale for the animals, seeing things from their perspective. “It’s almost alien to them. They’ve never seen this stuff before. It gives us a unique perspective,” he says. Other memorable scenes will be a chase sequence under a train and at a concert in a Las Vegas-style venue.\n\n\tThe humor in the film will come from “the characters and their point of view,” he says, and also “from the humans and how they interact with the animals.” “It also goes back to the distinctive personalities [of the animals] and how they all have different ways of dealing with things.”\n\t\n\n\tIn terms of conveying the film’s conservation message, he says it was important to find a way for the audience to connect with the characters so that the film poses questions and starts a conversation. “We’re not trying to spoon feed this. It’s really story first,” he says. “I really wanted to avoid trying to push some information at you. I wanted you just to sit back and enjoy the story and go, ‘I want to know more about these characters.’ My desire for this is that you walk out of the theater and have a conversation and be more curious about what’s happening to these animals.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tFollowing Joaquin Phoenix’s exit last year, Todd Haynes’ subversive love story “De Noche” is back on track with Pedro Pascal officially set to play ",
    "body": "\n\tFollowing Joaquin Phoenix’s exit last year, Todd Haynes’ subversive love story “De Noche” is back on track with Pedro Pascal officially set to play a hard-boiled detective opposite Danny Ramirez as his younger lover. Shooting will start next month.\n\n\tMK2 Films, the French indie banner behind Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” and Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent,” is financing the film as well as handling international sales. The Paris-based company is also co-repping domestic rights with Cinetic Media. Killer Films’ Christine Vachon and Pamela Koffler are producing.\n\t\n\n\tHaynes penned the screenplay with longtime collaborator Jon Raymond. The story, which echoes classic noirs like “Chinatown,” charts the passionate and unexpected love affair between a cop (Pascal) and a boarding school teacher (Ramirez) in 1930s Los Angeles, when the city is overtaken by corruption and the world is on the brink of war. The two men become targets of the city’s corrupt political machine and are forced to flee to Mexico.\n\n\tThe project marks Pascal’s first collaboration with Haynes. The actor has been balancing out studio blockbusters such as Marvel’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” with prestige indies like A24’s “Materialists” and “Eddington.”\n\n\tHaynes, whose last film “May December” earned an Oscar nomination for best screenplay, said: “This story, with Pedro Pascal and Danny Ramirez in the two leads, arises out of an era — all too relevant to our own — of domestic corruption, racial exploitation and global terror.”\n\n\t“But it emerges as a testament to the inexplicable powers of desire and love to survive and overcome even the most crippling of human barriers,” added Haynes, who is also an outspoken activist.Fionnuala Jamison, managing director of MK2 Films, said: “Few filmmakers connect with audiences as strongly as Todd Haynes.” Jamison, who will kick off sales on the project at the European Film Market in Berlin, added that Haynes’ films “such as ‘Carol’ and ‘Far from Heaven’ have left a lasting emotional impact worldwide. ‘De Noche’ carries that same power, and with Killer Films and a remarkable cast led by Pedro Pascal, it is a stand-out project we are proud to be a part of and share with buyers.”\n\t\n\n\tPaloma Negra Films and MK2 are also producing with Jonathan Montepare and Steven Demmler, in association with Cinetic Media. IPR.VC is financing as part of their long-term partnership with MK2, alongside Yggdrasil, Léger Production, Mid March, Pluto and Leaf Entertainment.\n\n\tMK2 Films will also be attending the Berlinale with Kornél Mundruczó’s “At the Sea” starring Oscar-nominated Amy Adams, which will world premiere in competition. The banner is rolling off a strong awards and festival momentum, having nabbed three Golden Globe Awards and seven European Film Awards — as well as 15 and 11 nominations at the Oscars and BAFTAs, respectively — with movies such as Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent” and Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSet in Pittsburgh in the early 1990s, “The Gymnast” follows a young athlete who, after a life-changing accident, loses her identity — much like her city. But director Charlotte Glynn, who also grew up there, found contemporary parallels in the story. \n\n\t“Mass amounts of people were leaving Pittsburgh and looking for work. Entire towns became ghost towns,” she recalls, describing the aftermath of the steel crisis in the 1980s.\n\t\n\n\t“Thousands were laid off, and the ramifications of industrialization can be connected to the current moment the U.S.: all this fascism. It’s not that fantastical to draw a connection between the decimation of these communities and the rise of people turning on their neighbors.”\n\n\n\tShe adds: “The best ‘period pieces’ are really mirroring what’s happening now.” \n\n\tDespite personal elements, Glynn wanted to address “larger questions” in the film: “Things that are outside my own personal angst. You want to take your experience and turn it into something others can engage with.”\n\n\tHer protagonist, 16-year-old Monica (Britney Wheeler), dreams of competing in the Olympics. Instead, an accident forces her to rethink her entire future. \n\n\tRicky Tollman and Luke Spears produced the film — premiering in Rotterdam’s Tiger Competition — while Visit Films handles sales. \n\n\t“I had a dear friend who was a gymnast when we were teenagers. I watched her go through a similar experience. Your life can change just like that,” she says. \n\n\t“Disability is something I’ve explored in my previous films — my sister has an intellectual disability — and deep into making ‘The Gymnast,’ I realized it’s not just a sports movie. It talks about how we can lose something physical that we had been taking for granted.”\n\t\n\n\tSubverting the genre, she thought of films like Chloé Zhao’s “The Rider” and “The Wrestler,” also depicting former athletes dealing with injuries or age.  \n\n\t“It feels like ‘The Gymnast’ is within this tradition. But that identity is still part of who Monica is. My friend, who inspired me, knew her floor routine even at age 30. I wondered: What does it mean to live your whole life being connected to something like this?”\n\n\tWheeler, an athlete herself, had been involved with the film for a long time.\n\n\t“We started casting before the pandemic, so I met her when she was 12. She had an incredible ability to just be present. We didn’t shoot until four years later, so ultimately, I made the character older.”\n\n\tEthan Embry joined the cast as Monica’s irresponsible yet loving dad, Rich, who’s drifting – also because his generation, unlike their parents, is unable to find stable jobs in the steel mills. \n\n\t“Do you think we’re easier on fathers than we are on mothers?” wonders Glynn.\n\n\t“I wasn’t interested in hating any of the characters, but I’ve noticed people empathize with him just because he’s ‘trying.’ Even though he’s unable to see things that are right in front of him,” she said.  \n\n\t“Ethan brought so much vulnerability [to the role] but also, he was a child actor. I wanted to make sure I was casting someone who would be comfortable working with a young person who had never been on set before.”\n\n\tAs Monica’s injury forces her out of her punishing schedule and well-established routines, she starts experimenting. \n\n\t“ She’s suddenly isolated because of the injury and she’s searching for connection. I really wanted to explore her rebellion and the excitement of, say, drinking in the park,” says Glynn.\n\n\t“For me, high school sucked. It’s such a complicated time and you’re trying to figure out who you are. But you’re also open to all these new experiences. When she’s running away from the cops, it feels as exciting as when she was still competing.”\n\n\tHer transformation won’t be easy, however. \n\n\t“Being a teenager is really complicated; being a teenage girl is really complicated. You are fighting against the odds, but there’s also… this thrill. When I was younger, all I wanted to do was to get out of Pittsburgh, so I was looking for adventures until I could finally leave. And then I did.”\n\t\n\n\tNow, after “The Gymnast,” Glynn is excited to finally let go of her past. \n\n\t“I was just in Pittsburgh for Thanksgiving, and it was such an incredible feeling. I’ve spent 20 years there, and now it’s as if they’ve lifted off of me. I can go and continue to make other movies now. And tell other stories.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tS.S. Rajamouli has worked with some of Indian cinema’s biggest stars, but Mahesh Babu managed to surprise him in unexpected ways. \n\n\t“As an actor, not much surprised me, because I was watching his films from a very long time. I know what he is capable of,” the “RRR” director says of working with Babu for the first time on “Varanasi.” “What came as a surprise is his work ethic.”\n\n\tChief among those surprises: Babu’s strict discipline around mobile phones. “He comes into the office without his phone. He keeps the phone in his car and steps into the office,” Rajamouli says. “At the shoot, I have never seen him come with the phone into the set. Only after he gets back into the car, he takes his phone.”\n\t\n\n\tThe observation was striking enough that Rajamouli made his own vow to “not touch my phone when I’m with my family members,” he says.\n\n\n\t“Varanasi” spans thousands of years and traverses multiple continents, with locations ranging from Antarctica to Africa to the titular Indian city. Babu plays the dual roles of the protagonist Rudhra and Hindu God Rama, Priyanka Chopra Jonas plays a character named Mandakini and the main antagonist Kumbha is played by Prithviraj Sukumaran. \n\n\tRajamouli describes Babu’s discipline as unprecedented. “It’s not that he is continuously busy in the office. He does his job, and we discuss with him if there is anything he needs to practice, and sometimes there are two, three hours, he just sits at his table observing all the people who work. He does not get his phone. He just observes,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tWhile Babu surprised Rajamouli with his work ethic, Priyanka Chopra Jonas brought unexpected global dimensions to the production. While shooting in Africa, local crew members approached the actress for photographs after filming concluded. “I was asking them, ‘So you watch her movies?’ And they said, ‘We are fans of her work because of what she does for UN as a brand ambassador, what she does in Africa,'” Rajamouli recalls.\n\n\tThe revelation deepened his appreciation for the actor. “I thought, wow, this woman is something. She has achieved so much on her own, and my respect for her grew,” he says.\n\n\tRajamouli had long admired Chopra Jonas’ work, dating back over 15 years. “I felt a little loss” when she began working more in the West, he admits. But seeing her success in Los Angeles changed his perspective. “Seeing those huge hoardings of PC [Priyanka Chopra Jonas] in L.A. for ‘Citadel,’ and for the previous one, ‘Quantico’ — that felt really great. Here is our desi girl making it big in the West.”\n\n\tThe character of Mandakini required specific qualities that Rajamouli believes Chopra Jonas uniquely possesses. “She can be a really kick-ass girl, and she has to be really vulnerable. [There are] very few actors who can do both in the same character,” he says. “She did a fantastic job, and I’m so happy that I have her on board.”\n\n\tRecreating the city of Varanasi on a soundstage presented unique challenges. Production designer Mohan Bingi made multiple visits to the sacred city, capturing thousands of photographs and 360-degree camera footage to authentically reproduce the ghats.\n\n\t“It is so chaotic, so many colors. There is no symmetry, but it’s beautiful,” Rajamouli says. “You place a camera, look at each element. One element does not resonate with the other, but you see it as a whole, everything makes sense. That is the beauty of Varanasi.”\n\n\tThe goal was immediate recognition without exposition. “I shouldn’t put a subtitle saying it’s Varanasi. The moment you see it, you should feel it,” he explains. “The majority of credit goes to him [production designer Bingi].” \n\n\tRajamouli reveals that his directing method relies heavily on collaboration with his technical team while maintaining clear boundaries between creative vision and technical execution. “I really depend on them,” he says. “I explain the story in minute detail to all my technicians in terms of emotion. At every shot, we have a discussion of what I want from this shot.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever, he deliberately avoids micromanaging technical decisions. “I won’t give them any instructions. I might say a close-up, but I would not say what lens, what distance, nothing, what lighting. How do you light it? I have absolutely no technical conversation with my technicians,” he explains. “I just depend on them, believe them, that they can deliver what is needed.”\n\n\tDespite the global attention following “RRR’s” Oscar success, Rajamouli maintains a focused philosophy about approaching new projects. “I strongly believe you should leave all the success behind you and start afresh for a new film. I sincerely believe that in my heart and every cell in my being,” he says.\n\n\tHis approach treats each film as if it were his first. “This has to be the best film that I can ever make,” he explains. “Of course, I take all the lessons that I have learned in the previous films — keep it in the back of the mind, not bring it to the fore. Keep all the knowledge in the storage, and leave everything out and start afresh.”\n\n\tThe director, whose “RRR” won the Academy Award for best original song, explains that “Varanasi” represents a creative milestone in how he engages with Indian mythology. “Almost every film of mine, I draw inspiration from [Indian epics] ‘Ramayana’ or ‘Mahabharata,’ some character, some instance, something,” he says. “For the first time, I am directly taking an episode from ‘Ramayana.’ I feel elated. I feel lucky to get the chance to recreate that, what I have been dreaming for years.”\n\n\tThe weight of bringing such material to screen is significant. “There are so many people who were asking me, like, you should do ‘Ramayana’ or ‘Mahabharata’ in the true sense, how people would like to see it,” he says. “I know at some point of time I will be attempting that. To meet that expectation, to meet my own expectation is the biggest challenge of my life.”\n\n\tAs for whether a full “Ramayana” adaptation might follow, Rajamouli reflects on the unpredictability of creative opportunities. “I never expected I would make an episode of ‘Ramayana’ in Varanasi. It happened. I thought I would make it much, much more later,” he says. “Some things are not in our hands. It happens when we least expect it.”\n\t\n\n\t“Varanasi” will open in theaters worldwide on April 7, 2027.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSri Lankan director Lalith Rathnayake’s “Riverstone” claimed the Golden Cyclo, the top prize at the 32nd Vesoul International Film Festival of Asian Cinema, which concluded Feb. 3 following a week-long showcase of Asian cinema in the French town.\n\n\tThe international jury, presided over by Chinese director Wang Bing and including Korean director Shin Su-won, Iranian producer Katayoon Shahabi, and French director, producer and screenwriter Joël Farges, recognized the film for its examination of political crisis in Asia and its impact on ordinary citizens. According to the jury’s citation, the drama demonstrates how “the serious crisis of political power in Asia threatens the survival of ordinary people” while reflecting “the current situation on the continent.” \n\t\n\n\tThe jury praised the performances and noted that Rathnayake “fully expressed the humanistic spirit” of the adapted work, singling out the film’s “sharp criticism of contemporary politics” as a contributing factor to its victory. The film previously won top awards at the Shanghai and Singapore film festivals.\n\n\n\tWang Bing also received the festival’s Honorary Golden Cyclo from the Vesoul Urban Community and City of Vesoul.\n\n\tKyrgyzstan’s “Kurak,” co-directed by Erke Dzhumakmatova and Emil Atageldiev, secured the Grand Prize of the Jury for what the panel described as its “subject importance and universality.” The jury commended the film as “accomplished in every cinematic respect,” highlighting both the performances and direction. Atageldiev died in 2024. “Kurak” won top prizes at Busan last year. \n\t\n\n\tThe Jury Prize went to Taiwanese filmmaker Tsao Shih-han’s “Before the Bright Day,” which also earned the Netpac Jury Prize. The film centers on a boy navigating fears of war and violence while growing up in an abusive household and struggling with school life, set against a middle-class Taiwanese family facing economic hardship. The jury noted the director’s skillful contrast between stillness and movement, with the protagonist “frozen” inside the violent home but “constantly on the move” outside, seemingly attempting to escape a world of conflict.\n\n\tThe Netpac jury, led by Indian festival programmer Raman Chawla, praised the film’s “sophisticated blend of historical scale and domestic drama, navigating the divide between national crisis and personal growth with cinematic precision and heart.”\n\n\tThe international jury also awarded two special mentions: a first special mention to Iranian filmmaker Abbas Nezamdoost’s “Duality” for its original cinematic approach, and a second special mention to Thai director Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit’s Venice prizewinner “Human Resource” for its direction.\n\n\t“Human Resource” went on to collect the Marc Haaz Jury Prize. The unanimous jury decision recognized the film’s exploration of pregnancy and bodily autonomy, noting its “understated narration, nuanced performances, and precise, rigorous visual and sound design.” The panel highlighted the film’s central question about how “an ordinary woman” experiencing pregnancy finds “her body become a social body, exposed to the gaze, judgement and control of others.”\n\n\tThe Critics’ Jury Prize also went to “Kurak,” with the panel citing the filmmakers’ “courage in tackling a painful topical issue with careful direction.” “Riverstone” received a special mention from the same jury for its psychological exploration of justice and conscience, supported by strong lead performance and cinematography.\n\n\tThe Prize of the Friends of Émile Guimet went to “Riverstone,” with the jury praising it as a road trip film featuring a confrontation between an empathetic prisoner and three police officers, representing an “inverted duality between good and evil.” The jury noted the unexpected pacing and cinematography. Indian director Tannishtha Chatterjee‘s “Full Plate” received a special mention from the same jury for its portrayal of women’s lives across different social and religious backgrounds in India, with the panel highlighting the film’s depiction of sisterhood and hope.\n\t\n\n\t“Full Plate” also claimed the Public’s Choice Award for Feature Film. The documentary prize went to Bernard Louargant’s French film “Li Chevalier, Encre et Âme.”\n\n\tIn the youth categories, “Kurak” took the High School Jury Prize, while Palestinian filmmaker Alaa damo’s “Hassan” won the Youth Jury Prize.\n\n\tThe festival’s 33rd edition is scheduled for Feb. 2-9, 2027.\n",

The images capture a shirtless Epstein on a stretcher surrounded by paramedics trying to revive him, to no avail.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The pics also show Epstein's messy jail cell with bed sheets and clothing strewn everywhere -- and the piece of fabric used to kill himself dangling from his bed frame.\n      \n\n          There's also exterior snaps of Epstein's cell with crime scene tape around the door. What's more ... there are photos capturing Epstein's cracked hyoid bone after he hanged himself by his neck.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As you know, Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in the Southern District of New York. Conspiracy theorists have been promoting for years that Epstein was murdered to cover up crimes committed by his rich and powerful friends ... but federal officials categorically deny the rumors.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

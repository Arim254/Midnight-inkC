    "body": "\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” ignited with $88 million in its domestic box office debut. It’s a decent start, albeit a significant decline from the opening weekend of 2022’s sequel “Avatar: The Way of Water” with $134 million. However a larger question looms about the financial fate of the big-budget blockbuster: How will James Cameron’s third trip to Pandora hold over the holiday season?\n\n\tThat’s important because “Avatar” films are known, not for fiery opening weekends, but rather for their unparalleled box office staying power. The original 2009 epic “Avatar” debuted to $77 million domestically and remained in first place for seven consecutive weekends, eventually climbing to $760 million in North America and $2.92 billion worldwide. Not to be outdone, the sequel also managed to hold onto the No. 1 spot for seven weekends and ended up earning $688 million domestically and $2.3 billion globally. \n\t\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” also debuted behind projections at the international box office with $257 million, bringing its global tally to $345 million. That’s one of the biggest worldwide debuts of the year while also ranking dramatically behind the second film’s $435 million global debut.\n\n\n\tBased on initial ticket sales for “Avatar 3,” which landed below expectations of $90 million to $105 million domestically, the otherworldly adventure appears to be experiencing diminishing returns. It’s unclear, however, what exactly diminishing returns will look like for the follow-up to two of the highest-grossing films in history. “Avatar” adventures carry enormous budgets, costing at least $350 million to produce and millions more to market. Cameron once said that “The Way of Water” needed to become one of the top-grossing releases of all time to break even. (It did.) The newest “Avatar” doesn’t necessarily need to surpass the $2 billion mark to be successful, but its safe to assume that “Fire and Ash” needs to become a box office behemoth to justify its massive price tag.\n\t\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” has several factors that’ll work in its favor, including an “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls, the upcoming Christmas stretch (which is the most popular time of year for moviegoing) and, of course, Cameron’s unmatched track record. Cameron is the only filmmaker with three movies to generate more than $2 billion, the other being “Titanic.” Although a daunting 3-hour-plus runtime has never deterred audiences for “Avatar” installments,” the newest film’s three hours and 17 minute length does limit the number of showtimes per day. And while  “Avatar: The Way of Water” was plagued by endless release date delays, it ended up contributing to pent-up demand over 13 years. The third entry is arriving a comparatively short three years after its predecessor.\n\n\t“Openings are not what the ‘Avatar’ movies are about. It’s what they do after they open that made them the No. 2 and three biggest films of all time,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “It will be several weeks before we really know how well the film is doing.” \n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” loomed large over domestic box office charts, but it wasn’t the only new nationwide release. In a surprising finish, Angel Studios animated biblical musical drama “David” emerged ahead of two other newcomers,  Lionsgate’s psychological thriller “The Housemaid” and Paramount’s “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants.” \n\n\t“David,” a kid-friendly take on the story of David and Goliath and follow-up to the TV mini-series “Young David, collected $22 million from 3,118 screens. Those ticket sales mark the best three-day debut for the faith-based Angel Studios, surpassing “Sound of Freedom,” which ignited to $19.6 million and became a sleeper hit with more than $250 million. \n\n\t“Families are searching for values-driven films that honor hope,” said Angel’s head of theatrical Brandon Purdie. “We look forward to a robust theatrical run as this popular animated musical continues to warm hearts and inspire families this Christmas.” \n\n\t“The Housemaid” started strong in third place with $19 million from 3,015 theaters. Initial crowds were 70% female and 75% above the age of 25, according to PostTrak. They gave the film a “B” grade on CinemaScore exit polls, which isn’t unusual for a movie that leaves audiences feeling unsettled as they leave the theater. Lionsgate is hoping the film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, becomes a breakout hit among women in the vein of “A Simple Favor,” “Anyone but You,” or “It Ends With Us” (but without the off-screen drama). Directed by Paul Feig (“Bridesmaids”) and adapted from the best-selling novel by Freida McFadden, the R-rated film follows an ex-con who becomes the live-in maid for an ultra-wealthy family.\n\t\n\n\t“SpongeBob” was No. 4 with $16 million from 3,557 locations. The PG-rated film, based on the hit Nickelodeon television show, cost $64 million to produce. Initial ticket sales are by far the lowest of the two prior “SpongeBob” theatrical adventures. The first, 2004’s “The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, launched with $32 million, while the second, 2015’s “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,” film opened to $55 million. Luckily moviegoers seem to dig “Search for SquarePants,” which earned an “A-” grade on CinemaScore, the highest of the series.\n\n\tMore to come…\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe most influential content creators were celebrated on Thursday night for their impact and contributions to popular internet culture at the inaugural TikTok Awards, held at the Hollywood Palladium and live-streamed on the social media app as well as on Tubi.\n\n\t​Just hours before the start of the event, news broke that TikTok and ByteDance signed agreements with three managing investors – Oracle, Silverlake and MGX– to form a new TikTok U.S. joint venture. The agreement, which is set to close Jan. 22, 2026, would ensure that the popular social media platform will continue operating in the United States. ​\n\t\n\n\tWhile this latest development is one step closer to preventing the app from being banned in the U.S., the uncertainty about how the app will change with its new investors was unsettling for many content creators at the awards ceremony.\n\n\n\tOn the red carpet, attendees shared their concerns about the future of the app particularly with Oracle, a software company run by billionaire and Donald Trump’s close ally Larry Ellison, as one of the new American investors in the deal.​\n\n\t“K-pop Demon Hunters” star Rei Ami told Variety, “I would be afraid of the censorship. I hope TikTok remains firm in its pledge not to censor their creators. Censorship goes against what America’s founding principles are. Censorship remaining out of users’ creative ability is what I hope and want for TikTok’s future.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tParis Hilton and Rei Ami at TikTok Awards 2025 at Hollywood Palladium on December 18, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (Christopher Polk/Billboard)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBillboard via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\t​TikTok star Merrick Hanna, who rose to internet stardom for his signature robotic dance moves, mentioned how he hopes “they don’t change the app too much.” He added, “I’m worried that the owners are going to sway what kind of content is going to get served to people on their For You Page. I hope that doesn’t happen.”​\n\t\n\n\t“Overcompensating” actress and content creator Yasmine Sahid said she’s worried about TikTok’s algorithm being impacted. “I’m a little bit nervous because I want the algorithm to stay true and freedom of speech. I want people to create without worrying about being punished or banned. So we’ll see.”​\n\n\tBeauty TikToker Golloria George, who built a massive platform on promoting makeup inclusivity, shared her concerns about whether TikTok stays true to its core. “I hope it stays authentic and doesn’t censor creators for having a voice. The beauty of the platform is that people can get on TikTok and say what they want to say. That is most important.”​\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGolloria George at the TikTok Awards 2025 held at Hollywood Palladium on December 18, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (River Callaway/Variety)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDespite their concerns, the shared sentiment of relief was present among the content creators and influencers, knowing that the pending deal would prevent TikTok from being banned in the U.S.​\n\n\t“I’m excited, but also mentally drained because the algorithm is so confusing right now,” TikTok star Markell Washington said. “From a creator’s perspective, the algorithm is making me feel like I have to do backflips and jump off a building to get views. Hopefully, after it’s sold, it can get back to normal with the original algorithm because it’s taking the fun out of creating. I’m creating content and trying to evolve with the algorithm, but it’s not getting rewarded at the same time.​”\n\n\tWith how much TikTok has changed the lives of business owners, Canadian influencer and businessman Josh Richards said he was happy to hear that the platform found buyers.​\n\n\t“TikTok has given so many people a way to create an income or business,” he said. “What it’s been able to do in the small business world is incredible. It’s been able to help kids to feed that hunger inside of them as a creative outlet. They have such easy access to that now.”\n\n\tHosted by La La Anthony, the TikTok Awards crowned New Orleans-based Keith Lee with the Creator of the Year Award. With 17.3 million TikTok followers, Lee’s videos spotlight small food businesses and uses his platform to drive massive customer demand that have turned restaurants into overnight successes.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKeith Lee wins the Creator of the Year Award at the TikTok Awards 2025 held at Hollywood Palladium on December 18, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Christopher Polk/Billboard)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBillboard via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“This means more to me than I can explain,” Lee said while accepting his award. “I was just a kid sitting in a PAW Patrol chair that started recording because I was a professional fighter who was nervous in front of cameras and couldn’t talk. I couldn’t be rooms with people. I was a nervous wreck who always doubted myself. TikTok provided me a platform to talk about that and highlight small businesses around the country.”\n\n\tHe continued, “It’s so hard for me to do something for myself because I always put other people in front of me. But this is for me.”\n\n\tAfter his speech, Anthony announced that TikTok pledged $50,000 to Feeding America to help fight against food insecurity.\n\n\tThroughout the night, the award show featured special surprises, including a performance from “Dancing With the Stars” duo Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa, TikTok shop giveaways and a Labubu cannon that launched the plush toys into the audience.\n\n\tCiara also took center stage to perform as headliner. The music superstar performed a combination of her classics and newer songs, including “My Goodies,” “Oh,” “Like a Boy,” “Level Up,” “1, 2 Step,” among others.\n\n\tAcross 14 categories, fans were able to cast their votes for their favorite creators in the TikTok app’s awards hub from Nov. 18 to Dec. 2. Other winners from the night were Bretman Rock (Video of the Year), Jeremiah Brown (Rising Star of the Year), Alex Warren (Breakthrough Artist of the Year), Tineke Younger (Storyteller of the Year), Paris Hilton (Muse of the Year), Zach and Pat Valentine (TikTok For Good Award), Dayane Chrissel (My Show Is On), Mariah Rose (MVP of the Year), Katie Fang (Okay Slay), Law By Mike (I Was Today Years Old), KlothesMinded (Immediately Added To Cart), Recider (CapCut Creator of the Year), Elizabeth Esparza (TikTok Live Creator of the Year).\n",

    "body": "\n\tAriana Grande belted out her own rendition of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” during her “Saturday Night Live” monologue about the difficulties of of buying presents for acquaintances and friends of friends, titled “What Do I Get for Christmas for This Dude?”\n\n\tSaturday marked the Christmas episode of this “Saturday Night Live” Season 51, with Grande as host and Cher as her musical guest. It also was cast member Bowen Yang’s final episode, as news broke Friday that he would be exiting the show. Yang, who appeared with Grande in “Wicked” and this year’s “Wicked: For Good,” joined her on stage for her spoof of Carey’s song.\n\t\n\n\t“December is my favorite time of year in New York,” Grande began. “I love the decorations, the snow on the ground. I love shopping for all my loved ones. But I have to admit, I get a little stressed shopping for certain other people in my life.”\n\n\n\tThe “Saturday Night Live” audience cheered when they realized Grande was doing her own take on “All I Want for Christmas Is You”\n\n\n\t“I don’t know what to get for Christmas for my cousin’s boyfriend Steve,” she sang to Carey’s tune. “I don’t know a thing about him, only see him on Christmas Eve.”\n\n\tShe also poked fun at her seemingly non-stop press tour for “Wicked: For Good,” joking that her director Jon M. Chu wouldn’t give her any bathroom breaks.\n\n\t“Haven’t shopped a lot for Christmas, ‘cuz my schedule’s never free,” she sang. “Had so much press for ‘Wicked,’ Jon Chu will not let me pee.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen Yang joined her on stage, Grande teased that he had very few lines in “Wicked”: “Can I just say how much I loved your line in ‘Wicked’?”\n\n\t“Thank you,” he said, to which Grande replied “you’re welcome!”\n\n\t“No,” Yang clarified. “That was my line.”\n\n\tSaturday’s episode marked Grande’s third time hosting “SNL,” one of which she doubled as the musical guest. She’s also performed solely as the musical guest twice.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” stars Colin Jost and Michael Che continued their yearly Christmas tradition of writing horribly offensive jokes for the other person to tell on Weekend Update. Except this year, Che lied to Jost that they weren’t doing their annual swap but still prepared his own — so Jost was the only one reading out jokes, much to Che and the audience’s delight.\n\n\tChe did not hold back for Jost once again, one year after he made his co-host tell some harsh jokes about Jost’s wife Scarlett Johansson, who was backstage watching.\n\t\n\n\t“Critics say a new series of coins from the U.S. Mint celebrating great moments in the country’s history ignore civil rights. But what about the coin that celebrates where Black people actually come from — ships,” Jost began reading reluctantly as Che laughed at his joke.\n\n\n\tJost continued: “The archdiocese of New York will set up a fund for victims of church sexual abuse. Yet I get nothing for keeping my mouth shut and taking it like a champ?” The audience gasped and laughed as Jost read his final prepared joke, while Che said Jost should’ve written some for him.\n\n\t“New research shows that millions of women leave the work force due to menopause. Which means there’s only a couple years left on my gravy train,” a photo of Johansson flashed on the screen as Jost grimaced. “My girl already be like, ‘Colin, I’m warm. Colin, I’m sweating.’ Bitch, you having a hot flash.”\n\n\t“But don’t worry about me, I got a backup. They don’t call Wednesday hump day for nothing,” Jost finished, as a photo of Jenna Ortega’s Netflix character Wednesday Addams popped on screen.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe filmmakers behind Yash‘s highly anticipated “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” have revealed the first look at Kiara Advani‘s character Nadia, offering a glimpse into what promises to be a transformative role for the actor.\n\n\tThe poster presents Advani set against a circus backdrop, balancing glamorous aesthetics with underlying emotional depth that suggests grief and melancholy beneath the surface spectacle. The character appears poised to showcase a different dimension of Advani’s range as she enters the distinctive cinematic world.\n\t\n\n\tAdvani has established herself as one of Hindi cinema’s most bankable stars following breakthrough performances in the romantic drama “Kabir Singh” and the biographical war film “Shershaah.” Her recent slate includes “Game Changer” and “War 2.”\n\n\n\tYash, the Kannada-language film industry actor who rose to pan-Indian stardom with the “K.G.F” franchise, has become one of the most sought-after stars in Indian cinema. Known for his portrayal of Rocky Bhai in “K.G.F: Chapter 1” (2018) and “K.G.F: Chapter 2” (2022) Yash’s transformation into a larger-than-life action hero propelled the films to unprecedented box-office success, breaking language barriers. The second instalment in the franchise is the fifth highest Indian grosser of all time. While the “K.G.F” series cemented his star power, Yash’s early career in Kannada-language films showcased his versatility, with notable performances in projects such as “Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari” (2014) and “Googly” (2013).\n\n\t“Toxic” is helmed by festival circuit darling Geetu Mohandas (“Moothon”). The ambitious project represents a watershed moment for Kannada cinema, which has been steadily gaining international traction following the “K.G.F” phenomenon. Written by Yash and Mohandas, “Toxic” is breaking new ground as the first major Indian film conceptualized, written and shot simultaneously in both the Kannada and English languages – with dubbed versions planned for Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and additional languages.\n\t\n\n\t“Some performances don’t just belong to a film they redefine an artist,” said Mohandas. “What Kiara created on screen in this film is nothing short of transformative. From our very first conversation, she placed an unwavering trust in a character that demanded everything from her – be it emotionally, mentally, and artistically. She didn’t just play the role, she lived it. As a director, I am deeply proud of her and for the performance she has delivered, and for the faith and heart she brought into our shared journey.”\n\n\tThe reveal arrives as Yash prepares for his first screen appearance since “K.G.F: Chapter 2” redefined box office benchmarks four years ago. The announcement coincides with the seventh anniversary of the original “K.G.F,” which launched the phenomenon that would culminate in the sequel’s historic performance.\n\n\tThe production has assembled a notable technical crew including Indian National Film Award-winning cinematographer Rajeev Ravi, composer Ravi Basrur, editor Ujwal Kulkarni and production designer T.P. Abid. Action sequences have been choreographed by Hollywood’s J.J. Perry, known for his work on “John Wick,” alongside Indian National Film Award-winning duo Anbariv.\n\n\tProduced by Venkat K. Narayana and Yash through KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations, “Toxic – A Fairytale for Grown-Ups” is scheduled for theatrical release March 19, 2026, capitalizing on the extended holiday weekend that encompasses Eid, Ugadi and Gudi Padwa celebrations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

It’s to try to really embrace it,” he said in the interview. “Because to fight it would be the wrong thing to do, because then you’re forgetting where everything started.”\n\n\n\tRocky spoke with Variety about the early “Don’t Be Dumb” single “Highjack,” which features singer-songwriter Jessica Pratt.\n\n\t“I like to do things that don’t make sense,” he said in the interview. “Nobody would have thought to put [folk musician] Jessica Pratt on that, but I think her voice is so angelic. She literally let me write the whole thing, and she just sang it beautifully. She makes me want to be like a secret songwriter; I should probably get into writing folk songs. She’s sick.”\n\n\tThe announcement was made during the Dec. 20 episode of “Saturday Night Live,” which was hosted by Ariana Grande with musical guest Cher. The episode was also the final show for Bowen Yang, who confirmed his departure earlier that day.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBowen Yang said goodbye to “Saturday Night Live” with the final sketch of the night, which was also his last.\n\n\tNews broke on Friday that Saturday’s episode would be Yang’s final appearance as part of the “SNL” cast after being on the show for eight seasons. He first joined “Saturday Night Live” as a writer in 2018 in Season 44 and later was added to the cast as a featured player in Season 45. He was upped to be a main cast member in Season 47. \n\t\n\n\tIn the sketch, Yang played a flight attendant with a broken eggnog machine at the Delta One lounge who was leaving for his final shift.\n\n\n\t“This is my last shift. It’s sad. I’m gonna miss everything about this place. The way it smells. The celebrities who come through. Just last week, Josh O’Connor came through,” Yang said, referring to last week’s “SNL” host.\n\n\tTonight’s host Ariana Grande, who co-starred with Yang in the “Wicked” movies, also appeared and said goodbye to her friend. Playing a family member of Yang’s character, Grande said, “I wish you were home but I’m so proud of you and all the eggnog you’ve made over the years. Some of it was great, some of it was rotten.”\n\n\t“And a lot of it got cut,” Yang added. “But you know, I also think eggnog’s kinda like me. It’s not for everyone, but the people who like it are my kinda people.” The two sang a song together and were joined by musical guest Cher (who played the eggnog maker’s boss) on stage, and Yang teared up saying goodbye.\n\n\t“Oh, Rhonda, I should have come home earlier,” he said while choking up. “I just feel so lucky that I ever got to work here. And I just wanted to enjoy it for a little bit longer. Especially the people. I’ve loved every single person who works here. Because they’ve done so much for me, especially my boss.”\n\t\n\n\tDuring the final goodnights to close out the show, Grande gave a special shoutout to Yang: “And Bowen yang, we love you so much! Goodnight!”\n\n\tYang’s mid-season departure comes after several cast members left before Season 51 began, including Ego Nwodim, Heidi Gardner, Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, Emil Wakim and John Higgins. Leaving in the middle of a season is rare but not unheard of — Cecily Strong, Molly Shannon and Dana Carvey did it in the past.\n\n\tOutside of “Saturday Night Live,” Yang hosts the pop culture podcast “Las Culturistas” with fellow comedian Matt Rogers. For the first time, the two hosted their yearly Las Culturistas Awards as a full awards show broadcast on Bravo and Peacock. Yang also reprised his “Wicked” role as Pfannee in this fall’s hit “Wicked: For Good” musical. He and Rogers are also writing and starring in an upcoming comedy for Searchlight Pictures.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKate Winslet is opening up about the challenges she faced while making her directorial debut, “Goodbye June.”\n\n\tWritten by her son, Joe Anders, the actress revealed that she only planned to star and produce the film. When she was also offered the opportunity to direct the feature, Winslet said that her initial thought was that she “cannot do three jobs.”\n\n\t“I know I’m good at multitasking, but this is too many things,” Winslet told Digi Spy. “I desperately tried to recast myself [and] had a really good list of a handful of people who would have been absolutely brilliant in that role.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “But at that point… well, first of all, Netflix was like, ‘Uh-uh,’ and secondly, I’d cast all these incredible actors. How could I not go and play with them? Because that’s what we do. We play, we pretend, and it’s an amazing thing.”\n\n\n\tNow playing in select theaters, “Goodbye June” follows four adult siblings and their father as they navigate their family dynamic as their sick mother’s health takes a turn for the worse. Winslet stars as Julia, one of June’s children, with Helen Mirren playing June, the matriarch of the family.\n\n\t“I know it sounds a bit sickly, but we had to really become a family in order to make it feel as real as possible and as relatable as possible,” Winslet added. “You can’t just show up and do the job and go home again; it becomes something else. We were lucky on this film that that really happened.”\n\n\tIn addition to Winslet and Mirren, “Goodbye June” stars Toni Collette, Johnny Flynn, Andrea Riseborough and Timothy Spall. Additional cast members include Stephen Merchant, Fisayo Akinade, Jeremy Swift and Raza Jaffrey.\n\t\n\n\tAfter its theatrical run, the film will arrive on Netflix on Dec. 24.\n",

    "body": "\n\tScience Saru will return with a third season of “Dan Da Dan” airing in 2027, the studio revealed during Jump Festa 2026 on Dec. 21, revealing a new key visual for the supernatural comedy series.\n\n\tThe anime’s debut season aired from October to December 2024, and its second season from July to September 2025. The series adapts Yukinobu Tatsu’s manga, which has sold over 12 million copies and continues serialization every Tuesday on Shueisha’s manga magazine app Shonen Jump+.\n\t\n\n\t“Dan Da Dan” centers on Momo (voiced by Shion Wakayama), a high school girl from a family of spiritual mediums, and her classmate Okarun (voiced by Natsuki Hanae), an occult enthusiast. After Momo saves Okarun from bullies, an argument erupts between the ghost-believing Momo and the alien-believing Okarun. To settle their debate, Momo visits an abandoned hospital UFO hotspot while Okarun explores a haunted tunnel, where both encounter unexpected creatures. Momo awakens hidden spiritual powers while Okarun gains curse abilities, launching them into paranormal battles and a potential romance.\n\n\n\tMainichi Broadcasting System (MBS) co-produces the series. The Osaka-based broadcaster has been involved in anime production for over 50 years, including franchises such as “Attack on Titan,” “Full Metal Alchemist,” “Jujutsu Kaisen” and the influential film “Akira.”\n\n\tScience Saru has produced television, film and streaming projects including “Lu Over the Wall,” “Devilman crybaby,” “Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!,” “Inu-Oh” and “The Colors Within.” The studio’s upcoming releases include TV anime series “The Ghost in the Shell” and “Jaadugar: A Witch in Mongolia,” both planned for broadcast in 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring the Dec. 20 episode of “Saturday Night Live,” James Austin Johnson’s President Trump used his holiday address to parody his stranger-than-fiction administration.\n\n\tTaking aim at Trump’s primetime address this week, as well as the release of more Epstein files and the president’s announcement that he’s launching “Patriot Games” for elite high school athletes, Johnson went to town in the episode’s cold open.\n\n\n\t“I almost forgot: I’m getting my own Hunger Games,” Johnson-as-Trump said. “That’s right, the White House will be hosting the Patriot Games for high school athletes, because I thought, ‘What’s the best way to distract from the Epstein files?’ I know, invite a bunch of teenagers to my house!”\n\t\n\n\tTrump also disputed the nation’s economic unease, saying, “The economy is fine, all right? The economy’s fine. It’s getting closer to fine. Indigo Girls. They were one of my favorite lesbian folk rock duos. I believe that was Melissa Etheridge and, I want to say, Elton John.”\n\n\tTrump also spoke about adding his name to the Kennedy Center, saying, “We are renaming the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which will now be called the Trump Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. I’m actually going to be renaming a number of our other monuments as well … People are saying, ‘Why are you putting your name on so many buildings?’ And I say it’s because we had to take it off of so many files, Epstein redacted. We had so many Trumps in there!”\n\n\tWatch the cold open sketch below.\n\n",

We had so many Trumps in there!”\n      \n    \n          This likely references the suspicion that several files -- at least 16 files, according to AP -- have gone MIA from the Justice Department’s Epstein Files drop from Friday. This reportedly includes a snapshot of Trump and images that show a painting depicting nude women.\n      \n    \n          Internet sleuths caught on to the allegedly vanished pic of Trump earlier Saturday, and Democrats on the House Oversight Committee publicly questioned Attorney General Pam Bondi about it.

    "body": "\n\tLondoners will soon get to shrink down to toy size in Andy’s room from “Toy Story” in a major immersive Pixar experience heading to the British capital in the new year.\n\n\tMundo Pixar Experience, a multi-sensory exhibition featuring the animation studio’s most celebrated films, is set to open in Wembley Park on Feb. 13, 2006.\n\n\tFollowing its success in Brazil, Mexico, Belgium and Spain, where it welcomed over 3.2 million visitors and received widespread acclaim, Mundo Pixar Experience now arrives in the U.K. for the very first time. It also arrives ahead of the release of new Pixar titles next year, “Hopper” in March and “Toy Story 5” in June.\n\t\n\n\tSet in a purpose-built venue in Wembley Park, the exhibition will span more than 3,500 square metres, and will feature 14 Pixar universes including over 25 sculptures. Guests will be able to explore recreated environments from “Toy Story”, “Monsters, Inc.”, “Cars”, “Finding Nemo”, “Inside Out”, “Coco”, “Up” and others. According to the organizers, each space “combines detailed set design, ambient music, and specially crafted scents to immerse visitors in Pixar’s most beloved stories.”\n\n\n\tPresented by Golden Peak Live Entertainment, in collaboration with Proactiv Entertainment, RG Live, Senbla and Luna, the London edition will include a brand-new room created exclusively for this stop on the world tour. Alongside Andy’s room, the attractions will include the Scare Floor from “Monsters, Inc.” and Riley’s emotional headquarters from “Inside Out 2.”\n\n\tBeyond the immersive sets, guests can take part in a special Pixar Ball Treasure Hunt, searching for the famous yellow ball with a red star hidden throughout the exhibition — a nod to the Easter egg that appears in many Pixar films.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Momsen sang high praises of Jim Carrey after reuniting for the first time in 25 years at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony on Saturday.\n\n\tUpon reuniting with her “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” co-star, the musician told People how watching Carrey’s work ethic as a child actor inspired her at a young age. \n\n\t“I just love that he was very protective of me,” she said. “He was always very kind. And just the entire experience of filming ‘Grinch’ and getting to know him so well, even in all the makeup, was just wonderful.”\n\t\n\n\tShe continued, “As a young person watching an artist at work and taking their craft so seriously, that left a really powerful, lasting impact on me as an adult now. And I’m excited to be able to tell him that as a grownup.”\n\n\tWhile posing together on the red carpet, Carrey told reporters, “We haven’t seen each other since ‘The Grinch.’”\n\n\tMomsen followed up with “Yeah, it’s been 25 years. This is insane.”\n\n\tMomsen was five years old when she played the role of Cindy-Lou Who. She acted alongside Carrey, who portrayed the titular, grumpy Dr. Seuss character who hated Christmas.\n\n\tBeyond “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” Momsen’s most prominent acting role was playing  Jenny Humphry in “Gossip Girl.” Her other acting credits also include “Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams,” “Underdog” and “Paranoid Park.”\n\n\tIn 2010, the actress stepped away from acting to focus on her music career as the lead singer of the rock band, “Pretty Reckless.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tHollywood franchise entry “Predator: Badlands” opened atop the Korean box office with $1.1 million from 160,000 admissions across 953 screens, capturing 25.4% of market share. The latest installment in the sci-fi action saga bowed strongly midweek, pushing its total to $1.5 million, according to KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council.\n\n\tSouth Korean road-trip comedy “The First Ride” slipped to second place with $800,000 for a $3.6 million cumulative. Directed by Nam Dae-joong (“The Great Battle”), the film follows a group of childhood friends whose long-awaited trip to Thailand quickly spirals into chaotic mishaps. The ensemble cast includes Kang Ha-neul, Cha Eun-woo, Kim Young-kwang, Kang Young-suk and Han Seon-hwa.\n\t\n\n\tJapanese anime “Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc” ranked third with $825,000, bringing its total to $21.6 million. The film adapts the “Reze” arc of Tatsuki Fujimoto’s hit manga. Directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara with a screenplay by Hiroshi Seko, the movie follows Denji as his encounter with café worker Reze leads to a clash between intimate connection and bloody chaos. Voice cast includes Reina Ueda, Fairouz Ai, Tomori Kusunoki, and Maaya Uchida. Sony/Crunchyroll are handling distribution in the market.\n\n\n\tAnother Japanese import, “The Exit 8,” took $313,000 for a $2.6 million cume. Directed by Kawamura Genki, the film stars Ninomiya Kazunari as a man trapped in a seemingly endless subway corridor where he must detect minute anomalies to escape.\n\n\tNew entry “Bugonia” opened in fifth with $154,000 from 528 screens.\n\t\n\n\tTim Burton-produced stop-motion classic “Coraline” continued its reissue run in sixth with $129,000 (cume $2.1 million). \n\n\t“Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle” took seventh with $125,000 (cume $41.5 million).\n\n\tSouth Korean animated feature “Toritori and the Secret of the Baby Dino” opened in eighth with $116,000 from 240 screens. Universal’s “Wicked” ranked ninth with $83,000 (cume $15.3 million), and Pingyao winner “The World of Love” rounded out the top ten with $88,000 (cume $594,000).\n\n\tThe top 10 films collectively grossed $3.8 million for the weekend, down sharply from the previous frame’s $4.5 million, continuing South Korea’s box office doldrums. \n",

    "body": "\n\tDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Sunday afternoon to celebrate the exit of the BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the CEO of News, Deborah Turness. The shocking step-downs came days after BBC’s documentary program “Panorama” was accused of doctoring Trump’s Jan. 6 speech to make it look like he incited the Capitol riots.\n\n\t“The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th,” Trump wrote. “Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”\n\t\n\n\tAs noted by Trump, The Telegraph put the network in hot water after publishing the details of a 19-page dossier on BBC bias by a former independent external advisor to the BBC’s standards committee. The report claimed that Panorama spliced together footage that made Trump “‘say’ things [he] never actually said.” One of the Panorama sound bites shows Trump declaring he would march with his supporters to the Capitol and “fight like hell,” when he actually told them to “peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”\n\n\tIn an exit note to BBC staff, Davie wrote, “Like all public organizations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable. While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as Director-General I have to take ultimate responsibility.”\n\t\n\n\tTurness, in her own statement, said she had “taken the difficult decision that it will no longer be my role to lead you in the collective vision that we all have: to pursue the truth with no agenda.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 1, Episode 3 of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tWhen Chris Chalk first appeared in Episode 2 of HBO’s “It: Welcome to Derry,” devoted horror fans likely recognized that his character, Dick Hallorann, shares a name with the Overlook Hotel’s telekinetic chef from “The Shining.” Episode 3 confirms that this is no mere nod to another Stephen King classic, when the young Black soldier showcases his unique powers in a thrilling and terrifying sequence. Chalk’s Hallorann is a far cry from Scatman Crothers’ ill-fated incarnation of the character in Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film, though. “Everything I do is going to have some dignity,” Chalk tells Variety, and he brings that dignity to Hallorann with a strong purpose and intensity throughout the show.\n\t\n\n\tDick Hallorann was first introduced in 1977 as a magical character who shares Danny Torrance’s eponymous psychic abilities in Stephen King’s third novel, “The Shining.” He plays a prominent role in the book and reappears in its 2013 sequel, “Doctor Sleep.” In between the two, he is briefly featured in the 1986 “It” novel, albeit in a short flashback. Even Chalk admits, “I didn’t remember any of that stuff in the book. I mean, the book has 3000 stories. It’s OK to forget some of it.”\n\n\n\tHowever, those intermittent flashbacks in “It” provide much of the source material for “Welcome to Derry,” so Hallorann’s canonical presence in the town is naturally expanded upon in the prequel series. Accordingly, Chalk restudied the source material and, with guidance from writer, director and executive producer Andy Muschietti, the ephemeral character came into full view.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tChalk’s Hallorann departs from past iterations of the character, though. Contemporary criticisms of “The Shining” will often point to Hallorann as a stereotypical, token Black character. “He’s literally a Magical Negro,” says Chalk. “But the trouble with a Magical Negro is that they’re the only motherfuckin’ Black person in the movie.” That’s certainly the case in “The Shining,” where Crothers’ Hallorann is among an otherwise all-white cast.\n\n\t“Welcome to Derry,” however, steers clear of this outdated trope. Alongside Chalk as Hallorann, Jovan Adepo plays Leroy Hanlon, a Black Army Major with a wife and son, who have their own arcs and are respectively played by Taylour Paige and Blake Cameron James. There’s also Hank (Stephen Rider) and Veronica Grogan (Amanda Christine), a single Black father and his daughter, who work at the town’s movie theater and become scapegoats in the disappearance of some of the town’s kids. Other Black soldiers populate the Army base and town as well as Native American and Latino characters.\n\n\t“To already have this huge selection of Black humans in the narrative, not just as props, but as essential to the narrative, I know we’re going to avoid these tropes, because the trope doesn’t exist if everybody there serves a purpose,” Chalk says, “I do happen to be a magical Black man, but in a world full of Black people, it doesn’t come off as gross.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Welcome to Derry” wears its racial commentary on its sleeve. Set in 1964, it expands upon the setting’s history of racial violence and segregation, which are peripherally mentioned in the 2017 and 2019 “It” films, but unavoidable in the novel. Even Hallorann’s blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearance in the book describes his role as the founder of “The Black Spot,” a nightclub for Black soldiers stationed in Derry, which was burned down by a Klu Klux Klan-like group.\n\n\tWhen we first meet Hallorann in the show, he and some other Black troops are kicked out of a local bar at the police chief’s insistence. They then return to the Army base, where they are similarly targeted until Hallorann’s name evokes some authority, the first sign that there is something special about him.\n\n\tIt’s soon revealed that the Army base is digging for some ancient weapon or power beneath Derry and that Hallorann’s abilities can help them pinpoint its location. Those abilities come into full effect in Episode 3, when Hallorann is tasked with guiding a helicopter over Derry in pursuit of the targeted spot. Using his abilities from the back of the chopper, Hallorann enters a trance, becoming increasingly distressed until his reality is fractured and the sequence cuts between the helicopter in the sky and a dark realm that Hallorann navigates within his own psyche.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“He’s just in the back of the plane, but he’s half in and half out of that reality, because he’s digging into another one,” Chalk says. To play that version of Hallorann, who is physically there but psychologically absent, Chalk focused on making his breathing appear intentional and trembles involuntary. Rather than study previous performances of characters “shining,” he turned to examples of real-world people pushing psychic barriers through herbalism and witchcraft across various cultures. “I won’t watch another movie because what’s the point? It’s just another person guessing,” Chalk says. He prefers to base his performance off of real people’s attempts at mysticism.\n\n\tMeanwhile, playing Hallorann in his psychic realm is a calmer experience. “He thinks he controls it,” Chalk says. “There’s a calm, because he knows it’s in the psychic realm and nothing can hurt him.” Everything in the psychic realm is constructed of Hallorann’s own memories, and he knows how to navigate it. As those memories get hijacked by something dark and unknown, however, he adds, “the world starts caving in on him and collapsing on him.”\n\n\tAudiences witness this when Hallorann sees the tower of Pennywise’s floating victims in his psyche. Visions of war and violence from his childhood flash before he snaps back to reality, where he has one foot out of the helicopter’s back door, saved only when Hanlon pulls him back.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrooke Palmer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile the actors were safely on the ground in a soundstage throughout the sequence, Chalk recalls, “Both Jovan and I got hurt. It was early on in the shoot, and when he saves me from opening the back, he popped my rib. That dude is strong. I studied Jiu Jitsu, so I was like, ‘It shouldn’t be that bad.’ But then I hit him against the wall and I threw his back out. So the struggle you see is actually two actors who got a little carried away and are really hurt in the scene.”\n\n\tLuckily, the two actors healed, and the resulting scene is a thrilling mix of real-world action and paranormal mystery. By the end of the episode, Hallorann is having dinner at Hanlon’s house. After the meal, the two soldiers talk about what happened in the sky. Hallorann explains his powers to the best of his abilities. He also says that when entering Hanlon’s mind, he’s unable to locate any fear— a condition linked to amygdala damage Hanlon endured during the war. Given what we know about Pennywise and his appetite for fear, it seems that Hallorann and Hanlon may prove the first lines of defense against the town’s terrifying clown curse.\n\t\n\n\tFor real world bravery, though, Chalk commends Andy Muschietti alongside showrunners Jason Fuchs and Brad Caleb Kane for making a bold show. “I think it has some degree of courage,” he says, “They could have very well told one of the other stories from ‘It’ and it would be honorable, but I love that Andy and Jason and Brad said, ‘No, we’re going to do this version of racism that’s still very clear, and it’s still very visceral, but we’re going to do it in genre. We’re going to do it our way and add that other layer of horror.’ In my opinion, if we can ground an honest reality and tell this honest story, and then you add terror on top, people are going to respond.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBefore there was the self-proclaimed Midwest Princess, there was the queen of Queens in New York. They came together in a glittery cosmic convergence Saturday night at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony as Chappell Roan formally inducted Cyndi Lauper, giving an earnest speech that touched on her own adoration for the honoree as a teenager and ongoing respect for her as one of pop’s most longstanding allies to the LGBTQ community.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInductee Cyndi Lauper and Chappell Roan speak onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWireImage\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Cyndi embodies every quality of an artist that I admire,” Roan said from the stage of L.A.’s Peacock Theatre. “She’s a born performer and a revolutionary songwriter, a forever fashion icon, and a fierce advocate and ally. And from the very beginning, she owned every ounce of who she was — the manic, panicked hair, all of those rad Fingerless gloves and those unbelievably layered, dynamic and one-of-a-kind vocals… Can I hear a little commotion for the vocals?”\n\t\n\n\tRoan looked back to Lauper’s impact at the very start of her nascent career: “One of Cyndi’s most inspiring songs to me personally is ‘True Colors.’ When I was 14 years old, I performed ‘True Colors’ at a talent show in my hometown in Missouri. That was my first time ever winning a competition for singing, and that has been so important to me ever since. ‘True Colors’ has gone on to be an anthem synonymous with love and acceptance in the LGBTQ+ community and beyond — a message that still stands the test of time.”\n\t\n\n\n\tLauper was as truly colorful as ever in that particular regard when she sang “True Colors” as part of a multi-artist performance segment in her honor, pausing the song as a vertical rainbow/pride flag unfurled from the top of the stage behind her, in a striking and pointed camera angle.\n\n\tIn her acceptance speech, Lauper thanked “my badass female band I always dreamed of having” — which, for this occasion, included guest drummer Gina Schock of the Go-Go’s — and then positioned herself as part of a middle generation in the history of women in rock.\n\n\t“So now to make a long story short…” she quipped. “Oops, too late for that. But I just want to say that I know that I stand on the shoulders of the women in the industry that came before me, and my shoulders are broad enough to have the women that come after me stand on mine. And the other thing that I thought was really important, which is why I really came here tonight, is to tell you that the little kid in me still believes that rock ‘n’ roll can save the world.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan and Cyndi Lauper arrive at the GBK Brand Bar & Meals On Me Backstage Lounge at the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for GBK Brand Bar L\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRoan began her speech by saying: “I think we can all agree the best art comes from the most authentic people. When artists stay true to themselves, even when some people say they’re too much, too loud, too eccentric, or all of the above, that honesty becomes their greatest strength.” \n\n\tIn an awkward but charming moment, Roan came within an inch of dropping an F-bomb on Disney+ as she realized she was losing her place. “I f…” She stopped herself, explaining, “I messed up so bad by refusing to get contacts. Holy cow.”\n\n\tQuickly regaining her composure amid audience chuckles that will not be heard when an edited version airs on ABC New Year’s Day, Roan continued: \n\n\t“It’s that courage that not only creates incredible art, it gives everyone who experiences it the permission to be themselves. It opens their hearts, it changes their mind, and that is its power. Tonight, we honor a woman who redefined what a pop star could look like, sound like, sing like and be. A music legend whose authenticity has inspired us for the last four decades with her four-octave range, the amazingly fabulous Cyndi Lauper.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 08, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter extolling her heroine’s vocal prowess, Roan noted that “before the whole world knew that voice, Cyndi spent years singing in cover bands and working random jobs trying to find her way. And it wasn’t until her band Blue Angel that people in the business started to notice her. The band eventually broke up, but Cyndi finally got her much-deserved, well-earned, overdue break in 1983 when she released her debut solo album, ‘She’s So Unusual’,” which she said “marked a cultural shift and earned Cyndi the Grammy for best new artist… ‘Girls Just Want to Have Fun’ was more than a hit. The song became a global feminist anthem, and the video a touchstone for her unmistakable style. ‘Time After Time’ is arguably one of the greatest love ballads to ever exist, and the naughty ‘She Bop’ and her iconic rendition of ‘All Through the Night’ further cemented Cyndi’s status as a global superstar.” \n\n\tContinued Roan, “Over the time of her 12 album releases and more, Cyndi spread her magical musical wings that have her venturing outside of pop and into blues, country, jazz and even Broadway, for which she won a Tony. Some of her incredible accomplishments also happen outside of the studio. They happen when she advocates for gay rights before the U.S. Senate. They happen through her non-profit, True Colors United, fighting to the end — fighting to end homelessness among LGBTQ+ youth. And they happen when she paves the way for artists like me to freely express myself. Cyndi Lauper has shown us that you can be bold, quirky, loud, glamorous and have any hair color you want. She’s empowered generations, opening our hearts, our minds, and broadcasting the beautiful message that we have the power to be who we authentically are.”\n\n\tLauper started her own speech on a more irreverent note: “See what happens when you let the riff-raff in?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCyndi Lauper at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 08, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAmong those Lauper thanked were “my mom, who would’ve liked to be here because she wouldn’t have had to worry if I was gonna win or not,” and “all the record executives and producers that I worked with, and probably drove crazy — just ask them, some of them are sitting there right now — who had faith in me and created it with me.” Her kudos extended to “every band, including the cover band,” and her road crew and “the people that helped me string my dulcimer, which nobody was happy I was playing.”\n\t\n\n\"My shoulders are broad enough to have the women who come after me stand on mine.\" — Cyndi Lauper accepts her 2025 Rock Hall Induction and gives thanks to all the women who came before her.  #RockHall2025 pic.twitter.com/IKrHRSTduF— Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (@rockhall) November 9, 2025\n\n\n\tShe noted that, when she uses the R&R term for herself, she is thinking in terms of the same big tent that the Hall itself has used for years in bringing in acts from different genres under that attitudinal umbrella.\n\n\t“Rock ‘n’ roll is a big, wonderful quilt of a lot of different styles of music. Thank goodness,” she said. “And all of that music has influenced me and my work, and without it, I don’t know what kind of music I’d be making. So I just want to say, now of all times, let’s come together again and do good in the world because it needs us…\n\n\t“You know, I always was part of the rock ‘n’  roll community anyway. You just didn’t wanna talk to me because, you know, they thought I was a little crazy. I don’t know why. Anyway, all kidding aside, I love you. Thank you very much to the Rock Hall of Fame. I’m so happy you’re bringing women back in. There are a lot of us. And long live rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\n\n\tThe performance by Lauper that came near the end of the four-hour-plus proceedings included, besides the aforementioned rendition of “True Colors,” a duet with Raye on “Time After Time” and a climactic “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” that had Avril Lavigne trading lines on the verses and Salt-N-Pepa making a group cameo at the end.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCyndi Lauper and Brandi Carlile at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHollywood returned to the top of the China box office as 20th Century Studios release “Predator: Badlands” debuted at No. 1 with RMB52.5 million ($7.4 million) for the Nov. 3–9 weekend, according to Artisan Gateway. \n\n\tWith a total of $80 million, “Predator: Badlands” is the No. 1 film in the world currently, per Comscore.\n\n\tPMF Pictures’ “Row to Win”was in second place with $2.2 million, bringing its total to $60.6 million. The comedy-drama directed by Ma Lin and starring Huang Bo, Fan Chengcheng, Yin Tao and Li Jiaqi, follows a coastal-town family – led by a once-tough patriarch – who rally together in hard times and push for a comeback. \n\t\n\n\tLast week’s topper, Maoyan Movie’s “Her Turn,” ranked third, adding $2.1 million for a $8.9 million cume after two weeks. Directed by Cheng Yanan, the thriller stars Li Gengxi, Deng Jiajia, Liu Yitie, Huang Xiaoming and Yue Jiayi. The story follows a partially paralysed woman who returns to her family’s remote mansion, uncovering long-buried secrets and a revenge plot years in the making.\n\n\n\tMint Pictures’ “The Sun Rises On Us All” opened fourth with $1.8 million. Directed by Cai Shangjun, the romantic drama stars Xin Zhilei – who won best actress at Venice for her role in the film – and Zhang Songwen as estranged lovers forced to reckon with old wounds and buried regrets after years apart. \n\n\tIn fifth place, 66cc Co. Ltd.’s feature “Penguin Girl” launched with $1.6 million. Directed by Yang Yuyu, the film follows Moon, a young woman obsessed with penguins who believes she’ll find true love in Antarctica — until her encounter with an eccentric man in a penguin suit changes her understanding of devotion and dreams.\n\t\n\n\tWeekend box office revenue totaled $21.7 million – on par with last weekend – bringing China’s 2025 year-to-date tally to $6.32 billion, up 15.3% compared with the same period last year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 40th annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony lasted for about five nonstop hours Saturday, at least for those watching live at L.A.’s Peacock Theatre or as a stream on Disney+. The show will be less than half that length by the time viewers get their crack at seeing it, or a condensed version of it, on New Year’s Day as an ABC special. But when it’s worthy artists like Cyndi Lauper, the White Stripes, Outkast, Soundgarden, Salt-N-Pepa, Warren Zevon, Bad Company and Joe Cocker being celebrated — probably the closest thing to a universally agreeable crop in years — the word “excess” just naturally seems like it should be preceded by the word “blessed.” \n\t\n\n\tHere, in photographs and words, are some of the memorable looks and quotes associated with this year’s performances, speeches and backstage chats.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaylor Momsen and Brandi Carlile perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSOUNDGARDEN\n\n\tThere seems to be a pattern here. When the surviving members of Nirvana get back together for a semi-reunion (as they did at FireAid earlier in 2025), they only employ female singers as fill-ins for the late Kurt Cobain. Soundgarden: same thing. It makes some sense, getting away from someone who might invite comparisons too close to Chris Cornell and settling on the female voice instead. Taylor Momsen brought growly grit to “Rusty Cage,” followed by the band’s fellow Seattle native Brandi Carlile breaking through to the heavens with “Black Hole Sun” (with Momsen returning to the stage to sing the rock anthem’s famous closing backing vocals). As dessert, Cornell’s 21-year-old daughter Toni Cornell sang “Fell on Black Days,” accompanied by a cellist and Heart’s Nancy Wilson on acoustic guitar.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHiro Yamamoto, Matt Cameron, Kim Thayil, Jim Carrey, Taylor Momsen and Ben Shepherd at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJim Carrey handled the induction duties. “You may ask why oh why Soundgarden, the heaviest of rock and roll royalty. (has) Jim Carrey to induct them into the Hall of Fame. Is there some deep cosmic connection between them, or was the Spoonman not available? Well, the truth is, I grew up with the awe-inspiring bands of the hard rock era. Every day I spent hours in the corner of a basement playing power chords on a goalie stick.” When he finally got to see and meet Soundgarden, “I stood right in front of them, letting the waves of electricity wash over me, like an audio baptism. They pushed me under and when I came up, I was free. After the show, they handed me what is to this day one of my most prized possessions, a Defender Telecaster Chris played on the show, signed by the whole band.” He described Cornell, whom he met on a few occasions, as “always really sincere, very down to earth, thoughtful, funny,” saying that “for all time, his voice will continue to light up the ether like a Tesla coil.”\n\n\t(Soundgarden members were not the only old cohorts Carey was meeting up with; he was reuniting for the first time in 25 years with his “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” costar, Momsen, under extremely different creative circumstances.)\n\n\tThe night was light on political talk, but founding bassist Hiro Yamamoto did take the occasion to say what was on his mind about current events. He said that hearing “my parents’ stories of American citizens who were rounded up and placed in prison camps just for being Japanese during World War II, that affected my life greatly, and it really echoes strongly today. … C’mon, we can do a lot better than this. Let’s not add another story like this to our history.” But he urged communication, not enmity: “Let’s keep the dialogue alive because dialogue’s what we need.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tToni Cornell at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSaid 21-year-old Toni Cornell backstage after singing “Fell on Black Days,” “It’s so surreal and I’m so honored I get to be here and do this for my dad. At the end of the day i just wish he could have been here to see this honor for himself. He’s he reason I do what I do. … I was really little and I remember going to my dad’s Songbook tour, which I think was his first acoustic tour… I was always really touched by just him and his voice and his guitar, and then eventually he did it with a cellist. And I just really love that arrangement. Everyone can relate to that song on so many levels. I fell on black days. We’ve all been there. So I personally related to that and I really wanted to channel how my dad would’ve performed that song on his own.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSandra Denton, DJ Spinderella and Cheryl James of Salt-N-Pepa at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSALT-N-PEPA\n\n\t“Let me put my glasses on here,” said Cheryl “Salt” James — not the first time those words have been spoken at a Hall of Fame ceremony. But once she was properly sighted, she got into why she thinks the hip-hop act has been slighted, getting into their legal battle with Universal Music and reiterating that their music is unable to be streamed right now because of the dispute.\n\n\t“This is for every woman who picked up a mic and they told her she couldn’t, every sister who had to fight twice is hard to be heard. But every artist has had to learn that ownership is the real freedom. When we came up, the industry was different. We didn’t have streaming, we didn’t have social media. We had cassette tapes, turntables and dreams. But even back then, we had to fight to be heard and to prove our word. We’re in a fight right now (over music) that rightfully belongs to us after 40 years as we celebrate this moment. Fans can’t even stream our music. It’s been taken down from all streaming platforms because the industry still doesn’t want to play fair. Salt-N-Pepa has never been afraid of a fight. This is the influence award. We have to keep using our influence until the industry honors creativity, the way the audience does with love, respect, and fairness. And that includes streaming platforms too.”\n\n\tJames took a lighter approach in saying “thank you to the fans, the DJs, the women who rhymed in their mirrors, and the mighty good men who supported us. I want to apologize to the countless fans who got in trouble for cutting their hair like us and singing our lyrics. To all the guys who had a crush on us and had our posters on the wall: You’re welcome.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInductees Sandra Denton aka Pepa and Cheryl James aka Salt of Salt N Pepa perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSandra “Pepa” Denton also got some words in, as did their longtime DJ Spinderella, aka Deidra Roper, who said, “I will be celebrating 40 years as a DJ next year. How crazy is that? When I started it was weird thing to see a woman on a turntable. It was literally a boy’ club… Tonight, being the first female DJ inducted into the Rock Hall of Fame, for every woman who touched a turntable and said ‘I could do that too,’ this is for you.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBryan Adams and inductee Simon Kirke of Bad Company perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBAD COMPANY\n\n\tAnd then there was one… who was able to make it to the ceremony. Guitarist Mick Ralphs died earlier this year, and while singer Paul Rodgers was expected to come and perform, he bowed out last week due to health concerns, leaving drummer Simon Kirke as the sole representative. Kirke was happy to get a drummer-to-drummer handoff from Mick Fleetwood near the beginning of the show, and then perform with a band that had the Black Crowes’ Chris Robinson handling lead vocals on “Feel Like Makin’ Love” and Bryan Adams singing “Can’t Get Enough,” with Joe Perry and Nancy Wilson joining in on guitars.\n\n\t“I’ve never played ‘Can’t Get Enough’ in a tuxedo before, you’ll have to forgive me,” Kirke quipped at the beginning of his speech.\n\n\tKirke talked about how far this stage seemed from his childhood prospects. “I was 14 years old sitting in my classroom overlooking Middlesboro, my hometown, and I could see beyond the town, to the steel works, the chemical factory with the shipyard. My teacher, Mr. Garrity, said, ‘OK, class, take a good look out there. That’s where you’ll be going when you graduate.’ That night I went to a dance and I heard a record by Little Richard, and a box of fireworks went off in my head, rockets and all. I thought to myself, ‘I’m gonna follow that music and find out all about it.’ That’s what I did. Now I found myself being inducted into the brotherhood and sisterhood of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSimon Kirke performs onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Mazur/Getty Images for RRH\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBackstage, Kirke talked about the notable absences from the original Bad Co. lineup, saying there were “mixed emotions. You know, when death takes a friend, it never really dies,  it never really fades away. And I’m just glad that Mick was able to hear that we were inducted before he passed away. I believe (Ralphs’ passing) was two weeks after he got the news… Paul called him and said, ‘Hey mate, we got in. We got in.’ Mick said, ‘Does that mean we get free hot dogs?’ I guess it was the morphine talking. But he went out with a smile. I miss him very much. And it was hard holding it together out there.”\n\t\n\n\tWith Rodgers, “What happened was, as you all know, he’s had health problems for quite a while, and it’s not so much the singing or the rehearsals. It was the traveling and the flying. I don’t want to speak out of turn, but flying was a big problem for him, just to be on the safe side. So he called me last week and said, ‘Hey man, so sorry…’ But he called Bryan Adams, who was great tonight, an absolute marvel, and the Hall of Fame contacted Chris Robinson, so we got two great substitutes. I do wish he had been here, but I totally understand, and in fact,” he noted, looking for a silver lining, “we’ve got more publicity from him not coming.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBig Boi and André 3000 of Outkast speak onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOUTKAST\n\n\tAs legendary duos go, the Hall had better luck with getting full attendance with Outkast than with the White Stripes. Even then, of the two, only Big Boi chose to perform, while André 3000 looked on — but few fans could realistically claim there was a great disruption of chemistry in that, since the two had spent most of the time they were together acting almost as conjoined solo acts. (Still, it seemed like a missed opportunity for a flute solo to be added to “The Way You Move.”)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJanelle Monae at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Outkast performance salute packed in more songs per square homage than that for any other act of the night. Big Boi was joined by JID on “ATLiens,” Doja Cat on “Ms. Jackson,” Tyler, the Creator on “B.O.B.,” Janelle Monae seeming to be playing a spunky — if not downright bratty — teenager on Andre’s rocking”Hey Ya,” Sleepy Brown on “The Way You Move” and Killer Mike on “The Whole World.” If this Hall of Fame ceremony sometimes seemed like it was more suited to be a limited series than a special, Outkast’s segment could practically have been stretched out to two all-star episodes all by itself.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJack White speaks onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWHITE STRIPES\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking to his former drummer’s absence, White said: “I spoke with Meg White the other day, and she said that she’s very sorry she couldn’t make it here tonight, but she wanted me to tell you that she’s very grateful. And to all of the folks who supported her in all the years, it really means a lot to her. She also helped me write all this… I sent these things to her. She checked it for me for a lot of punctuation and corrections. She’s pretty good at that.”\n\n\tHe continued by sharing a random thought of Meg’s: “She said, ‘Do you remember, Jack? We used to walk around and animals, for some reason, would stare at us. They would stop and stare at us for some reason. Even at the Detroit Zoo, an elephant did the exact same thing one time.’ She just wanted me to tell you that,” he explained, to crowd laughter.\n\n\tWhite read off a litany of musicians he wanted to thank as influences, including such varied names as Loretta Lynn, Fugazi, the Misfits, Jethro Tull, the Troggs, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Arthur Lee and Love, the Flat Duo Jets, Dick Dale, Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow, the Sonics, Pavement, Black Flag, Sleater-Kinney, the Breeders, the Cramps, Merle Haggard, the Hives, Them, the Damned, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Minor Threat and Captain Beefheart.\n\n\tIn the video tribute that the Rock Hall put together for the duo, Olivia Rodrigo offered a younger generation’s appreciation of the pair — and the highest possible veneration for “Seven Nation Army” in particular: “Do you hear those seven notes? There’s no question what it is. ‘Seven Nation Army’ is the most iconic song of all time — it’s just so ingrained into who we are as humans.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFeist and Olivia Rodrigo pose in the press room during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnd then she and Feist sang a lovely duet of one of the White Stripes’ gentlest songs, “We Are Going to Be Friends,” followed by Twenty One Pilots doing the more ferociously classic “Seven Nation Army.” There was some controversy among WS fans about Pilots getting the pick, although it was easy to see where the Hall drew the connection, in choosing one of the few famous two-person outfits in rock. Tyler Joseph played White’s bass-sounding riff on an actual bass, then switched to keyboards briefly, taking the mask off his face and looking plaintively into an overhead camera as he took the song into a nearly balladic version for one verse.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoshua Dun and Tyler Joseph of Twenty One Pilots at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCYNDI LAUPER\n\t\n\n\t“Cyndi embodies every quality of an artist that I admire,” Chappell Roan said in her much-anticipated induction speech bringing Lauper into the Hall. “She’s a born performer and a revolutionary songwriter, a forever fashion icon, and a fierce advocate and ally. And from the very beginning, she owned every ounce of who she was — the manic, panicked hair, all of those rad Fingerless gloves and those unbelievably layered, dynamic and one-of-a-kind vocals… Can I hear a little commotion for the vocals?”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan and Cyndi Lauper arrive at the GBK Brand Bar & Meals On Me Backstage Lounge At The Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for GBK Brand Bar L\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChappell Roan at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRoan looked back to Lauper’s impact at the very start of her nascent career: “One of Cyndi’s most inspiring songs to me personally is ‘True Colors.’ When I was 14 years old, I performed ‘True Colors’ at a talent show in my hometown in Missouri. That was my first time ever winning a competition for singing, and that has been so important to me ever since. ‘True Colors’ has gone on to be an anthem synonymous with love and acceptance in the LGBTQ+ community and beyond — a message that still stands the test of time.”\n\n\tLauper was as truly colorful as ever in that particular regard when she sang “True Colors” as part of a multi-artist performance segment in her honor, pausing the song as a vertical rainbow/pride flag unfurled from the top of the stage behind her, in a striking and pointed camera angle.\n\n\tIn her acceptance speech, Lauper thanked “my badass female band I always dreamed of having” — which, for this occasion, included guest drummer Gina Schock of the Go-Go’s — and then positioned herself as part of a middle generation in the history of women in rock.\n\n\t“So now to make a long story short…” she quipped. “Oops, too late for that. But I just want to say that I know that I stand on the shoulders of the women in the industry that came before me, and my shoulders are broad enough to have the women that come after me stand on mine. And the other thing that I thought was really important, which is why I really came here tonight, is to tell you that the little kid in me still believes that rock ‘n’ roll can save the world.”\n\n\tShe noted that, when she uses the R&R term for herself, she is thinking in terms of the same big tent that the Hall itself has used for years in bringing in acts from different genres under that attitudinal umbrella.\n\t\n\n\t“Rock ‘n’ roll is a big, wonderful quilt of a lot of different styles of music. Thank goodness,” she said. “And all of that music has influenced me and my work, and without it, I don’t know what kind of music I’d be making. So I just want to say, now of all times, let’s come together again and do good in the world because it needs us…\n\n\t“You know, I always was part of the rock ‘n’ roll community anyway. You just didn’t wanna talk to me because, you know, they thought I was a little crazy. I don’t know why. Anyway, all kidding aside, I love you. Thank you very much to the Rock Hall of Fame. I’m so happy you’re bringing women back in. There are a lot of us. And long live rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRaye and inductee Cyndi Lauper perform onstage at the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFilmMagic\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter singing a solo rendition of “True Colors” that climaxed with the vertical unrolling of a rainbow pride banner, Lauper was matched powerfully with one of today’s most promising rising stars, Raye, on “Time After Time,” then joined by Avril Lavigne (and eventually Salt-N-Pepa) for “Girls Just Want to Have Fun.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDavid Letterman speaks onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Mazur/Getty Images for RRH\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWARREN ZEVON\n\n\tHandling the induction speech, David Letterman told the story of having Zevon on his program shortly after the rocker was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and given only months to live. It was there that Zevon issued his famous “Enjoy every sandwich” advice, and Letterman spoke of following the singer-songwriter to his dressing room. Then, he said, Zevon handed him the electric guitar he had used in his many appearances on the show, saying, “Take care of this for me.” “I know what’s supposed to happen now,” Letterman said, “and sure as hell, it did happen. I started to sob uncontrollably.”\n\n\tLetterman stood beside the guitar in question and said, “For 22 years, I have taken care of the guitar. … By God, tonight it’s going back to work.” To Dave Keuning, lead guitarist of the Killers, he said, “It’s all yours, sir.” And at that point, it was left to the Killers — with special guest Waddy Wachtel, who played guitar on most of Zevon’s most famous records — to close the tribute out with their version of one of the honoree’s signature songs, “Lawyers, Guns and Money.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDave Keuning, Brandon Flowers, Ronnie Vannucci and Mark Stoermer of the Killers at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt was only a one-song tribute, and his most famous song, “Werewolves of London,” did not factor into it — save for a couple of “Ah-oooh!” phrasings that Brandon Flowers worked in near the end of “Lawyers” as a semi-subtle interpolation.\n\n\tLetterman referred back to the catchphrase that Zevon introduced in his final appearance on his show. ““The thing about ‘Enjoy every sandwich’ — you know that that’s easy, but it’s deeply meaningful. And there’s not a person in this room who hasn’t considered that, but nobody can hang on to that on a daily basis. But by God, isn’t that true of life around the planet? Enjoy every sandwich.”\n\n\tOTHER HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\tChubby Checker chose to do a show rather than attend the Hall ceremony, but he did appear in video from the stage of his concert, holding the trophy that had been sent out to him for the occasion and saying “how happy I am and that I’m around to enjoy it.” He then broke out into a too-quickly-cut-away Twist, the revolutionary solo dance he popularized.\n\n\tLike Checker and Meg White, bass-playing studio-sessions legend Carol Kaye took a pass on attending the ceremony. Unlike them, she had repeatedly said that she did not want to be inducted at all, offering a variety of reasons on her social media — most recently declaring that she was a jazz musician, not a rocker, and citing the cost of tickets for guests. In any event, anyone watching the show wouldn’t have known she was getting what others would consider the honor of a lifetime under extreme protest, as producers put together a nice video package to educate viewers about her contributions, using vintage clips.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFlea and Beck perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTwo segments during the show paid tribute to recently departed Hall of Fames. The show began with a raucous Sly & the Family Stone tribute that had Stevie Wonder joined by Maxwell, Jennifer Hudson, new Grammy nominee Leon Thomas, Flea and Beck on “Dance to the Music,” “Everyday People,” “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again)” and “Higher.” Sly Stone died June 9.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Hudson and Maxwell perform onstage during the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 08, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for RRHOF\n\t\n\n\n\n\tElton John appeared toward the end of the night, singing the haunting “God Only Knows” in tribute to Brian Wilson, who passed away June 11.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNathaniel Rateliff, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks at 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert Flores/Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Tedeschi Trucks Band provided plenty of cover for the late Joe Cocker at the climax, joined by Nathaniel Rateliff on “The Letter,” Teddy Swims on “Feelin’ Alright?” and a veritable cast of thousands on “With a Little Help From My Friends” — Lauper, Rateliff, Robinson, Swims and Thomas. As the song asks: Do we need anybody? And as it answered, in true Cocker fashion: Owwwwwww, yes.\n\n\tHere are some other photographic moments from the red carpet and backstage:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLeon Thomas III attends the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Peacock Theater on November 08, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

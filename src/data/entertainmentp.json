    "body": "\n\tThree cheers for the Crawley family. “Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale,” the third and final cinematic chapter about the fictional aristocratic clan, has crossed the $100 million milestone at the global box office.\n\n\tThe film, backed by Focus Features and designed to bid farewell to the franchise that began with the beloved British television show, has grossed $104 million to date — including $45 million domestically and $55 million internationally. A slow and steady box office win for “The Grand Finale,” which opened in September, signals that long-time fans of the property haven’t tired of the onscreen palace intrigue and class-system drama. It’s also significant because, post COVID, many films aimed at older crowds have struggled to sell tickets at all.\n\t\n\n\tRevenues for the third film managed to improve upon the prior entry in the series about the grand houses and the servants and elite who populate them. The second film, 2022’s “Downton Abbey: A New Era,” debuted after COVID upended the theatrical landscape (and kept many older moviegoers at home) and amassed a still-impressive $92.6 million worldwide. Neither were able to top the first “Downton Abbey” movie, which was a huge hit with $194 million globally in 2019.\n\n\n\t“Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale” opened in North America on Sept. 12 with $18 million in its opening weekend, below the original’s $31 million start but above the sequel’s $16 million bow. Internationally, the United Kingdom is unsurprisingly the top-earning market with $24 million followed by Germany with $4.7 million and France with $4.5 million.\n\t\n\n\tSimon Curtis directed “Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale” after helming “A New Era.” Series creator Julian Fellowes wrote the script, with Hugh Bonneville, Jim Carter, Michelle Dockery, Paul Giamatti, Elizabeth McGovern and Penelope Wilton among the original cast members who appear in the third installment.\n\n\tIn Variety’s review, film critic Tomris Laffly praised Fellowes for “gracefully transformed the series into an equally alluring three-film trilogy.” She wrote, “With a profound embrace of the changing times and clever winks at Downton devotees, Fellowes and director Simon Curtis deliver a heart-swelling conclusion.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland’s Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz” might be the most recognizable shoes in cinematic history. But with the release of “Wicked: For Good” around the corner on Nov. 21, fans expecting to see the iconic slippers shouldn’t get their hopes up.\n\n\tThe famous footwear didn’t appear in the first “Wicked” movie and won’t show up in “Wicked: For Good” either. Instead, director Jon M. Chu remains faithful to the original book, “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” by L. Frank Baum, and the Broadway musical that “Wicked” adapts, by keeping the slippers silver.\n\t\n\n\tBaum’s 1900 novel appeared at the tail end of the Gilded Age, a tumultuous time in American history that was marked by political tension and rapid industrialization. Consequently, many literary scholars believe that the book is heavily allegorical. They argue that the yellow brick road represents the gold standard favored by bankers and the elites, while the silver slippers represent the Silverite position of unions and populists who called for a less fixed money supply.\n\n\n\tThe decision to stay true to the silver slippers also stems from the fact that the rights to the ruby ones belong to MGM, now owned by Warner Bros., which cooked up Dorothy’s footwear for the 1939 film to highlight the Technicolor look (Baum’s book is in the public domain, but the movie is still copyrighted). The “Wicked” films are distributed by Universal Pictures.\n\n\t“We had boundaries of what we could reference or not. We never use the ruby slippers,” Chu previously told Variety.\n\t\n\n\tYet the production team still found a way to nod to Dorothy’s iconic shoes, lighting them so they appear red in a key scene.\n\n\tIn the first film, it’s revealed that the shoes are an heirloom belonging to the family of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo). They make their first appearance when her father, Governor Thropp (Andy Nyman), gifts them to her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), upon her arrival at Shiz University. It’s mentioned that they once belonged to their mother, and they are presented in a case encrusted in ruby red jewels in a reference to the shoes from the 1939 film. Costume designer Paul Tazewell added a tornado-shaped detail to the heel, a clever nod to the original twister that brought Dorothy from Kansas to Oz.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” carries the ruby red allusions even further. Nessarose, who uses a wheelchair, is seen levitating after begging Elphaba to wield her magical powers to give her the ability to walk. As Nessarose climbs into the air, her silver slippers and the room are bathed in red lighting.\n\n\tCinematographer Alice Brooks used red in the film to reflect that Elphaba and Nessarose are making “the wrong choice.” As Elphaba’s powers grow stronger and Nessarose flies out of her chair, the shoes glow as if lit from within. “They get hotter and hotter, and that red became our most vibrant red,” Brooks says. For a moment, at least, the most dazzling pumps in all of Oz are back in the center of the frame.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCharlie Sheen recently appeared on “In Depth With Graham Bensinger” and reflected on being dropped from 1989’s “Born on the Fourth of July” so that it could become a Tom Cruise star vehicle. Sheen said he had been in talks with his “Platoon” director Oliver Stone about reuniting on the movie, which tells the true story of Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic and how he became an anti-war advocate after being paralyzed in battle. Sheen had no idea Stone was changing course until Sheen’s brother, Emilio Estevez, cold-called him one night.\n\t\n\n\t“Emilio, he calls me. He says, ‘Hey, man. You sitting down?’ And I think somebody died, right?” Sheen said (via EW). “I’m like, ‘No, what’s going on?” He says, ‘Cruise is doing “Born on the Fourth.”‘ I love that Emilio thought that I needed to be seated to get news he thought was going to make me faint. I mean, what are we doing here? It’s a movie.”\n\n\n\tEven if it’s just a movie, Sheen acknowledged being dropped for Cruise was “a big deal,” adding: “It was also the betrayal factor of it. So I was like, ‘OK, all right.’ You know, Oliver’s been a fan of Tom’s for a long time. It’s a different movie if Tom does it than if I do it.”\n\n\tSheen said the news of Cruise’s casting came after he “had meetings about” the movie with Stone, with the duo even having dinner with the real Ron Kovic. “And then I stopped hearing from him,” Sheen said of Stone. “We stopped talking about it, and I reach out to Oliver, and I’m told that he’s in Cuba. Whatever. This is like 1988 or ’89, right? I’m like, ‘OK, well, tell him I’m looking for him.'”\n\t\n\n\tIt wasn’t until much later that Sheen got the chance to confront Stone about the betrayal when they both ended up in the same bar, explaining: “I was drunk enough and he was drunk enough for that thing to finally be brought up. And he was like, ‘I just felt like you didn’t have any passion for it. I felt like you lost interest.’ I was like, ‘Well, I didn’t see you. How do you know how much passion I lost or interest that evaporated if we never talked about it again?'”\n\n\tSheen is no longer bitter about how things went down, noting: “You can’t lose something you never had. I didn’t sign a contract. There was a handshake.” And he’s not one to talk negatively about Cruise, who scored the first Oscar nomination of his career for “Born on the Fourth of July.”\n\n\t“It wasn’t like a thing where I’m going to talk shit about him, because then you see the movie and you’re like, ‘Oh, OK. All right. He turned it into that,'” Sheen said. “When someone gets a job and does that with it, you’re just like, of course. You don’t sit there and dissect it and like, ‘I’d have done that better.’ No, go fuck yourself. That’s a brilliant [performance] — and you should have won the freaking Oscar.”\n\n\tCruise’s Oscar nom was one of eight Academy Award nominations earned by “Born on the Fourth of July.” The film was also nominated for best picture and won Stone the best director prize. The movie was a box office hit with $162 million worldwide.\n\n\tWatch Sheen’s full interview on the “In Depth With Graham Bensinger” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHulu’s Onyx Collective has ordered a pilot for a series adaptation of the “Southern Bastards” graphic novels, Variety has learned.\n\n\tJason Aaron and Jason Latour, who created the original comics, are executive producing. Bill Dubuque wrote the teleplay and executive produces in addition to sharing a co-story credit with Nia DaCosta. DaCosta will also direct the pilot in addition to executive producing via The Once and Future Inc. Matt Olmstead will serve as showrunner and executive producer. Layne Eskridge executive produces via POV Entertainment, with Proximity Media and Gabriel Nadig executive producing as well. The series is produced in association with Fifth Season. \n\t\n\n\tThe logline for the project states that it follows “a tenacious military vet into Craw County, Alabama, in search of her estranged father. What she finds is a murderous hornet’s nest of organized crime run by the winningest high school football coach in the South.” \n\n\n\t“Southern Bastards” was originally released between 2014 and 2018. The series has received good reviews from both critics and audiences, winning the Harvey Award for best new series in 2015 and multiple Eisner Awards in 2016. \n\n\tDubuque is perhaps best known for co-creating the hit, Emmy Award-winning Netflix series “Ozark,” which aired for four seasons at the streamer. He shared in the show’s three nominations for best drama series between 2019 and 2022. He is also currently prepping the crime drama “M.I.A” at Peacock. In film, Dubuque is known for writing features such as “The Judge,” “A Family Man,” and both “The Accountant” and “The Accountant 2.” \n\t\n\n\t“Southern Bastards” will mark the second TV project that DaCosta has directed. She previously directed two episodes of the critically-acclaimed British series “Top Boy.” She is best known for her work in film, having directed and written features such as “Hedda” starring Tessa Thompson, the MCU pic “The Marvels,” the Jordan Peele reboot of “The Candyman,” and her debut film “Little Woods.” Up next, DaCosta is directing the highly-anticipated sequel “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple.” \n\n\tOlmstead co-created the hit shows “Chicago Med” and “Chicago PD,” the former of which is in its 11th season and the latter of which is in its 13th. He has previously been the showrunner on series such as “Prison Break,” “NYPD Blue,” “Chicago Fire,” and “FBI International.” \n\n\tDubuque is repped by CAA and Goodman Genow. DaCosta is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, Casarotto Ramsay, and Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka. Olmstead is repped by WME and Goodman Genow. Aaron and Latour are repped by Angela Cheng Caplan and Harris Miller. Eskridge is repped by WME.\n",

    "description": "\n\tFour years after the fatal shooting on the set of “Rust,” the man who supplied prop guns and blanks to the production has sued Alec Baldwin in a bid",
    "body": "\n\tFour years after the fatal shooting on the set of “Rust,” the man who supplied prop guns and blanks to the production has sued Alec Baldwin in a bid to clear his name.\n\n\tSeth Kenney, the owner of PDQ Arm & Prop, filed the 35-page complaint last week, alleging that his reputation has been destroyed in the wake of the accidental death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, Kenney said he has been unable to find work in the film industry since then.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s been devastating,” he said. “It’s not a matter of saving face. There’s nothing left to lose. This whole thing has been shit and I have been the scapegoat.”\n\n\tKenney supplied the Colt .45 revolver that Baldwin was holding when the fatal shot was fired on Oct. 21, 2021. The film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, served 14 months for involuntary manslaughter for loading a live bullet into the gun. Baldwin was put on trial last summer, but the case was thrown out midway through due to withheld evidence.\n\n\tInvestigators never determined how the armorer’s supply of dummy rounds became contaminated with live bullets — a major safety breach. Kenney, who served as a key prosecution witness at both trials, has adamantly denied that he was to blame, saying he had meticulously “rattle tested” each dummy to ensure that it was inert.\n\n\tBut he has been unable to escape a cloud of suspicion. In his lawsuit, Kenney accuses Baldwin and others of conspiring with “cutthroat industry Hollywood ‘fixers’ and media” to put the blame on him. As a result of a “national propaganda campaign,” Kenney says he has suffered personal humiliation, mental anguish, and “ruinous financial losses.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the interview, Kenney said the “last straw” came in January, when Baldwin filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit against New Mexico officials. In the complaint, Baldwin’s lawyers suggested that Kenney had inadvertently commingled live rounds into a supply of dummy rounds. Baldwin’s lawyers also argued that detectives had failed to properly investigate Kenney because they were working closely with him.\n\n\t“Why is he trying to paint me out to be this villain?” Kenney asked.\n\n\tKenney has been repeatedly sued for his alleged role in the shooting. He filed his lawsuit himself, without a lawyer. He said he was no longer worried about inflicting further harm to his career by speaking out.\n\n\t“I’ve gotta say my piece,” he said. “I do have that opportunity to say, ‘Here’s what really went on with a lot of things.'”\n\n\tThe lawsuit names Baldwin as a defendant along with the production entity, Gutierrez Reed, and numerous other producers and crew members. It tells a familiar tale of a cascade of safety lapses. It accuses the production of cutting corners and faults Baldwin for failing to participate in an inspection of the gun. And it alleges that Gutierrez Reed was the one responsible for the live bullets.\n\n\t“Hannah started this deadly snowball,” Kenney said. “Then the rest of them do everything they’re not supposed to do.”\n\n\tProsecutors at Gutierrez Reed’s trial showed evidence that she had brought the contaminated dummies from a previous production, “The Old Way,” starring Nicolas Cage. In his lawsuit, Kenney alleges “upon information and belief” that her dummy supply “had been mixed with live .45 Colt rounds that she had been shooting in her off hours while working as an Armorer on ‘The Old Way.'”\n\n\tGutierrez Reed was paroled in May and is still appealing her conviction. In a police interview in 2021, she said she got the dummy rounds she used on “The Old Way” from Kenney. She sued Kenney in 2022, blaming him for introducing the live bullets. Her suit was later dropped.\n\n\tIn his initial police interview, Kenney was shown a photo of a box of dummies marked with the initials “JS” that was recovered from the set of “Rust.” He acknowledged that he may have supplied the box to Gutierrez Reed for “The Old Way.”\n\n\t“I might have provided this previously on the Nic Cage movie,” he said. “It’s entirely possible. I don’t remember.”\n\t\n\n\tAt the time, he also said that the source of the live bullets was not important.\n\n\t“In the end again it doesn’t matter, because we have to assume everything is live,” he said. “She still didn’t do her job.”\n\n\tTwo years later, Kenney testified that he did remember who provided the “JS” box to “The Old Way.” He said they came from Gutierrez Reed’s father, film armorer Thell Reed.\n\n\t“I was definitely honest in the interview, and initially I couldn’t remember,” he told Variety via text this week. “It took me a while to realize that I had never owned a ‘JS’ .45 Colt Dummy round box.”\n\n\tBaldwin’s lawyers declined to comment on Kenney’s suit.\n\n\tKenney said he hopes to use the discovery process to learn more about Baldwin’s use of media fixers to damage his reputation. The suit accuses the defendants of working with online trolls and YouTube creators to paint him in a false light.\n\n\t“People that know me understand what a stickler I am,” Kenney said. \n\n\tHe said the industry immediately cut ties with him after the shooting, and that the effect on his career may be “terminal.”\n\n\t“What are you going to do — pull over by the side of the road and cry in the gutter?” he said. “No. I refuse to give up. It’s not that I’m done with the industry. The industry might be done with me for a while.”\n\n\tBaldwin’s attorneys, meanwhile, recently revived his lawsuit after it was thrown out for lack of prosecution. The suit alleges that the state deliberately withheld a cache of bullets — three of which appeared to match the fatal round — because it undermined the state’s theory of the case.\n\n\tAfter removing the case to federal court, the state filed five motions Tuesday and Wednesday to dismiss it on grounds of prosecutorial immunity.\n\n\tA few other civil suits remain pending. Hutchins’ mother and sister have filed a suit against Baldwin and others involved in the production. Baldwin is due to be deposed in that case via Zoom on Nov. 12.\n\n\tKenney also filed a six-page civil rights lawsuit against the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office last December, alleging that investigators lied in order to obtain a search warrant on his business.\n\n\tIn the new lawsuit, Kenney states that he still has not received his gun back — it remains in evidence — and that the “Rust” production never paid him for the rental.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmy Pascal will be honored with the David O. Selznick Achievement Award on behalf of the Producers Guild of America. Pascal will accept the award at the 37th Annual Producers Guild Awards on Feb. 28 at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles.\n\n\tSince founding Pascal Pictures in 2015, Pascal has produced major box office hits such as the trilogy of “Spider-Man” movies, “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” and its sequel “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women,” Steven Spielberg’s “The Post,” and more.\n\t\n\n\tMost recently, Pascal has had producer credits on Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly” and Luca Guadagnino’s “Challengers” starring Zendaya, Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist. Pascal next will serve as producer on Greta Gerwig’s “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Magician’s Nephew”; “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” starring Tom Holland; Phil Lord and Chris Miller’s “Project Hail Mary” and the upcoming “James Bond” film by Denis Villeneuve. \n\n\n\t“Producing has been the great joy of my professional life, and to receive this honor from the Producers Guild, among so many legendary peers I deeply respect, is incredibly moving,” said Pascal in a press release. “David O. Selznick was the kind of producer who believed in ambition, imagination, and taking risks, and to be awarded in his name is a reminder that producing isn’t just about making movies – it’s about championing bold stories and carrying forward a legacy of daring, visionary filmmaking. I’m so grateful for the PGA and its commitment to protecting and celebrating the craft of producing, and for the extraordinary collaborators, colleagues and mentors who’ve supported me on this journey.”\n\t\n\n\t“Amy exemplifies the essential qualities of a truly great producer: impeccable taste, a keen eye for extraordinary talent both in front of and behind the camera, and an unwavering determination fueled by deep passion,” said PGA Presidents Donald De Line and Stephanie Allain. “Her films are masterclasses in storytelling – seamlessly blending compelling entertainment with thought-provoking ideas – and many have become lasting cultural touchstones.”\n\n\tPascal previously served as the Chairperson of the Motion Pictures Group of Sony Pictures Entertainment and Co-Chairperson of SPE from 2006 until 2015.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRoku, the top independent streaming device and content platform company, delivered third-quarter 2025 financial results that exceeded analyst expectations — and marked the company’s first quarter with positive operating income since 2021.\n\n\tFor Q3, Roku posted revenue of $1.21 billion, up 14%, and net income of $24.8 million (versus a net loss of $35.8 million in the year-earlier period). That translated to earnings per diluted share of 16 cents. On average, Wall Street analysts expected revenue of $1.1 billion and adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share, per financial data provider LSEG.\n\t\n\n\tHelping fuel the growth was the continued uptick in usage: Total streaming hours on Roku for Q3 were 36.5 billion, up 12% year over year. \n\n\n\tRoku’s Platform revenue (which includes ad sales, content sales and subscription-revenue sharing) was $1.065 billion for the quarter, up 17%, while Devices revenue declined 5% to $146 million. Platform segment operating margin was 51.7% (versus 54.2% in the year-ago period) and Devices margin was -15.7%. Total operating expenses were flat at $515.4 million.\n\n\tAll told, Roku eked out an operating profit of $9.5 million for the quarter. Gross profit was $525 million, up 9%.\n\n\t“Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver double-digit Platform revenue growth while increasing operating margins in 2026 and beyond,” Roku CEO Anthony Wood and COO and CFO Dan Jedda wrote in the quarterly shareholder letter.\n\n\tThe company said video advertising on the Roku platform grew faster year over year than the broader U.S. streaming and digital ad markets. “By expanding integrations with third‑party demand‑side platforms (DSPs)” — such as through its recent pact with Amazon — we are increasing ad demand and meeting enterprise and other clients where they choose to transact,” the execs said. \n\t\n\n\tFor Q4, Roku expects total net revenue of approximately $1.35 billion, which would represent 12% growth. Within that, Platform revenue is projected to grow 15% year-over-year with an estimated gross margin of approximately 52%. Excluding political advertising and Roku’s acquisition of Frndly TV, the Q4 Platform revenue growth rate is expected to “step up slightly” from Q3. Roku projects Q4 gross profit of approximately $575 million and adjusted EBITDA of roughly $145 million.\n\n\tFor the full year 2025, Roku raised its outlook for Platform revenue to $4.11 billion and adjusted EBITDA to $395 million (versus previous guidance of Platform revenue of $4.075 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $375 million).\n\n\tDuring the quarter, Roku launched Howdy, a $2.99-per-month subscription video service with no ads that includes nearly 10,000 hours of TV shows and movies from Warner Bros., Lionsgate and other partners. It’s aimed at tucking in as a lower-cost alternative to subscription VOD services like Netflix or HBO Max.\n\n\t“We see a significant untapped opportunity for a low-cost, ad-free streaming service, and we are leveraging the power of our platform to drive cost-efficient sign-ups and engagement, similar to our success building The Roku Channel,” the execs wrote in the Q3 letter.\n\n\tThe company said the Roku Channel remained the No. 2 app on our platform by engagement in the U.S. (after YouTube). The Roku Channel expanded its lineup with new content from A&E, including a channel featuring “The First 48,” which was “one of our most successful new channel launches,” according to the company. The Roku Channel also launched channels for “Shark Tank” and “NYPD Blue,” and added “Law & Order,” which was the first FAST channel dedicated to a series in the Dick Wolf universe. \n\n\tAmong Roku originals, the company said “Solo Traveling With Tracee Ellis Ross,” which premiered in August, became its most‑watched unscripted original (and the show recently received a Critic’s Choice nomination and has been renewed for a second season).\n\n\tLast month, Roku announced the hiring of Lisa Holme as Roku Media’s head of content, overseeing the company’s slate of content businesses globally, including original programming, content acquisitions and partnerships, sports, branded content, and “This Old House” content and studios. Holme, , a veteran of Warner Bros. Discovery and Hulu, took over the role after David Eilenberg, Roku Media’s previous head of content, exited in June to rejoin ITV America.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe hymns are alive with the sound of music.\n\n\tMona Fastvold’s “The Testament of Ann Lee,” a historical drama starring Amanda Seyfried as the 18th-century religious leader who founded the Shakers, will compete in the musical or comedy categories at the upcoming Golden Globe Awards, Variety has learned exclusively.\n\n\t“The Testament of Ann Lee” has been hailed by critics and festivalgoers as Fastvold’s most ambitious work to date — a sweeping, musically infused portrait of faith, isolation and female empowerment. In addition to Seyfried, the ensemble cast includes Lewis Pullman, Thomasin McKenzie, Stacy Martin, Christopher Abbott and Tim Blake Nelson. The film’s tonal fusion of music, spirituality and emotional irony led the filmmakers, in collaboration with awards strategists, to position it in the Globes’ musical or comedy field — a thoughtful choice intended to highlight its unconventional musical sequences and themes.\n\t\n\n\tFastvold and her co-writer and co-producer Brady Corbet are coming off an impressive Oscar run with their previous collaboration, “The Brutalist,” which earned 10 Academy Award nominations and won three, including best actor for Adrien Brody, cinematography and original score. It also took home three Golden Globes for best motion picture (drama), director (for Corbet) and actor.\n\n\n\tReuniting with composer Daniel Blumberg, Fastvold worked closely with the experimental musician from preproduction through sound mixing to craft a soundscape rooted in original Shaker hymns. In addition, Searchlight Pictures has submitted two original songs — “Clothed by the Sun” and “John’s Running Song” — for awards consideration. Both tracks, penned and performed by Blumberg, capture the film’s haunting spiritual essence, blending minimalist instrumentation with choral harmonies inspired by authentic Shaker music traditions.\n\t\n\n\tSeyfried, 39, continues to solidify her standing as one of the industry’s most versatile performers. The Emmy, Golden Globe and SAG Award winner for Hulu’s “The Dropout,” and Oscar nominee for her role in David Fincher’s “Mank” (2020), delivers what many describe as a career-best performance as the titular visionary whose message of celibacy, equality and ecstatic worship defied 18th-century convention. Seyfried was honored on Monday at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival with the Vanguard Award for her stunning turn.\n\n\tA late entry into the awards race, “The Testament of Ann Lee” could boost Seyfried’s chances in one of the most competitive lead actress lineups in recent years. In the Globes’ musical or comedy lead actress category, she is expected to face off against powerhouse contenders Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked: For Good”), Chase Infiniti (“One Battle After Another”), Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”) and Emma Stone (“Bugonia”).\n\n\tIf Seyfried were to join Erivo and Hudson at in the Academy’s best actress lineup — both of whom are also in musical roles — it could mark a first in Oscar history. Last year, Erivo was nominated for best actress for the first installment, “Wicked,” alongside Karla Sofía Gascón for the Spanish-language musical “Emilia Pérez” marked the second occurrence in 60 years,  that two lead performances from musicals were nominated in the category. The first, for traditional musicals with non-diegetic music came during Hollywood’s 1960s musical renaissance, when Julie Andrews and Debbie Reynolds earned nominations for “Mary Poppins” and “The Unsinkable Molly Brown,” respectively, with Andrews taking home the prize.\n\n\tWith “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Fastvold revives that legacy — a haunting, hymn-filled meditation on faith and feminism that may soon find itself singing its way into awards history.\n\n\tThe film premiered in competition at the 82nd Venice International Film Festival on Sept. 1, where it competed for the Golden Lion. It was later acquired by Searchlight Pictures and is scheduled to open in limited release on Dec. 25.\n\n\tThe Golden Globe nominations will be revealed on Dec. 8.

YouTube/TikTok star Eugenia was riding the monorail with her mom and brother on Tuesday ... but, as you can see, she looks pretty glum as she stares out a window at \"The Most Magical Place on Earth.\" An eyewitness tells us she and her family didn't say one word to each other during the entire ride.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Her clothes, though, screamed high fashion.

Her sudden break from social media had some fans thinking the worst.\n      \n    \n          You may recall ... Eugenia confirmed she had an eating disorder in 2019, followed by her claims that friends put her on a psychiatric hold because of her medical condition, which made her feel betrayed by those close to her.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    TikTok / @eugeniaxxcooney\n          \n    \n          The Greenwich Police Department in Connecticut tells TMZ there was an uptick in calls regarding Eugenia's health over the summer  -- coinciding with her pause on social media -- but it's been about 2 months since the last call.\n      \n    \n          Police say they have Eugenia's number, so they check in on her whenever they hear from a concerned party. If they don't get her by phone, they will visit her house. But the cops tell us there's only so much they can do if the person doesn't want their help.\n      \n      ",

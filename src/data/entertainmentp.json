    "body": "\n\tVanessa Redgrave will be honored with a lifetime achievement award from Italy’s Torino Film Festival, where the Oscar-winning British actress will present the world premiere of her latest film “The Estate.”\n\n\tDirected and written by her son Carlo Nero, “The Estate” is a suspense drama starring Redgrave and husband Franco Nero (“Django”). It’s the tale of the Wellsleys, an aristocratic family desperate to save their ancestral property due to insurmountable debts. \n\t\n\n\tHailing from an illustrious family of actors, Redgrave’s first lead in “Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment” (1966), by Karel Reisz, won her best actress at Cannes and scored BAFTA and Oscar nominations. She returned to Cannes in the following year as Jane, the mysterious woman in the park in “Blow Up” by Michelangelo Antonioni.\n\n\n\tMore Oscar nominations followed: in 1969 for her performance as Isadora Duncan in “Isadora” by Reisz, which again won her best actress at Cannes, and in 1972 for Charles Jarrott’s “Mary, Queen of Scots,” which won her a special David at Italy’s David di Donatello Awards. Her performance in Fred Zinnemann’s “Julia” (1978) won her an Oscar, and she scored further nominations for James Ivory’s “The Bostonians” (1985) and “Howards End” (1993). In 1994, she received the Volpi Cup in Venice for “Little Odessa” by James Gray.\n\n\t“When you are nominated for an Oscar six times, you’re no longer just one of the world’s greatest actresses: you become a legend,” said Torino artistic director Giulio Base in a statement. He went on to note that “Vanessa Redgrave is an icon of theater and cinema, but also a committed activist.”\n\t\n\n\t Torino’s 43nd edition is being held Nov. 21-29 in the Northern Italian city of Turin. The fest’s lineup will be announced on Nov. 7.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This review contains a plot detail from the Season 3 premiere of “The Diplomat,” now streaming on Netflix. There are no other spoilers about the rest of the season.\n\n\tSeason 3 of “The Diplomat” is the first installment of the Netflix political drama to come out since the 2024 presidential election, which means the series is now even more of an escapist fantasy than it already was. Watching Ambassador Kate Wyler (Keri Russell) stalk the halls of the United States embassy in London, earnestly working to satisfy Danish concerns over British oil drilling in the North Sea and gushing over bipartisan treaties as the key to domestic popularity, it’s hard not to think of Elon Musk’s minions laying waste to USAID or trade wars conducted via Truth Social. These pangs are only compounded by the cliffhanger that concluded Season 2, in which President William Rayburn (Michael McKean) suffered a fatal heart attack and elevated his vice president, Grace Penn (Allison Janney), to the top of the call sheet. If a female VP struggling to gauge how much distance to place between herself and her now-former boss while she attempts to fill his shoes gives you a sinking feeling, this season may be a tough sit. \n\t\n\n\tThe good news is that “The Diplomat,” still under the leadership of creator Debora Cahn, makes other changes that bring the series back to its core strengths. At just six episodes, and with a fast-paced plot unfolding in the immediate aftermath of an explosion that injured multiple major characters, Season 2 diverted its focus from the volatile marriage between Kate and her husband, Hal (Rufus Sewell), also a veteran of the foreign service. The accelerated momentum was helpful in stabilizing — or perhaps acclimating viewers to — the show’s mishmash of tones, which staple together motormouthed policy wonkery and combustible romantic chemistry. But Season 3 goes beyond extending the pre-existing story and meaningfully alters the status quo. Paradoxically, shaking up “The Diplomat” also returns the series to its roots: the tug-of-war between the aspirations of two ambitious people, both straining against the gender dynamics of monogamous heterosexual marriage.\n\t\n\n\tGrace’s sudden promotion creates many job openings in the new administration, chief among them her old gig. Hal spent the first two seasons of “The Diplomat” scheming, along with White House Chief of Staff Billie Appiah (Nana Mensah), to get Kate promoted to VP. To Hal’s mind, the plan was — along with moving to London — a mea culpa for subordinating his wife’s career to his own for many years, even though she’s a capable professional in her own right; to Kate, Hal’s maneuvering behind her back was her husband once again going rogue to serve his own agenda. The question of just how sincere Hal is in wanting Kate to take the lead for once is one of the animating tensions of “The Diplomat.” Which is why Grace offering the job to Hal over his better half is so good for the health of the show.\n\n\tThe idea that Hal’s Richard Holbrooke-esque résumé would land him in the line of succession is part of the series’ alternate reality, where the only skill that matters is wielding American influence abroad with an expert knowledge of protocol. (The entire season premiere is dedicated to the minutiae and optics of Grace’s swearing-in: where to stage the event, which Bible to use and who to administer the oath of office.) This institutionalist worldview, inherited from Cahn’s old workplace “The West Wing,” can grate in light of recent events; a casual mention of the Jared Kushner-negotiated Abraham Accords of the first Trump administration raised my eyebrows given ensuing developments in the Israel-Palestine conflict. It’s also less tenable with Hal working out of the White House, an office with a much broader portfolio than that of a diplomatic mission — including domestic issues “The Diplomat” still largely avoids.\n\n\tRegardless, there are real benefits to Hal’s new workplace. One is simply expanding the world of the show, which has added a production outpost in New York (where Russell and Cahn both live) that enables setpieces like a “Succession”-esque interlude at Grace’s Hamptons retreat. Mensah, once confined largely to Zoom, FaceTime and phone calls as her character patched in from D.C., gets to join the ensemble in earnest as she spars with the Wylers face-to-face. Both she and the new environs are breaths of fresh air.\n\t\n\n\tThe shock to Hal and Kate’s equilibrium, already unsteady to begin with, is even more rewarding. For two seasons, Hal tried and mostly failed to occupy the role of “ambassador’s wife,” as he introduces himself to Grace’s husband Todd (Bradley Whitford). (With Whitford joining Janney and Cahn in the “West Wing” reunion, one wonders if Richard Schiff is waiting in the wings for Season 4.) Now, he’s once again in the higher-profile position, a shift Kate tries to spin as “all upside” — he can negotiate a bigger role for her! she can get a meeting with any foreign dignitary she wants! — before admitting how she really feels. When asked if playing second fiddle is what she actually wants, Kate sighs: “Apparently. It’s what I keep choosing.” \n\n\tThe season’s second episode looks back on the early days of Hal and Kate’s relationship as they contemplate this major change. It is, to this critic’s mind, the finest chapter of “The Diplomat” to date, because it centers the unhappy power couple that is the show’s most singular creation. Sewell gives Hal a childlike quality for both good and for ill; he’s as sincerely enthusiastic as he is reflexively selfish and petulant. Russell, for her part, can match Sewell’s intensity without uttering a word, as in a scene where Kate silently unpins her hair while Hal spirals out over Grace’s VP offer. And with Grace and Todd, “The Diplomat” gives Kate and Hal a mutual foil, and perhaps a look into their future. Kate finds commonality with Todd as the spouse shut out of the room where it happens, but she doesn’t want to be him.\n\n\tUltimately, “The Diplomat” doesn’t have much to say about international relations, being too in love with surface pageantry and process to dive into the real power dynamics beneath. Rather, it’s a story about the messy intersection of love, work and the battle of the sexes, with a setting grand enough to heighten both the stakes and the eroticism. In Season 3, “The Diplomat” recommits to this core mission, a pivot that pays dividends.\n\n\t“The Diplomat” Season 3 is now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "description": "\n\tBritney Spears has issued a response after her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, made claims about her parenting in his new memoir, “You Thought You Knew",
    "body": "\n\tBritney Spears has issued a response after her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, made claims about her parenting in his new memoir, “You Thought You Knew.”\n\n\tAhead of the book’s Oct. 21 release, The New York Times published an excerpt from “You Thought You Knew,” in which Federline claims their kids woke up to Spears watching them sleep “with a knife in her hand.” In the penultimate chapter, he writes of her condition, “The clock is ticking, and we’re getting close to the 11th hour. Something bad is going to happen if things don’t change, and my biggest fear is that our sons will be left holding the pieces.”\n\t\n\n\tNow, Spears is telling her side of the story. In a post to Instagram on Wednesday, the Grammy winner wrote, “The constant gaslighting from [my] ex-husband is extremely hurtful and exhausting. I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys. Relationships with teenage boys is complex. I have felt demoralized by this situation and have always asked and almost begged for them to be a part of my life. Sadly, they have always witnessed the lack of respect shown by [their] own father for me. They need to take responsibility for themselves. With one son only seeing me for 45 min in the past 5 years and the other with only 4 visits in the past 5 years. I have pride too. From now on I will let them know when I am available.”\n\n\n\tShe added, directly attacking Federline’s book, “Trust me, those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I am the only one who genuinely gets hurt here. I will always love them and if you really know me, you won’t pay attention to the tabloids of my mental health and drinking. I am actually a pretty intelligent woman who has been trying to live a sacred and private life the past 5 years. I speak on this because I have had enough and any real woman would do the same.”\n\t\n\n\tFederline and Spears were married in 2004, and Spears filed for divorce two years later in 2006. They have two sons, a 19-year-old and a 20-year-old.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Tokyo International Film Festival has revealed that legendary Japanese actor Yoshinaga Sayuri will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the festival’s 38th edition, which runs Oct. 27-Nov. 5.\n\n\tThe accolade comes as Yoshinaga stars in “Climbing for Life,” this year’s TIFF opening film, in which she portrays the first woman to climb Mount Everest. The role marks her 124th screen appearance across a career spanning more than six decades.\n\t\n\n\tSince her film debut in 1959’s “Asa o yobu kuchibue,” Yoshinaga has remained at the forefront of Japanese cinema. She has won the Japan Academy Film Prize for best leading actress multiple times, including for “Ohan,” “Station to Heaven,” “Crane,” “A Chaos of Flowers,” “Nagasaki Bura Bura” and “Year One in the North.”\n\n\n\tHer work has earned recognition at the highest levels of Japanese society, with the government naming her a Person of Cultural Merit and bestowing the Medal with Purple Ribbon.\n\n\tYoshinaga served as both producer and star of “Cape Nostalgia,” which took home both the jury grand prix and the ecumenical jury prize at the Montreal World Film Festival. In recent years, she has tackled roles exploring war’s lingering effects and life’s dignity in films including “Nagasaki: Memories of My Son” and “Mom, Is That You?!”\n\n\t“Ms. Yoshinaga has risen to the pinnacle of Japanese cinema over many years, overcoming numerous challenges along the way,” said Ando Hiroyasu, 38th TIFF chair. “Her remarkable journey mirrors that of the indomitable female mountaineer she portrays in ‘Climbing for Life,’ who became the first woman ever to conquer Mount Everest. It is a great honor to present her with the Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition and appreciation of her outstanding contributions to cinema.”\n\t\n\n\tThe festival will take place across Tokyo’s Hibiya-Yurakucho-Marunouchi-Ginza area, with the TIFFCOM market running Oct. 29-31.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter a three-week wait, “South Park” is back with a new episode and a new season.\n\n\tIn an abrupt turn of events, the short-lived Season 27 has ended after just five episodes, instead of the previously determined 10, a spokesperson for Comedy Central confirmed. No details were provided as to why. Wednesday’s Season 28 premiere saw South Park Elementary enveloped in the “6-7” TikTok trend, and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel thinks the Antichrist is to blame.\n\t\n\n\tThe episode opens on a rally led by PC Principal, who is determined to get South Park Elementary back on track after catching wind of some “santaic numerology shit” going on.” To set things straight, he brings in a guest speaker to talk some sense into the student body: The “absolute expert on the end of days and the coming of the Antichrist,” Peter Thiel.\n\n\n\t“Hello, kids, I’m Peter Thiel, and I’m here to talk to you about the Antichrist,” he says. “Ok, so first, what is the Antichrist? The Antichrist is a newer, more human form of Satan that will soon walk the Earth. We don’t know how soon it will walk the Earth, but it could be within the next six to seven weeks.”\n\n\tThe South Park Elementary student body then explodes in unison, “6-7!”\n\n\tConfused, Thiel continues his impromptu TED Talk. He explains that Satan wasn’t able to have a child until Donald Trump came along, who has the perfect-sized manhood to fit inside Satan’s “pinhole” sized rectum. How big is Trump’s manhood? Thiel estimates it’s between “six and seven centimeters.”\n\n\tOnce again, his Gen Alpha audience shouts, “6-7!”\n\n\tNow frustrated, Thiel yells back at the kids, “The Antichrist is coming! The Bible refers to the eagle, which refers to America, the fourth seal broken, and hell coming to Earth. It’s right here in Revelations Six… Six-Seven.”\n\t\n\n\tDead set on putting an end to the seemingly demonic “6-7” craze, Thiel dives into the school data center with PC Principal and South Park Elementary’s counselor, Jesus Christ, to look for answers.\n\n\t“I’ve downloaded all the students’ information and loaded them into an AI face detection program so the school’s security cameras can watch their every move,” he says. “Now look. Two students passing each other in the hallway. They give each other the sign: six, seven. Exactly 67 seconds later, this odd parka-wearing child makes the same gesture. And then inside the girls’ bathroom, two girls doing the same thing!”\n\n\tA concerned Jesus stops him, “Wait, why is there a camera inside the girls’ bathroom?”\n\n\tThiel returns, “To stop the Antichrist!”\n\n\tAll the while, Thiel has been secretly working for JD Vance, who is determined to stop the Antichrist from being born so that he can take Trump’s place instead of the devil child. He tells Vance, while en route to a child he suspects is connected to the demon spawn, “I’m very close to finding the secret of the numbers. I’ve narrowed it down to one little boy who seems more possessed than the others.”\n\n\tThe child in question: Eric Cartman.\n\n\tAla “The Exorcist,” Thiel walks up to Cartman’s room to free him from the possession.\n\n\tThiel tells a giggling Cartman, “I came to see you in an Uber. You know how long it took me to get here? Around six or seven minutes.” Cartman starts laughing so hard that he projectile vomits all over Thiel. \n\n\tUnable to complete the exorcism, he tells Ms.Cartman that he must take her child to D.C., and that “everything we hold dear could end” if he doesn’t “unlock the secrets he holds.”\n\n\t“6-7” (pronounced “six seven”) is a viral lyric from the rap single “Doot Doot (6 7)” from American artist Skrilla. The phrase skyrocketed into the cultural zeitgeist through TikTok, proving especially popular with younger users. As demonstrated by “South Park,” “6-7” is often recited in tadum with a hand gesture popularized by a TikTok user named Maverick Trevillain, fittingly known as “The 67 Kid.” The phrase doesn’t appear to have any real meaning and functions more as an internet inside joke.\n\n\tThiel recently made headlines after the Washington Post published the contents of his invite-only, off-record lectures on religion and the tech industry. Across the four, roughly two-hour-long talks, the venture capitalist accused Greta Thunberg as well as all those who are critical of the rapid development of artificial intelligence of being “legionnaires of the Antichrist.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBuffalo 8 has picked up global rights to “Jujji,” a Pakistani crime thriller directed by Habib Shahzad from a screenplay by Ahmad Umar Ayaz.\n\n\tBHM Films produced the neo-noir pic in partnership with Yūgen Studios and Lollipop. Buffalo 8 has unveiled a trailer. \n\n\tThe film centers on a pair of detectives hunting a serial murderer in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Muhammad Arsalan plays the killer, with Mustafa Rizvi and Anjum Habibi starring as SI Naveed and Constable Arshad, respectively. The investigation forces both officers to confront their own moral compromises as the boundaries between justice and revenge begin to dissolve.\n\t\n\n\t“‘Jujji’ is not just a film – it’s a statement that Pakistani cinema can take risks and still resonate globally,” Shahzad said. “We wanted to capture the essence of Rawalpindi while making it universally human. It’s a deeply personal journey that became a collective one for our team – and we hope, for audiences everywhere.”\n\n\n\tThe project took two years to develop, originating as an independent effort to spotlight Rawalpindi’s stories internationally. “Jujji” won the top prize at the Gandhara Independent Film Festival 2024 and claimed best feature at the Punjab Police Film Festival 2024. The film also screened at the Divvy Film Festival 2024.\n\n\tNikki Stier Justice, Buffalo 8’s head of distribution, called the acquisition a significant pickup for the company. “From the first screening, Jujji stood out as a bold, genre-defying thriller that merges authentic South Asian storytelling with the universal appeal of true-crime cinema,” she said. “It’s the kind of film that challenges conventions while signaling the exciting global evolution of independent filmmaking.”\n\t\n\n\tBuffalo 8, based in Santa Monica, handles production, post-production, financing and distribution for independent films.\n\n\tYūgen Studios and BHM Films develop projects across film, theater and digital platforms, with a focus on South Asian narratives and emerging filmmakers.\n\n\tThe film launches on demand Nov. 21 in the U.S. and U.K. via Amazon and Verizon Fios/Vubiquity, with additional territories to be announced.\n\n\tWatch the trailer here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery and CJ ENM have revealed a sweeping multi-year partnership that will bring a pipeline of Korean drama and entertainment to HBO Max subscribers across Asia Pacific, marking one of the most significant collaborations between a Hollywood studio and a Korean content powerhouse.\n\n\tUnder the deal, HBO Max will become the streaming home for Tving — the CJ ENM-affiliated Korean streaming platform — in 17 markets across Asia Pacific, including Southeast Asia, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The partnership includes the launch of a dedicated Tving branded hub on HBO Max in early 2026, featuring exclusive premieres of new original K-dramas alongside hundreds of hours of scripted and unscripted content from CJ ENM and TVING’s library.\n\t\n\n\tAhead of the hub’s official launch, HBO Max will begin rolling out K-content titles starting in November, including the premiere of the highly anticipated drama “Dear X” on Nov. 6.\n\n\n\tThe two companies will also co-invest and co-produce original Korean drama for global distribution on HBO Max, creating a development pipeline designed to feed the growing international appetite for Korean storytelling.\n\n\t“We are honored to partner with CJ ENM, a true leader in creating universally popular stories that resonate worldwide,” said David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. “This collaboration marks a cornerstone of our commitment to great locally relevant stories in key markets around the world.”\n\n\tMiky Lee, vice chair of CJ Group, added: “K-content captivates audiences everywhere with its creativity and originality. At CJ ENM, our mission has always been to connect people through the power of storytelling. This partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery takes that mission to a new level, combining Warner Bros. Discovery’s storytelling legacy with CJ’s unique voice. Together, we will deliver authentic narratives that transcend borders on a platform where fans can discover new favorites, revisit timeless classics, and experience the best in global content.”\n\t\n\n\tThe deal represents a strategic bet on Korean content for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has been working to strengthen HBO Max’s position in competitive Asian markets. For CJ ENM, it offers a powerful distribution channel to expand the reach of its content library and its TVING platform beyond Korea.\n\n\t“HBO Max is the streaming destination for unique, premium storytelling so this partnership with CJ ENM, a leader in the enormously popular K-content genre, aligns perfectly with our strategy and brand,” said JB Perrette, CEO and president of global streaming and games at Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\tTving, founded in 2020, has rapidly emerged as a leader in Korea’s streaming landscape and is currently working on a merger with Wavve, another major Korean streaming service. As of August, Tving reported 7.56 million monthly active users, representing a 4.7% increase from May. The combined reach of Tving and Wavve approaches 10 million users.\n\n\tThe platform has built a reputation for acclaimed original series that have traveled well internationally. Tving’s “Death’s Game” ranks as one of the best K-dramas of 2024, while “Pyramid Game” was the only Korean content invited to Series Mania 2024, Europe’s largest TV series event. “Bargain” won best screenplay at the 2023 Cannes International Series Festival, becoming the first Korean streaming original series to win at the competition.\n\n\t“CJ ENM has spearheaded the industrialization and global expansion of K-content over the past 30 years, positioning itself as a global IP powerhouse,” said Pious Jung, CEO of CJ America and president of content, global business for CJ ENM. “Through our extensive partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery, we will strive for the sustainable growth of K-culture, which has now become a lifestyle for many across the globe.”\n\n\tFurther details on the Tving branded hub and content lineup will be revealed in the coming months.\n",

    "description": "\n\tGerman composer Volker Bertelmann was named Film Composer of the Year at the Ghent Film Festival’s prestigious World Soundtrack Awards on Wednesday ",
    "body": "\n\tGerman composer Volker Bertelmann was named Film Composer of the Year at the Ghent Film Festival’s prestigious World Soundtrack Awards on Wednesday for his work on Edward Berger’s “Conclave” and James Hawes’ “The Amateur.” This is the second time Bertelmann has won the award, having nabbed it just two years ago for his scores for “War Sailor,” “Memory of Water” and his Oscar-winning music for “All Quiet on the Western Front.”\n\t\n\n\tBertelmann couldn’t attend the ceremony but sent a video message thanking both Berger and Hawes for “giving me the chance to experiment.” “I recognize it’s so nice to have directors who let you do your thing when you can stretch the boundaries and experiment a bit more. It’s a collaborative process, but ultimately you have to find your voice.”\n\n\n\tBritish composer Daniel Blumberg, the recipient of this year’s best original score Oscar for his work on Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist,” won the Discovery of the Year award. Several other awards were also handed out at the ceremony, which was interspersed with a concert by the Brussels Philharmonic, conducted by Dirk Brossé. Theodore Shapiro won Television Composer of the Year for his work on “Severance,” and Clément Ducol, Camille and Jacques Audiard were others to repeat their Oscar feats by winning best original song for “El Mal” from “Emilia Pérez.” \n\n\n\tShapiro thanked “Severance” while accepting his award. “I want to thank working on a show that is so incredibly generous in the space that it allows for music to have a real voice and character on the show. Not every project gives music that kind of space, so I want to thank Ben Stiller for his vision of what language this show was going to be. I’m grateful to have him as a friend.”\n\t\n\n\tThis year marks a landmark 25th edition for the World Soundtrack Awards. The event originated from Belgium’s Film Fest Ghent, which cleverly realized it needed to set itself apart from similar film festivals in the 1980s. The festival’s focus on film music eventually settled into the World Soundtrack Awards and its parent organization, the World Soundtrack Academy, in 2001.\n\n\tThe anniversary begged for “unique celebrations,” with the WSA choosing to honor two “absolute legends of the game” in Philip Glass (“The Hours”) and Michael Nyman (“The Piano”). The duo received the Lifetime Achievement Awards and are being further honored at the festival with a special concert titled “Minimalism in Motion: Glass, Nyman and Beyond” on Thursday. Their music will be performed live alongside the work of contemporary minimalists Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch (“All Of Us Strangers”) and Martin Phipps (“Napoleon”).\n\n\tThe WSA also highlighted two guests of honor in Debbie Wiseman and A. R. Rahman. Wiseman is one of the most prolific British and television composers of her time, with work that includes “Tom & Viv” and “To Olivia and Wilde.” Meanwhile, Rahman is a two-time Oscar winner and is “arguably the biggest Indian composer for the screen working today.” He has numerous credits in Bollywood and won the Oscar for his work on Danny Boyle’s “Slumdog Millionaire.”\n\n\t“Bugonia” composer Jerskin Fendrix returned to Ghent after making history at the awards in 2024, becoming the first person ever to win both Film Composer of the Year and the Discovery of the Year Award for his work on Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Poor Things.” Speaking from the stage before his award-winning music was played live, Jerskin, who also scored Lanthimos’ “Kinds of Kindness,” said he is at a point where he has “no other choice” but to continue to collaborate with the Greek director.\n\n\t“I was writing songs before I started working with Yorgos,” he recalled of the beginning of their collaboration. “To a certain extent, songwriting can be very self-centered, and when you’re writing for something like ‘Poor Things,’ you have to wipe yourself off the desk. Through doing these scores with Yorgos, I think I gained a good amount of artistic empathy. It’s been really, really helpful. He’s really supportive. I feel very lucky, generally.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWorld Soundtrack Awards 2025, courtesy of WSA\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTo mark the 25th anniversary, the WSA released a triple album including: “Debbie Wiseman: Music for Film and Television,” featuring all-new studio recordings from the British composer behind “Edie” and “Tom and Viv”; “Craig Armstrong: Music For Film,” an expanded reissue of the first album launched by the festival back in 2007; and “World Soundtrack Awards – 25th Anniversary Celebration,” a limited-edition vinyl set bringing together over two decades of WSA history and featuring live recordings of memorable live and studio performances at the festival.\n\n\tFull list of winners below:\n\n\tFilm Composer of the Year:\n\n\tVolker Bertelmann – “Conclave,” “The Amateur”\n\n\tTelevision Composer of the Year:\n\n\tTheodore Shapiro – “Severance” (Season 2)\n\n\tBest Original Song:\n\n\t“El Mal” from “Emilia Pérez” – written by Clément Ducol, Camille and Jacques Audiard; performed by Zoe Saldaña, Karla Sofía Gascón\n\n\tDiscovery of the Year:\n\n\tDaniel Blumberg – “The Brutalist”\n\n\tPublic Choice Award:\n\n\tLaetitia Pansanel-Garric – “Hola Frida”\n\n\tGame Music Award:\n\n\tLorien Testard – “Clair Obscur: Expedition 33”\n\n\tBelgian Film Composer of the Year (Powered by Sabam):\n\n\tRuben De Gheselle – “Young Hearts,” “There Was, There Was Not”\n\n\tAward for the Best Original Composition by a Young Composer (Powered by Vienna Synchron Stage):\n\n\tBongseop Kim\n\n\tLifetime Achievement Award:\n\n\tPhilip Glass and Michael Nyman\n",

    "body": "\n\tBobby Deol is experiencing a remarkable career renaissance, celebrating three decades in the film industry with a string of acclaimed performances that have reshaped his standing in Bollywood.\n\n\tThe son of legendary actor Dharmendra and brother of star Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol made his debut as a leading man in 1995 with “Barsaat” and enjoyed early success before experiencing a career slump. However, the advent of streaming platforms has given the actor a second act, allowing him to explore complex, unconventional roles far removed from his earlier larger-than-life characters.\n\t\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety, Deol says the fan response remains extraordinary. “It’s kind of overwhelming when you get so much love and keep getting more and more love from the audiences. Thirty years, what better way to celebrate with especially with your fans, and to have such a big, successful web series: ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood.’”\n\n\n\tThe actor credits streaming platforms with fundamentally altering his career trajectory. “It all changed with OTT platforms for me, because that gave me my first chance to do something different,” he says. His Netflix film “Class of 83” (2020), a gritty police drama set in 1980s Mumbai, marked the beginning — but it was the Amazon MX Player series “Aashram,” in which he played a sinister godman, that truly changed perceptions. “It released one week later, and it just overshadowed ‘Class of 83’ completely. I still, till date, whenever I meet Prakash Ji [director Prakash Jha], I can’t come to terms with it, but it took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that what did he see in me to cast me as Baba Nirala.”\n\t\n\n\tThat role signaled to the industry that he was capable of far more than his initial career suggested. “That was the beginning of everything, because people started having belief and faith in me as an actor that, OK, Bobby doesn’t just have to be how I was in my beginning of my career. He can play different characters,” he says.\n\n\tDeol’s performance as a mute antagonist in Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s violent crime saga “Animal” (2023) proved pivotal to his resurgence and led directly to his collaboration with Anurag Kashyap on “Bandar” (Monkey in a Cage), a raw prison drama that premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September. After “Animal’s” release, Kashyap called Deol and spoke to him for 45 minutes, expressing admiration for his evolution as an actor. The validation from a filmmaker he’d long admired left Deol both thrilled and anxious.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Bandar” (Monkey in a Cage)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSaffron Magicworks Private Limited\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’d been wanting to work with Anurag since years,” Deol says, recalling their various encounters over the decades, from when Kashyap was still a writer visiting his home, to running into each other at their children’s martial arts events and at the gym. “As a director, I’ve always loved his work, and he always gets something different out of every actor he works with.”\n\n\tThe night before his first day of shooting on “Bandar,” sleep eluded him. “I’m like wondering to myself, ‘What have I done that has made Anurag want to work with me?'” At 3 a.m., he put on Netflix and watched “Animal” again, trying to understand what others saw in his performance. “I still couldn’t figure it out, because obviously, as actors, you can’t figure out certain times when things change in your life and what you’ve been waiting for — that moment — happens. It’s like, surreal. It’s like a dream.”\n\n\tAfter only an hour of sleep, Deol headed to set, where the experience proved transformative. “Working with Anurag was like being in a workshop. I always give myself completely to my director, and working with Anurag was like going to this acting coach, being with him and giving yourself up — no inhibitions, nothing. Just give yourself completely.”\n\n\tKashyap’s communication style made that vulnerability possible. “I think that’s because of the way he communicates with his actors. And I guess that’s the reason why people enjoyed my work in the film, because for me, it was totally out of my image, my everything.”\n\t\n\n\tThe process allowed him to learn more about himself. “Every time you’re working on a project, you kind of start understanding different aspects of your emotions,” he says. The film was completed in just 23 days.\n\n\t“Bandar” marked Deol’s first festival premiere at Toronto’s 50th anniversary, where he also represented his father for the festival’s golden jubilee celebration of “Sholay,” one of the greatest Indian films of all time. “I never imagined going to a film festival. I mean, never thought that a movie of mine will be premiered at a festival,” he says. “And what better way to celebrate — it was the 50th year of TIFF, and I also got the opportunity to represent my father for ‘Sholay’s 50 years. It was like being in India.”\n\n\tDeol’s decision to join Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan’s directorial debut — the Netflix series “The Ba***ds of Bollywood,” a behind-the-scenes drama exploring the underbelly of the Hindi-language film industry — stemmed from industry solidarity and parental empathy. “I’m a parent myself, and I’m from this industry, and I’d want anyone to be there to stand by me when my sons are getting into this industry,” he says. “I know that Shah Rukh is that kind of a person who would stand by me, or so many people I know in my industry, and I just felt that positive feeling and that emotion and when I got the call, I just said that I’m doing it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Ba***ds of Bollywood”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat began as support became something more substantial after a long meeting with Aryan Khan. “I sat with him for seven hours and heard the whole story because it’s seven episodes, and I just was taken in by his conviction, by his writing, by his thoughts, by his maturity,” he says. “Every time you talk to a director, I always believe you get scripts to read. But when you sit with them and you hear it from them narrating to you, you get a better idea of what they’re visualizing. So I think I just got lucky.”\n\n\tDeol praises Khan’s approach to the material. “The show, whatever it is, it’s all because of Aryan. I think that child has done a great job. So mature, his conviction, his instincts, his fearlessness, and to give something which is so different yet so connecting. It’s about things you’ve seen, but at the same time it is so differently approached.”\n\t\n\n\tThe series’ success, he argues, stems from its comprehensive storytelling. “I think every character in the show is something you’ll remember, not just one person. That happens very rarely. It only when the writing is good and when the direction is good that every actor tries to work hard. But it can only be seen if the captain of the ship can bring it out.”\n\n\tThe series explores Bollywood myths and realities in a very insider way. “I think it’s just making fun of yourself in a way, it’s just being absolutely open,” he says. “It’s a fiction, end of the day. So how do you entertain people? You bring out elements, you show elements, so people discuss them and get excited about it. As it is, ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’ is a show based on all the myths of the Bollywood industry. Because stories can’t be written if there’s no truth behind it. But most of the stories which are created for cinema or for OTT platforms, they have to be fictionalized, because you got to make it more juicier and more interesting.”\n\n\tAsked whether being born into the industry but experiencing career setbacks gives him unique insight into how Bollywood treats talent, Deol offers a measured perspective. “I think it works for any kind of industry, for any profession. Being an insider was my luck, because I was born in this family. I never asked to be born in this house.” His father, he notes, was an outsider who struggled for years before his first break.\n\n\t“Definitely being an insider, I have experienced ups and downs, and I’ve learned from that. So yes, I’m lucky to be Dharmendra’s son, and I’m just so proud about that,” he says. “But at the same time, it’s not easy for anybody. You can be an insider, an outsider. You have to work hard. The only thing that any parent would do for the child is spend their own money to launch you. They have worked so hard that they want the kids to live a very happy life, so they would spend every penny to make things for them. But after that, you have to make every penny worth it with your hard work.”\n\n\tHis journey from a strong start through difficult years to his current resurgence carries particular meaning because his aging parents have witnessed it. “I’m happy that I went through a great start and a bad middle, and now again, I have succeeded to a certain level. And I’m so proud that my parents have seen that, because my parents are growing old, and I wanted that to happen for them,” he says. \n\t\n\n\t“I’ve always felt that I could never live up to my dad’s expectations. I was always this little Bob, the youngest in the house, his golden child, because you end up being the youngest and you end up getting all that affection,” he adds.\n\n\tThe turning point came with his father’s validation. “The biggest compliment I ever got was from my father, like four, five years back, saying that ‘now you’ve understood yourself as an actor’ and ‘I’m very proud of you.’ I think that made me feel very happy, because that’s what I wanted to hear, and I’m really proud of that.”\n\n\tHaving lived through single-screen theaters, the multiplex wave, and now streaming, Deol remains format-agnostic. “I never think about which medium I’m going to be part of in that sense. For me, things have evolved because times are changing. You have to move with the times. So you have to do things according to how the times are moving. Because to exist, you have to be in sync with what’s happening.”\n\n\tStill, he waxes nostalgic about the communal experience of single-screen cinemas. “The magic of single screen is something else. I’ve grown up watching movies in single screens, and I’ve seen people going crazy. The atmosphere in a single screen is completely something you really, really become a part of when you’re sitting there in the theater.”\n\n\tNevertheless, he embraces evolution. “But then multiplex, it had to come, the time had to evolve, and then OTT platforms. I really am happy that OTT platforms exist, because it changed my life. And I think all of them can coexist. It’s just how the creators, they have to be honest with their work and try to do their best.”\n\n\tDeol also expresses nostalgia for earlier eras of filmmaking. “I always say that I wish I was born in the 30s so I could have been an actor in the 50s and enjoy the golden period and be a part of everything that was done for the first time, because there was so much honesty and sincerity and passion.” Though he hasn’t experienced it himself, he’s heard stories from his father about the kind of filmmakers and the honesty that pervaded that era.\n\n\tToday’s landscape is different. “But now people have changed. They’ve evolved. Everyone’s living a tough life because it is becoming tougher out there. So there’s no time to get entertained besides seeing things on your mobile phone or your laptop or sitting somewhere, waiting in a lounge. But I’m just glad that these 30 years I’ve actually had a great time and I’m just happy, and I’m so lucky that I’m doing what I love the most still.”\n\t\n\n\tLooking ahead, Deol has “Alpha” releasing Dec. 25, the latest installment in producer Aditya Chopra’s YRF Spy Universe, directed by Shiv Rawail, son of Rahul Rawail who directed his brother Sunny Deol’s first film “Betaab” (1983). “Rahul directed my brother’s first film. And now Shiv, his son is directing his first film, and I’m a part of it, so it makes it special.”\n\n\tWhile he occasionally contemplates directing, Deol admits it’s not his calling. “I think I wish I could direct. Sometimes, every actor thinks they want to direct, because as an actor, you start imagining and thinking how the story moves and how that character would react, and how that person would do things. But I’m not someone who can control people. I can’t multitask. So I wish I was a director, but I can’t be one.”\n\n\tHis focus now is on continuing to push boundaries. “I am just glad that my audiences have helped me. The love they’ve given me is giving me the opportunities now to do work which is out of my comfort zone, and just keep surprising myself and surprising the audiences with what I can do. That’s what I’m hoping for.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Royal Shakespeare Company has released production photos from its modern-dress “Macbeth,” marking Sam Heughan‘s first performance with the company and his return to theater after 10 years focused on screen work.\n\n\tThe images show a contemporary staging that reimagines Shakespeare’s tragedy in late-20th-century Scotland. Heughan appears in casual modern clothing — a white tank top with an open shirt and gold chain — while the set features a detailed bar environment with bottles, fluorescent tubes and intimate staging. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSam Heughan – “Macbeth”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelen Murray\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSeveral photos show dramatic moments, including scenes with visible stage blood that emphasize the play’s violent narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tConor McLeod – “Macbeth”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelen Murray\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDirector Daniel Raggett has relocated the story to 1990s Glasgow’s working-class neighborhoods, framing the power struggle through the lens of gang conflicts and family feuds. The design, captured in Helen Murray’s moody photographs, uses stark lighting and a stripped-down aesthetic that brings audiences close to the action in an in-the-round configuration.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLia Williams – “Macbeth”\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelen Murray\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRaggett previously helmed the RSC’s 2024 staging of Marlowe’s “Edward II” with Daniel Evans. For this production, he has drawn inspiration from Scottish filmmaker Peter Mullan’s work, Francis Ford Coppola’s “Godfather” films, and recent psychological horror cinema like Ari Aster’s “Hereditary.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSam Heughan – “Macbeth”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelen Murray\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLia Williams plays Lady Macbeth in what is otherwise an entirely Scottish cast spanning multiple generations. The company includes Alec Newman as Macduff, Nicholas Karimi as Banquo, and Alison Peebles, Eilidh Fisher and Irene Macdougall as the three witches.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIrene MacDougall, Eilidh Fisher, Alison Peebles – “Macbeth”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelen Murray\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHeughan has spent the past decade primarily in television and film, becoming widely known for playing Jamie Fraser on Starz’s “Outlander” alongside Caitriona Balfe. He trained at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and earned a 2003 Olivier nomination for most promising performer for David Greig’s “Outlaying Islands” at the Royal Court and Traverse Theatre. His stage credits also include “Crime & Punishment,” “The Seagull” and “Prometheus Bound.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLia Williams – “Macbeth”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelen Murray\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe production features design by Anna Reid, lighting by Ryan Day, and an original score by Tommy Reilly.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSam Heughan, Lia Williams – “Macbeth”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelen Murray\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Macbeth” runs through Dec. 6 at The Other Place in Stratford-upon-Avon. \n",

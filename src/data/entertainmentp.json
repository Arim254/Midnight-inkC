    "body": "\n\tWith an endearing black comedy set in the provinces, which adopts the visual style of a ’60s Western, prolific writer-director Teemu Nikki salutes his country’s (and his family’s) tradition of sahti-making. “100 Liters of Gold” follows two dysfunctional middle-aged sisters, third-generation makers of the strong farmhouse ale. In their village of Sysmä, sahti is a must to mark births, weddings and funerals, as well as almost everything in between. Touching on issues such as alcoholism and family trauma, but with a light touch, Finland’s international Oscar submission provides a breath of fresh air (albeit one redolent with alcohol) amongst the serious dramas in this category.\n\t\n\n\tPirkko (Elina Knihtilä) and Taina (Pirjo Lonka) live in a ramshackle house on what was once the family farm, but their main source of income comes from their tasty home brew — or it would, if they didn’t consume so much of it themselves. Then, there’s the friends and neighbors, even the local pastor (Vilma Melasniemi ), who continue to make off with full containers on credit.\n\n\n\tWhen their younger sister Päivi (Ria Kataja) commissions 100 liters of the golden liquid for her upcoming wedding, Pirkko and Taina promise to concoct a batch worthy of a perfect 10. But 22 days later, when it is ready, they once again get too tempted by their own brewhouse magic and by the time the wedding day nears, there’s no more sahti left.\n\n\tWith their reputation as top brewmakers to protect, as well as a feeling of guilt toward Päivi, who lost her lower leg after a car accident when they were all driving drunk, the gals set off with Pirkko’s would-be suitor, the chain-smoking milquetoast Hauki-Hikkanen (Ville Tiihonen) at the wheel. They are determined to get some decent sahti by hook or by crook.\n\t\n\n\tNikki spends a tad too much time on the escapades of their single-minded quest. He also includes multiple showdowns with their nasty, leering cousin Ponu-Paavo (Jari Pehkonen), who covets their business and the special wooden brewing trough (the kuurina) left to them by their grandfather.\n\n\tThe kuurina and other tools and tricks of the sahti trade are lovingly incorporated into the storyline, as Pirkko explains the brewing process to Päivi’s fiancé (Jakob Ohrman). Although there’s plenty of boozing in the film, the dangers of over-indulging are made very clear. There’s Päivi’s injury, which continues to haunt Taina; the client who dies before he can pay off his debt; Pirkko’s hospitalization for alcohol poisoning; and the women’s father (Pertti Sveholm), who now depends on Antabuse, but still likes his daughters to leave him samples of their latest batch.\n\n\tNo matter how cartoonish the action, the fine ensemble of actors plays it seriously, and you can see the intelligence shine from their eyes. Nikki maintains that he likes to cast before he writes, and with Knihtilä and Lonka, who work in theater as well as film and television, he has a starring pair who give it their all.\n\n\tNikki and cinematographer Jarmo Kiuru, another Sysmä native, shoot in a 1:2.39 widescreen ratio with a dusty, warm color palette. When Pirkko and Taina face off with Ponu, they could be rival outlaws staring each other down and refusing to give up ground.\n\n\tThe colorful costumes by Anna Vilppunen (“Tom of Finland,” “Sisu”) also continue the Western motif, while composer Marco Biscarini was a student of Ennio Morricone. All things considered, Nikki proves himself a native son of which Sysmä can be proud — much like Olavi Virta, the “king of Finnish tango,” whose music the film also celebrates.\n\n\tSo far, only Nikki’s previous Finnish Oscar entry, “Euthanizer” (2017) has been distributed Stateside. But with the pace and range of his work, as well as an upcoming English-language project, it shouldn’t be too long before American audiences get a chance to catch up.\n",

    "body": "\n\tElliot Grainge’s 10K Projects has been sued by Taz Taylor’s Internet Money, which claims that the company breached fiduciary and contractual obligations by withholding millions of dollars.\n\n\tThe suit, filed in Los Angeles Federal Court on Tuesday and reviewed by Variety, outlines a pattern of contract violations and misconduct regarding profit sharing, among other claims. It alleges that 10K knowingly cross-collateralized accounts and evaded paying Internet Money’s earned share of profits as part of its joint venture.\n\t\n\n\tInternet Money initially entered into the JV with 10K in Aug. 2019 to sign and develop artists with a 50/50 split of net profits. Following the contract execution, Taylor began releasing music outside of the scope of the deal that grew in popularity, leading to a 2020 negotiation for an amendment that extended the JV through June 2024.\n\n\n\tAccording to the suit, first reported by Billboard, 10K engaged in a “consistent and repeated pattern of violations and breaches of its obligations under the Agreement in numerous ways.” Per the agreement, 10K was required to get approval from Internet Money regarding all creative and business decisions, as well as any reallocations of A&R costs and marketing. Internet Money claims that 10K did not comply with the agreement, and “unilaterally incurred and charged tens of millions of dollars in deductions” without approval.\n\n\tMore specifically, Internet Money accuses 10K of “diluting” and “effectively giving away” profits from the 2020 hit “Lemonade,” a global smash that peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The suit claims that 10K gave a $500,000 advance to an unnamed artist, then renegotiated the agreement without Internet Money’s approval. It also alleges that 10K failed to execute a profit participation agreement with Taylor in respect to Iann Dior, and has impeded requests for an audit.\n\t\n\n\tGrainge, who became CEO of Atlantic Music Group in Oct. 2024, has spent years building his 10K business, which is now housed under Warner and counts Trippie Redd and Ice Spice as signees. A representative for 10K responded to Variety with no comment.\n\n\tInternet Money is seeking millions in damages on causes including breach of contract, accounting, fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent appearance on the “Hate to Break It to Ya” podcast, Raven-Symoné says she separates Bill Cosby‘s impact on the TV industry from his “horrific” sexual assault allegations.\n\n\t“Separate the creator from the creation,” she said. “And that’s just where I live. The creation changed America. Changed television.”\n\n\t“He’s also been accused of some horrific things,” Symoné added. “That does not excuse, but that’s his personal [life]. So personally, keep that there, and then business-wise, know what he did there as well. Like you said, both can live, and I think our culture is right to…don’t do wrong. Don’t do wrong personally. You just can’t do wrong.”\n\t\n\n\tSymoné appeared as Olivia Kendall alongside Cosby on “The Cosby Show” from 1989 until the show’s end in 1992. Cosby co-created the show in 1984 and starred as Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable. “The Cosby Show” earned six Emmy awards and ran for 197 episodes.\n\n\tCosby first faced sexual assault allegations back in 2004 from Andrea Constand, but it wasn’t until 2014 that the accusations became widely known. In 2014, Barbara Bowman, who testified in support of Constand’s civil suit against Cosby, penned an op-ed for The Washington Post titled, “Bill Cosby raped me. Why did it take 30 years for people to believe my story?”\n\n\tIn the years following, dozens more women came forward with their own allegations against Cosby. In 2016, he was ordered to stand trial by the Montgomery County Magisterial District Court for sexual assault. The trial began in June 2017 and ended in a mistrial after twelve days.\n\n\tCosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault and sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overturned the conviction in 2021 due to a previous agreement Cosby had with Montgomery County prosecutor Bruce Castor. The pair agreed Cosby could not be prosecuted if he provided a deposition in Constand’s civil case.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaylor Momsen was the latest guest on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and reminisced on the painstaking effort it took to quit The CW’s “Gossip Girl” during Season 4. Momsen, a child actor who had already appeared in major films such as “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” and “Spy Kids 2” before signing on to “Gossip Girl,” originated the role of Jenny Humphrey on the series. Jenny was one of the more divisive characters. Momsen wanted to quit the show in Season 4 to pursue her dreams of touring with her band, The Pretty Reckless. \n\t\n\n\t“I kind of just Irish-dipped. I just wasn’t on the script the next week,” Momsen said (via E! News). “They all knew I was making music. They all knew I had a band. I would play them stuff because I was working on the first record while I was on the show. I would come in and play songs… but I don’t think anyone knew how serious I was at that stage.”\n\n\n\t“It was an easy decision for me,” she continued. “To actually get [out of] a contract was not easy… it was a very long battle of me arguing [with] everyone and going, ‘Get me outta this. I can’t do this anymore. This is killing me. I have something else I want to do with my life, and it has nothing to do with this, and I can’t be stuck here anymore.'”\n\n\tDespite her pleas, Momsen said studio executives at Warner Bros. Television deemed her “ungrateful” for trying to get off a popular television series, adding: “You’re called all the things that come along with, ‘How dare you turn your back on something that’s been so successful for you.'”\n\n\t“I just went, ‘Fuck you. You don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re not in my shoes, so how dare you judge this?'” Momsen said. “I was very defensive, but it came down to they wouldn’t let me out of the contract. The head of Warner Bros. said, ‘Fuck Taylor Momsen. No fucking way.’”\n\t\n\n\tFortunately for Momsen, she had “Gossip Girl” showrunners Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz on her side. They agreed to write Jenny out of the show in Season 4, even though Momsen was still contracted for more time. This meant that Momsen could not act in other projects until her “Gossip Girl” contract was up, even if she was no longer being written into scripts. Luckily, Momsen had no intention of acting anyway as she pivoted full-time to her music career.\n\n\t“I really have to credit them for doing that for me because they did not have to, and they wrote me out of the show so I could go on tour and be in a band,” Momsen said, noting that she has no resentment towards “Gossip Girl” all these years later. She even reprised Jenny in the show’s 2012 series finale.\n\n\t“As a fan of television and a fan of the shows, I love when you have the full cast together again,” Momsen said. “You want to full-circle that and round it out.”\n\n\tWatch Momsen’s full interview on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeghan Markle is returning to the screen with a small cameo role in the feature “Close Personal Friends,” Variety has confirmed. Lily Collins, Jack Quaid, Brie Larson and Henry Golding are starring in the comedy that is currently shooting around Los Angeles.\n\n\tAlso appearing in the comedy are “SNL” alum Melissa Villaseñor, as well as Natasia Demetriou, Anna Konkle, Patti Harrison, Jack Shalloo and Dustin Demri-Burns.\n\n\n\tThe story reportedly revolves around a “regular” couple that meets a celebrity couple while on a trip to Santa Barbara.

Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger are producing. Orley, Aptaker and Berger previously worked together on Amazon MGM’s rom-com “I Want You Back.”\n\n\tMarkle starred in “Suits” for seven seasons and appeared in films like “Horrible Bosses” and “Remember Me” before marrying Prince Harry in 2018. She has not acted in over seven years, though her and Prince Harry’s banner Archewell Productions re-upped its first-look deal at Netflix back in August. Through the partnership, Markle has executive produced doc series like “Polo” and “Live to Lead,” plus Markle’s own lifestyle series “With Love, Meghan,” which bowed it second season over the summer.\n\n\t“It’s a new chapter, right?” Markle, 36, told Page Six when she gave up her gig on the USA network’s “Suits” to focus being the Duchess of Sussex. “I’ve ticked this box, and I feel very proud of the work I’ve done there, and now it’s time to work with [Harry] as a team.”\n\t\n\n\tIn 2020, the couple announced they were stepping back from royal duties and would split their time between Santa Barbara and the U.K.\n\n\tAmazon MGM had no comment. \n",

    "body": "\n\tGrX Studio, the production company behind crime thrillers “Copycat Killer” and “The Victims’ Game,” is showcasing its latest project at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF). “The Ones I Killed and The Ones Who Killed Me” is a psychological crime drama with plans for a U.S.-Taiwan co-production.\n\n\tThe series, adapted from Akira Higashiyama’s novel of the same name, follows a Taiwanese psychiatrist who becomes entangled in U.S. serial killings spanning three decades. Each body serves as a brutal message, forcing him to confront a past he desperately tried to forget.\n\t\n\n\t“The inspiration comes from the novel’s capture of the fragile beauty of childhood friendship and the painful contrast that comes with adulthood,” producer Lee Wen-yi and executive producer Tseng Han-hsien tell Variety. “That became the starting point for our adaptation.”\n\n\n\tThe narrative centers on two childhood friends, Jason and Morris, who grew up in dysfunctional families and vowed to become each other’s family. “They are twin flames — light and shadow, yin and yang — illuminating each other’s tragic lives,” the producers explain. “But one incident tears them apart, and their fates are reversed.”\n\n\tWhen the pair reunite as adults, they find themselves on opposite sides of morality: Jason works as a psychiatrist assisting police, while Morris has become a serial killer challenging society’s definition of sanity. “The mystery of the crime is no longer about who the killer is, but how evil comes into being,” the producers note. “Have we, in order to survive, ever killed the kindness in another’s soul? Perhaps the real culprit is society itself.”\n\t\n\n\tThe project represents GrX Studio’s continued exploration of the crime-thriller genre. “From ‘Copycat Killer’ to ‘The Victims’ Game,’ the GrX team has continued to explore and expand the possibilities of the crime-thriller genre,” the producers say. “With ‘The Ones I Killed and The Ones Who Killed Me,’ we aim to take that vision even further — deepening our psychological and moral inquiry while pushing creative boundaries.”\n\n\tThe series will begin with a murder in Los Angeles, unfolding through the perspective of a Taiwanese psychiatrist who has lived in the U.S. for years as he reflects on his childhood in Taiwan. Filming is planned for both the U.S. and Taiwan, with the team actively seeking international co-production partners at TCCF.\n\n\tThe project’s timing is deliberate. “The world has been changing rapidly in recent years,” the producers observe. “Across many countries, anti-immigration sentiments are rising, and people have begun to engage in deeper discussions about identity and immigration policies.” They note that original author Akira Higashiyama, who was born in Taiwan and later moved to Japan, brings a unique perspective on how different cultures shape identity.\n\n\t“At its creative core, the series explores the interdependent relationship between good and evil — like yin and yang — as a way to examine belonging and otherness,” the producers say. “The title itself suggests a mirror-like connection, just as the relationship between an investigator and a suspect in a crime thriller often reflects two sides of the same coin.”\n\n\tThe script is currently 80% complete, with the writing team aiming to finalize it by year’s end. Pre-production is slated for Q3 2026, with filming scheduled to commence in Q1 2027.\n\n\tThe creative team includes executive producer Hank Tseng, known for his global perspective and keen market insight in developing culturally rich, cross-border content. Producer Lee Wen-yi brings expertise in crafting narratives that explore human complexity and social structures. The writing team comprises John Cheng, who specializes in social realism and crime genres rooted in Taiwanese culture; Chen Cheng-yu, a senior screenwriter based in the U.S. with experience in American TV structure and writers’ room dynamics; Peng Huai-de, whose versatile storytelling balances emotional depth with entertainment value; and Cheng Wen-ting, who holds a master’s degree from NTUA’s Department of Radio and Television.\n\t\n\n\tGrX Studio encompasses film and television production, talent management, IP development, and business strategy, with a presence across the Asian market. \n",

Whereas chronicles of its ilk tend to simply perceive their subjects’ work at a distance, Klára Tasovská’s feature, about queer Czech photographer Libuše Jarcovjáková, conscripts her as a co-author by having her read from her journals throughout the 1970s and ‘80s. It also uses her photographs, not just as a source, but as a primary medium. The film is composed entirely of her decades-old snapshots, and credits her as cinematographer.  \n\t\n\n\tThe resultant photoroman (à la Chris Marker’s “La Jetée”) mimics movement through successive shots, and through the placement of each image on screen, while employing subtle foleys to create a soundscape of time and place. As Jarcovjáková travels from the former Czechoslovakia to Japan and West Berlin, navigating rejection and the lives of various lovers, the murmurs of voices, quiet footsteps and hums of crowded rooms accompany her striking black-and-white photography. Some images even expand and unfold, their hidden halves fading-in to reveal new layers and dimensions to the places and people she captured decades prior.\n\n\n\tWhile the movie’s English language title speaks to a constant state of confusion and contrition, its original name, “Ještě nejsem, kým chci být,” translates to the intriguing “I’m Not Yet Who I Want to Be” — note the “yet” — hinting at the film being a diary of not just self-image, but of personal and artistic process. Jarcovjáková, who has been dubbed the Nan Goldin of Czechoslovakia, captures stark and intimate images, revealing people through overexposed skin just as much as hiding them in shadow. Tasovská’s documentary is similar in this regard; it lines up just enough photographs and recollections to grant us access and insight, but not so much that we’re satiated all at once.\n\t\n\n\tJarcovjáková makes for a fascinating subject, especially as someone capturing her own emotional dissatisfaction through the contours of her body and face. However, owing to the nature of her photographs — slivers of time cemented in place, and never intended for motion — there’s only so long “I’m Not Everything I Want to Be” can go without feeling outstretched. While each of the images, individually, features the suggestion of motion (in some cases, ethereal strokes of light exposed at length), Jarcovjáková’s collection as a whole isn’t a narrative in nature, at least not in the way we might think of narratives in cinema. \n\n\tA gallery of Jarcovjáková’s work might gesture towards her larger story, meant to be pondered over at a leisurely pace. But Tasovská’s film charges forward breathlessly at breakneck speed. This isn’t a cardinal sin, but the approach presents a challenge for the movie to overcome, which it only manages to in moments of denouement. Its connective tissue, however, might lose the viewer along the way, as it coheres only into a distant political analysis of the world around its subject, seldom offering us enough time to get fully absorbed in the meaning of her imagery.\n\n\tState homophobia is a key concern in Jarcovjáková’s work, and she finds comfort through observation, highlighting life in all its hues, albeit behind closed doors. Tasovská mirrors this creative instinct in energetic ways, between using strobing effects to match the intoxicating chaos of Prague’s queer nightlife (accompanied by a modern, techno-infused tracks by DJ GÄP) and by introducing color in fleeting moments of liberation. Beyond a point, Jarcovjáková considers herself a perpetual outsider, more comfortable at the margins — whether as an outcast in her own country (and among its Romani populace), or as a guest in someone else’s.\n\n\tThe movie builds admirably to these moments, where the euphoria of fragile belonging is front and center. However, in the interim, one might become impatient for Tasovská to turn the next corner of Jarcovjáková’s story, leaving little room to ruminate, as a good photography exhibition would. The handshake of different artistic forms that the film attempts is commendable in spirit, and it often yields remarkable results, even if the whole is seldom satisfying.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKathy Hilton insists she’s not involved in any of the drama coming up in Season 15 of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.”\n\n\tEven so, she warns, “It’s pretty brutal.”\n\n\t“There’s no Kathy Hilton drama,” she continued. “I’m not really dramatic. All that drama makes me really sad. They’re all just very comfortable in saying whatever they want and that’s what makes it brutal.”\n\n\n\tI caught up with the Hilton matriarch Tuesday night at her home in Bel-Air, where she and daughter Nicky were hosting their annual Pajama Party. Presented by QVC, the soiree is a gifting suite of sorts – guests filled personalized Hulken Bags with various free health and beauty products, Oh My Mahjong sets and Slatkin + Co candles, while sipping Moët & Chandon champagne and enjoying “caviar bumps” courtesy of The Caviar Co placed on their top of their hands by the model-worthy waitstaff. \n\t\n\n\tThe event also served as a holiday toy drive as well as a benefit for the Los Angeles Mission, Yogi’s House and Camp Crocker Rescue.\n\n\tGuests were encouraged – and most obliged – to wear festive pajamas from Hilton’s Printfresh collection.\n\n\tEarlier Tuesday, the first trailer dropped for the new “RHOBH” season, featuring returning Housewife Denise Richards and newbie cast members stylist Rachel Zoe and businesswoman Amanda France.\n\n\tFull-time Housewives Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley, Kyle Richards, Bozoma St. John and Sutton Stracke are also back. Hilton and Jennifer Tilly welcome a new “friend” in the show, Natalie Swanston Fuller.\n\n\t“I had a couple of phone calls today from some of the girls [after they saw the trailer], let’s just put it that way,” Hilton said. “Some of them were like, ‘I can’t believe so-and-so did this.’”\n\t\n\n\tHilton said Zoe, who is also marking her return to Bravo after starring in her own reality show for the cabler, “came in and fit right in. … I don’t think she caused any drama.”\n\n\tNicky Hilton teased that she makes an appearance in the season finale: “The event was very dramatic, but me not included,” she said, smiling.\n\n\tKathy added, “It was bru-tal!”\n\n\tSpotted at the party were Frances and Zoe, Jennie Garth, Dylan Mulvaney, screenwriter Sam Lansky, Christine Chiu, Crystal Kung Minkoff, Faye Resnick, Heather Dubrow, Joely Fisher, Nancy Davis, Sutton Stracke, Tommy Hilfiger, Dee Ocleppo, producer Hilary Shor and Maria Bakalova.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHenry Tsai, the Golden Horse Award-winning screenwriter of “Winds of September,” is set to direct “Spent Bullets,” an adaptation of Terao Tetsuya’s acclaimed literary work, with the project selected for presentation at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF).\n\n\tThe film follows Silicon Valley engineers Wu Yi-Hsiang and Hsiao-Hua as they journey to Las Vegas to mourn their genius classmate Jie-Heng. During the highway trip, they must confront the intimacy, shame, and desire they once shared — a premise that explores the intersection of success, love, and human connection.\n\t\n\n\t“I was captivated by the plight of being a genius, and the subtle and hard-to-define erotic relationships in the stories,” Tsai said. “I was inspired to tell a story on screen that explores the correlation between success and love.”\n\n\n\tThe director emphasized the film’s emotional core: “Someone will love you for who you are, no matter if you’re successful or wealthy. You deserve that love, and you know how to give it as well as to receive it.”\n\n\tProduced by Jacqueline W. Liu through Taipei-based Each Other Films, which she co-founded with Tiffany Yu-Chia Chen, the project is eyeing a May 2026 start for principal photography in the U.S., with Taiwan shoots scheduled to follow in June. The team is actively seeking financing and co-producing partners at TCCF.\n\n\tEach Other Films’ recent slate includes the family drama “Little Big Women” (2020), comedy series “The Accidental Influencer” (2024), and romantic comedy “Penguin Girl” (2024).\n\n\tTsai has built a strong festival pedigree with his short films. “Love After Time” earned nominations at both the Golden Horse Awards and Sitges Film Festival, while “Live Stream from Yuki <3” was selected for Sundance, Sitges, and Munich Film Festival. His short “My Grandma” also received a Golden Horse nomination.\n\t\n\n\tThe source material comes from Terao Tetsuya, a Taiwanese former Google software engineer operating under a pseudonym who spent eight years at the tech giant before turning to writing. His works “Spent Bullets” and “Overfitting” have won several literature awards. “Spent Bullets” has already been translated into English and Korean. \n",

    "body": "\n\tNBCUniversal and Visa are teaming for an ambitious marketing partnership that will connect the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics with the Super Bowl though content produced by sports-centric creators Allison Kuch and Isaac Rochell, a former NFL player.\n\n\tThe pair, known as Allie and Isaac, will be flown this week by NBCUniversal to the Winter Games in northern Italy, as well as to Levi’s Stadium in northern California for the Super Bowl on Feb. 8. Kuch and Rochell, who are married, will produce content that is aimed to capture major moments of both events, as well as behind the scenes glimpses and personal stories of athletes going for the gold in Milan-Cortina and the Lombardi gold in Santa Clara. The effort with the popular creators is part of NBCUniversal’s effort to amp up its “Legendary February” promo campaign to viewers emphasizing that it has the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics in the same short month.\n\t\n\n\tThe content produced by the duo known as Allie and Isaac, who are married, will run almost entirely on social media and digital video platforms. It will be distributed not on NBCUniversal’s linear platforms by via the social and digital platforms of NBCUniversal and Visa and potentially other partners. The deal marks another evolution for television advertising as it is a marketing deal not tied to traditional metrics or time spans.\n\n\n\tRochell is a former NFL defensive end who retired after seven seasons in 2024. Allie began sharing their life together on social media – which expanded with a daughter, Scottie Bee, and the couple has another baby on the way. What began as Allie expressing her life as the spouse of. a professional athlete has evolved into a vocation that has put the couple on the radar for marketing and endorsement deals. The duo previously worked with NBC Sports at the Kentucky Derby in May.\n\t\n\n\t“it was an opportunity to really create some connective tissue across each of the moments and to tell different stories, but through the lens of a creator. That’s really where we think the perfect marriage is with Allie and Isaac coming together,” said Karen Kovacs, president of advertising sales and partnerships for NBCUniversal. “On behalf of the NBC they’re really bringing this narrative to their their community, and it’s exciting. The two of them really making that unique and authentic storytelling, combining culture and sports, their audience, that’s really an exciting opportunity for both visa and NBCU.”\n\n\tKuch and Rochell will have an all-access pass to two of the biggest sporting events in the world. They plan to bring their typical you-are-there POV on the events. Kuch is particularly interested in probing the human stories behind each high-achieving athlete.\n\n\t“I think what people connect with most is honesty. I’ve always shared the behind-the-scenes reality of life in sports and the emotions that com The Olympics are filled with those same layers,” Kuch said. “There’s so much heart behind every athlete and every family there. I’m excited to bring that same perspective to this setting and highlight the human side of the Games that viewers might not always get to see.”\n\n\tVisa is counting on Kuch’s touch on social media to amplify big moments at both events and to tap into the ever-growing creator economy.\n\n\t“We feel incredibly grateful to NBC for trusting us with something as meaningful as the Olympics. To be invited into a space like this as storytellers is really special, and we don’t take that lightly,” Kuch and Rochell said. “Opportunities like this remind us how powerful media can be in bringing people closer to moments they might not otherwise experience. We’re just excited to be a small part of that and to continue learning from a team that does this at such a high level.”\n\n\tKaren Kovacs notes that NBCUniversal in 2024 established a Creators Collective around the Paris Summer Games that yielded a tidal wave of content that added to the buzz around the Games.\n\n\t“We’ve been collaborating with these creators in their ecosystem for the last few years, and it’s really exciting to see it come to life in a bigger way in Milan. But we feel like you and I have been talking about some of also the non sports way this comes to life for us,” Kovacs said. “You know, we we really see the power of these creators across the whole universe. So whether it’s through entertainment or Bravo, it’s really influencing how we are developing programming, how we are going to market with with our partners.”\n\t\n\n\t(PIctured: Allison Kush and Isaac Rochell at the 2025 Kentucky Derby)\n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Group executives detailed their vision for expanding the Peanuts franchise during the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings call Thursday, revealing strategies to leverage the iconic IP across music, film and global distribution platforms.\n\n\tLin Tao, Sony’s chief financial officer and corporate executive officer, described the December acquisition of an 80% stake in Peanuts Worldwide as a cross-segment initiative spanning the company’s music and pictures divisions. The deal, which gives Sony control of what Tao called “one of the world’s leading evergreen IPs,” positions the conglomerate to pursue an integrated approach to growing the beloved franchise.\n\t\n\n\t“We aim to further grow the scale of the business and further increase the value of the brand over the long term by leveraging the strengths of the Sony group,” Tao said during the earnings presentation.\n\n\n\tThe entertainment giant plans to enhance Sony Music Entertainment Japan’s operations by integrating Peanuts characters and storylines into the company’s music, video and live event offerings. The strategy includes collaborations between Peanuts IP and SMEJ’s roster of artists and existing content properties.\n\n\tOn the film and television side, Sony Pictures Entertainment will deploy its production capabilities and global distribution network to broaden the franchise’s reach. “By utilizing SPS production capabilities and distribution network, we aim to make peanuts IP more accessible to a wider audience and share its charm with people all over the world,” Tao stated.\n\n\tTao emphasized that Sony will maintain close collaboration with the family of Charles M. Schulz, who created the Peanuts comic strip that first appeared in newspapers in 1950. The franchise has since grown into a global phenomenon encompassing television specials, consumer products, theme park attractions and digital content.\n\t\n\n\tThe acquisition saw Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) agree to purchase Canadian media company WildBrain’s 41% stake in Peanuts Holdings for CAD630 million, approximately $457 million. Combined with SMEJ’s existing 39% stake, the transaction brings Sony’s total ownership to 80%, while the Schulz family retains the remaining 20%.\n\n\tThe deal delivered an immediate financial boost to Sony’s bottom line. Because Sony Music Entertainment Japan already owned approximately 39% of Peanuts Holdings before acquiring WildBrain’s stake, accounting rules required the company to revalue its existing investment at current market prices. This revaluation generated a one-time gain of approximately JPY45 billion ($286.5 million), which Sony incorporated into its music segment operating income forecast. In simpler terms, Sony’s original stake in Peanuts had increased significantly in value, and the company must now officially recognize that appreciation on its books. The deal is expected to close during the current fiscal year, pending regulatory approvals.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscar winners Sean Baker and Michelle Yeoh have secretly teamed up for a new project, which will world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival later this month.\n\n\tIn collaboration with the London-based fashion house Self-Portrait, the “Anora” director returns to his iPhone-shooting roots for “Sandiwara,” described in a press release as an “immersive cinematic experience.” It’s the first film from Self-Portrait’s Residency program, which launched last year with the aim of inviting creatives “from all disciplines into the brand to design using their own distinctive style,” the release states. The initiative provides Self-Portrait’s “infrastructure, platforms, resources, teams and distribution network to spotlight and promote external creatives, offering them the freedom to dream and create.”\n\t\n\n\tStarring Yeoh as five different characters, “Sandiwara” is set in a Malaysian night market and “moves beyond fashion and into the world of cinema and storytelling to capture the heart of Malaysian culture,” according to its synopsis. “Each character tells their own unique story and represents a facet of Malaysian culture rarely explored.” The film gets its title from the Malay word for “drama, theatrical performance or play” and was shot in Penang. \n\n\n\tThe Berlin Film Festival will host a special screening of “Sandiwara” on Feb. 13, followed by a conversation between the director and actor. Baker will also be on hand at the Berlinale’s opening ceremony on Feb. 12 to present Yeoh with this year’s Honorary Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement.\n\n\tThe Berlin Film Festival runs from Feb. 12 to 22. \n\t\n\n\tSee a first look of Yeoh in “Sandiwara” below.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichelle Yeoh in Sean Baker’s “Sandiwara.”\n\t\n\n\n",

Gorgeously shot with a quiet, deliberate rhythm, it’s the kind of film that entrances its audience without them noticing. Only at the end does the audience fully grasp the magnitude of the story it chronicles and the natural beauty of the images they have been witnessing all along.”\n\n\tThe director of photography is Eva Kraljević and the editor is George Cragg, with additional editing by Catherine Rascon. The original score is by Draško Adzić. \n\n\tThe producers are Tutorov, Glomazić, Quentin Laurent and Rok Biček. It is executive produced by Megan Gelstein, Andrea Meditch, Bianca Oana, Jean Tsien and Petra Costa. The executive producers for Points North Institute are Sean Flynn, Ben Fowlie and Lucila Moctezuma, and Chandra Jessee and Rebecca Lichtenfeld for InMaat. The executive producers for Doc Society are Megha Agrawal Sood and Shanida Scotland. Meadow Fund also exec produces.\n\t\n\n\t“To Hold a Mountain” is a Wake Up Films Production in co-production with Les Films de l’Oeil Sauvage, Ardor Films and Cvinger Film.\n\n\tMFS’s current slate includes Ross McElwee’s “Remake,” which won the Golden Globe Impact Prize for Documentary at the Venice Film Festival, and Brydie O’Connor’s “Barbara Forever,” which recently premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, winning the Jonathan Oppenheim Editing Prize.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has tapped Francis Bourgeois, Thomas Holland and James Engelsman to helm the revamped “The Grand Tour,” which returns later this year with a fresh lineup two years after Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May concluded their run.\n\n\tThe six-episode series will see trainspotter-turned-petrolhead Bourgeois team up with the YouTube automotive duo behind Throttle House for a globe-spanning motoring adventure. The new installment promises challenges across diverse locations, from navigating the Angolan desert in track vehicles to immersing in Malaysia’s automotive scene and testing American performance cars in California.\n\t\n\n\tStudio Lambert produces the series, which aims to preserve the franchise’s DNA while ushering in a new chapter with younger talent.\n\n\n\t“The saying ‘big shoes to fill’ spring to mind. Well, in this case it’ll be like Mo Farah running in Size 14 wellies — it’ll be a little awkward at first, perhaps blister inducing but will overall be an interesting watch,” Bourgeois said.\n\n\tHolland brought his characteristic humor to the announcement: “When I first heard they were rebooting ‘The Grand Tour’ and replacing Clarkson Hammond and May, I said ‘only a moron would take that job.'”\n\n\tEngelsman noted the evolution of his partnership with Holland: “I’ve worked with Thomas for almost a decade making car films. Who knew that all this time, the one ingredient that was missing was a Francis Bourgeois? Let the car adventures commence.”\n\n\tTara Erer, head of U.K. and Northern Europe originals at Prime Video, emphasized the stakes involved in recasting the streamer’s most-watched unscripted U.K. original series globally.\n\t\n\n\t“Finding the right successors was no small feat – but we’ve absolutely struck gold,” Erer said. “We’re beyond excited to pass the keys to Thomas, James, and Francis, three standout talents who emerged from an extensive search. Each bringing distinctive talents and energy that will propel the series into exciting new territory while capturing the spirit of adventure and camaraderie of this beloved franchise.”\n\n\tOriginal executive producer Andy Wilman added: “We are properly happy to hand over the baton to Thomas, James and Francis, because quite simply – they are doing it right. Not only do they have passion and knowledge, but more importantly they are in no way cardboard cutouts of the old three. They have a delightful chemistry that’s all of their own making.”\n\n\tTim Harcourt, chief creative officer at Studio Lambert, said: “‘The Grand Tour’ has humor and a pure love of cars at its heart. It’s been a delight to find and film a brilliant new trio who take these values across the world from Angola and Malaysia to California and Didcot Parkway.”\n\n\tHolland and Engelsman have cultivated a substantial following through Throttle House, their YouTube channel boasting millions of subscribers and 75 million annual viewers. Canada-based Holland specializes in high-performance vehicles and works as an automotive journalist and amateur race car driver, while Engelsman brings an enthusiast’s perspective exemplified by his ownership of a Toyota Century limousine originally built for Japanese royalty.\n\n\tBourgeois commands a social media audience approaching six million followers, primarily through trainspotting content. However, the U.K. personality also holds credentials as a mechanical engineer with professional experience at Rolls-Royce. His technical expertise extends to identifying vehicle makes by engine sound alone.\n\n\tPhil Churchward, Tim Harcourt, Stephen Lambert, Alex Renton and Nia Yemoh serve as executive producers for Studio Lambert, with Hilary Berkshire and Diana Focke as production executives.\n\n\tThe new series launches globally across more than 240 countries and territories on Prime Video later this year.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe U.K. has underlined its status as a major global production hub, according to new figures from the British Film Institute. \n\n\tIn its annual investment report released Thursday, the BFI’s official statistics showed  that film and high-end television production expenditure in the U.K. reached £6.8 billion ($9.24 billion) in 2025, marking a 22% increase over 2024 figures and the third-highest annual spend on record.\n\n\n\tThe production boom was driven by feature film activity, which hit an all-time high of $3.8 billion — up a huge 31% year-over-year. Meanwhile, HETV production climbed 17% to $5.43 billion, the third-highest level since tax relief was introduced in 2013.\n\t\n\n\tInward investment films and HETV combined accounted for $7.88 billion, representing 85% of total U.K. production spend. Despite fewer total productions compared to recent years, overall expenditure increased substantially.\n\n\tOf the total $3.76 billion spent on 193 film productions in 2025, inward investment contributed $3.41 billion across 58 features – a 35% increase despite fewer projects than 2024’s 67. Local U.K. films accounted for $262.2 million from 96 productions, while co-production spend reached $92.3 million across 39 projects.\n\n\tMajor inward investment shoots included Emerald Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights” starring Margot Robbie, Sam Mendes’ four-film Beatles project with Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan, and “Avengers: Doomsday” from the Russo brothers with Chris Hemsworth, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr. Other high-profile productions included “Supergirl,” “The Christophers” and “The Thomas Crown Affair.”\n\t\n\n\tLocal productions included Georgia Oakley’s “Sense and Sensibility” with Daisy Edgar-Jones, Shane Meadows’ “Chork,” and Marc Evans’ Welsh-language “Effi o Blaenau.”\n\n\tDespite the launch of indie tax credit in 2024, investment on local projects made up just 7% of the overall film production spend.\n\n\tHETV production spend reached $5.48 billion across 168 shows that began principal photography in 2025. Inward investment accounted for 81% of HETV activity with $4.43 billion, while local shows contributed $934.82 million. Co-production spend hit $114.13 million – more than quadruple 2024’s figure and the highest since HETV tax relief was introduced.\n\n\tHigh-profile HETV shoots included “Slow Horses” seasons 7 and 8, “Vision Quest,” “Outlander: Blood of My Blood” season 2 and the first season of the “Harry Potter” series. Local productions included “Blue Lights” season 3, “A Woman of Substance” and “Silent Witness” season 29.\n\n\t“From ‘Wicked’ and ‘Hamnet’ to ‘Bridgerton’ and ‘Slow Horses’ — some of this year’s most successful films and high-end television were made in the U.K.,” said Culture Minister Ian Murray. “The economic bounceback of our film sector is fantastic to see, and is a testament to the talented workforce that exists across the country.”\n\n\tOn the exhibition front, the U.K. box office generated $1.35 billion in 2025, up 2% on 2024 but still 21% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Cinema admissions totaled 123.5 million, down 2% from the previous year and 30% behind 2019.\n\n\t“A Minecraft Movie” topped the U.K. and Republic of Ireland box office with $77.3 million, followed by U.K.-shot titles “Wicked: For Good” at $63.8 million and “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy” at $63 million. Other U.K.-produced films in the top 10 included “Jurassic World Rebirth” ($49 million), “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” ($35.8 million) and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” ($32.6 million).\n\n\tAmong U.K. independent releases, “The Roses” led with $13.9 million, followed by “We Live In Time” ($11.9 million), “The Salt Path” ($11 million), “I Swear” ($8.2 million) and “The Choral” ($5.7 million). The market share for U.K. independent films held steady at 6.8%, compared with 6.9% in 2024.\n\n\tBFI chief executive Ben Roberts noted that while audiences showed “strong appetite for cinemagoing,” the local industry “remains under pressure.”\n\t\n\n\t“Access to finance is an acute challenge,” Roberts said. “We continue to be focused on working closely with industry and government to further advocate for investment in skills, infrastructure, creativity and innovation across the U.K.”\n\n\tBritish Film Commission chief executive Adrian Wootton highlighted the figures as evidence of “steady as she goes” growth, crediting enhanced tax credits for film and VFX while noting the industry is “cementing and embedding a longer term, sustainable production ecosystem.”\n\n\tSeventeen of 2025’s top 20 films were sequels, franchise installments, remakes or video game adaptations, with only “The Housemaid,” “Sinners” and “F1 the Movie” falling outside those categories.\n",

    "body": "\n\tenGEN3, a participatory storytelling platform, has formed a strategic partnership with Web3 anime brand Oni Force to develop “Oni Hunter X” as one of the first story worlds built on enGEN3’s infrastructure for licensed fan co-creation, distribution and revenue sharing, the companies announced.\n\n\tThe partnership comes as enGEN3 joins the GK Labs ecosystem as one of its inaugural flagship projects, with GK Labs making an undisclosed seed investment into enGEN3’s current funding round.\n\t\n\n\t“Oni Hunter X” was originally created by IMCMPLX and incubated by the Oni Force community. The series, which stars Oni Force anti-hero Joji, has been brought to life by Eisner Award-winning writer Paul Jenkins, whose credits include Marvel’s “Inhumans,” “Wolverine: Origin” and “The Sentry,” a character he created who now appears in Marvel’s “Thunderbolts.” The series was first previewed at San Diego Comic-Con in 2023, with full release planned for 2026 as part of a larger multimedia initiative.\n\n\n\t“The future lies not with Artificial Intelligence alone, but with the Joint Intelligence of creator and AI combined,” Jenkins said. “enGEN3 moves us ever closer to an ethically sourced, powerful AI tool that supports creatives across disciplines, rather than appropriating their work without permission.”\n\n\tJordan Bayne, founder and CEO of The Squad and enGEN3, added: “‘Oni Hunter X’ is an incredible project. Oni Force and Paul Jenkins are the perfect creative partners to show what’s possible when a legendary IP architect works with infrastructure designed for fan participation. We are also delighted to join GK Labs and work closely with Henry as we launch enGEN3 publicly in Q1 and turn the $100-300 billion economic value that fan-driven and derivative creation generates today into a structured, monetizable layer of the creative economy.”\n\t\n\n\tHenry Finn, CEO of Oni Force, said: “The future of entertainment is going to be built on IP that can scale with its audience. enGEN3 gives ‘Oni Hunter X’ the infrastructure to do that properly, where fans can contribute to the world we’re building and share in the value they help create. That’s not how traditional studios work. That’s what makes this a game changer.”\n\n\tAs part of the collaboration, independent entertainment group Goldfinch and production company The Squad will support Oni Force in the development, packaging and production of “Oni Hunter X.”\n\n\tenGEN3, jointly owned by The Squad and Goldfinch, combines storytelling and creative tools with licensed fan participation. The platform has strengthened its advisory board with Finn, who joins from the Oni Force/GK Labs ecosystem, alongside Alanna LaForet, formerly in leadership roles at ConsenSys, Google and Condé Nast, and Mike Gamble, whose career spans SEGA, Microsoft, THQ and Epic Games, with credits on over 42 titles and current work with Bastion. HaZ Dulull, filmmaker behind “2036: Origin Unknown” and cinematics director for “Dune: Awakening,” also serves as an advisor.\n\n\tenGEN3 is currently onboarding an initial cohort of creators, IP owners and partners to launch its Creator Partner Programme in February, ahead of a wider platform rollout to early access users in March.\n",

    "body": "\n\tH264, a Montreal-based film distribution and international sales company, has acquired the international rights to “La Portraitiste,” the first narrative feature film written by Florence Longpré, and directed by Annie St-Pierre, her first narrative feature as a director.\n\n\tIt is a period dramedy with touches of magical realism, set in Montreal in 1962. It follows Françoise, who leads a stifling life, dictated by her husband Germain and sanctioned by her aunt Agathe. Françoise is a receptionist at the local police station, where her beloved cousin Gilles patrols, and is unexpectedly asked to sketch the composite of an assailant.\n\t\n\n\tThe experience rekindles her passion for drawing and suddenly reveals the contours of her telepathic gift. Françoise’s prophetic intuition draws her into an investigation alongside Sergeant Stevenson, where long-buried family secrets echo her own past.\n\n\n\tCarried by a burgeoning love and the discovery of her gift, Françoise comes to understand that every quest inevitably leads back to oneself.\n\n\tThe film is scheduled to begin shooting this spring, with a release planned for 2027.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Roger Frappier at Max Films, who said, “Working with Florence Longpré and Annie St-Pierre feels like having access to a true dream team. Florence brings an extraordinary intelligence and a rare sensitivity to character while Annie’s vision gives the story both depth and direction. Their collaboration gives me absolute confidence that this story will resonate deeply with audiences.”\n\n\tLongpré first came to public attention with “Like-Moi!” in the role of Gaby Gravel, and later made a strong impression with “Can You Hear Me?” (M’entends-tu?) and “Audrey’s Back” (Audrey est revenue), two critically acclaimed series, on which she also collaborated as a screenwriter. She is also the co-screenwriter of “Le temps des framboises,” a series recognized at several international festivals, including the Berlinale and the Seoul Drama Awards. \n\t\n\n\tIn 2025, Longpré unveiled “Empathy” (Empathie), a series she wrote and starred in. It won the Audience Award at Séries Mania prior to its broadcast on Canal+, with a second season in development. \n\n\t“La Portraitiste” marks Longpré’s first venture into cinema.\n\n\tSt-Pierre directed the documentaries “Fermières” and “Le plein potentiel,” the latter selected at SXSW in 2025. Her short film “Like the Ones I Used to Know” (Les grandes claques) premiered at Sundance and was shortlisted for the Academy Awards in 2021 in the live-action short film category.\n\n\tMontreal-based Max Films’ credits include “Borderline,” “The Grand Seduction,” “Maelström,” “Jesus of Montreal” and “The Decline of the American Empire.” Its slate also includes the English-language remake “The Grand Seduction” (dir. Don McKellar), “Two Lovers and a Bear” (dir. Kim Nguyen), “Hochelaga,” “Land of Souls” (dir. François Girard), and Jane Campion’s Oscar-winning “The Power of the Dog.” Most recently, Max Films produced “Tell Me Why These Things Are So Beautiful” by Lyne Charlebois.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Milan Cortina Winter Olympics will have special significance for Warner Bros. Discovery. Not only is the entertainment conglomerate the games’ official broadcaster in Europe, but HBO Max is the flagship streaming hub of the Feb. 6-22 snow and ice sports extravaganza just as its rollout in the region completes.\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery, which owns the Eurosport network, will be airing 865 hours of live Olympics games spread out over 15 venues. Their coverage includes 116 medal-worthy events in 16 sports, some of which, like ski mountaineering, will be making their Olympic debut.\n\t\n\n\tDuring the lead-up to the Feb. 6 opening ceremony — which will feature Mariah Carey singing in Italian, an Andrea Bocelli performance and a mix of Hollywood and Italian stars icons — “Heated Rivalry” breakouts Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie carried the Olympic torch. They are also expected to resurface during the games as part of the promotional push for the show — about a steamy romance between two rival hockey players — that is currently launching across Europe on HBO Max.\n\n\n\tBelow, Variety speaks to Warner Bros. Discovery Southern Europe chief Alessandro Araimo about how the Olympics play into the HBO Max rollout effort in Europe and why the fact that the Milan Cortina games are the most spread out in Olympic history will “create great beauty” for viewers.\n\t\n\t\tHow important are the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics as a driver for HBO Max’s European rollout?\t\n\n\tThe Olympics are certainly among the best premium content we can offer our HBO Max subscribers. So much so, that they are included in the HBO Max package — not in the sports package. So they are just like the major entertainment series and films we offer. For us, it’s key content — both from a subscriber acquisition perspective and a subscriber consumption perspective — on the platform. And also from a marketing, communication and brand association perspective between HBO Max and, of course, the five Olympic rings.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRegarding brand association, having “Heated Rivalry” stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie as official torchbearers was a buzzy marketing coup especially since “Heated Rivalry” will release on HBO Max in Italy on Feb. 13. Will they also resurface in some way during the actual games?\t\n\n\tI can’t comment on that at this time.\n\t\n\t\tHBO Max will provide cutting-edge immersive coverage through an integrated platform that allows users to watch up to four events simultaneously on a single screen. How will the Winter Olympics experience on HBO Max differ from the Eurosport channels that are also carried by DAZN?\t\n\n\tEurosport is de-facto HBO Max’s sports offering. It’s HBO’s sports brand for the entire Olympics coverage. The distinction is only based on technological features used to enjoy the content. But the content, in terms of editorial curation, is exactly the same in terms of the quality that the Eurosport brand guarantees.\n\t\n\t\tMarco Balich, who is producing the opening ceremony, has said it will be more somber than other recent Olympic openers, with less Hollywood stars and more focused on showcasing Italy. What’s your take on that? \t\n\n\tFrom my point of view, the branding — so to speak — of this year’s Milan and Cortina Olympics clearly nods to the “Made in Italy” theme. This is an aspect that must necessarily play a role, as always happens with these types of events, during the ceremony. I think it will be a beautiful ceremony. It will also feature a few surprises. One aspect that will be very interesting to see are the two Olympic Cauldrons lit [simultaneously] in Cortina and in Milan’s Parco Sempione park.\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of which, the Milan Cortina games are the most spread-out in Olympic history. How will this impact coverage?\t\n\n\tThere’s a remarkable logistical and production complexity involved. From a production standpoint, we’ve managed it with a multi-location presence in four key areas: Milan, Cortina, Bormio and Livigno. This wasn’t easy, because it required creating three studios that require perfect data connectivity between them. The technical staff will probably travel less than they usually would because their movements would be too long to manage and traveling by road is complicated by traffic. So yes, there is complexity. But in my opinion, this will create great beauty from a media standpoint. From the perspective of people watching the Olympics, I’d say this beauty is going to be unparalleled.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\tAraimo, above right, is pictured with Italian Olympic Committee chief Luciano Buonfiglio.\n",

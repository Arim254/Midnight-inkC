    "body": "\n\tSubtext, a new distribution company for independent film, is launching as this year’s edition of the Sundance Film Festival gets ready to kick off this week. The company is founded by industry veterans Danielle DiGiacomo, Brian Levy and Teddy Liouliakis. It will have offices in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\n\tThe company will be at Sundance, where it will be actively looking to acquire films. Subtext is also one of the producers behind “Closure,” directed by Michal Marczack, which will premiere in the World Cinema Documentary Competition.\n\t\n\n\tThe company says its mission is “to connect author-driven films with their audiences.” The goal is to use multi-platform U.S. distribution strategies to help the films have greater “cultural impact,” as well as create long-term value for both creators and investors. To that end, Subtext says it will forge partnerships spanning brands, music, publishing and fashion. Subtext’s slate will focus on distinctive, filmmaker-driven work. The films will receive bespoke release strategies, the founders said.\n\n\n\tThe first film produced under the banner was “Empire Skate,” directed by Josh Swade, a documentary examining the rise of Supreme and the streetwear brand’s influence on skate culture. It is produced in collaboration with Time Studios and ESPN. The film premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival and is now streaming on Disney+. Subtext will announce its growing slate of fiction and nonfiction films in more detail over the coming weeks.\n\n\tDiGiacomo is the former head of content at Utopia Media and previously was the senior VP of acquisitions and strategic partnerships at 1091/The Orchard. She will oversee distribution and content curation. Brian Levy, previously of Entertainment 360 and Pulse Films/VICE, will oversee production and content curation while continuing to manage a roster of writers, directors and filmmakers across film, television and documentary. Teddy Liouliakis, founder of cultural strategy and insights consultancy Why-Q, will oversee marketing and operations.\n\t\n\n\t“At Subtext, we believe great independent films deserve more than visibility — they deserve context, community and longevity,” said the founders in a joint statement. “Our goal is to build tailored distribution strategies that meet audiences where they are, while creating sustainable value for filmmakers and partners.”\n\n\t“Independent distribution doesn’t fail because audiences aren’t there — it fails when strategy isn’t aligned with culture,” said the founders. “Subtext exists to close that gap.”\n\n\tLevy and DiGiacomo share a long history of collaborations. Their work together includes the acclaimed documentary “Meet Me in the Bathroom,” produced by Levy and acquired and distributed by DiGiacomo during her tenure at Utopia, as well as “All These Sleepless Nights,” directed by Levy client Michal Marczak and acquired and distributed by DiGiacomo for The Orchard. Levy’s producing credits include “Coup!” and “Bad Man,” while DiGiacomo has built her reputation acquiring such acclaimed films as “Shiva Baby and “Holy Spider.”\n\n\tLiouliakis offers a background in data analytics, consumer insights and cultural strategy, which Subtext says it will use to craft campaigns across digital marketing, PR, and live activations. Why-Q has partnered with such brands as Apple, LVMH, Netflix, Nike and Universal.\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Sentimental Value” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeon\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Director Commentary (Updated Jan. 20, 2026): Paul Thomas Anderson and Ryan Coogler are your likely 1-2 punch here, but we can’t discount potential chaos. The potential surplus rule means second-choice votes matter more than you’d think. Chloé Zhao could make history again with “Hamnet,” and Del Toro (“Frankenstein”) remains beloved. That fifth spot is a bloodbath between Joachim Trier, Josh Safdie, and whoever has the most loyal fans inside the branch.\n\n\tThis also could present the second time in history the directing lineup is comprised of filmmakers from underrepresented communities. The first was in 2017, which coincidentally also included Guillermo Del Toro, who won the Oscar for “The Shape of Water.”\n\n\tThis year’s director race may be decided less by passion and more by mathematics.\n\n\tUnder the Academy’s preferential nomination system, voters rank their choices. Once ballots are cast, a “magic number” — the quota required to secure a nomination — is calculated. For most categories, that number is determined by dividing the total ballots by six and adding one. For the best picture category, it’s the total ballots divided by 11, plus one.\n\n\tHere’s where the surplus rule comes in.\n\n\tIf a contender receives significantly more votes than needed to hit that quota, those extra votes are not discarded. Instead, they are redistributed — at a reduced, fractional value — to the voter’s second choice (or third, if the second choice is already safe). In best picture, this redistribution is triggered when a film receives 10% more than the quota; in other categories, it’s triggered at 20%.\n\n\tThis is why Paul Thomas Anderson’s strength could quietly reshape the director lineup beneath him. If Anderson overwhelmingly clears the quota (which many think he might), his surplus votes could be redistributed across secondary choices — and those choices are not uniform. Some Anderson voters lean toward Josh Safdie, others toward Guillermo del Toro, Joachim Trier or Ryan Coogler.\n\n\tI have found that a “One Battle After Another” voter tends to be a “Marty Supreme” voter, but what is clear is that loving “One Battle” does not automatically translate to voting for Safdie. That fragmentation makes the director race unusually fluid and dangerously close.\n\n\n\tThe Directors Guild of America unveiled its nominees for the DGA Awards with recognition for: Paul Thomas Anderson (“One Battle After Another”), Ryan Coogler (“Sinners”), Guillermo Del Toro (“Frankenstein”), Joachim Trier (“Sentimental Value”) and Chloé Zhao (“Hamnet”).\n\n\tThe British Academy of Film and Television Arts longlist for best director includes Yorgos Lanthimos for “Bugonia,” Lynne Ramsay for “Die My Love,” Chloé Zhao for “Hamnet,” Kathryn Bigelow for “A House of Dynamite,” Josh Safdie for “Marty Supreme,” Paul Thomas Anderson for “One Battle After Another,” Hikari for “Rental Family,” Joachim Trier for “Sentimental Value,” Ryan Coogler for “Sinners” and Kaouther Ben Hania for “The Voice of Hind Rajab.” Six filmmakers will ultimately be nominated, but those won’t be known until Jan. 27, five days after the Oscar nominations are announced.\n\n\tAt the Critics Choice Awards, Anderson claimed the best director prize, prevailing over fellow nominees Coogler, del Toro, Safdie, Trier and Zhao.\n\n\tOfficial nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theatre and will be televised live on ABC in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Agata Grzybowska\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Atsushi Nishijima\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: CJ ENM\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Searchlight Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Directors\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tKaramo Brown, the resident culture expert on “Queer Eye,” pulled out of multiple cast interviews on Tuesday. According to his assistant, his absence was due to fears of bullying after feeling that he’s been “mentally and emotionally abused for years.”\n\n\tIn a statement, which Gayle King read live on air to the rest of the “Queer Eye” cast during a “CBS Mornings” segment meant to highlight the series’ upcoming 10th and final season, Brown said, “I hope everyone remembers the main theme I have tried to teach them over the past decade, which is to focus on and to protect their mental health/peace from people or a world who seek to destroy it, which is why I can’t be there today.”\n\t\n\n\tKing also referenced Brown’s assistant’s note about bullying. And on NBC, “Today” anchor Sheinelle Jones expanded on the note, saying the assistant wrote that “Karamo has felt mentally and emotionally abused for years, and he’s been advised by his therapist to protect himself and his peace by not attending.” \n\n\n\t“‘Surprised’ is a fair understatement,” said Antoni Porowski, the “Queer Eye” food expert, to King. “Our ‘Queer Eye’ family —we’ve been doing this for almost a decade, which is pretty wild to believe — and families are complicated. And we’re definitely not excluded from that. But I think two things can exist at the same time, and while that is definitely true, we’re also here to showcase these incredible heroes that we have and really honor the legacy of this past decade of our lives and all these wonderful heroes that we’ve had the blessing of getting to meet and to have conversations with.”\n\t\n\n\tJeremiah Brent, who joined “Queer Eye” as an interior designer in Season 9 following Bobby Berk’s exit, vouched for his co-stars’ character. “My experience in this group has been transformative. To see the way that they move through the world; the way that they have taught me so much about life and friendship and love. I have felt safe and supported by the people up here. I’ve loved every second of this thing, and I am so excited that we get to do this and share this next season, because the show really is just about highlighting the best of humanity. That’s really what it is, and nobody needs that more than this country.”\n\n\tKing pushed back slightly, saying, “That’s a constant theme in the show, but I don’t think we can negate how Karamo feels.” So when asked if anyone in the group had something to say directly to Brown, grooming expert Jonathan Van Ness said they’ve been “honored to learn from Karamo” that “we have to meet people where they’re at. He has taught people to center what they need, and I’m actually really proud of him. Center what you need. Do the things you need to do to take care of you. I’d be lying if I [said I] didn’t feel like that sometimes, so I think it’s really beautiful. I think we do need to center what’s best for us sometimes. My hat off to him for doing that today.”\n\n\tVariety has reached out to Netflix for comment on Brown and his assistant’s statements. \n",

    "body": "\n\tTwo-time WNBA all-star Angel Reese has joined the cast of “The Hunting Wives” Season 2.\n\n\tShe’ll play a character known as Trainer Barbie, which Netflix describes as a “co-starring role.”\n\n\tThe drama series, starring Brittany Snow and Malin Akerman, became a breakout hit for Netflix after it aired in July 2025. It follows Sophie (Snow), who moves from the East Coast to East Texas and joins the elite social circle of Margo (Akerman) known as the “Hunting Wives,” who conceal a dangerous web of secrets.\n\t\n\n\tPer the Season 2 logline: “Sophie and Margo are on the outs. But soon enough, old secrets and new foes force them back together. As they play their dangerous games the question arises. Are they the hunters or the hunted?”\n\n\n\t“The Hunting Wives” also stars Evan Jonigkeit, Katie Lowes, George Ferrier, Dermot Mulroney, Jaime Ray Newman and Chrissy Metz. Rounding out the cast are Jaime Ray Newman, Dermot Mulroney, Evan Jonigkeit, George Ferrier, Karen Rodriguez, Hunter Emery and Branton Box. Reese joins previously announced Season 2 newcomers John Stamos, Kim Matula, Alex FitzAlan, Dale Dickey and Cam Gigandet.\n\n\tReese’s character’s name, Trainer Barbie, appears to be a play on her basketball nicknames, Bayou Barbie and Chi Barbie. As the star player at LSU, she led the team to its first national championship and was named Most Outstanding Player. In 2024, she was drafted to the Chicago Sky, and she’s now a two-time WNBA all-star.\n\n\t“The Hunting Wives” Season 2 is currently in production. The series is created by Rebecca Cutter and based on the bestselling novel by May Cobb. The show is produced by Lionsgate Television and 3 Arts Entertainment, and Netflix acquired the first season before release from Starz.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCould uplifting comedy prove a new international force from Latin America? The selectors of this year’s Content America’s Copro Pitch six finalists certainly think so. \n\n\tThree projects – “Dr. Sex,” “José Piedra, a Guy With Bad Luck” and “Sexorcism”– weigh in as feel-good, second chance comedies/dramedies. Another, “Pioneers,” delivers a humor-laced real-life inspired chronicle.\n\n\n\tThe other two, almost inevitably, are crime dramas-thrillers. Many titles genre bend. “Sexorcismo” “flips the traditional single-mother narrative on its head, asking a simple but radical question: What happens when it’s the man whose life is upended by unexpected parenthood?” says producer Marlon Quintero. \n\t\n\n\tEqually, “Yellow Submarine” is a narco thriller whose wanna kingpins are run-of-the-mill people, blessed by an unexpected cocaine windfall. \n\n\tIn one other ways the Copro Pitch looks set to say a lot about contempo fiction. Most last decade producers proclaimed how big their budget was.  In Miami, those behind the Copro titles will explain how they can bring in their series at a effective cost per episode. “Dr. Sex,” a classic single comedy, is looking to save 30% on costs by shooting in Colombia, for example.\n\n\tCopro Pitch projects will be judged by a top-notch jury of Ben Odell (3Pas Studios), Cindy Teperman (Infinity Hill), Erik Barmack (Wild Sheep Content), Teresa Gonzalez (Conspiraçao), Robert Frank (Intaglio Films) and Albertina Marfil (NBC Universal Formats).  \n\n\tA closer look at the finalists:  \n\t\n\n\t“Dr. Sex,” \n\n\tMexico\n\n\tCreators: Juan Pablo Solano\n\n\tShowrunner: Noé Santillán-Lopez \n\n\tProduction Company:  Jaguar Bite Mexico\n\n\tEmiliano, a sex therapist records a video about his passion for helping people embrace their sexuality.

    "body": "\n\tL.A.-based international entertainment studio MFF & Co and Brazilian TV behemoth Globo, behind Oscar winner “I’m Still Here,” have attached U.S. writers Alexander Maggio, Jenny Lynn and Ted Sullivan to adapt three Globo’s telenovelas for North American audiences. \n\n\tThe MFF & C0, Globo joint venture will see the writers reimagining the originals in the English-language and in traditional U.S. multiple season formats, MFF & Co and Globo said when announcing their landmark joint venture in August. \n\t\n\n\tSet to be announced at a Globo showcase at Content Americas on Tuesday, the deals with Maggio, Lynn and Sullivan see three experienced writers who have worked on high-profile U.S. series taking on the challenge of how to channel the melodrama essence of Globo telenovelas into new narrative structures. \n\n\n\tMaggio, with a strong line in high-stakes political and procedural drama as a writer on “Homeland: Aftermath,” and writer and executive story editor on “Madam Secretary” and writer on “FBI,” MFF & Co and Globo note, is set for a North American makeover of “Empire” (2014-15), winner of a 2015 Intl. Emmy for best telenovela and the story of a heartbroken, power-obsessed millionaire battling to retain control of his jewellery empire.\n\n\tLynn (“Mayans M.C.,” “Marvel’s Iron Fist,” “Arrow”) will reversion “The Other Side of Paradise,” (“O Outro Lado do Paraíso” (2017-18), an international hit licensed to 85 countries. It turns on revenge, as a young woman, sectioned to a psychiatric ward by her mother-in-law, returns years later for payback. \n\t\n\n\tFor his part, Ted Sullivan, whose writing career takes in “Riverdale,” “Star Trek:Discovery,” “Pure Genius” and “Supergirl,” will adapt the epic “King of Cattle,” (1996-97), a story of across-the-tracks love set during WWII and then jumping to 1996, charting the decades long land-feud between two rival immigrant families. \n\n\t“This marks a pivotal moment for our projects and partnership with Globo. These accomplished writers are fully equipped to transform these audience-proven Brazilian stories into series that truly resonate with global audiences,” said Estela Renner, showrunner, director, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of MFF & CO. “Globo’s telenovelas have always captured the cultural pulse of the moment, reflecting the depth of human emotion. Our creative challenge is to preserve that emotional intensity while reimagining these narratives through a contemporary lens for North American viewers.”\n\n\tAdded Globo Head of International Business and Co-productions Angela Colla: “This next phase of our partnership with MFF & CO represents an important evolution in how we bring Globo’s stories to the world. Having such accomplished writers attached to these projects reinforces the strength, relevance and adaptability of our content. These are stories that have already proven their emotional power with millions of viewers, and we are confident they can resonate just as deeply when reimagined for new audiences.”\n\n\t“The attachment of these talented writers puts tested creative muscle behind the ambition of this slate. Each of them brings a distinctive auteurist voice and deep experience to this high-impact serialized storytelling,” said Miura Kite, president of global content at MFF & CO. “Their skill will leverage the DNA of Brazilian telenovelas into premium, multi-season series for the U.S. market. We’re building shows with rich emotional stakes, complex characters and addictive storylines designed to compete at the highest levels of global television.”\n\n\tAdditional standout titles on the slate include “Belíssima,” (2005-06), a huge hit on Globo from Silvio Abreu, punching a 48% audience, and the more recent “All the Flowers,” from and João Emanuel Carneiro creator of Globo’s biggest telenovela in modern times, “Brazil Avenue.”\n\t\n\n\tThe development of each telenovela adaptation will continue to be led by Kite, formerly EVP of global television at Participant.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNBC is once again opting not to take advantage of the massive Super Bowl lead-out to promote a new, returning or pre-existing entertainment program. Instead, just like the network did in 2022, it will instead go right back to coverage of the Winter Olympics.\n\n\tAfter the Vince Lombardi trophy is hoisted at the end of Super Bowl LX on Sunday, Feb. 8, NBC Sports will segue to the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics primetime show, “Primetime in Milan,” at approximately 10:45 p.m. ET — including the women’s downhill competition (which will include Lindsey Vonn going for the gold as part of her comeback) and team figure skating.\n\t\n\n\tWhen NBC decided to air the Winter Olympics after the Super Bowl in 2022, it disrupted a longstanding tradition among the TV networks of using the post-Big Game timeslot to boost an entertainment program. In 2018, for example, NBC used the lead-out to air the landmark “Super Bowl Sunday” episode of its hit drama “This Is Us” — featuring that infamous deadly crockpot. (Sorry, slow cooker. “Crock-Pot” is trademarked.) That episode averaged a whopping 27 million viewers, making it the drama’s most-watched episode. And in 2015 after the game, NBC aired the first half of a “The Blacklist” two-parter, attracting 25.7 million viewers.\n\n\n\tAnd just like in 2022, this year’s Super Bowl takes place right in the middle of the Winter Olympics (which will be held February 6 to February 22). At least this year, according to insiders, NBC did briefly mull putting an entertainment show behind the Super Bowl — options could have included a comedy like “St. Denis Medical” or a drama from the Dick Wolf world. But ultimately, given the hefty financial investment that NBCU has in the Olympics, it was decided to stick with nonstop sports on Feb. 8. \n\t\n\n\tThe premiums that advertisers will pay for an Olympics lead-out is clearly a factor. But also from a ratings standpoint, airing sports out of sports isn’t a bad strategy. In 2022, coverage of the Beijing Winter Olympics following the Super Bowl brought in 24 million viewers. \n\n\tJenny Storms, NBCUniversal’s chief marketing officer, entertainment and sports, says she believes the industry has moved on from “the legacy days where you’re using the one singular broadcast opportunity to then flow into something else. I think now, when you’re talking about a business that has multiple platforms and multiple ways to showcase content, I don’t think you have to be as reliant on a lead out.”\n\n\tEven though it doesn’t have a show premiering behind the Super Bowl, NBCU still has a series launch priority that day: Peacock’s “The ‘Burbs.” That’s because the new Keke Palmer starrer premieres the same day as the game, on Feb. 8, and Peacock is hoping to lure viewers to the show after they’ve had their fill of sports.\n\n\t“We’re taking advantage of that huge audience all day, in both Olympics in the morning and then in Super Bowl, that comes to Peacock,” Storms said. “And then we’re going to be able to use promotion throughout the entirety of the day to make sure that we’re really pushing people once the events are over, once you’re out of the Super Bowl, out of the Olympics, now you have that next watch.”\n\n\tStorms said NBCU will also utilize its Feb. 8 double-shot of the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics to promote the upcoming Season 2 of “Ted” (which premieres March 5), as well as NBC drama staples like the “Chicago” and “Law & Order” franchises, its batch of sitcoms, “The Voice: Battle of Champions” (which launches Feb. 23), upcoming Bravo fare and Peacock’s “House of Villains” Season 3. \n\n\tExpect to also see spots, logos and interstitials during the Super Bowl and the Winter Games referencing “NBC100,” the company’s year-long initiative marking its centennial.\n\n\tStill, there’s no better showcase to give a series a boost like airing it behind the Big Game. (That “This Is Us” Super Bowl episode, for example, remains an iconic touchpoint from that series’ run.) Before NBC’s move in 2022, the last time a network followed the Super Bowl with another sporting event had been in 1976, when CBS aired the Phoenix Open golf tournament after Super Bowl X. Later, the Super Bowl lead-out became a place where networks tried to launch new series (with varying degrees of success). Then the networks instead started programming special episodes of fan favorites like “Friends.”\n\t\n\n\tLast year, Fox aired the Season 3 premiere of Rob Lowe gamer “The Floor” (averaging 13.94 million) after Super Bowl LIX; in 2024, CBS ran “Tracker” (18.44 million) after Super Bowl LVII; and in 2023, Fox had the cooking competition “Next Level Chef” (15.66 million) after Super Bowl LVII. \n\n\tMeanwhile, up in Canada, the post-Super Bowl series lead-out tradition continues: Bell Media last week announced that the new crime drama “The Borderline” will launch following Super Bowl LX on broadcaster CTV and its sibling streamer Crave.\n\n\tNBC isn’t completely out of the strategy of scheduling shows for sampling behind major sports broadcasts. This past Sunday, NBC premiered its new Tracy Morgan comedy “The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins,’ which is set in the world of football, behind the NFL playoff game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears (which the Rams won in overtime, giving “Reggie Dinkins” a tremendous lead-in). And Variety has learned that NBC will also air a special episode of its new comedy “Stumble” on Feb. 20 at 10:30 p.m. ET immediately following that evening’s coverage of the Winter Olympics. (The network also just announced it will air a special edition of “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Feb. 6 after the Opening Ceremony.)\n\n\t“It’s one tactic,” Storms said of airing shows behind major events. “In today’s environment, you look at it as one lever… We’ve got enormous peaks in viewership coming to our platforms for almost three weeks in February. And it’s not just about a lead out, because we want to make sure we’re also defining that consumers make their choices the way they want to make them.”\n\n\tAnd with that, NBC is leaning into the tagline “Legendary February” to promote the fact that it will be airing the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics and the NBA All-Star Game all in the same month.\n\n\tThe pinnacle of the month, of course, is Feb. 8. Adding to the pomp and circumstance: NBC Sports’ Mike Tirico will call Super Bowl LX from Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., repping his first Super Bowl play-by-play assignment. And then, right after that, Tirico will host “Primetime in Milan” from the field at Levi’s Stadium. According to NBC Sports, that makes Tirico the first U.S. broadcaster to call the Super Bowl and host a Winter Games in the same year.\n\t\n\n\tNBC may have effectively ended its practice of airing series as Super Bowl lead-outs. That’s because under the new NFL Super Bowl rotation (a deal sealed in 2021), NBC/Peacock are now landing broadcast rights for the Super Bowl on the same cycle as the Winter Olympics every four years. That means the NBCU network and its streamer will continue to air both major sporting events at the same time through at least 2033.\n\n\t“This is one of the things that the entirety of Comcast and NBC Universal all participate and engage with,” Storms said. “That is the beauty of the Olympics, the Super Bowl and NBA All Star being in one month. All parts of the company are a part of this. There is absolutely just a palpable excitement throughout the entire organization around what we have ahead and such an incredible opportunity. Not just for the sports properties of ‘Legendary February,’ but more importantly, for all of the entertainment and pay 1 films and parks and Comcast. It’s a huge launch pad.”\n",

The Warner Bros. release could earn recognition across major categories including best picture, director and acting bids for Michael B.

If realized, it would become only the 10th film in Oscar history to achieve this feat and the first since “Network” (1976). Previous films accomplishing this include “The Godfather Part II” (1974), “Bonnie and Clyde” (1967), “Tom Jones” (1963), “Peyton Place” (1957), “On the Waterfront” (1954), “From Here to Eternity” (1953), “All About Eve” (1950) and “Mrs. Miniver” (1942).\n\n\tWarner Bros. stands to make its own history with a projected 34 total nominations, surpassing the studio’s previous record of 30 in 2004, when “Million Dollar Baby” won best picture.

    "body": "\n\tThe long-awaited conclusion to Max and Chloe’s story arrives March 26 on Xbox Series X|S and PC. “Life is Strange: Reunion” marks the first time both iconic characters serve as co-leads, offering alternating perspectives as they investigate a mysterious fire threatening Caledon University.\n\n\tDeveloped by Deck Nine Games, the finale picks up after the events of “Life is Strange: Double Exposure,” with Chloe’s return tied to Max’s timeline-shifting abilities. Max returns with her signature Rewind power — now evolved with new capabilities, including the ability to leap into Polaroid photographs and restart events from those captured moments. Meanwhile, Chloe has grown into her role as touring band manager for Drugstore Makeup, bringing her trademark Backtalk ability and unfiltered attitude to investigations where Max’s academic position limits her access.\n\t\n\n\tThe game honors the weight of player choices from the original, allowing players to define whether Chloe survived the storm in Arcadia Bay and the nature of their relationship — whether friends or lovers. Supporting characters from “Double Exposure,” including Moses, Safi, Amanda and Vinh, return to round out the mystery at Caledon University. Senior Brand Manager Andrew James, who worked on the “Life is Strange” comics before joining Square Enix, describes “Reunion” as a “full circle moment” that finally brings Max and Chloe’s saga to a definitive close.\n\n\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.\n\t\n\t\tNEW VENTURES\t\n\n\tSEGA, in partnership with Realm, has announced the release of “Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles,” a brand-new narrative podcast. The audio drama series will debut on Jan. 27. \n\t\n\n\tIn the podcast, the Sonic universe will come to life in audio for the first time. Inspired by detective radio dramas, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon and Charmy Bee of the Chaotix Detective Agency are tasked with solving their biggest mystery yet.\n\n\tThe official Sonic video game voice cast will reprise their roles for the series, including Roger Craig Smith as Sonic the Hedgehog, Keith Silverstein as Vector the Crocodile, Matthew Mercer as Espio the Chameleon and Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Charmy Bee. Others are set to appear throughout the season. \n\n\t“Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles is an exciting milestone for the Sonic franchise, allowing SEGA to expand the Sonic universe with a completely new medium,” said Ryan Hamlyn, Senior Director, SEGA Lore & Creative Strategy, in a statement. “We combined the appeal of a noir detective drama with Sonic’s fun and action-packed style, creating a fresh story that’s both true to the Sonic series and new to fans. Thanks to our collaboration with Realm, listeners can look forward to this immersive mystery adventure anywhere they get their podcasts.” \n\t\n\t\tPARTNERSHIPS\t\n\n\tWizards of the Coast, a division of Hasbro, Inc., has announced the launch of a special series of Fortnite islands inspired by the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, in collaboration with Chartis and Teravision Games.\n\n\tThe custom Fortnite Islands are built by Chartis and Teravision, using Epic’s UEFN toolset, and are designed as part of a “launch and learn” initiative to explore how D&D can connect with Fortnite players. The five new islands will include a PvP arena, a social hub, a platformer, a co-op boss fight, and the largest co-op roguelike in Fortnite history.\n\n\tPlayers can visit D&D locations in the Forgotten Realms including the Yawning Portal tavern, the Spine of the World mountains, Mount Hotenow, and more. The islands will also include the opportunity to battle D&D characters such as Klauth, the ancient red dragon and necromancer Valindra Shadowmantle.\n\n\t“We’re bringing the spirit of D&D homebrew to Fortnite – supporting creators, experimenting in new mediums, and learning how we can introduce D&D to new players,” said Nick Strann, Franchise Strategy Director for Dungeons & Dragons at Wizards of the Coast. “D&D already means so much to all those who have joined us at the table, and we hope that we can make it just as meaningful for millions of Fortnite fans. We very much look forward to hearing player feedback on these creator-made islands and using that feedback to shape future adventures wherever people love D&D.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAWARDS\t\n\n\t“Clair Obscur: Expedition 33” won game of the year at the 2026 New York Game Awards. The New York Videogame Critics Circle (NYVGCC) recognized the best games, actors, journalists and more during the awards on Sunday night. \n\n\tThe prestigious Knickerbocker Award for best games journalism was given to the YouTube channel People Make Games. “Ball x Pit” received the inaugural Excelsior Award for Best NY Game and The Pokémon Company was honored with the 2026 Andrew Yoon Legend Award.\n\n\tIn honor of the awards’ 15th anniversary, the NYVGCC was honored with a proclamation from the New York City Council and received special recognition from Nintendo of America President and COO Devon Pritchard and Head of Microsoft Gaming, Phil Spencer. A new song from Mega Ran also debuted at the show as a tribute to the anniversary. \n\n\tThe NYVGCC is a not-for-profit organization of 40 video game critics, writers, reports and bloggers.

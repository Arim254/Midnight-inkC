    "description": "\n\tBased on Candice Millard’s 2011 novel “Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President,” Netflix’s newest limited",
    "body": "\n\tBased on Candice Millard’s 2011 novel “Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President,” Netflix’s newest limited series, “Death by Lightning,” follows President James Garfield, the oft-forgotten 20th president of the United States, and the man who assassinated him, Charles Guiteau. Created by Mike Makowsky (“Bad Education”) and executive produced by the “Game of Thrones” duo David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the four-part series serves as a historical remembrance and an ominous omen.\n\t\n\n\t“Death by Lightning” opens in 1969 at the Army Medical Museum. Workers are startled when a jar tumbles out of a dusty box and rolls onto the ground. Upon analyzing it, they realize it’s the brain of Charles J. Guiteau (Matthew Macfadyen), and had been tucked away on a shelf for nearly a century. From there, the series rolls back to 1880. The audience meets Charles, who is completing yet another stint in jail, this time for false pretenses and evading arrest. A couple of states away in Ohio, Civil War veteran and Congressman James Garfield (Michael Shannon) is summoned from his family farm to Chicago for the Republican National Convention. \n\n\n\tThough Garfield is attending the RNC reluctantly to give a speech in support of his friend, Congressman James Blaine (Bradley Whitford), for the presidency, his rousing oration inadvertently earns him the nomination. Garfield’s wife, Crete (Betty Gilpin), doesn’t even learn he’s on the ballot until eager supporters begin showing up on her front lawn. As Garfield hesitantly moves forward with his campaign, he is forced to align with Chester Arthur (Nick Offerman), who unexpectedly becomes his running mate, and with the domineering but highly influential Senator Roscoe Conkling (Shea Whigham).\n\t\n\n\tFollowing Garfield’s ascension, Charles becomes increasingly fixated on Garfield. Abandoning his plans to start a newspaper, he begins a desperate scheme to be a part of the Garfield campaign and later, his administration. “Death by Lightning” showcases the lives of two men, both determined to make their mark on the world, but for very different reasons. The series follows Garfield as he cuts through red tape and bureaucracy to create a path for the voiceless — namely, formally enslaved Black Americans and immigrants — and Charles, who deludes himself into believing he played a vital role in getting Garfield and Arthur in the White House. The men’s lives fatally collide at a train station just three months after Garfield is sworn into office.\n\n\tDuring a calmer political moment, “Death by Lightning” may have been received differently. However, amid the current turmoil in all three branches of our government, the show echoes a tone of hopelessness. Just 100 years after the country’s founding, the highest office of the land was rife with corruption and greed. The stain of slavery and the horrors of the Civil War remained palpable, and many citizens clung on to what once was — including their racism and xenophobia — instead of looking ahead toward a more progressive future. One hundred forty-five years later, watching privileged men scream and rant while hoarding power, opportunities and food over others feels like the United States has remained stagnant. These struggles remain at the core of our republic, and we, as Americans, appear doomed to continue in this helpless cycle. \n\n\tEven so, for those who enjoy history, the series is beautifully acted and detailed. Yet, four episodes feel excessive, especially since so much time is spent with Charles. Macfadyen is diligent in his portrayal of an obviously unwell man, traumatized by his difficult childhood and never having received the proper care. Unfortunately, forcing the audience to linger in his mania adds very little to the story overall. Though viewers get glimpses of his past, including his lengthy stint in a sex cult and his sister Franny’s (Paula Malcomson) whispers about their upbringing, seeing those elements play out would’ve been more effective. Instead, watching Charles attempt to insert himself into the Garfield Administration by forging papers and sneaking into buildings feels repetitive and a bit dull. \n\t\n\n\tStill, while “Death by Lightning” isn’t the most riveting political drama, it is refreshing to see a depiction of a forgotten man who could have put our country on an alternative course. By centering Garfield, Makowsky, and director Matt Ross showcase a man committed to civil rights and determined to clean up the grit and rot within the government. Had he lived, America today might look wildly different.\n\n\t“Death by Lightning” is now streaming on Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDuring a recent appearance on the “Hate to Break It to Ya” podcast, Raven-Symoné says she separates Bill Cosby‘s impact on the TV industry from his “horrific” sexual assault allegations.\n\n\t“Separate the creator from the creation,” she said. “And that’s just where I live. The creation changed America. Changed television.”\n\n\t“He’s also been accused of some horrific things,” Symoné added. “That does not excuse, but that’s his personal [life]. So personally, keep that there, and then business-wise, know what he did there as well. Like you said, both can live, and I think our culture is right to…don’t do wrong. Don’t do wrong personally. You just can’t do wrong.”\n\t\n\n\tSymoné appeared as Olivia Kendall alongside Cosby on “The Cosby Show” from 1989 until the show’s end in 1992. Cosby co-created the show in 1984 and starred as Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable. “The Cosby Show” earned six Emmy awards and ran for 197 episodes.\n\n\tCosby first faced sexual assault allegations back in 2004 from Andrea Constand, but it wasn’t until 2014 that the accusations became widely known. In 2014, Barbara Bowman, who testified in support of Constand’s civil suit against Cosby, penned an op-ed for The Washington Post titled, “Bill Cosby raped me. Why did it take 30 years for people to believe my story?”\n\n\tIn the years following, dozens more women came forward with their own allegations against Cosby. In 2016, he was ordered to stand trial by the Montgomery County Magisterial District Court for sexual assault. The trial began in June 2017 and ended in a mistrial after twelve days.\n\n\tCosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault and sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overturned the conviction in 2021 due to a previous agreement Cosby had with Montgomery County prosecutor Bruce Castor. The pair agreed Cosby could not be prosecuted if he provided a deposition in Constand’s civil case.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMeghan Markle is returning to the screen with a small cameo role in the feature “Close Personal Friends,” Variety has confirmed. Lily Collins, Jack Quaid, Brie Larson and Henry Golding are starring in the comedy that is currently shooting around Los Angeles.\n\n\tAlso appearing in the comedy are “SNL” alum Melissa Villaseñor, as well as Natasia Demetriou, Anna Konkle, Patti Harrison, Jack Shalloo and Dustin Demri-Burns.\n\n\n\tThe story reportedly revolves around a “regular” couple that meets a celebrity couple while on a trip to Santa Barbara. When the two couples become friends, lines are crossed and things get awkward.\n\t\n\n\tJason Orley is directing from a screenplay by Isaac Aptaker, from a story on which they collaborated. Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger are producing. Orley, Aptaker and Berger previously worked together on Amazon MGM’s rom-com “I Want You Back.”\n\n\tMarkle starred in “Suits” for seven seasons and appeared in films like “Horrible Bosses” and “Remember Me” before marrying Prince Harry in 2018. She has not acted in over seven years, though her and Prince Harry’s banner Archewell Productions re-upped its first-look deal at Netflix back in August. Through the partnership, Markle has executive produced doc series like “Polo” and “Live to Lead,” plus Markle’s own lifestyle series “With Love, Meghan,” which bowed it second season over the summer.\n\n\t“It’s a new chapter, right?” Markle, 36, told Page Six when she gave up her gig on the USA network’s “Suits” to focus being the Duchess of Sussex. “I’ve ticked this box, and I feel very proud of the work I’ve done there, and now it’s time to work with [Harry] as a team.”\n\t\n\n\tIn 2020, the couple announced they were stepping back from royal duties and would split their time between Santa Barbara and the U.K.\n\n\tAmazon MGM had no comment. \n",

    "body": "\n\tGrX Studio, the production company behind crime thrillers “Copycat Killer” and “The Victims’ Game,” is showcasing its latest project at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest (TCCF). “The Ones I Killed and The Ones Who Killed Me” is a psychological crime drama with plans for a U.S.-Taiwan co-production.\n\n\tThe series, adapted from Akira Higashiyama’s novel of the same name, follows a Taiwanese psychiatrist who becomes entangled in U.S. serial killings spanning three decades. Each body serves as a brutal message, forcing him to confront a past he desperately tried to forget.\n\t\n\n\t“The inspiration comes from the novel’s capture of the fragile beauty of childhood friendship and the painful contrast that comes with adulthood,” producer Lee Wen-yi and executive producer Tseng Han-hsien tell Variety. “That became the starting point for our adaptation.”\n\n\n\tThe narrative centers on two childhood friends, Jason and Morris, who grew up in dysfunctional families and vowed to become each other’s family. “They are twin flames — light and shadow, yin and yang — illuminating each other’s tragic lives,” the producers explain. “But one incident tears them apart, and their fates are reversed.”\n\n\tWhen the pair reunite as adults, they find themselves on opposite sides of morality: Jason works as a psychiatrist assisting police, while Morris has become a serial killer challenging society’s definition of sanity. “The mystery of the crime is no longer about who the killer is, but how evil comes into being,” the producers note. “Have we, in order to survive, ever killed the kindness in another’s soul? Perhaps the real culprit is society itself.”\n\t\n\n\tThe project represents GrX Studio’s continued exploration of the crime-thriller genre. “From ‘Copycat Killer’ to ‘The Victims’ Game,’ the GrX team has continued to explore and expand the possibilities of the crime-thriller genre,” the producers say. “With ‘The Ones I Killed and The Ones Who Killed Me,’ we aim to take that vision even further — deepening our psychological and moral inquiry while pushing creative boundaries.”\n\n\tThe series will begin with a murder in Los Angeles, unfolding through the perspective of a Taiwanese psychiatrist who has lived in the U.S. for years as he reflects on his childhood in Taiwan. Filming is planned for both the U.S. and Taiwan, with the team actively seeking international co-production partners at TCCF.\n\n\tThe project’s timing is deliberate. “The world has been changing rapidly in recent years,” the producers observe. “Across many countries, anti-immigration sentiments are rising, and people have begun to engage in deeper discussions about identity and immigration policies.” They note that original author Akira Higashiyama, who was born in Taiwan and later moved to Japan, brings a unique perspective on how different cultures shape identity.\n\n\t“At its creative core, the series explores the interdependent relationship between good and evil — like yin and yang — as a way to examine belonging and otherness,” the producers say. “The title itself suggests a mirror-like connection, just as the relationship between an investigator and a suspect in a crime thriller often reflects two sides of the same coin.”\n\n\tThe script is currently 80% complete, with the writing team aiming to finalize it by year’s end. Pre-production is slated for Q3 2026, with filming scheduled to commence in Q1 2027.\n\n\tThe creative team includes executive producer Hank Tseng, known for his global perspective and keen market insight in developing culturally rich, cross-border content. Producer Lee Wen-yi brings expertise in crafting narratives that explore human complexity and social structures. The writing team comprises John Cheng, who specializes in social realism and crime genres rooted in Taiwanese culture; Chen Cheng-yu, a senior screenwriter based in the U.S. with experience in American TV structure and writers’ room dynamics; Peng Huai-de, whose versatile storytelling balances emotional depth with entertainment value; and Cheng Wen-ting, who holds a master’s degree from NTUA’s Department of Radio and Television.\n\t\n\n\tGrX Studio encompasses film and television production, talent management, IP development, and business strategy, with a presence across the Asian market. \n",

    "body": "\n\tKathy Hilton insists she’s not involved in any of the drama coming up in Season 15 of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.”\n\n\tEven so, she warns, “It’s pretty brutal.”\n\n\t“There’s no Kathy Hilton drama,” she continued. “I’m not really dramatic. All that drama makes me really sad. They’re all just very comfortable in saying whatever they want and that’s what makes it brutal.”\n\n\n\tI caught up with the Hilton matriarch Tuesday night at her home in Bel-Air, where she and daughter Nicky were hosting their annual Pajama Party. Presented by QVC, the soiree is a gifting suite of sorts – guests filled personalized Hulken Bags with various free health and beauty products, Oh My Mahjong sets and Slatkin + Co candles, while sipping Moët & Chandon champagne and enjoying “caviar bumps” courtesy of The Caviar Co placed on their top of their hands by the model-worthy waitstaff. \n\t\n\n\tThe event also served as a holiday toy drive as well as a benefit for the Los Angeles Mission, Yogi’s House and Camp Crocker Rescue.\n\n\tGuests were encouraged – and most obliged – to wear festive pajamas from Hilton’s Printfresh collection.\n\n\tEarlier Tuesday, the first trailer dropped for the new “RHOBH” season, featuring returning Housewife Denise Richards and newbie cast members stylist Rachel Zoe and businesswoman Amanda France.\n\n\tFull-time Housewives Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley, Kyle Richards, Bozoma St. John and Sutton Stracke are also back. Hilton and Jennifer Tilly welcome a new “friend” in the show, Natalie Swanston Fuller.\n\n\t“I had a couple of phone calls today from some of the girls [after they saw the trailer], let’s just put it that way,” Hilton said. “Some of them were like, ‘I can’t believe so-and-so did this.’”\n\t\n\n\tHilton said Zoe, who is also marking her return to Bravo after starring in her own reality show for the cabler, “came in and fit right in. … I don’t think she caused any drama.”\n\n\tNicky Hilton teased that she makes an appearance in the season finale: “The event was very dramatic, but me not included,” she said, smiling.\n\n\tKathy added, “It was bru-tal!”\n\n\tSpotted at the party were Frances and Zoe, Jennie Garth, Dylan Mulvaney, screenwriter Sam Lansky, Christine Chiu, Crystal Kung Minkoff, Faye Resnick, Heather Dubrow, Joely Fisher, Nancy Davis, Sutton Stracke, Tommy Hilfiger, Dee Ocleppo, producer Hilary Shor and Maria Bakalova.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tElliot Grainge’s 10K Projects has been sued by Taz Taylor’s Internet Money, which claims that the company breached fiduciary and contractual obligations by withholding millions of dollars.\n\n\tThe suit, filed in Los Angeles Federal Court on Tuesday and reviewed by Variety, outlines a pattern of contract violations and misconduct regarding profit sharing, among other claims. It alleges that 10K knowingly cross-collateralized accounts and evaded paying Internet Money’s earned share of profits as part of its joint venture.\n\t\n\n\tInternet Money initially entered into the JV with 10K in Aug. 2019 to sign and develop artists with a 50/50 split of net profits. Following the contract execution, Taylor began releasing music outside of the scope of the deal that grew in popularity, leading to a 2020 negotiation for an amendment that extended the JV through June 2024.\n\n\n\tAccording to the suit, first reported by Billboard, 10K engaged in a “consistent and repeated pattern of violations and breaches of its obligations under the Agreement in numerous ways.” Per the agreement, 10K was required to get approval from Internet Money regarding all creative and business decisions, as well as any reallocations of A&R costs and marketing. Internet Money claims that 10K did not comply with the agreement, and “unilaterally incurred and charged tens of millions of dollars in deductions” without approval.\n\n\tMore specifically, Internet Money accuses 10K of “diluting” and “effectively giving away” profits from the 2020 hit “Lemonade,” a global smash that peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The suit claims that 10K gave a $500,000 advance to an unnamed artist, then renegotiated the agreement without Internet Money’s approval. It also alleges that 10K failed to execute a profit participation agreement with Taylor in respect to Iann Dior, and has impeded requests for an audit.\n\t\n\n\tGrainge, who became CEO of Atlantic Music Group in Oct. 2024, has spent years building his 10K business, which is now housed under Warner and counts Trippie Redd and Ice Spice as signees. A representative for 10K responded to Variety with no comment.\n\n\tInternet Money is seeking millions in damages on causes including breach of contract, accounting, fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 38th Tokyo International Film Festival and its industry market TIFFCOM unfolded under clearer skies than last year’s typhoon-soaked edition, and the mood matched the weather. From Oct. 27 to Nov. 5, the festival filled venues across the Hibiya-Yurakucho district while TIFFCOM brought deal-making energy to Hamamatsucho, where 322 exhibiting companies descended on the Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Trade Center – a record that reflects Tokyo’s evolving identity from regional showcase to pan-Asian co-production hub.\n\t\n\n\tThis year’s edition revealed an industry at an inflection point. Japanese producers are flush with IP gold – anime alone hit $25.3 billion globally – yet grappling with structural barriers that make international collaboration maddeningly difficult. Meanwhile, a new generation of female producers took center stage to share how they’ve navigated an industry that, until recently, kept them firmly in supporting roles. And perhaps most tellingly, the entire event was tinged with anticipation of Japan’s 2026 spotlight as the Cannes Film Market’s Country of Honor, a coronation that arrives just as Korean and Chinese competitors are nipping at Japanese content’s heels.\n\n\n\tHere are seven themes that emerged from the festival and market.\n\t\n\t\tTIFFCOM Pivots From Sales Market to Co-Production Hub\t\n\n\tTIFFCOM 2025 hosted 322 exhibiting companies, up from 283 in 2024, with booths nearly sold out by early July as CEO Shiina Yasushi emphasized the market’s transformation from a purely sales-driven event into a co-production and financing hub. The market is increasingly recognized as a comprehensive platform bringing together film, television, animation and IP business under one roof, with diversity of Japanese content and Tokyo’s cultural energy cited as major strengths. The Tokyo Gap-Financing Market selected 23 projects including multiple Japan co-productions spanning Korea (manga adaptation), Taiwan, and Spain, marking increased international collaboration.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJapanese IP Adaptation Frenzy Reaches Global Studios – But Faces Regional Competition\t\n\n\tSony Pictures International Productions’ Shebnem Askin revealed at TIFFCOM that the studio is actively seeking live-action remakes of Japanese anime properties, taking “so many great meetings” with companies producing anime stories as one of her key missions at the market. TIFFCOM rebranded its Tokyo Story Market as Tokyo IP Market: Adaptation & Remake, expanding from adaptation rights specialists to include production companies holding remake rights, with six major participants including Kadokawa, Kodansha, Square Enix, and Toei. Examples cited include China’s “Yolo” remake grossing approximately $480 million and Netflix’s live-action “One Piece” series demonstrating explosive global demand.\n\n\tThe appetite is driven by hard numbers. Japan’s anime industry reached a record $25.3 billion in 2024, with overseas sales accounting for nearly 80% of the total market and growing at double-digit rates annually, according to figures released by the Association of Japanese Animations during TIFFCOM. The sector has doubled in size over the past decade, making Japanese content a high-stakes battleground for global studios.\n\n\tBut attendees at The Future of Japanese Intellectual Property in Global Adaptations, a TIFFCOM keynote presentation by producer Fujimura Tetsu, came away with a different, more positive impression: For all the problems of the Japanese entertainment industry, beginning with an insular mindset that makes it slow to respond to international opportunities, it still generates IP with enormous growth potential.\n\n\tFounder and CEO of consulting firm Filosofia, Fujimura illustrated this thesis with not only a wealth of data and examples, but also his own story of joining hands with top Hollywood producers to bring Japanese IP to the world, from the 2017 live-action sci-fi “Ghost in the Shell” to the hit Netflix “One Piece” series.\n\n\tAs Fujimura noted, Japanese anime has moved beyond a niche interest internationally to the global mainstream, led by the record-setting earnings of the “Demon Slayer” franchise. He also presented a long list of Japanese IP, from comics and novels to games and toys, that is now in the Hollywood content pipeline. His takeaway: Japanese IP has become a key national industry rivaling the country’s fabled automakers in earnings. Toyota may be struggling against Tesla in the global EV sweepstakes, but Hello Kitty is conquering the world.\n\t\n\n\tYet despite this dominance, the emergence of world-beating IP from South Korea and China, including games, animations, movies and streaming shows, has seemingly threatened the longtime supremacy of regional pop culture powerhouse Japan.\n\t\n\t\tJapan’s Cultural Confidence Returns With “Kokuho” Leading Local Box Office Renaissance\t\n\n\tLee Sang-il’s three-hour Kabuki period drama “Kokuho” has grossed $109 million since its June release, marking the third-highest total ever for a live-action Japanese film. The film premiered in Directors’ Fortnight at Cannes and has become a major cultural phenomenon, with government officials highlighting how it has re-inspired public interest in traditional Kabuki theater.\n\n\tThe success reflects renewed appetite for prestige studio filmmaking reminiscent of Japan’s Golden Age auteurs, a theme that resonated throughout the festival. At a standing-room-only TIFF Lounge event, 91-year-old directorial legend Yamada Yoji engaged in conversation with Lee about craft and the future of Japanese cinema. Other TIFF Lounge sessions paired Kore-eda Hirokazu with Oscar-winner Chloé Zhao, Fujimoto Akio with Thailand’s Pen-ek Ratanaruang, and Miyake Sho with Cambodia’s Rithy Panh, reinforcing Tokyo’s positioning as a hub for inter-Asian filmmaker dialogue.\n\n\tThe festival’s opening ceremony featured American auteur Paul Schrader, whose 1985 film “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters” finally made its Japan premiere this week after four decades of being blocked due to controversial content. The screening, timed to the 100th anniversary of Mishima’s birth, exemplified the festival’s growing confidence in bridging cinematic history with contemporary cultural diplomacy.\n\n\tUnlike last year’s TIFF, which brought stars Paul Mescal, Fred Hechinger, Connie Nielsen and Denzel Washington to Tokyo for a Centerpiece screening of “Gladiator II,” this year’s edition was short on Hollywood glamor, though director Chloé Zhao stepped on stage to present her drama “Hamnet” as the closing film and “Elvis” producer Schuyler Weiss presented two masterclasses. The festival compensated with a robust international star presence on the red carpet, including Chinese superstar Fan Bingbing (competition entry “Mother Bhumi”), French actor Juliette Binoche (presenting her directorial debut “In-I In Motion”), Hong Kong filmmaker Peter Chan, and festival ambassador Takiuchi Kumi, alongside Japanese talents including Yoshinaga Sayuri (who received a lifetime achievement award), Saitoh Takumi, and Morita Misato.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tJapanese Women Producers Break Through at Industry’s Highest Levels\t\n\n\tLong shunted into support roles, Japanese women are now active as producers at the peaks of the industry, both locally and internationally. Proof was on stage at the From Tokyo to the World – Japanese Woman Producers Go Global talk event, a part of TIFF’s Women’s Empowerment section.\n\n\tMiyagawa Eriko, an Emmy winner for the hit streaming series “Shogun,” Eiko Mizuno Gray, producer of the Cannes competition entry “Renoir,” and Murata Chieko, whose many credits include the box office sensation “Kokuho,” took different routes to the top, but all have carved out careers that would have been next-to-impossible a generation ago.\n\n\tMiyagawa tasted success by finding opportunities in Hollywood, Mizuno Gray by launching an indie production company and Murata by climbing corporate ladders in Japanese subsidiaries of Hollywood studios. In the process they have paved the way for the next generation of female producers by showing just how limitless opportunities are for those with oversized talent and ambitions.\n\t\n\t\tRising Production Costs Drive Asian Co-Production Pivot\t\n\n\tProducers in Asia are cognizant of rising costs in their domestic markets. Seminars conducted at TIFFCOM devoted perhaps as much time to discussions of salary and production caps in high-cost markets, as it did to funding. The boom in production costs has been blamed on high talent prices, stemming from extravagant spending by big streamers in recent years. There is a sense that local producers are leaning towards coproductions with producers in other countries, not just to ameliorate the financial burden, but to wean themselves away from over reliance on commissions and acquisitions from streamers.\n\t\n\t\tJapan’s Production Committee Model Emerges as Co-Production Barrier\t\n\n\tSeparately, Japanese producers are very excited to and desirous of, coproducing with international partners, but language and culture still remain massive obstacles. For example, the Production Committee style of film producing, that is common in Japan, came in for criticism, and was compared poorly to Korea’s less bureaucratic and more swashbuckling style of filmmaking, which is usually helmed by just one company. Similarly, producers complained of having to spend more money hiring bilingual crew and cast when coproducing in Japan. In a similar vein, Japanese media startups and companies might express a desire to expand overseas, but their content continues to be local focused, with less thought and effort devoted to translating distinctly Japanese content to be easily consumed by international audiences. For example, in one platform’s presentation, none of the content demonstrated was localized into English, and video clips shown were not stripped of the extensive Japanese text overlays that are a hallmark of Japanese television, despite the platform being meant for international producers.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCannes 2026 Country of Honor Signals Belated Global Ambitions\t\n\n\tJapan’s selection as the Cannes Film Market 2026 Country of Honor will see the nation co-host the market’s opening night gala for 1,200+ delegates and feature across flagship programs highlighting animation, genre cinema and co-production opportunities. Officials plan to use the platform to demystify Japan’s production committee financing model for overseas producers, with the goal of enabling more meaningful international co-productions, as Japan produces around 1,200 films annually with $1.31 billion in box office receipts. \n\n\tDespite the language barrier, Japan in general, still looms large in the imagination of Asian filmmakers. The sui generis nature of Japanese culture, practices and lifestyle continue to be a font of inspiration for directors in the region. The number of international filmmakers, actors and producers presenting films with a Japanese link, is testament to that continued fascination about Japan.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWith an endearing black comedy set in the provinces, which adopts the visual style of a ’60s Western, prolific writer-director Teemu Nikki salutes his country’s (and his family’s) tradition of sahti-making. “100 Liters of Gold” follows two dysfunctional middle-aged sisters, third-generation makers of the strong farmhouse ale. In their village of Sysmä, sahti is a must to mark births, weddings and funerals, as well as almost everything in between. Touching on issues such as alcoholism and family trauma, but with a light touch, Finland’s international Oscar submission provides a breath of fresh air (albeit one redolent with alcohol) amongst the serious dramas in this category.\n\t\n\n\tPirkko (Elina Knihtilä) and Taina (Pirjo Lonka) live in a ramshackle house on what was once the family farm, but their main source of income comes from their tasty home brew — or it would, if they didn’t consume so much of it themselves. Then, there’s the friends and neighbors, even the local pastor (Vilma Melasniemi ), who continue to make off with full containers on credit.\n\n\n\tWhen their younger sister Päivi (Ria Kataja) commissions 100 liters of the golden liquid for her upcoming wedding, Pirkko and Taina promise to concoct a batch worthy of a perfect 10. But 22 days later, when it is ready, they once again get too tempted by their own brewhouse magic and by the time the wedding day nears, there’s no more sahti left.\n\n\tWith their reputation as top brewmakers to protect, as well as a feeling of guilt toward Päivi, who lost her lower leg after a car accident when they were all driving drunk, the gals set off with Pirkko’s would-be suitor, the chain-smoking milquetoast Hauki-Hikkanen (Ville Tiihonen) at the wheel. They are determined to get some decent sahti by hook or by crook.\n\t\n\n\tNikki spends a tad too much time on the escapades of their single-minded quest. He also includes multiple showdowns with their nasty, leering cousin Ponu-Paavo (Jari Pehkonen), who covets their business and the special wooden brewing trough (the kuurina) left to them by their grandfather.\n\n\tThe kuurina and other tools and tricks of the sahti trade are lovingly incorporated into the storyline, as Pirkko explains the brewing process to Päivi’s fiancé (Jakob Ohrman). Although there’s plenty of boozing in the film, the dangers of over-indulging are made very clear. There’s Päivi’s injury, which continues to haunt Taina; the client who dies before he can pay off his debt; Pirkko’s hospitalization for alcohol poisoning; and the women’s father (Pertti Sveholm), who now depends on Antabuse, but still likes his daughters to leave him samples of their latest batch.\n\n\tNo matter how cartoonish the action, the fine ensemble of actors plays it seriously, and you can see the intelligence shine from their eyes. Nikki maintains that he likes to cast before he writes, and with Knihtilä and Lonka, who work in theater as well as film and television, he has a starring pair who give it their all.\n\n\tNikki and cinematographer Jarmo Kiuru, another Sysmä native, shoot in a 1:2.39 widescreen ratio with a dusty, warm color palette. When Pirkko and Taina face off with Ponu, they could be rival outlaws staring each other down and refusing to give up ground.\n\n\tThe colorful costumes by Anna Vilppunen (“Tom of Finland,” “Sisu”) also continue the Western motif, while composer Marco Biscarini was a student of Ennio Morricone. All things considered, Nikki proves himself a native son of which Sysmä can be proud — much like Olavi Virta, the “king of Finnish tango,” whose music the film also celebrates.\n\n\tSo far, only Nikki’s previous Finnish Oscar entry, “Euthanizer” (2017) has been distributed Stateside. But with the pace and range of his work, as well as an upcoming English-language project, it shouldn’t be too long before American audiences get a chance to catch up.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe French production landscape has come a long way since Emily first hit town.\n\n\tIn early 2019, “Emily in Paris” was among 15 international shoots to touch down in Gaul, together generating around $70 million in local spending per quarter. Six years later, that picture looks very different. The post-pandemic boom has subsided while investment has surged, with between 18-20 commensurate projects now averaging $175 million over similar periods. In fact, overall spending crested past $300 million in the first quarter of 2025, driven by “Emily’s” fifth-season return and a sector strengthened by new capacity in animation, VFX and studio infrastructure — all part of a wider plan to make France a one-stop shop for production.\n\t\n\n\tPublic support has been central to that transformation. A 2020 update to France’s Tax Rebate for International Productions (TRIP) added a 10% bonus for projects spending at least $2.3 million with French VFX and post-production facilities, in addition to the standard 30% rebate. Since then, the France 2030 modernization plan has supercharged infrastructure and workforce development, dotting the landscape with new assets such as a highly detailed 3.7-acre backlot replicating the City of Light, which recently played an ersatz Paris for “Emily” and her crew.\n\n\n\t“Projects now stay longer, shoot more days, do more VFX and invest more deeply,” says Arnaud Roland, who oversees the initiative for the national film agency CNC. “When you combine efficiency with agility, you understand why producers come back. American filmmakers often say that something uniquely French always comes through on screen, no matter how international the project.”\n\t\n\n\tThat certain je ne sais quoi has become an advantage in a fiercely competitive global market where tax breaks are merely table stakes. As part of an expanding outreach effort, the CNC’s international commission, Film France, now champions locally made productions with global footprints, spotlighting “The Substance” and the action comedy “Heads of State” as titles that used French locations to stand in for Spain, Italy, Serbia, Croatia, the U.K., the U.S. and Poland. \n\n\tBut in order to attract even greater attention in the coming years — including the next season of HBO’s “The White Lotus” — Film France will trade on Gaul’s emblematic institutions.\n\n\t“Our strength is agility,” says Film France head Daphné Lora. “We can rapidly coordinate across government services to meet every production’s unique needs, from military access to brand collaborations. We’ve connected filmmakers to infrastructures and historic sites that are normally closed to the public and brought in luxury partners when the story called for it. We also handle critical logistics, such as securing visas in under 48 hours. It may not sound glamorous, but it’s essential, and it gives us a real edge.”\n\n\tBuilding on that momentum, Film France has expanded its outreach by hosting “inspiration tours” for visiting producers and sending delegations of French VFX and production experts to Los Angeles for industry meetings. This year, it also formalized a funding partnership with the American French Film Festival, creating a direct channel for dialogue between the two ecosystems by connecting CNC leadership with U.S. industry guilds.\n\n\t“The goal goes far beyond promoting France as a filming destination,” Roland adds. “It’s about elevating France’s global profile and building lasting creative and technical partnerships. We want the country to be seen not just as a service hub but as a genuine collaborator — a place that can deliver blockbusters and festival winners [like Jim Jarmusch’s “Father Mother Sister Brother”] both in the same year.\n\n\t“When the next major franchise decides to film here, it shouldn’t feel like luck,” he adds. “It should feel inevitable.”\n",

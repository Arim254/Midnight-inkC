    "description": "\n\tThe Jokers Films has acquired French distribution rights to Barunson E&A’s “The World of Love,” the top-grossing independent Korean film at the 2025",
    "body": "\n\tThe Jokers Films has acquired French distribution rights to Barunson E&A’s “The World of Love,” the top-grossing independent Korean film at the 2025 local box office.\n\n\tThe acquisition deal was negotiated between Manuel Chiche, founder of The Jokers Films and head of Asian acquisitions, and Sylvie Kim, head of international business at Barunson E&A.\n\n\tThe feature surpassed 150,000 admissions in Korea as of Nov. 30.\n\n\n\tDirected by Yoon Ga-eun, acclaimed for “The World of Us” (Berlinale 2016) and “The House of Us” (BFI London 2019), the drama centers on 17-year-old Lee Jooin (Seo Su-bin), an unpredictable high school student whose angry outburst creates ripple effects throughout her world.\n\t\n\n\tThe title has gained traction on the festival circuit, world premiering at Toronto’s Platform competition and collecting jury and audience awards at Pingyao International Film Festival’s Crouching Tigers section, along with the Fipresci Award at the Warsaw Film Festival. The film recently played at the Cork International Film Festival’s Momentum section.\n\n\tThe film recently won the Montgolfière d’Or, the top prize in the international competition section, at the 47th Nantes 3 Continents Film Festival. Previous recipients of the honor include “Hanami” (2024), “The Shadowless Tower” (2023), “Glorious Ashes” (2022), and “Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy” (2021).\n\n\tThe festival jury praised the film for exploring a universally denied subject with depth, tenderness and sensitivity. “Through rich and complex characters who have the courage to refuse to be confined by an imposed narrative, the film tackles a taboo subject without ever looking away, always celebrating life and love above all else,” the jury stated. “For its richness, its power, and its ability to make us think, ‘The World of Love’ receives the Montgolfière d’or.”\n\t\n\n\tFounded in 2014 by Chiche and Violaine Barbaroux, The Jokers Films has built a reputation for handling acclaimed international cinema. The company’s slate includes Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite,” Park Chan-wook’s “The Handmaiden,” Wong Kar Wai’s “2046” and Nicolas Winding Refn’s “The Neon Demon.”\n\n\t“The Jokers are very proud to be the French distributor of ‘The World of Love.’ On a personal note I haven’t been so moved and enthusiastic about a Korean movie since some time,” said Chiche. “Yoon Ga-eun is a brilliant director and some sequences (especially the car wash scene) are absolutely fantastic. Being able to see this kind of talent is the ultimate reason why we are doing this job. We are very thankful to Barunson E&A for their trust.”\n\n\t“The World of Love” is currently playing at the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival, which also includes the JAFF Market, and is next at the Red Sea Film Festival. \n",

    "body": "\n\tChina’s theatrical market is losing younger audiences while Vietnam emerges as a breakout territory for pan-Asian content, according to industry executives speaking at the JAFF Market.\n\n\tEric Lin, general manager of international content at Alibaba‘s Damai Entertainment, revealed that Chinese audiences under 24 now represent only 15% of total moviegoers, down from 38% before the pandemic. “We’re losing half of them in five or six years,” Lin said, noting that core frequent audiences have shifted to the 30-49 age bracket. While the year saw “Ne Zha 2” generate more that $2 billion at the box office, the market struggles to retain younger demographics competing with short-form vertical content AKA microdramas. \n\t\n\n\tVietnam has established itself as a crucial territory for Asian films, with Phong Duong, business director at Mockingbird Pictures, presenting market data showing Vietnamese title “Red Rain” generated more than $27 million, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the territory. \n\n\n\tThe panel, moderated by JAFF Market advisor Lorna Tee and presented in partnership with Indonesian producers’ association APROFI, brought together Duong, Lin, Nelson Mok, CEO of Mokster Films, and Shiori Takata, director of international production at Toei. Indonesia’s theatrical market has demonstrated strength with local films capturing over 65% of box office share.\n\n\tMok, whose company handled international sales for “How To Make a Million Before Grandma Dies” and the Taiwanese version of “More Than Blue,” emphasized theatrical-focused distribution strategies. “The similarity between the two films is a when we first bring it to the market, nobody wanted the films,” Mok revealed. “Everybody rejected the movies because it didn’t fit into any sort of computation of what distributor had in mind as a commercial film.” \n\t\n\n\tTakata noted Japan’s domestic market faces challenges with animation comprising 80-90% of content, leaving limited space for live-action films. Toei launched its international production division in 2023, targeting Southeast Asian partnerships in the $1 million to $2.5 million budget range. Multiple panelists stressed production quality’s importance for attracting international buyers.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” stuffed the box office competition over Thanksgiving. \n\n\tDisney‘s animated sequel, a buddy-cop comedy about anthropomorphic animals, debuted to $156 million in North America and $400 million overseas, delivering a stunning $556 million global tally. The family film, which opened on Wednesday, cemented several records, including the fourth-biggest worldwide debut in box office history (following “Avengers: Endgame,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home”), as well as the largest global launch of all time for an animated film.\n\t\n\n\t“The incredible response to ‘Zootopia 2’ reflects both its worldwide appeal and the remarkable work of our filmmakers and cast,” says Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman. “It’s a proud moment for Disney Animation and all of us at Disney, not to mention a great way to start the holiday season.”\n\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” is turbocharging the box office, which has been majorly struggling since the summer. This was the second consecutive weekend that movie theaters were booked and busy after “Wicked: For Good” arrived ahead of Thanksgiving with $147 million. The initial turnout for “Zootopia 2” is also a needed win for Disney, which has fielded a string of theatrical misses, including Marvel’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” Pixar’s “Elio,” “Tron: Ares” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” After a rocky stretch, the studio will dominate through the rest of the year with “Zootopia 2” and December’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”\n\n\tDirected by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, the PG-rated “Zootopia 2” follows a rabbit police officer (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist fox (Jason Bateman) as they reunite to pursue a mysterious new reptilian resident (Ke Huy Quan) in the city. The original “Zootopia” opened in March 2016 with $75 million in North America and became a massive hit with $341 million domestically and $1.02 billion worldwide. With stellar reviews and excellent word-of-mouth, “Zootopia 2” is poised to deliver a similar result — and should easily become the second movie of the year to surpass the $1 billion mark after Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” in May. \n\t\n\n\t“‘Zootopia 2’ has a perfect release date, built-in brand recognition and a PG rating,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends, Paul Dergarabedian.\n\n\tHere are all the records from opening weekend:\n\t\n\t\tGlobal\t\n\n\nHighest animated global opening of all time (based on current rates) \nFourth-biggest global opening of all time after “Avengers: Endgame” ($1.2 billion), “Avengers: Infinity War” ($630 million) and “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($587 million)\nBiggest global debut of 2025\nHighest global opening for an animated sequel ever \nLargest global opening ever for Walt Disney Animation Studios\nHighest global opening for any animated film in Disney’s 102-year history\nBiggest opening weekend increase from original to sequel for any animated franchise (239%)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDomestic\t\n\n\nSecond-biggest Thanksgiving Day after “Moana 2” ($28 million)\nSecond-highest Thanksgiving opening ever (three-day and five-day) behind “Moana 2” ($139 million over the three days and $225 million over the five days)\nSecond-largest Black Friday ever with $38.9 million behind “Moana 2” ($54.3 million)\nSecond-highest domestic Wednesday before Thanksgiving of all time with $39.3 million after “Moana 2” ($57.5 million)\nSecond-biggest preview gross for Walt Disney Animation sequel with $10.2 million, behind “Moana 2” ($13.8 million) and ahead of “Frozen II” ($8.5 million)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tChina\t\n\n\nSixth-highest debut of all time, including local and Hollywood titles\nSecond-best non-local film opening of all time behind “Avengers: Endgame” ($632 million)\nHighest animated opening ever for a non-local title\nTop-grossing non-local film since 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” \nHighest non-local animated film of all-time after five days of release\nFourth-highest-grossing animated film\nAlready surpassed the total cume of Zootopia ($236 million) in five days\nHighest single-day gross of all-time for an MPA film with $104 million on Saturday, surpassing “Avengers: Endgame” ($79 million)\nBest opening for a Hollywood release in 2025\n\n\n\t\n\t\tInternational\t\n\n\nFourth-highest international opening of all time\nBiggest Walt Disney Animation international opening of all time (based current rates in the same suite of markets)\nHighest international animated opening of all time (based current rates in the same suite of markets)\nLargest Hollywood international opening of 2025\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains very light spoilers from Season 2, Episode 3 of “Landman,” “Almost a Home,” which premiered Sunday, Nov. 30, on Paramount+.\n\n\tAndy Garcia made his “Landman” debut as Gallino in the Season 1 finale, introduced as a cartel boss who spared the life of Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) and menacingly assured him they would be business partners soon … and maybe even friends! Their reintroduction came quickly, once Tommy learned that Cooper (Jacob Lofland) signed a huge oil partnership with Gallino’s investment firm, which led to a heated standoff — as well as drinks at the Cattlemen’s Club — between the two on this week’s episode.\n\t\n\n\tDespite their onscreen friction, Garcia says working alongside his old friend Thornton makes the “Landman” set feel like home.\n\n\n\t“I was embraced first of all by Billy, who’s the most generous,” Garcia says. “There’s a mutual respect there. We already had a friendship from acquaintances over the years, and so it was walking into a place where you felt you already belonged. There’s a bonding that happens with actors: You have to rely on each other to do the best work, because your best work comes from the people in front of you. That’s where you pull it from.”\n\n\tAdditionally, Garcia says the role fit him like a glove because the show’s co-creator, Taylor Sheridan, developed it for him.\n\n\t“When he approached me, he hadn’t written the part yet,” Garcia says. “He met with me and said, ‘I’d like to create this part for you.’ He was a fan of a movie I did many years ago called ‘Eight Million Ways to Die,’ and I played this crazy young drug guy, and he killed people. Not so much like Gallino, but maybe it’s Gallino when he was 18. I think he writes to people. He said to Billy Bob, ‘I’m going to write this character in your voice.’ He wrote Sam Elliott’s character in this thing in Sam’s voice. I think he understood it based on the work he had seen me do over the years, and what he had felt was my voice, my persona.”\n\t\n\n\tGarcia says his real life even helped to shape Gallino’s backstory.\n\n\t“I said, ‘Who’s this guy?’ And he said, ‘He’s a cartel leader in the Permian Basin,'” Garcia says. “And I said, ‘There’s a cartel in the Permian Basin? Is he a local kid? Is he Mexican?’ And he just said, ‘It’s you.’ So immediately that located me as saying, ‘Okay, who is the person as close to who I am, where I’m from?’ And I said, ‘My character is from the Caribbean.’ In my own mind, I’m saying, ‘He got to the Permian Basin because he’s the guy who has access to where the source is, where the product is coming from, because of his access to the Caribbean, South America. Maybe he grew up in Miami, but he ended up in Fort Worth because it was virgin territory to explore. But he’s not a local kid. He’s local now. And he always said, ‘Your character is integrated into society, and he’s living under the radar there.’ That’s all he said.”\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKorean content company Showbox has partnered with Thailand’s M Studio to develop Thai film co-productions under a newly signed memorandum of understanding.\n\n\tThe strategic alliance pairs Showbox with M Studio, a leading Thai film production and distribution entity under the Major Cineplex Group, which operates Thailand’s largest cinema chain.\n\n\tThe companies will collaborate across multiple facets of Thai film co-production, encompassing financial investment, talent exchange for both production crew and cast, and distribution initiatives spanning domestic and international markets.\n\t\n\n\tThe partnership also includes provisions for adapting Showbox intellectual property for Thai film productions. The companies plan to announce their first project and production schedule at a later date.\n\n\n\tM Studio has established itself as a commercial force in Thai cinema, particularly in horror and action genres. The company currently commands a 54% market share of the Thai box office in 2024-2025, according to them. Notable M Studio releases include the “Death Whisperer” trilogy, which has collectively grossed over $50 million at the Thai box office.\n\n\tThe Bangkok-based company’s prolific output of 10-15 films annually has established it as a major force in Thai cinema. The company’s vertical integration — spanning production through exhibition via Major Cineplex’s theater network — provides comprehensive control over marketing and theatrical releases.\n\n\tM Studio’s slate includes Puttipong Nakthong’s thriller “The Last Shot,” racing comedy “Jazz the Racing,” the latest “Nakee 3” installment in the popular action-drama franchise, comedy-action hybrid “Riam Fighting Angel 2,” biographical drama “Bit by Bit,” action-thriller “God Skin” and drama-comedy “The Lion Dance Girl.”\n\t\n\n\tShowbox’s slate features hit comedy-drama “The First Ride,” starring Kang Ha-neul and Kim Young-kwang and directed by Nam Dae-joong; mystery thriller “White Blast” directed by Hong Eui-jeong and Park Sun-woo; body horror “Sleep No More” from director Edwin, starring Rachel Amanda, Lutesha and Iqbaal Ramadhan; romance drama “Once We Were Us” with Koo Kyo-hwan and Mun Ka-young, directed by Kim Do-young; and action thriller “Colony” from Yeon Sang-ho, starring Gianna Jun, Koo Kyo-hwan, Ji Chang-wook and Shin Hyun-been.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Is this bear an endangered species?” asks Tarinn Callender as the hapless helper of Victoria Hamilton-Barritt’s (very) arch-villainess Millicent Price. With growling glee as insanely delicious as it is malicious, she retorts, “It is now.” Price is absolutely right about the trapped-in-peril titular character she wants to stuff, but about the show as a whole she couldn’t be more wrong. Furry, funny and fully-formed, the much-anticipated “Paddington” musical has finally arrived in the West End and it’s alive not only with joy but that vanishingly rare theatrical quality: completely beguiling charm.\n\t\n\n\tAdapting beloved intellectual property to the stage is a risky business. For every long-running “The Lion King” and “Wicked” there’s an “Interview With A Vampire”, “Groundhog Day” or London’s current, depressingly flaccid “The Hunger Games.” But hopes were lifted for producers Sonia Friedman and Eliza Lumley’s stage presentation by the fact that the film versions of Michael Bond’s original 1958 story collection “A Bear Called Paddington” (and fourteen sequels) were vastly stronger than anyone foresaw, amassing a box-office total approaching $800 million and counting.  \n\n\n\tAt least five years in gestation with multiple developmental workshops along the way, the result could have felt flatly cynical. But from the opening moments, set in the cozy cabinet of curiosities shop — cue orchestrator/arranger Matt Brind’s mysterious and twinkling Danny Elfman-esque underscoring — there’s real precision to Luke Sheppard’s production. From the storybook design right through the entire cast, the show never feels engineered. \n\t\n\n\tThe overriding question prior to opening was: How would they do the bear? The answer sounds more complicated than it appears but Paddington is played by Arti Shah, an actor of short stature, inside an expectedly furry costume while being voiced and (powerfully) sung by another actor, James Hameed, who appears briefly to bookend the show but spends the rest of his time backstage. Like the central character in the stage adaptation of “War Horse,” what is in effect a human-operated puppet works immediately on the audience’s collective imagination. And like the doleful dog in the Aardman Animations “Wallace and Gromit” screen hits, the bear’s seemingly expressionless face with jet-black eyes turns out to be astonishingly expressive, not least because of Hameed’s voice and the sympathetic head and body movements.\n\n\tWith that problem winningly solved, it becomes a question as to whether the material works both as a piece of theatrical storytelling and as a musical. \n\n\tThe initially buoyant company number “I’ve Arrived” sets the pleasingly jaunty tone, aided and abetted by Ellen Kane’s snappy, characterful, happily theatrical choreography, which sends crowds of passengers skittering across Tom Pye’s atmospheric set of the London train station rendered even more famous than J.K. Rowling’s King’s Cross. (A statue of Paddington Bear was unveiled at the real Paddington Station in 2000, long before the movies.)\n\n\tMusic and lyrics are by Tom Fletcher, founder of the wildly successful British band McFly. But Fletcher has also written over 30 children’s books, so this is not a world he’s condescending to. Interleaved with Jessica Swale’s neat book, numbers and moments occasionally overplay their hand when underlining teachable moments, but the performers carry the valuable sentiment so securly that it almost never curdles into sentimentality.\n\n\tFletcher’s music and lyrics are mostly more effective than fully affecting and are better at delivering states of mind than moving plot forward. But his comedy numbers are witty and, seized by the skilled cast, all the laughs land. And in an era where musicals too often topple over into high seriousness, the return of musical comedy is lapped up by the audience, nowhere more so than in one of the show’s highpoints, the Act Two opener.\n\t\n\n\tA superbly silly comedy waltz in which Millicent’s increasingly unhappy sidekick Mr. Curry (Tom Edden, the scene-stealing waiter from “One Man, Two Guvnors”) is seduced into a love of Paddington’s favorite food, “Marmalade” turns into a riotously infectious and orange production number which even has the nerve to get the audience to join in, which, at the press performance, they exuberantly did. Edden and Sheppard’s superbly meshed production team turn the number into a music-and-design tour-de-force with costume designer Gabriella Slade going for broke against Ash J. Woodward’s wonderful, picture-book-style animation. Eschewing dull literalism, the bold illustrations lend imaginative flair to the warm, lived-in look of Pye’s production design.\n\n\tSwale’s book allows every character their season in the spotlight and Adrian Der Gregorian’s Mr. Brown has a nice line in fatherly exasperation and stymied hope. As Mrs. Brown, Amy Ellen Richardson has a tremendous singing voice with a real belt where necessary, and the tenderness of her performance is responsible for the show’s unusual degree of truthful sincerity. \n\n\tWhere director Sheppard (“& Juliet”) and Swale score most strongly is in their own inventions away from the film. Hamilton-Barritt has had a career being the best thing in high-profile flops including the National Theatre’s “Hex” and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cinderella.” Here, in a grotesque characterization in tweeds and thigh-length boots, she’s finally surfing on a hit, ricocheting gloriously between wickedly basso-profundo, deadpan droll and, to the audience’s delight, lip-smacking savagery.\n\n\tIf she’s now the shoo-in for next year’s Best Leading Actress awards, all Best Supporting Actress prizes are going to be stolen by Amy Booth-Steel who wrings every conceivable laugh from — and adds a heap of her own to — a string of minor characters. Whether she’s slaying her lines as a pert and sarcastic station announcer or inhabiting the galumphing, self-aggrandizing, gloriously vowel-mangling president of the Geographical Guild, there’s not a speck of the auditorium she doesn’t rule.\n\n\tAuthor Michael Bond created a character with a label saying “Please look after this bear.” It’s a pretty safe bet that West End audiences will look after “Paddington” for a long time to come.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Pillion,” the kinky BDSM rom-com in which Alexander Skarsgard’s strapping biker takes Harry Melling’s timid wallflower as his new submissive, has won the top honor at the British Independent Film Awards. \n\n\tThe debut feature of writer/director Harry Lighton, “Pillion” — which bowed in Cannes earlier this year and is due for release in the U.S. with A24 — also won best debut screenwriter. These join the film’s previously announced craft wins for best costume design and best make up and hair design. \n\t\n\n\tHeld on Sunday at London’s Roundhouse, the awards ceremony brought together the the film world in the U.K. and abroad. Among the guests presenters were Carey Mulligan, Stephen Merchant, Ruth Wilson, Celia Imrie and Billy Crudup. \n\n\n\tHaving led the pack of nominations with nods in 11 categories, Akinola Davies Jr’s Nigeria-set “My Father’s Shadow” — another Cannes-bowing directorial debut and, like “Pillion,” produced by Irish powerhouse Element Picture — may have only emerged with one award. But that win was for best director. \n\n\tElsewhere on the night, in the gender-neutral performance categories Robert Aramayo won best lead for his acclaimed turn as a Tourette’s campaigner in indie hit “I Swear” (beating, among others, Jennifer Lawrence). Meanwhile, fast-rising British star Jay Lycurgo — recently listed on Variety‘s Actors to Watch — won best supporting for playing a troubled youngster in pressure-cooking school drama “Steve.” \n\n\tWith the BIFAs often serving as a bellwether of future talent in front of and behind the camera, the ceremony also saw Cal McMau win best debut director for “Wasteman,” Dhiraj Mahey named breakthrough producer for “Ish” and Posy Sterling claim the breakthrough performance award for “Lollipop.”\n\t\n\n\tSee the full list of winners below.\n\n\tBest British Independent Film\n\n\t“The Ballad of Wallis Island” “I Swear” “My Father’s Shadow”“Pillion” (WINNER)“Urchin”\n\n\tBest Lead Performance\n\n\tRobert Aramayo,” I Swear” (WINNER)Frank Dillane, “Urchin”David Jonsson, “Wasteman”Jennifer Lawrence, “Die My Love”Harry Melling, “Pillion”Cillian Murphy, “Steve”\n\n\tBest Supporting Performance\n\n\tTom Blyth, “Wasteman”Scott Ellis Watson, “I Swear”Jay Lycurgo, “Steve” (WINNER)Peter Mullan, “I Swear”Maxine Peake, “I Swear”Alexander Skarsgård, “Pillion”\n\n\tBest Joint Lead Performance\n\n\tEbada Hassan, Saffiya Ingar, “Brides”Tim Key, Tom Basden, “The Ballad of Wallis Island” (WINNER)Andrea Riseborough, Brenda Blethyn, “Dragonfly”\n\n\tBest Director \n\n\tLaura Carreira, “On Falling”Akinola Davies Jr, “My Father’s Shadow” (WINNER)Kirk Jones, “I Swear”Harry Lighton, “Pillion”Lynne Ramsay, “Die My Love”\n\n\tBest Screenplay\n\n\tTom Basden, Tim Key, “The Ballad of Wallis Island” (WINNER)Laura Carreira, “On Falling”Wale Davies, “My Father’s Shadow”Kirk Jones, “I Swear”Harry Lighton, “Pillion” \n\n\tThe Douglas Hickox Award for best debut director\n\n\tLaura Carreira, “On Falling”Akinola Davies Jr, “My Father’s Shadow”Harris Dickinson, “Urchin”Harry Lighton, “Pillion”Cal Mcmau, “Wasteman” (WINNER)\n\n\tBreakthrough Producer\n\n\tWyn Baptiste, “Shoot the People”Charlotte Knowles, “Palestine Comedy Club”Joann Kushner, “Lifehack” [also produced by Timur Bekmambetov, Aleksandr Kletzov]Dhiraj Mahey, “Ish” [also produced By Bennett Mcghee] (WINNER)Archie Pearch, “Urchin” [also produced By Scott O’Donnell]\n\n\tBreakthrough Performance\n\n\tScott Ellis Watson, “I Swear”Ebada Hassan, “Brides”Safiyya Ingar, “Brides”Posy Sterling, “Lollipop” (WINNER)Connor Tompkins, “The Son and the Sea”\n\n\tBest Debut Screenwriter\n\n\tHunter Andrews, Eoin Doran, “Wasteman”Tom Basden, Tim Key, “The Ballad of Wallis Island”Laura Carreira, “On Falling”Wale Davies, “My Father’s Shadow”Harry Lighton, “Pillion” (WINNER)\n\n\tBest Feature Documentary\n\n\t“Antidote” — James Jones, David Moulton“Mother Vera” — Cécile Embleton, Alys Tomlinson, Laura Shacham“Motherboard” — Victoria Mapplebeck“The Shepherd and the Bear” — Max Keegan, Elizabeth Woodward, Amanda Mcbaine, Jesse Moss“A Want in Her” — Myrid Carten, Tadhg O’Sullivan, Roisín Geraghty, Kat Mansoor (WINNER)\n\t\n\n\tBest Debut Director – Feature Documentary\n\n\tMyrid Carten, “A Want in Her” (WINNER)Cécile Embleton, Alys Tomlinson, “Mother Vera”Victoria Mapplebeck, “Motherboard”\n\n\tThe Raindance Maverick Award\n\n\t“Foul Evil Deeds,” Richard Hunter“Holloway,” Sophie Compton, Daisy-May Hudson, Stella Heath Keir, Alice Hughes, Polly Creed“Mother Vera,” Cécile Embleton, Alys Tomlinson, Laura Shacham“Motherboard,” Victoria Mapplebeck“A Want in Her,” Myrid Carten (WINNER)\n\n\tBest International Independent Film\n\n\t“It Was Just an Accident”“Sentimental Value” (WINNER)“Sirāt”“Sorry, Baby”“Sound of Falling”\n\n\tBest Casting\n\n\tShaheen Baig, “Brides”Shaheen Baig, “Urchin”Kharmel Cochrane, “Warfare”Lauren Evans, “I Swear” (WINNER)Robert Sterne, “Steve”\n\n\tBest Cinematography\n\n\tCharlotte Bruus Christensen, “H Is for Hawk”Jermaine Edwards, “My Father’s Shadow”Cécile Embleton, “Mother Vera”Seamus Mcgarvey, “Die My Love” (WINNER)Piotr Niemyjski, “A Pale View of Hills”\n\n\tBest Costume Design\n\n\tSusie Coulthard, “100 Nights of Hero”Kirsty Halliday, “Tornado”Grace Snell, “Pillion” (WINNER)Sayaka Takahashi, Matthew Price, “A Pale View of Hills”PC Williams, “My Father’s Shadow”\n\n\tBest Editing\n\n\tRonan Corrigan, Aleksandr Kletsov, “Lifehack”Omar Guzmán Castro, “My Father’s Shadow”Fin Oates, “Warfare” (WINNER)Sam Rice-Edwards, “One to One: John & Yoko”Gareth C.

    "body": "\n\tSafe to say James Cameron will never cast Tilly Norwood in a movie. \n\n\tDuring a recent interview with CBS’ Sunday Morning, the director of “The Terminator” explained that even before the invention of generative AI, some Hollywood insiders thought he would use computer graphics to replace actors as he was developing the first “Avatar” film in 2005.\n\n\tHe recalled, “For years, there was this sense that, ‘Oh, they’re doing something strange with computers and they’re replacing actors,’ when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we’re doing, it’s a celebration of the actor-director moment.”\n\t\n\n\tCameron said now that generative AI is invading the industry, the idea that the technology could substitute for a performer is “horrifying.”\n\n\t“Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character,” Cameron added. “They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It’s like, no. That’s horrifying to me. That’s the opposite. That’s exactly what we’re not doing.”\n\n\tIn September, comedian and producer Eline Van der Velden introduced AI performer Tilly Norwood to the world at the Zurich Summit, boasting that her team had already received interest from multiple talent agencies. The presentation sparked immediate backlash from industry leaders.\n\n\tIn a sit-down with Variety, Van der Velden said, despite the overwhelming backlash, the presence of AI is only going to grow in filmmaking.\n\n\t“I think it will be a slow progression,” she said. “I’m sure in the coming year, there’ll be plenty of effects that will be made with AI. There’ll be some establishing shots, there’ll be some second-unit shots with AI, and then slowly, we’ll progress to a full AI film. And whether people will pay for an AI film or not — I don’t think they’ll know the difference. It’s good storytelling that will be the reason why people will pay for it or not.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeading Indonesian music publisher Massive Music has begun development on an AI powered data-driven technology solution that could assist audiovisual producers in their creative process by more precisely determining the mood and character requirements of a movie or television show.\n\n\tThe search engine has yet to settle a release date, but has been previewed at various international events, including at the ongoing JAFF Market, as a pioneer toolkit for music supervisors.\n\t\n\n\tMassive Music’s approach is centered on efficiency driven by technology and analytics, expanding based on the encouraging results of last year’s Music Supervisor program. The company is providing answers to the industry’s increasing need for a more efficient licensing and curating procedure, they said. \n\n\n\tMassive Music is now working on a data-driven song search engine that is expected to improve the quality and accuracy of music selection for production companies and film studios. The tool aims to drastically cut down on the time it takes to find new music, aiding time efficiency in the production process. Currently the platform carries the musical catalogue available at Massive Music, and they are aiming to further expand on the possibilities of making other musical works available.\n\n\tUp until now, producers, directors, and editors’ “muscle memory” or subjective taste has been a major factor in music searches. This method is laborious and has inherent drawbacks, according to Massive Music. With the search engine, it showcases various charts of the mood and key elements of each song based on a prompt given, or song chosen. It can also detect and file the cue sheet for each work uploaded on the platform. Ganjar Ariel Santosa, COO of Massive Music Entertainment, stated, “We are creating a data-driven technological solution intended to more accurately interpret the mood and character needs of a film or series.”\n\t\n\n\t“We would like to stress that Massive Music is a key partner that provides a comprehensive solution for the music department. The key to making the music discovery process simpler, quicker, and more accurate in this digital age is the combination of a large catalog, technology, and data,” he added.\n",

This episode has it all: A very horny Angela (Ali Larter) doing everything she can to get in a car wreck; Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) fumbling with his speakerphone; a gas leak; dead poachers; and the return of Gallino (Andy Garcia) making big threats. It’s a fun and exciting hour! Let’s dive in:\n\t\n\n\nWhat is killing those cowardly big-game hunters? I’m not mad at it!\n“Life pulled out its big dick and beat me over the head with it.” — Tommy, forever a poet.\n“You know car rides make me horny.” — Angela, saying something no woman has ever said before.\nOf course, Tommy and Angela would get pulled over less than 30 seconds into her trying to give him road head against his will.\nFor someone who’s constantly on speakerphone, Tommy sure is a fuddy-duddy about using it correctly.\nSide note: Does anyone else get distracted when Tommy delivers a line exactly like fellow fuel-obsessed Texan Hank Hill of “King of the Hill”? It makes some of the show’s NSFW dialogue all the funnier.\n“Oh, fuck,” indeed! This gas leak is scary!\nRespectfully, why are we still following Ariana (Paulina Chávez) on her journey? You’re either in the family circle or you’re not on the show…\nThat randy patron Johnny (Mike Harkins) was out of line, but Ariana — you’ve been on the job for five minutes. Stick with it!\n“That’s why God created tits.” The scripture, via Angela.\nI like how Gallino puts on such corporate airs despite being a big cartel boss. His office looks so swanky!\nTommy, dude, Gallino gave Cooper (Jacob Lofland) a sweet deal and doesn’t want to mess with you. Be kind!\n“I bet on your son, which is something you could have done.” Ouch, point to Gallino.\nLove Gallino getting pissed at Tommy, slamming the table and calling him “Thomas.” Good baddie acting from Garcia!\nDamn, all this hacking up and spitting is disgusting!\nWow, an effective horror scene is Jerrell (Elijah Collins) stuck up on the tank, the effects of the gas leak not hitting him until the wind shifts and he can taste it as his device goes crazy.\nDale (James Jordan) once again proves he’s the best character on the show by somehow saving his team.\nI’m worried that Cooper has a legitimate body odor problem — it comes up ALL of the time!\nI’m no accountant, but Monty’s money strategy sounded absolutely outrageous.\n“Frog’s ass watertight?” These southern expressions never fail to surprise a Yankee like me…\nR.I.P. Bonner (Shawn Carter Peterson). Welcome to the show, Bob!\n“Nobody likes a tattletale, Bob!” I mean, Tommy’s right — this is what clubs are for!\nOK, now I want to go to Cattlemen’s Club. I bet the steak prices are outrageous, but Alan (Jim Meskimen) can take care of it. (By the way, after Googling it, I realized that it’s a real club opened by “Landman” co-creator Taylor Sheridan. Love that synergy!)\nBella (Stefania Spampinato) and Angela’s appreciation for each other is a beautiful thing.\nAww, Cami (Demi Moore) delivers a speech about love that is surprisingly sweet, considering we’re breaking bread with a scary drug kingpin.\n“You think life has a big dick? Wait until I hit you with mine!” Ok, Angela, love the spirit, but maybe it’s not your best retort.\nDid Angela just trick Tommy into proposing to her?\n“It’s a popsicle, not a snow cone.” I didn’t need to hear Thornton ever describe a sex act like that, but alright!\nHaunting last scene with Cami and the coyotes wailing in grief. What a performance!\n\n\n\n\tUntil next time, comment below with your favorite southern saying from “Landman.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom Massage Guns to Lego Sets, Here Are 27 Great Gifts For Him\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis Rare and Unrestored 1969 Corvette Could Fetch $1 Million at Auction\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhitecaps in Rare Territory With Playoff Run While for Sale\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBlack Friday Weekend Wrap: Retailers Give a Thumbs-up\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

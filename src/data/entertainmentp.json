    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: The following article discusses plot details from Season 1, Episode 2 of “The Chair Company,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tIt’s not easy to upstage Tim Robinson. The comedian’s signature character is a man whose social unease leads him to act out in big, loud, obnoxious ways — like the hot dog guy from the sketch series “I Think You Should Leave,” or Marvel enthusiast Craig Waterman in the film “Friendship.” Ron Trosper, the protagonist of Robinson’s HBO conspiracy comedy “The Chair Company,” is no exception to this rule. But in Ron’s quest to find out what’s going on with Tecca, the namesake manufacturer of a faulty chair that leads the mall developer to take an embarrassing tumble in front of his colleagues, he encounters many characters who more than match his eccentricities. People like a certain shirt salesman who pitches Ron on his membership program.\n\t\n\n\tIn the second episode of “The Chair Company,” Ron visits the menswear shop Tamblay’s in an attempt to identify his assailant from the series premiere, who warned Ron to stop looking into Tecca before running off and leaving an article of clothing behind as a clue. The Tamblay’s proprietor agrees to help him out, confirming the shirt is one of theirs. The owner even models the item’s wear and tear using a ball he happens to have on hand: “It’s like a big belly and someone’s belly is pushin’ up into the buttons,” the man explains. “He’s about at his limit. I happen to know a guy who’s at his limit.” The emphases, cadence and delivery of this seemingly mundane dialogue combine to make the viewer sit up and ask themselves: Who is that?\n\t\n\n\tThe actor, it turns out, didn’t have to do much to get into character. Jared Lindner is the real-life co-proprietor of Suit Man, a small business located in the Westchester County suburb of Mount Vernon, New York. Lindner’s father founded the store nearly two decades ago, and the two still run Suit Man as a family operation. (You can learn more about the store in this video on the small city’s official YouTube channel.) Robinson himself took notice of Lindner when he swung by the store to scout the location. Lindner didn’t recognize the “Saturday Night Live” alum, but struck up a rapport with the crew: “They started to chuckle, because I’m a pretty easygoing, somewhat young guy,” Lindner tells Variety. The next thing he knew, the production was calling to offer him the part.\n\n\tLindner is patching into our interview directly from Suit Man, where the racks of shirts, ties and socks appear exactly as they do in “The Chair Company.” (During our conversation, Lindner walks around the store, iPhone in hand; at one point, a pair of hands appeared from offscreen to adjust his collar for the Zoom camera.) Lindner’s distinctive voice, a Christopher Walken-esque blend of New York accent, long vowels and soft tone, is also identical to the one that appears in the show. The only real difference is that the actual Lindner is wearing a baseball cap — and instead of helping Robinson’s protagonist with a mystery, he’s singing the praises of the real Robinson to a reporter.\n\n\t“It’s unbelievable how good they are,” Lindner says of Robinson, his creative partner Zach Kanin and their collaborators. “They took someone who had no idea what to do and made me feel comfortable enough to not be nervous,” despite the dozens of crew members crowding into the Suit Man space. Lindner had never so much as read a script before making his acting debut on HBO, but credits Robinson and his team with making him feel at ease. \n\n\t“I think of it like sports,” Lindner says. “When a good team has a very good manager and head coach, they don’t need to yell. They don’t need to tell you what to do. They’re respected enough that everyone has the common goal to just get it done and make them happy.”\n\n\tDirector Andrew DeYoung first worked with Robinson on “Friendship” before coming aboard “The Chair Company” as an executive producer. Though the idea of casting Lindner came from Robinson, DeYoung didn’t require much persuasion. (HBO asked that Lindner at least read for the network before giving the green light, but he quickly came aboard.) “I was chatting with Jared and was like, ‘This guy is so unique and interesting,’” DeYoung recalls. “There’s something about him and his way of being that’s rare and captivating in the sweetest way possible. No one’s making fun of anybody at all, and I hope that’s clear.”\n\t\n\n\tThough a total acting novice like Lindner is an extreme example of its casting strategy, “The Chair Company” generally avoided big names and recognizable faces when populating its strange, extreme world. Besides Robinson, Lake Bell and Sophia Lillis — who play Ron’s wife and daughter, respectively — are probably the best-known series regulars. Everyone else is much less likely to come with pre-existing associations for the audience, which is precisely the point.\n\n\t“There’s an excitement when you don’t have the baggage of somebody that you know,” DeYoung explains. “There are so many brilliant people out there that are trying to be performers — or, in Jared’s case, not — who show up and electrify the screen because they bring something special and unique.” That’s what appeals to him, Robinson and Kanin about figures like Lindner, who can make such an impression in such a short span of time. “What’s beautiful about Tim and Zach [is], even if a character has one line, they feel incredibly rich,” DeYoung says. “That, to me, is so exciting. When you have those specificities, a character shows up and you’re like, ‘I would like to follow them.’ It feels like we’re living in a world that goes beyond the screen.” As “The Chair Company” works to build an entire immersive universe where Ron’s paranoid logic makes a certain kind of sense, it’s helpful to cast figures like Lindner who carry an ingrained sense of authenticity.\n\n\tSuit Man may not have a membership program like Tamblay’s, or an accompanying group chat with five separate guys named Ron in it. But Lindner stresses that he always strives for recurring business. “I always say when a gentleman comes in to see me, I don’t want to sell them one sweater and then never see them again,” he says. “I’d rather sell them a sweater for their wedding, and then their son’s christening, and their other daughter’s baptism, or whatever it is. We’ve made lifelong friends. They’re not even customers.” Even though Lindner says he’s open to acting again after having such a good experience with “The Chair Company,” he’s not abandoning his day job.\n\n\tWhen we spoke, Lindner hadn’t yet gotten the chance to watch his own performance, though he has gone back and watched Robinson’s Comedy Central series “Detroiters” to get a sense of what he might expect from the final product. The prospect of introducing himself to a mass audience is the first time in our conversation where even a hint of actorly self-consciousness comes up. “I hope I don’t make a fool out of myself in front of my wife,” Lindner says. “Everybody told me that I did okay, but I guess I’ll have to see for myself on Sunday.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “A Still Small Voice,” the series finale of “Task,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tThroughout HBO’s “Task,” Maeve Prendergrast (Emilia Jones) is the audience’s eyes, after she discovers that her uncle, Robbie (Tom Pelphrey), is involved in a cat-and-mouse chase with both the FBI and a violent motorcycle gang called the Dark Hearts after killing two of the group’s members, and then kidnapping their son Sam (Ben Doherty) in the wake of their deaths. It’s Maeve who has to watch over Sam, knowing that at any given point, either the Dark Hearts or the FBI might find Robbie.\n\t\n\n\tAfter Robbie dies in Episode 6, Maeve finds herself at a standstill in processing the loss of her uncle, while also simultaneously figuring out how to survive with her niece and nephew after Robbie’s death. In the final moments of the penultimate episode, Maeve receives the bag of money that Robbie had been trying to hide before his death, giving her the opportunity to make a new life if she is able to get away from the Dark Hearts.\n\n\n\tWith the realization that the Dark Hearts are coming to find her, it’s down to the wire for Maeve and the rest of the Prendergrast family to hide the money, and get as far away from them as possible before it’s too late.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Peter Kramer/HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJones spoke with Variety about Maeve and Robbie’s family dynamic, how Robbie’s death affects Maeve throughout the series finale and staging the final fight scene with Jayson, the Dark Heart final boss (Sam Keeley).\n\t\n\t\tRobbie dies in Episode 6, and in the episode’s final moments, Maeve is given the bag of Robbie’s money at her doorstep. She realizes she’s the only person who knows the whereabouts of what the Dark Hearts are looking for, and leading into Episode 7, it’s a lot that she’s grappling with.\t\n\n\tMaeve has always been so clever, so the minute she has the bag of money in her hand, she’s like, “Who’s going to want this?” She knows that people are going to come after her and the kids. But, at the same time, she’s just happy that Robbie’s plan worked out. It’s a moment of very mixed emotions for her.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow does Robbie’s sacrifice change the way Maeve feels about him?\t\n\n\tFor a long time, Maeve was torn between feeling resentment towards Robbie and feeling so much love towards him. She’s had to pick up the pieces and be the strong adult figure in the relationship. When you first meet Maeve, she’s just so tired of picking up the pieces and cleaning up the mess that Robbie makes. At the end of the show, when Maeve realizes that Robbie sacrificed himself with this plan, and it worked out [because] he wouldn’t stop until it was successful, she has a lot of respect for him and she just knows that no matter whatever Robbie did, he was always thinking of other people. Even when he’s being questioned by Tom [Mark Ruffalo], Robbie’s like, “Please keep Maeve out of it.”\n\n\tRobbie really does have a heart of gold, and I think that’s what Brad [Ingelsby] does so well with the moral ambiguity. The bad guys can have good hearts and the good guys can have bad hearts. The scene with Grasso [Fabien Frankel] when he gives her the warning is a really good moment for his character, because it shows you that for all of his flaws, he’s learned from his mistakes. Same with Tom, and how he lets Maeve keep the money at the end.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a scene in the first episode where Robbie and Maeve are talking on the porch, and we get more insight as to their family dynamic after her father’s death. There’s generational trauma that has been deep inside Robbie, and now Maeve. So how does her family’s past affect the decisions she makes throughout the season?\t\n\n\tShe hasn’t had the time or space to really mourn the loss of her father, and she’s been pushing it deeper and deeper inside of her and blocking it out. The scene on the porch that you mentioned is a really important scene for Maeve, because it’s the first time that she really says what she’s feeling. No matter what you throw at Maeve, she takes it, because she’s tough. It’s the first time for Robbie when he realizes that there’s this 21-year-old girl standing in front of him asking for help after she lost her father. That’s why Robbie’s death is so hard for her to deal with, because Jayson killed her dad and her uncle.\n\t\n\t\tThe finale has a final showdown at the Prendergrast house, where Jayson has discovered that Maeve has the bag of money hidden somewhere. What was it like staging that final scene with Sam Keeley and the rest of the cast?\t\n\n\tIt was exciting! I was crossing over with characters that I hadn’t really fully crossed over with before. We were all aware that it was the climax of the show, and there was immense pressure for us because we wanted to make sure that we could do it the best that we could. We did all of our own stunts, and it was so much fun and challenging because I was using my body in ways I’d never used it before. Sam is such an intense actor and throws himself in. It was really great to bounce off of. The scene after we’re in the chicken coop and Maeve gets away and Jayson grabs her back, I was really trying to run away, and he was really trying to grab me, and we just kept going on filming because the team wanted to let the scene play out for as long as possible.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a scene where Maeve is looking at the money in the finale, where she says that Robbie would have wanted the family to have it so that they could have a better life. At the very end of the episode, Maeve and the kids have moved out of the house and are on their way to a new destination. What do you like to imagine that Maeve’s “better life” would be?\t\n\n\tI hope that she can build a nice, comfortable environment for her and the kids, and give them the life that they deserve after such a hard start. I also really hope that she can kind of do things for herself for once, since she’s so young and her whole kind of younger years have been shouldering so much adult responsibility. I hope that with Robbie’s help and the money, she can really start to think about herself and put herself and the kids first, and they can have a really comfortable life where she doesn’t have to worry.\n\t\n\t\tThis is your first time working with Brad Ingelsby, so if you could return back to work with him on a future project, what genre would you like to see him explore next?\t\n\n\tI would do anything for Brad. His writing is so authentic and nuanced, and he’s just so lovely. “Task” is a crime show, but with love, loss, family and forgiveness, and all of these relatable and intense themes, but, with a whole lot of action, so it’s a little bit for everyone. Every character has such a layered backstory, and if any Brad Ingelsby project was to come to me again, I would absolutely jump at the chance to work with him again.\n\t\n\t\tI also learned that while you were filming “Task” in Philadelphia, you saw Olivia Rodrigo in concert with Fabien Frankel and some of the crew during your downtime. \t\n\n\tOh my god, we did! You know what’s sad? Mark arranged the whole concert and got everyone the tickets, and he created a group chat and was like “Guys, we’re gonna go meet her after,” and then he had to work! Mark had to go film for “Task,” so everyone else got to go to Olivia Rodrigo after he had literally organized the whole thing! Fabien and I got all of the merchandise, and he had the purple sunglasses with the Olivia Rodrigo tour T-shirt. He’s such an Olivia fan, and he was singing all the words to “Vampire.”\n\n\t“Task” is quite dark in places, so it was just so nice to go to an Olivia Rodrigo concert on the weekend and switch off for a second during filming. It was such a great experience.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tIna Garten’s “Be My Guest” returns this Sunday with an all-star lineup and the kind of cozy, conversational charm that made the series a daytime staple. The seventh season premieres Oct. 19 at 11 a.m. ET on Food Network, with new episodes featuring Tina Fey, “Gilded Age” star Christine Baranski, violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman and fashion designer Daniel Roseberry.\n\n\tFor fans looking to stream the new season, the best option is DIRECTV, which offers access to Food Network’s live broadcast and HBO Max, where new episodes become available on demand. DIRECTV’s PREMIER package includes HBO Max at no additional cost, while other DIRECTV streaming and satellite TV plans let subscribers add it for $16.99 a month and they get the first 3 months included at no extra cost. DIRECTV offers three months of HBO Max and along with other premium channels — like Paramount+ with Showtime, Cinemax and STARZ — when signing up for select packages.1\n\t\n\n\tPer Food Network’s description for “Be My Guest” Season 7, “In the season premiere, Ina knows Tina Fey loves custard desserts – so she greets her with Breakfast Panna Cotta.  Tina then shares childhood revelations, standout standup moments and stories about life on the road with her best friend Amy Poehler.  Finally, the duo team up in the kitchen to make a dream dinner of Tina’s Greek Lemon Potatoes served with Ina’s Chicken Thighs with Creamy Mustard Sauce.”\n\n\n\tLater in the season, Baranski will stop by for Maple-Oatmeal Scones, Perlman will try Potato Galette with Smoked Salmon and Roseberry will try Tri-Berry Ricotta Cake.\n\t\n\n\tSince premiering in 2022, “Be My Guest” has helped Garten transcend her Food Network roots to become a full-fledged lifestyle and entertainment figure, blurring the line between culinary television and celebrity interview. The show’s relaxed format — equal parts chat, cooking demo and introspective sit-down interview — has drawn comparisons to longform celebrity conversations like “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction” and “Hot Ones,” positioning Garten as a kind of Hamptons-set cultural interviewer.\n\n\tStream “Be My Guest” Season 7 on DIRECTV here.2\n*w/eligible pkg.

    "body": "\n\tKorean film “The World of Love” has secured a Chinese distribution deal with Light Films Limited, marking a significant breakthrough in a market that has been largely closed to Korean cinema for nearly a decade.\n\n\tThe acquisition by Light Films Limited represents a rare achievement in the current landscape, as “Oh! My Gran” was the only Korean film to receive an official Chinese theatrical release in the past 10 years, when it opened in 2021.\n\t\n\n\tThe Chinese distributor specializes in arthouse cinema, with a track record of curating international film festival standouts. Its notable acquisitions include Kim Do-young’s “Kim Ji-Young: Born 1982,” Kore-eda Hirokazu’s “Nobody Knows,” and Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite.”\n\n\n\t“The perspective of this feminist film is refreshingly new,” said Li Na, CEO of Light Films. “While it explores trauma and its lasting impact, its underlying tone is warm and uplifting, which makes it all the more moving and encouraging.”\n\n\tDirected by Yoon Ga-eun, acclaimed for “The World of Us” (Berlinale 2016) and “The House of Us” (BFI London 2019), the drama centers on 17-year-old Lee Jooin (Seo Su-bin), an unpredictable high school student whose angry outburst creates ripple effects throughout her world.\n\n\tThe film world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and took home both the Roberto Rossellini Awards Jury Prize and the People’s Choice Award in the Pingyao International Film Festival‘s Crouching Tigers section. Chinese interest surged following the festival’s Asian premiere, with strong buzz and reviews from local audiences on platforms including Douban.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is produced by Semosi and Vol Media, with Barunson E&A — the South Korean studio behind Oscar-winning “Parasite” and Kim Jee-woon’s Cannes title “Cobweb” — serving as both presenting studio and sales agent.\n\n\tThe Chinese deal joins previously announced distribution agreements with veteran Japanese distributor Bitters End, Hong Kong’s Edko Films, and Taiwan’s Andrews Film across key Asian territories.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNo one would have expected Taylor Swift‘s “The Life of a Showgirl” to lose its grip on the album chart in week 2, and it indeed held on at the top of the Billboard 200, with 338,000 equivalent album units in its second week out. \n\n\tLast week, Swift set a record in the Luminate/Soundscan-era data-keeping books with 4.002 million units. Although this week’s figure marked a predictably significant drop-off from that record-buster, even the second week for “Showgirl” ranked as the fifth best week for any album this year, per Billboard and Luminate. The only albums that had a higher number than 338,000 units in a single frame this year were first-week figures for releases from Wallen (who opened with 493,000), the Weeknd (who started with 490,000), Sabrina Carpenter (which started with 366K) and, of course, Swift’s own debut tally.\n\t\n\n\tBreaking down that 338K figure for Swift’s second week, 101,000 of those units came in the form of pure album sales, Billboard reported. That sales figure represented the biggest drop for “Showgirl” in week 2, down 97%, after a first week that included all the pre-sales for the album, plus a number of release-week-only variants. Nonetheless, 101,000 is a pure-sales figure that few contemporary albums ever reach in a week, and “Showgirl” had little competition in easily standing atop Billboard’s separate Top Album Sales chart for a second week. \n\n\n\tStreaming had a stronger hold, down from the juggernaut first-week figure by only 55%. The album’s tracks picked up a still-staggering 307.59 million on-demand official streams, which calculated out in the chart formula to 236,000 SEA (streaming equivalent album) units. Needless to say, “Showgirl” didn’t have any challengers in returning to No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Streaming Albums chart.\n\t\n\n\tWallen’s “I’m the Problem” spent a dozen nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 this year. That’s a run at the top of the Billboard 200 that Swift will no doubt be hoping to match in the coming months. Looking at the release schedule, it appears as if there won’t be a lot standing in the way of an extended reign, as there are no further obvious pop blockbusters currently scheduled to come out between now and the end of 2025, barring any last-minute surprises from a superstar.\n\n\tWith no music stars interested in putting albums out right now in Swift’s shadow, there were no new entries in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for the week ending Oct. 10.\n\n\tThe only relatively fresh blood on the chart is in Olivia Dean’s “The Art of Loving,” which debuted at No. 8 two weeks ago, then rose one spot to No. 7 last week, and is up yet one more spot to No. 6 in week 3. The latest weekly tally for the album is 36,000 equivalent album units, up 5% from the previous week.\n\n\tEverything else in the top 10 is very familiar fare — perhaps overly familiar, for some tastes. Following Swift near the top of the list are the “KPop Demon Hunters” soundtrack at No. 2 (104,000 units), Wallen’s “I’m the Problem” at No. 3 (79,000 units), Cardi B’s “Am I the Drama?” in fourth place (50,000) and Sabrina Carpenter’s “Man’s Best Friend” in the No. 5 spot (45,000)\n\n\tFollowing Dean at No. 6 are Bad Bunny’s “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” in seventh place (33,000 units), SZA’s “SOS” at No. 8 (32,000), Alex Warren’s “You’ll Be Alright, Kid” — not to be confused with Swift’s “You’re on Your Own, Kid,” of course — at No. 9 (32,000) and, finally, a second Wallen mega-seller, “One Thing at a Time,” in 10th place (31,000).\n\n\tResults for the Hot 100 will come in Monday, with Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia” expected to repeat at the top there as well.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Black Phone 2,” a sequel to Universal and Blumhouse’s 2022 hit slasher film, scared up $42 million at the global box office in its first weekend of release.\n\n\tThose ticket sales included a softer $15.5 million from 71 international territories as well as a leading $26.5 million in the United States and Canada. Top overseas openings were Mexico with $4.3 million, the United Kingdom and Ireland with $1.4 million and Brazil with $1.2 million.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Scott Derrickson, “The Black Phone 2” follows the return of the deranged serial killer known as the Grabber (Ethan Hawke). Initial ticket sales for the second film were slightly ahead of its predecessor, which launched to $13 million overseas and $35.8 million worldwide in 2022. The first “Black Phone,” which cost $18 million, became a sleeper hit with $161 million globally. The sequel, which carries a larger $30 million price tag, shouldn’t have trouble justifying its budget. However, it needs to stick around on the big screen beyond opening weekend to count as a major comeback for Blumhouse. The horror empire has struggled in 2025 with a string of flops, including “Wolf Man” and “M3GAN 2.0.” Another sequel, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” is scheduled for December.\n\n\n\t“Black Phone 2” was this weekend’s only major newcomer at the international box office. Elsewhere, Disney’s sci-fi sequel “Tron: Ares” earned $14.1 million from 52 markets, declining about 50% from its debut. So far, the film has grossed $48.4 million overseas and $103 million globally after two weekends of release. That’s a decent tally, especially for a franchise in its fifth decade — except that Disney spent $180 million to produce and many millions to promote the sequel, so “Tron: Ares” is shaping up to become a major money loser for the studio.\n\t\n\n\tAnother expensive film, Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio’s “One Battle After Another” added $11.8 million overseas, impressively down just 21% from the prior weekend. The Warner Bros. release has generated $100 million internationally and $162.5 million globally. It’s an impressive result for the original, R-rated action comedy (one that’s likely to find itself in the awards race). However, it’s likely to end its theatrical run in the red for Warner Bros., which spent more than $130 million on production and $70 million on promotional efforts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRobert De Niro is telling Americans to keep protesting against Donald Trump.\n\n\tAfter Saturday’s nationwide No Kings protests, De Niro told MSNBC that the country needs to show “much more” resistance, because that’s “the only thing the politicians are going to recognize.” He added that we need to make lawmakers “more afraid of the wrath of the people” than the “wrath of Trump.”\n\n\t“We can’t let up,” De Niro said. “Cannot let up on him because he is not going to leave the White House. He does not want to leave the White House. He will not leave the White House. Anybody thinks he, oh, he’ll do this, he’ll do that, it’s just deluding themselves.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “The Republicans, most of all, because they know, but they’re going along with it. It’s a classic bully situation. We see it, and there’s no other way to face a bully. You have to face him and fight it out and back them off and back him down. That’s the only way this is going to work.”\n\n\tThe Oct. 18 No Kings protests were joined by nearly 7 million people, according to MSNBC. ICE’s aggressive immigration crackdown remains a key issue in the nationwide demonstrations, as they were during the first No Kings protests in June. National Guard presence in major cities and sweeping cuts to federal programs were also major motivators for participants. \n\n\tDe Niro was one of the many Hollywood mainstays to speak out in support of the No Kings movement. On Oct. 9, he appeared in a video on the TikTok account of political activist group Indivisible to encourage people to attend the No Kings protests.\n\t\n\n\t“The original No Kings protest was 250 years ago,” De Niro said. “Americans decided they didn’t want to live under the rule of King George III. They declared their independence and fought a bloody war for democracy. We’ve had two and a half centuries of democracy since then. Often challenging, sometimes messy, always essential.”\n\n\tHe continued, “Now we have a would-be king who wants to take it away: King Donald the First. Fuck that. We’re rising up again, this time, nonviolently raising our voices to declare: No Kings.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s no big shock to see that commentators on the right, the far right, and the extreme alt-right (I think that covers the waterfront), from Ben Shapiro to film critic Armond White, have pounced on “One Battle After Another,” accusing it of being a “left-wing” movie made for left-wing elites sitting in their left-wing bubble. The forces on the right, led by President Trump, will now say that about almost anything. They treated yesterday’s No Kings protest, with its massive surge of outraged citizens, as if it were some lunatic-fringe collection of hippie terrorists.\n\t\n\n\tIt was a tad more surprising to see the same criticism of “One Battle After Another” made by Bret Easton Ellis, who thinks that reviewers have hailed Paul Thomas Anderson’s film, and overpraised it, “because it really aligns with this kind of leftist sensibility.” Ellis later added on his podcast, “You have the left and the entertainment press propping this movie up to such an absurd degree that it felt unnatural.” I consider myself a fan of Ellis’s (I was a guest on his podcast once), and relish the independence of his voice, so the fact that he isn’t wild about “One Battle After Another” is fine with me. I’m all for debate. But I think that tagging the film with the “leftist” label feeds into the very same cliché mindset that Ellis thinks he’s fighting.\n\n\n\tWhat’s more, if you believe, as I do, that part of the power of “One Battle After Another” is that it is not, in fact, a left-wing movie, it’s important to recognize how that misperception has been fed by a lot of people…on the left. The movie, which is set in an authoritarian America that resembles the one we could be heading toward (it anticipates what the country might start to look like if Trump invokes the Insurrection Act), is centered, for a while, on a ragtag band of revolutionary guerrillas. And since the movie is certainly on their side, I think a lot of the attitude of the entertainment media has been to reflexively treat “One Battle After Another” as if the film itself were raising a revolutionary fist — and as if there were something “left-wing” about attacking authoritarianism. There is not.\n\t\n\n\tThis isn’t merely a matter of semantics. In a strange way, the lionization of “One Battle After Another” as a cinematic manifesto, a movie that sees itself as part of “the resistance” and tips its hat to the glory of being a “radical,” has fed directly into the skewed right-wing view of the film. At times, it’s almost as if the right and the left agree on what “OBAA” is: a romantic salute to revolution. They just don’t agree on where they come down on it.\n\n\tBut see, that word “revolution” is more loaded than people think. And so is “left-wing.” They may just be words, but they have helped to create the lens through which “One Battle After Another” is being viewed. As someone who loved the film, and found it to be a potent statement, but does not consider it a “left-wing” vision, I thought I would try to clarify why “One Battle After Another” should really escape that label, regardless of which side is doing the labeling. Here’s why. \n\n\tThe film borrows the iconography of late ’60s/early ’70s “revolutionaries.” But that world, and the movie’s world, could not be more different. In the film’s opening section, the underground rebels, known as the French 75, are characterized in a way that nods to the counterculture radicals of 55 years ago. One of the film’s most indelible images is that of Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor), in her khakis and boots and open plaid shirt and wool cap, firing a machine gun balanced on her pregnant belly — an image that looks like a Black Panther/Symbionese Liberation Army fever dream. The French 75 launch their insurrectionary acts (bombings, bank robberies, breaking into an immigration-detention facility to free the prisoners) with an overthrow-the-system bravura that nods to that earlier time.\n\n\tBut here’s the difference. The Black Panthers fought for Civil Rights, but by the late ’60s and early ’70s many of the radicals of the counterculture had the stated goal of overthrowing, you know…America. At the time, this was regarded by the overwhelming majority of Americans, including liberals, as an extreme and even crackpot idea. By the time of the rise of the Weather Underground (whose great achievement was accidentally blowing up a Greenwich Village townhouse, killing three of their own members), many of the radicals of the era were starting to look not just extreme but scurrilous.\n\t\n\n\tSo why does “One Battle After Another” pay homage to them? Because they possessed a militant impulse that struck a chord in the popular imagination. Yet the two situations could hardly be more different. At the end of the ’60s, America was not an authoritarian regime. “One Battle After Another,” by contrast, takes place in a police state where the cops and the military have joined forces to patrol an autocratic society, with basic rights stripped away. That is what the French 75 are rebelling against. Does that make them “left-wing”? No, it makes them freedom fighters who are trying to crack a fascist nation back open.\n\n\tHow could anyone think the film starts in 2008? The timeline of “One Battle After Another” might be a little confusing, for several reasons. The film is loosely based on the Thomas Pynchon novel “Vineland,” which is set in the Reagan ’80s; Anderson, looking ahead (the film was shot last year), reconfigured the book into a dystopian projection of what a Trump regime might look like. But a host of progressive critics and writers, obsessed with the idea that the movie is about what’s going on right now, man, have stated that the heart of the action is set quite specifically in the present day. That would mean that the opening 45 minutes, which is set 16 years before that (when the French 75 are going wild), would take place in 2008. But the vision of oppression the movie conjures has nothing to do with the vibe of 2008 (the start of the Obama era). And the power of “OBAA” is that it’s not a literal vision of today. It’s a spiritual projection of where we could land.\n\n\tThe film’s ragtag band of radicals are not glorified. On the contrary, they’re shown to be deeply flawed. This, I think, gets to the heart of why Paul Thomas Anderson has made a movie about radicals that is not, in itself, a piece of firebrand “radicalism.” How imperfect are the French 75? In many ways, the film’s key character is Perfidia Beverly Hills, who’s portrayed as a ruthlessly charismatic rebel leader, until she has her baby (the secret father is Sean Penn’s ramrod-rigid Col. Lockjaw), at which point her lover and partner, Bob Herbert (Leonardo DiCaprio), says: We’re a family now. Our priorities have to pivot away from revolution. Anderson, who has four children with Maya Rudolph, stages this moment with notable conviction. It’s the first thing that makes us take notice of DiCaprio’s character as a morally complex being. But Perfidia is having none of it. She’s placed (by Lockjaw) in the Witness Protection Program, and then hustles over the border to Mexico, leaving the revolution — and, more to the point, her child — behind. The movie does not respect this.\n\t\n\n\tCut to 16 years later. The revolution is in tatters, and Bob is a stoner sitting around in his bathrobe. He is still, in his way, a devoted father, but apart from that he’s blitzed, navel-gazing, dissipated. This is not a revolutionary we can exactly salute. What’s more, the film’s funniest joke has been widely misinterpreted by media progressives. When Bob calls the French 75 headquarters and keeps failing to remember the proper espionage code phrase (the answer to the question “What time is it?”), many have interpreted this to simply be a sign of how fried his brain is. But that wouldn’t be a funny joke. DiCaprio’s acting in this section — his steam-out-the-ears frustration at the fact that the operator won’t give him a pass on remembering the damn code — is brilliant, and puts the audience right on his side. The bureaucratic fussiness of the operator is clearly meant to be a satire of doctrinaire left-wing rigidity.\n\n\tThe attack on “OBAA” for being “left-wing” could almost be an early salvo in the Oscar race. Speaking of battles, the Academy Awards already look like they’re shaping up to be a four-way war: “One Battle After Another” vs. “Hamnet,” with “Sinners” and “Marty Supreme” coming up on the side. Attacking “OBAA” on ideological grounds sounds like something right out of the anti-“Green Book” playbook. I don’t think that’s where the argument ultimately came from, but it’s one that could easily be exploited by opposing forces.     \n\n\tWhat Is “One Battle After Another” Actually About? It’s the Authoritarianism, Stupid. If you scanned the media coverage of it, you might think “One Battle After Another” was the story of a revolution. It is (sort of). But not really. For 45 minutes or so, it looks like that. But the guerrilla rebellion fails, and while Bob is helped out by Sensei Sergio St. Carlos (Benicio del Toro), the leader of an underground railroad for immigrants, the revolution comes down to a father rescuing his daughter. That’s emotionally powerful, but the portrayal of “resistance” is less potent than the film’s portrayal of authoritarianism itself, and of how directly that connects with what’s happening in America today. The real revolution going on in this country now is the Christian nationalist revolution — an attempt to upend the American Dream and replace it with a theocracy. And the film dares to unveil that; its portrait of the Christmas Adventurers is a chilling vision of hate. That’s all the message the movie needs: that this is happening, that the right-wing revolution is on. And that there are people in America who still want to stop it. To suggest that portraying all that is “left-wing,” even if that’s the side you think you’re on, is to play right into the propaganda. It’s to win the battle of self-righteousness and lose the war.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“God Save the King” has never been the loveliest or most melodic of national anthems, and its somewhat chiding, aggressive tenor is brought to the fore early in “The Choral.” Upon delivery of some good news from the front in the grim midst of the First World War, an English village choir’s lusty, spontaneous rendition of the song disrupts their rather shabbier rehearsal of Edward Elgar’s complex, haunting oratorio “The Dream of Gerontius,” prompting refined choirmaster Dr. Henry Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes) to roll his eyes to the back of his head. “If only you sang Elgar with the confidence you sing the national anthem,” he mutters. Art counts for a lot more than patriotism to Guthrie, and the happy surprise of Nicholas Hytner‘s film — despite its twee, veddy English trappings — is that it largely takes his side.\n\t\n\n\tPerhaps that’s not such a surprise. “The Choral” is, after all, the first original screenplay in over 40 years by Alan Bennett, a 91-year-old national treasure whose place in the British cultural firmament has never been tidily defined: A queer, agnostic, working-class Northerner, he’s a staunch royalist who declined a knighthood, and whose politics have traveled along a spectrum he once described as “conservative socialism.” Many of those contrasts and conflicts are present in “The Choral” — some for better, some for worse, but quite interestingly in all cases — even if Hytner, the director who previously filmed Bennett’s scripts for “The Madness of King George,” “The History Boys” and “The Lady in the Van,” gives the overall package a deceptively buttery gloss of tea-and-crumpets nostalgia.\n\t\n\n\tAt first glance, the film seems a twinkly fusion of two brands of British feelgood crowdpleaser: the keep-calm-and-carry-on portrait of wartime resilience, and the let’s-put-on-a-show underdog story, like “The Full Monty” with the radio dial tuned to “Land of Hope and Glory” rather than “You Sexy Thing.” The year is 1916, the setting the picturesque (and fictional) Yorkshire mill town of Ramsden — the rolling hills and cobbled, honey-filtered streets of which seem safely sheltered from the war raging over on the Continent, but for its depleting effect on the town’s young menfolk. With each wave of conscription, they depart from the town’s quaint train station, bright-eyed and crisply uniformed, only to return embittered and incomplete, if at all.\n\n\tUntil his own name is called, 17-year-old postboy Lofty (Oliver Briscombe) spends his days delivering messages of tragedy to newly bereaved women around Ramsden, though his randy pal Ellis (Taylor Uttley) looks on the bright side: “Grief, it’s an opportunity,” he says cheerily. There’s an opportunity for the boys, too, in the village chorus, sorely deprived by the draft of male voices — and soon its young choirmaster too. Enter Guthrie, an urbane, prodigious conductor formerly of some renown, though much disapproved of by the locals on several counts, not least among them the fact that he spent several years living and studying in Germany. His unapologetic atheism doesn’t help; nor do further “peculiarities” that nobody precisely wants to name. “Let’s just say I’d prefer a family man,” says priggish board member Duxbury (Roger Allam), and leaves it at that.\n\n\tGuthrie’s gayness remains more or less covert throughout Bennett’s script, though Fiennes plays him with a typically graceful, understated air of melancholy, his mourning turned inward for loves and lovers he can never name. There are unanswered overtures from the choir’s pianist Horner (Robert Emms), a soft, vulnerable young man whose conscientious-objector status renders him a fellow outsider. But “The Choral” is more preoccupied with the romantic lives of its younger characters, as Ellis, Lofty and their fellow teen soldiers-to-be desperately seek to lose their virginities before potentially losing their lives. Those in their sights include Mary (Amara Okereke), a golden-voiced Salvation Army officer yet to loosen so much as one button, and Bella (Emily Fairn), a pluckier sort anxiously awaiting the return of her wounded boyfriend Clyde (heartbreaking ensemble standout Jacob Dudman), though perhaps not equipped to nurse his trauma. \n\t\n\n\tBennett’s script flits inconsistently between generations, foregrounding certain perspectives before they suddenly recede, though the film is never less than diverting — with Guthrie’s ambitious plan to stage Elgar’s elevated work (with an off-key choir and a three-person orchestra) lending proceedings a satisfying narrative thrust. If it doesn’t culminate in the against-the-odds artistic triumph you might expect, there’s a more nuanced, honest moral here in favor of artistic aspiration, integrity and compromise all at once, via a hilariously deflating, supercilious cameo from Simon Russell Beale as Elgar himself.\n\n\tBut then the film is best when it chafes quietly against our expectations of gentle British comfort viewing, whether sharing in Guthrie’s dry exasperation at demonstrations of national pride, or eschewing dewy romanticism for its sole, unlikely sex scene: a passionless, reluctant handjob on the moors, discreetly depicted but tenderly illustrative of bodies and souls broken by war and English reserve. There are ugly open wounds in “The Choral,” even if they’ve been carefully and handsomely dressed by Mike Eley’s pristine, wheaty lensing, George Fenton’s luxurious scoring and Jenny Beavan’s perfectly pressed costumes. At its best, Bennett’s writing cuts through the gauze.\n",

    "body": "The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures hosted its fifth annual gala at the Academy Museum in Los Angeles last night in support of the museum’s education initiatives, public programming and future exhibitions. This year’s Gala raised over $12 million in donations for the general public and the local community of Los Angeles. \nThe gala was presented in partnership with Rolex, a founding supporter and official watch partner of the Academy Museum. The gala was co-chaired by Jon M. Chu, Common, Viola Davis, Julius Tennon, Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, Jennifer Hudson and Academy Museum Trustee Alejandro Ramírez Magaña.\nThe event honored four important voices in the entertainment industry for their contributions to film, both past and present. The first presenter of the night was Wim Wenders, who presented director Walter Salles with the Luminary Award. The Vantage Award was presented by Jon M. Chu to actor and comedian Bowen Yang, alongside Zoe Saldaña, who presented the Icon Award to actress Penélope Cruz during the night. The final award, the inaugural Legacy Award, was presented by Martin Scorsese to musician Bruce Springsteen. \nGeorge Clooney introduced a musical performance by Bruce Springsteen, where he closed out the event singing “Streets of Philadelphia,” “Atlantic City” and “Land of Hope and Dreams.”\nThe Icon, Legacy, Luminary and Vantage Awards were designed by the Haas Brothers and fabricated by UAP. The awards are solid cast bronze, hand-polished, hand-stamped and triple plated in nickel, copper and 24k gold.  \nThe event design was conceived by Keith Baptista, with talent relations overseen by Special Projects. \nSee the best looks from the 2025 Academy Gala below.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharli xcx\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCharli xcx wears YSL.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKim Kardashian\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tKim Kardashian wears Maison Margiela by Glenn Marten.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJacob Elordi\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJacob Elordi wears Bottega Veneta.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Rodrigo\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOlivia Rodrigo wears Armani Privé.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSelena Gomez\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSelena Gomez attends the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJenna Ortega\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJenna Ortega wears Grace Ling.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Zegler\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Zegler wears Tamara Ralph.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDamson Idris\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDamson Idris wears DIDRIS Jewelry at the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Sennott\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRachel Sennott wears Balenciaga.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAyo Edebiri\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAyo Edebiri wears Chanel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElle Fanning\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElle Fanning wears Balenciaga.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHailey Bieber\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tHailey Bieber wears Schiaparelli.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tViola Davis\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tViola Davis wears Gucci.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGreta Lee\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGreta Lee wears Dior.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDemi Moore and Lucy Liu\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDemi Moore and Lucy Liu attend the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMilly Alcock\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMilly Alcock wears Harris Reed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMikey Madison\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Michael Buckner/WWD\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMikey Madison wears Dior.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMartin and Francesca Scorsese\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMartin and Francesca Scorsese attend the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSydney Sweeney\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSydney Sweeney wears Giorgio Armani.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSeth Rogen and Lauren Miller Rogen\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSeth Rogen and Lauren Miller Rogen attend the Fifth Annual Academy Museum Gala.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

Mahomes clearly yells out \"This f***ing never f***ing works man\" and stays fully upright -- apparently overcome with frustration to the point he's gesturing toward his sideline in anger.\n      \n    \n          He then crouches again ... and actually runs a play -- a run up the middle by Kareem Hunt for the first down!\n      \n    \n      \n      It’s a Mahomes kind of morning 👋 pic.twitter.com/CNJrwAJULg— Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) October 19, 2025\n              @Chiefs\n          \n  \n    \n          Mahomes is a pro ... so we seriously doubt he was pissed off about the play. More likely he's hoping to win the ESPY For \"Best Leading Actor\" at next year's ceremony.\n      \n    \n          The Chiefs decimated an abysmal Raiders squad 31-0. The win moves the Chiefs up to 4-3 this season; the Raiders will fall to 2-5 with the loss.\n      \n    \n          Looks like Patrick's adding a little insult to injury with this one ... 'cause no matter what plan Mahomes runs, it tends to work anyway.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Patrick Mahomes\n              \n                          \n                Kansas City Chiefs\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                NFL\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

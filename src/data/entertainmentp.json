    "body": "\n\tThe Playmaker has come on board as the international sales agent for the upcoming family entertainment movie “Barry & Me,” which will have its pre-sales launch at the American Film Market in Los Angeles (Nov. 11 – 16).\n\n\tOn a snowy mountain pass, a boy befriends and raises a St. Bernard puppy, but when others threaten to take his beloved dog away, he risks everything to protect their bond.\n\n\n\tDirected by German filmmaker Markus Welter, the film is inspired by the Swiss legend of the famous barrel-wearing rescue dog who helped recover dozens of people swept up in avalanches in the 1800s. This version, however, focuses on his friendship with 12-year-old Georg, who discovers and secretly raises the puppy in a mountain hospice, leading to adventures in the Swiss alps.\n\t\n\n\t“Barry & Me” is a Swiss-German co-production from Atlantis Pictures and MMC Zodiac, supported by Zürcher Filmstiftung, Deutscher Filmförderungfonds, Film- und Medienstiftung NRW, Bundesamt für Kultur, Filmförderungsanstalt FFA, SUISSIMAGE, Kanton Luzern and Valais Film Commission.\n\n\n\tThe distributors in Germany and Switzerland are Wild Bunch and Ascot Elite, respectively. The film will start in Swiss cinemas in January and in Germany in March 2026.\n\n\t“As a little boy, I was captivated by the image of the legendary St. Bernard with the wooden barrel — a timeless Swiss icon. ‘Barry & Me’ is a heartwarming adventure that will enchant audiences of all ages and win hearts around the world,” Moritz Hemminger, head of sales and acquisitions at The Playmaker, said.\n\t\n\n\t“I want to tell Barry’s story with this film because it has deeply moved me. Barry represents courage, compassion, and that quiet greatness that lies in helping others. He saved countless human lives without ever asking for anything in return – and that is where his greatness lies. To me, Barry is a symbol of humanity and of the unbreakable bond between humans and animals, a bond that transcends both time and language,” producer Marcel Wolfisberg of Atlantis Pictures said.\n\n\t“After producing ‘Heidi,’ I knew how well stories about friendship and courage can move audiences. With ‘Barry & Me,’ we continue that tradition: a big family adventure inspired by the Swiss legend of Barry and the extraordinary friendship between a boy and his dog,” Lukas Hobi, a co-producer on the film for MMC Zodiac, said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAustralian actress Abbie Cornish, whose credits include “Limitless” and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” and Scottish actor Dougray Scott, who appeared in “Crime” and “Enigma,” are set to star in Southern African action thriller series “The Invisible.”\n\n\tThe cast also features South Africa’s Kim Engelbrecht (“Reyka,” “Eye in the Sky”), Tim Theron (“Trackers,” “Heart of the Hunter”) and Tumisho Masha (“Mandela’s Gun,” “Invasion”).\n\t\n\n\tM-Net, ITV Studios, Scene23 and Berkeley Media Group will produce “The Invisible,” an eight-part adaptation of Deon Meyer’s novel “Blood Safari.” It is distributed internationally by ITV Studios.\n\n\n\tIn the area surrounding South Africa’s Kruger National Park, a mysterious killer begins executing local poachers. As the body count rises, local Inspector Jack Phatudi is drawn into a dangerous manhunt to unmask the vigilante.\n\n\tAt the same time, Dekker — a former bodyguard with a haunted past — is hired to protect Emma, a South African expat, who returns home to search for her brother who she believes is still alive, despite his disappearance 20 years ago.\n\n\tWhen Phatudi’s investigation collides with Emma and Dekker’s quest, they uncover a buried conspiracy reaching back to the political assassination of a pivotal African leader. As powerful forces close in, all three are forced to confront the explosive truth — one that could rewrite history, and that others will kill to keep hidden.\n\n\t“The Invisible” is directed by Jozua Malherbe, who helmed previous Meyer adaptations “Devil’s Peak” and “Trackers,” and Amy Jephta, known for “Barakat” and “Catch Ae a Killer.” The series is created by Meyer, who is an exec producer alongside Cornish and Scott, and William Josef Schneider, with the latter taking the lead in writing the adaptation. Tina Kruger serves as creative EP.\n\t\n\n\t“To say I’m proud, grateful and excited about ‘The Invisible’ as a TV series is a vast understatement,” Meyer says. “We’ve worked so hard for two years to put the series together, and now, it’s finally going into production with an excellent broadcast partner and executive production team, great writers, a stellar, international cast, a brilliant director and the best film crew in the world. How cool is that?”“’The Invisible’ is a contemporary South African retelling inspired by true events – including the mysterious plane crash that claimed former Mozambican President Samora Machel,” Nomsa Philiso, director of content: general entertainment, English and Portuguese-speaking Africa at MultiChoice, said.\n\n\t“Premiering on M-Net, this gripping tale is crafted by Deon Meyer, brought to life in Hoedspruit and Cape Town by top local talent, and supported by our co-production partners, ITV Studios, Scene23 and BMG. We’re proud of this collaboration and the platform the series will enjoy on M-Net, where Meyer’s work continues to captivate South African – and global – audiences.”\n\n\tJulie Meldal-Johnsen, executive vice president of global content at ITV Studios, said, “We’re delighted to be partnering with M-Net, Scene23, BMG and the IDC to bring this thrilling and action-packed drama to global audiences. ‘The Invisible’ marks our first scripted project from a South African producer – hopefully the first of many.”\n\n\t“We are proud and excited to be working with Abbie Cornish, Dougray Scott and a hugely talented group of creatives in South Africa on Berkeley Media’s latest international production. With our partners Scene23 and ITV Studios, we aim to bring alive this amazing African story to an appreciative global audience,” Yu-Fai Suen of Berkeley Media Group said.\n\n\t“With the success of ‘Trackers’ and ‘Heart of the Hunter’ proving the global appetite for South African stories, ‘The Invisible’ is the perfect next chapter,” Cobus van den Berg, executive producer at Scene23, said. “Based on the work of acclaimed author Deon Meyer, it’s about more than just a television series – it’s a chance to showcase our talent, our landscapes, and our storytelling on an international stage.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBAFTA nominee John Hannah (“The Last of Us,” “Four Weddings and a Funeral”) is set to lead “Death in Benidorm,” a new detective drama series launching on the Paramount Skydance-owned U.K. network Channel 5. \n\n\tThe show — which is currently a working title — comes from Blackbox Multimedia and Clapperboard and centers around Dennis, a former detective trying to escape his past who swaps the chaos of the U.K. for a quieter life running a bar in Benidorm. But when tourists start turning up dead, he’s reluctantly drawn back into detective work — egged on by his barmaid Rosa, a crime drama superfan. \n\t\n\n\tAs per the synopsis, with Dennis’ real-world experience and Rosa’s encyclopaedic TV knowledge, “each episode sees the duo tackling a new murder in paradise, whilst trying to remain on the right side of the local Spanish cops.”\n\n\n\tPlaying Rose is Carolina Bécquer as Rosa, while additional cast includes Ariadna Cabrol as Maria and Damian Schedler Cruz as Jesùs. \n\n\t“Death in Benidorm” — which sounds more-than-a-little inspired by the BBC’s long-running series “Death in Paradise” — was commissioned by Greg Barnett, commissioning editor at 5 and is co-produced by Blackbox Multimedia (“The Ex-Wife,” “The Serial Killer’s Wife,” “This Time Next Year”) and Clapperboard (“The Teacher,” “The Game,” “The Madame Blanc Mysteries”) with ZDF Studios onboard as international distributor.\n\n\t“I am thrilled to have John Hannah on board,” said Barnett. “He’s absolutely perfect for the role of Dennis — a character with sharp intellect, dry wit, and life experience — and from what I’ve seen already, viewers will fall in love with him.”\n\t\n\n\tChiara Cardoso and Camilla Hammer are executive producers for Blackbox Multimedia, Mike Benson and Andy Morgan for Clapperboard, Robert Franke, VP drama for ZDF Studios with Viviane Richard, executive drama in Franke’s team, acting as associate producer. Ian Jarvis (“The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin”) created the series, with Simon Delaney (“Death in Paradise,” “The Young Offenders”) on board as Director. Yasmine Akram (“Flack”), Claire Downes (“The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin,” “The Outlaws”) and Tom Parry (“Your Christmas or Mine,” “Your Christmas or Mine 2”) are writers.\n\n\t“Death in Benidorm is such a witty and charming addition to the cosy crime genre, and John Hannah truly encapsulates this,” added Richard. “We’re thrilled to be working with Blackbox to bring these sharply written scripts to life and, we can’t wait to share it with audiences around the world.”\n\n\t“Death in Benidorm” is now filming on location in Spain and is set to air on 5 in 2026.\n",

    "body": "\n\tStudio 100 Film will present animated family adventure “Halloween vs Day of the Dead” at the American Film Market in Los Angeles (Nov. 11-16).\n\n\tWhen the candies of the rival towns, Halloween Ville and Day of the Dead Town, mysteriously vanish before their most important festivities, the celebrations are suddenly in danger. The fate of both villages rests in the hands of Pumpkid and Bony Lu, who join forces with a quirky group of friends to save the holidays and reunite their communities.\n\t\n\n\tThe film, written and directed by Celso García (“The Thin Yellow Line,” “The Great Seduction”), is a co-production between Studio 100 Intl. and Mexico’s Lunch Films. The executive producers are Martin Krieger of Studio 100 Intl., and Axel Vielma and Fernando Estrada of Lunch Films. Thorsten Wegener, García and Gerry Cardoso are the producers.\n\n\n\t“Working with Studio 100 Intl. to bring ‘Halloween vs Day of the Dead’ to life is an exciting opportunity to share a story we hold close to our hearts. Together, we’re creating a vibrant, heartfelt film that honors both traditions while telling a timeless tale of friendship, unity and hope. We believe audiences everywhere will connect with the journey of these two children from rival villages,” said García, founder of Lunch Films.\n\n\tCardoso added: “We wanted to create a film that’s not only fun and full of adventure but also celebrates the heart of Mexican culture. It’s a playful clash of two iconic traditions, told through a story that’s emotional and deeply rooted in family and identity. We hope audiences around the world will laugh, be moved and walk away with a greater appreciation for the beauty, spirit and meaning behind Día de los Muertos.”\n\t\n\n\t“Growing up Mexican in New York, I looked forward to twice as many sweets and double the ghosts. Halloween and Día de los Muertos were both part of my life, so when this project came along, it ultimately felt like home for me. After two years of spirited – and occasionally spooky – talks, I’m thrilled we’re kicking off development and sharing it at the film market!,” said Lorena Booth, senior manager sales and acquisition of Studio 100 Film.\n\n\tThe film is slated for a 2028 theatrical release.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPicture Tree Intl. has acquired international sales rights to “Rosemead,” the dramatic thriller headlined by Lucy Liu, alongside breakout newcomer Lawrence Shou.\n\n\tThe feature marks the directorial debut of cinematographer Eric Lin (“The Exploding Girl,” “The Sound of Silence,” “Hearts Beat Loud”). Vertical will release the film theatrically in the U.S. on Dec. 5 and has launched an awards campaign.\n\n\n\tFollowing its world premiere at the Tribeca Festival, “Rosemead” quickly gained momentum on the international circuit, winning best narrative feature at the Bentonville Film Festival, and capturing the Prix du Public UBS Audience Award at the Locarno Film Festival, where Liu was also honored with the Career Achievement Award.\n\t\n\n\tLiu continues to be fêted with numerous awards for her performance in “Rosemead” and her career, including the Critics’ Choice Trailblazer Award, Bentonville’s Rising to the Challenge Award, Philadelphia Film Festival’s Artistic Achievement Award, Miami Film Festival’s Precious Gem Award, Belfast Film Festival’s Réalta (Star) Award, and Denver Film Festival’s John Cassavetes Award.\n\n\tThe next international festival outings for “Rosemead” include the Mexico premiere at Morelia Film Festival, Brazil premiere at São Paulo Intl. Film Festival, Germany premiere at Hof International Film Festival, U.K. premiere at Belfast Film Festival, and England premiere at Leeds Intl. Film Festival, to be followed by further regional premieres yet to be announced.\n\n\t“Rosemead’s” screenwriter Marilyn Fu was also recently nominated for a Taipei Golden Horse Award for best adapted screenplay.\n\t\n\n\tCritics have embraced the film, saying it “builds to a most unexpected crescendo, giving [Liu] her best role in years” (Deadline), and “forces its audience to hold its breath” and “will leave you speechless” (Loud & Clear). Liu’s performance has been cited as “a revelatory turn” and “career-redefining” (Variety) and “a highlight of her storied career” (Next Best Picture).\n\n\tPTI will pick up negotiations at Mipcom this week and launch “Rosemead” at the upcoming AFM in Los Angeles.\n\n\tSet against the quiet tensions of a Chinese American household, “Rosemead” tells the story of an ailing mother who uncovers a terrifying secret: her teenage son is consumed by violent impulses. As her health rapidly declines, she is forced into a desperate struggle—how far will she go to stop what she fears he is becoming, and what will she sacrifice to protect him?\n\n\t“’Rosemead’ is both an intimate and urgent drama with global relevance. Lucy Liu delivers one of the most powerful performances of her career, anchoring a film that will resonate strongly with audiences worldwide,” said Andreas Rothbauer, managing partner at Picture Tree Intl.\n\n\tWritten by Marilyn Fu (“The Copenhagen Test,” “The Honor List”) and adapted from Frank Shyong’s award-winning Los Angeles Times article, the film is produced by Mynette Louie (“I Carry You With Me,” “Swallow”), Andrew D. Corkin (“A Vigilante,” “Martha Marcy May Marlene”), and Liu.\n\n\t“Rosemead” is a production of The Population and Untapped, in association with MyVideo, Taiwan Mobile, and L.A. Times Studios.\n\n\tExecutive producers include Theo James, Eric Lin, Peng Zhao, Fanghua Jiang, Julia Xu, Chris Argentieri, Frank Shyong, Jamie Lin, Chiling Lin, Jeff Yang, Daniela Ruiz, and Julia Gouw. Co-producers are Tony Yang and Hao Zhang.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTBA Studios has unveiled the worldwide release strategy for “Quezon,” a historical biopic chronicling the political ascent of Manuel L. Quezon, the first president of the Philippine Commonwealth. The film stars Filipino actor Jericho Rosales in the title role alongside “Game of Thrones” alumnus Iain Glen.\n\n\tABS-CBN International has secured exclusive theatrical distribution rights for key overseas territories after TBA Studios fielded interest from multiple international distributors.\n\t\n\n\tThe Philippines will see the film first on Oct. 15, followed by Australia and New Zealand on Oct. 30. North American audiences, including those in Guam and Canada, will get their first look on Oct. 31, with Middle Eastern territories scheduled for Nov. 20. Additional international markets are expected to be revealed.\n\n\n\tSet during the twilight of American colonial rule, the film traces Quezon’s calculated path to victory in the 1935 presidential elections, depicting his confrontations with American Governor-General Leonard Wood (played by Glen), political rival Sergio Osmeña, and revolutionary leader Emilio Aguinaldo.\n\n\tThe ensemble cast features Benjamin Alves as the young Quezon, Mon Confiado as Aguinaldo, Arron Villaflor and Cris Villanueva as Joven Hernando, and Romnick Sarmenta as Osmeña. Karylle portrays Aurora Quezon, with supporting performances from JC Santos, Jake Macapagal, Bodjie Pascua, Angeli Bayani, Jojit Lorenzo, Joross Gamboa, Therese Malvar, Ana Abad Santos, Ketchup Eusebio, and Nico Locco.\n\n\t“We’re thrilled that ‘Quezon’ will finally be seen by Filipinos around the world – and not just by the Filipino community, but also by fans of historical and political cinema,” said producer Daphne Chiu-Soon. “This is a world-class production made for the big screen, and we’re proud to share this important story with a global audience.”\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Jerrold Tarog, “Quezon” completes TBA Studios’ “Bayaniverse” trilogy of Philippine historical films. The series began with 2015’s “Heneral Luna,” which became the highest-grossing historical film in Philippine box office history, and continued with 2018’s “Goyo: The Young General.”\n\n\tThe production received support from the Film Development Council of the Philippines and CreatePHFilms.\n",

    "body": "\n\tShowmax is expanding its hit “Real Housewives” franchise with “The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: Africa,” bringing together standout cast members from South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria for a Brazilian getaway.\n\n\tThe latest installment follows the success of “The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: South Africa,” which ranked as one of Showmax’s most-watched series in 2024. The new series assembles 10 housewives from across the continent for what producers are calling a celebration of Pan-African sisterhood and glamor.\n\t\n\n\tFrom “The Real Housewives of Durban,” the cast includes Annie Mthembu (Seasons 1-3), Angel Ndlela (Seasons 4-5) and Jojo Robinson, who has appeared in four consecutive seasons since joining in Season 2, making her the most experienced Housewife in the lineup.\n\n\n\tJohannesburg’s representatives are Madam Evodia Mogase and Christall Kay, two original cast members who became the franchise’s first breakout stars in Africa. Madam Evodia starred in Season 1, while Kay appeared in the debut season, returned for Season 2 and featured in last year’s “The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: South Africa.”\n\n\tEast African representation comes from Nairobi with Dr. Catherine Masitsa (Dr. C) and Zena Nyambu. Dr. C has appeared in both seasons of the Kenyan franchise, while Nyambu joined as a full-time cast member in Season 2.\n\n\tRounding out the cast are Nigeria’s Mariam Timmer from “The Real Housewives of Lagos,” who has appeared in all three seasons, and Princess Jecoco from “The Real Housewives of Abuja,” who debuted in that show’s first season.\n\t\n\n\t“‘The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: Africa’ is more than just a reality show, it’s a celebration of African womanhood in all its power, diversity and glamour,” says executive producer Graeme Swanepoel. “For the first time, we’re bringing together iconic housewives from across the continent to share their worlds, their stories and their sisterhood. It’s unapologetically Pan-African, women-led and bursting with the kind of energy and authenticity that makes Africa unlike anywhere else on Earth.”\n\n\tThe series is produced by GOAT Productions, which previously produced “Unfollowed,” “Untied” and the South African Film and Television Award-winning “Life With Kelly Khumalo” Season 3.\n\n\tBarrie Kelly, VP of international format production and development at NBCUniversal Formats, added: “Every African version of ‘The Real Housewives’ has captured the vibrant diversity of its country while resonating with audiences both locally and globally. With ‘The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: Africa,’ we are taking that energy to the next level. Partnering once again with GOAT Productions and Showmax, this series brings together some of the most formidable Housewives for an unforgettable journey. We can’t wait for viewers to join them on the trip of a lifetime to Brazil.”\n\n\t“The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip” format launched in the U.S. in 2021 with four seasons on Peacock, produced by Shed Media. “The Real Housewives” and “The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip” formats are distributed internationally by NBCUniversal Formats, a division of Universal Studio Group.\n\n\t“The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: Africa” premieres on Showmax on Nov. 28.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSet in 1580 Seville, Spaniard Alberto Rodríguez’s 2017 series “The Plague,” a milestone in Spanish TV history, depicted how Spain took a wrong turn.",
    "body": "\n\tSet in 1580 Seville, Spaniard Alberto Rodríguez’s 2017 series “The Plague,” a milestone in Spanish TV history, depicted how Spain took a wrong turn. \n\n\tInspired by Javier Cercas’ extraordinary non-fiction book, starring Álvaro Morte (“Money Heist”) and acclaimed at September’s San Sebastián world premiere, Rodríguez’s “The Anatomy of a Moment” tells how over 1976-81, Spain finally got it right, and how its hard-won young democracy also hung by a thread.\n\t\n\n\tA “portrait of power and freedom, or at least how to maintain freedom for the future,” Rodríguez (“Prison 77”) tells Variety, the high-stakes thriller begins with the titular “moment”: a posse of some 200 Civil Guards breaking into Spain’s Congress, led by the pistol-brandishing Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero, who spray the semi-circle with bullets. Most congressmen unceremoniously scramble to duck behind their benches. Three figures, however, – and the scene was caught on live on national TV – sit upright in their seats or confront the guards, refusing symbolically to bow before the coup’ d’état, convinced that they are going to die anyway. The figures were outgoing Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez, Santiago Carrillo, head of the Spanish Communist Party, and armed forces chief Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado who, though a frail near-70, got up to order the rebel Guards to lay down their arms.  \n\n\n\tProduced by Movistar Plus+, Banijay’s DLO Producciones, headed by José Manuel Lorenzo, and Arte Frace, the series dedicates one episode a piece to all three figures: Ep. 1, how Suárez, Spanish Prime Minister from July 1976, persuaded Franco’s parliament to vote itself out of existence; how Santiago Carrillo, head of the Spanish Communist Party, returns to Spain and secures its legalization, and Gutiérrez Mellado’s battle to modernize of the army, removing its most hawkish elements, captured collectively in scenes worthy of a horror film.  \n\t\n\n\t“These are figures,” says Rodríguez, of “Shakesperian stature.” The series portrays them in their grandeur, contradictions, traumas, chain-smoking and betrayal of the castes they came from. \n\n\tAlso, this is the story of three traitors. Suárez turned his back on his proclaimed fidelity to the Principles of the National Movement, Franco’s political system; Carrillo gave up guiding principles of Spain’s Communist Party to wrestle its legalization; Gutiérrez Mellado betrayed fellow Francoist officers with whom he had fought for Franco in the Spanish Civil War and who were intent 40 years later on preserving a Francoist world order. A final episode returns to the coup d’état, why it failed, and the subsequent court martial. \n\n\tA fictionalized series, “The Anatomy of a Moment” is shot with flair, seen in its use of ellipsis – in Ep. 1, to portray Súarez’s dramatic rise in Francoist ranks, he’s seen as a young Falangist ushering a general into the office of the governor of Segovia: cut to its interior, where Suárez,  himself now installed as governor, receives another general. \n\n\tIt is accompanied by a quietly trenchant voice over, mostly written by scribes Rafael Cobos and Fran Araújo, explaining intricacies of characters and historical through-lines. “Your friend has only one political ideal, to thrive,” Alfonso Armada, head of the royal household, complains to King Juan Carlos when the monarch names Suárez Prime Minister. “And he was entirely right,” the voiceover adds. \n\n\tEach episode channels a sense of genre: political comedy as Suárez buys Franco’s parliament, offering its members anything from a family cruise to, viewers imagine, much more; espionage intrigue as Carrillo enters Spain incognito, donning a popstar mop wig, and court drama in the moving last episode, tinged with a note of melancholic elegy, as Súarez is forgotten and, suffering Alzheimer’s, even forgets who he was himself.        \n\n\tVariety sat down with Rodríguez at San Sebastián where “The Anatomy of a Moment” celebrated its world premiere, acclaimed by El Mundo” as “magnetic” and by El Correo as “the series of the year.”\n\n\tYour Goya best picture-winning film “Marshland” is set in 1980 during Spain’s 1975-82 transition from dictatorship to democracy. Why return to the period? \n\t\n\n\tThe producers Domingo Corral and Jose Manuel Lorenzo said: ‘Read Javier Cercas’ book, and then let’s talk.’  I did, and found it fascinating. First off, it re-orders reality, creating what could be regarded as a fantastic fiction. Then there’s the gutting ending, which is about oblivion, how everything disappears, including our referents. History ends up forgotten. In his prologue, Cercas quotes a poll carried out in the U.K. to the effect that a significant percentage of people thought Churchill didn’t exist, that he was a figure of fiction.\n\n\tAlso, the book, as your series, is structured around three figures when the essence of great TV drama, its largest appeal to make viewers return to a second season, is its characters.\n\n\tYes, the three, Suárez, Carrillo and Gutiérrez Mellado were extraordinary figures, with pronounced dramatic arcs and highly complex characters. Suárez was many things at the same time, Carrillo also. They were extremely personable, above everything around them. These are figures of a Shakespearian stature.\n\n\tOne of the key scenes in the series is when Suárez arranges a clandestine first meeting with Carrillo, when he’s returned to Spain. Against all odds, they immediately jell…\n\n\tThere’s a moment when Suárez says to Carrillo: ‘Don Santiago, you and I are the only real politicians in this country. Each sense the others’ weakness: Their egos. These are multi-faceted characters, with many layers, faces.\n\n\tAnother thing that stands out in the series is its voiceover, which can be highly ironic or poetic and but also draws through lines from the present and future.…\n\n\tMaybe 15% is drawn from Javier Cercas’ book. The rest comes from Rafa [Rafael Cobos] and Fran [Araújo]. It attempts to clarify the major guidelines of the story. The book is 500 pages long. We had to condense a lot.\n\n\tYou extract extraordinary performances from the actors, especially, perhaps, “Money Heist’s” Alvaro Morte, as Suárez. The first time Álvaro put on the prosthetic nose, it was as if he was another person. He studied a lot videos and other references. And Suárez was elegant. He would put on a suit and was elegant in any situation. Álvaro has that elegance too.  \n\n\tAnd if you had to say what the series is about?\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a portrait of power and freedom, or at least how to maintain freedom for the future.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBelgian eight-episode series “The Big Fuck-Up” is based on a true story – as much as possible.\n\n\tSet in the 1980s, it follows Belgian Gendarmes who, led by an American CIA agent, are supposed to catch drug dealers. Instead, they turn into criminals themselves. That includes Jan Laureys (Willem De Schryver), who never wanted to be a gendarme in the first place. \n\n\t“Although – and I’ll go on the record here – not all cops were corrupt, the gendarmerie was infested with scandals and crime. There was a lot of nepotism and it had a mob-like structure: if you made a mistake, they would cover it up for you,” says director Wim Geudens at Mipcom. But the team never wanted to make a factual show. \n\t\n\n\t“They really started selling drugs and there really was an American agent who came over to teach them everything. In the end, there was a trial too, but there has never been any real proof,” notes Philippe De Schepper, who wrote and created it with Bas Adriaensen.\n\n\n\t“That’s why we opted for a lighter tone – we don’t really know what happened. Wim pushed for that; for that fun side. There are so many dark shows already.”\n\n\tWhat they are doing in the show is dark – “They have no moral compass,” says Geudens. But he also liked the idea of having a protagonist who’a crook and also loves life. \n\n\t“It’s like Spielberg’s ‘Catch Me If You Can’ with Leonardo DiCaprio. He’s lying to everyone but he’s so charismatic. Later, he realizes it’s not fun and games anymore. He goes: ‘How can I get myself out of this big fuck-up’?”\n\t\n\n\tAt first, the show had a more respectable title.\n\n\t“It was called ‘The Years of Lead’ because that’s how they used to describe that period,” smiles De Schepper. “The problem was, people would see it and assume it was a serious drama.”\n\n\tGeudens adds: “When they suggested ‘The Big Fuck-Up’ I was like: ‘Whoa, that’s bold. Man, am I really doing this?’ But there are so many fuck-ups here, on so many levels. Even when it comes to Jan’s family, because they’ve been lying for so many years.” \n\n\tDe Schryver, who plays Jan Laureys, needed some time to warm up to him. \n\n\t“I was very nervous that I had to be someone who’s so full of himself. Jan sees himself as this top-notch guy: good-looking, narcissistic. I was only 22 when we started filming and doubting everything in my life. Jan ended up being my savior, in a way. Playing him gave me the confidence I needed.”\n\n\tAt first, Jan doesn’t notice what’s happening around him – “until he’s already in too deep to get out.” But he also matures over the course of the show.\n\n\t“Jan puts on a façade. He looks like he’s ready to conquer the world but he’s actually running away from a lot of problems. The reason why he’s abroad is because he doesn’t feel at home in his own family. Willem was able to show it: you wouldn’t want to follow someone who’s just shallow. With Jan, you want to get to know him better,” adds Geudens.\n\n\tTom Vermeir, Tibo Vandenborre, Cathy Serclaes, Koen De Bouw, Koen De Graeve, Natalie Broods, Rob Van der Auwera, Tom Van Dyck, Dempsey Bovell and Felix Vroman also star. \n\n\tIn order to make the kind of show they wanted, they needed to be resourceful, underlines De Schepper.\n\n\t“When you are making a period show, you can say ‘I need this exact table’ and it will cost you a lot of money, or you can say ‘fuck it, we’re gonna create our own universe.’ It’s still the 1980s, but it’s Wim’s version of the 1980s. Wim is a bit like Peter Jackson – when he first started out in New Zealand, making his own props. Together with his partner in crime [cinematographer] Piet Deyaert, they found ways to make things cheaper.” \n\n\tThe goal with the show was to “entertain people,” says the director. \n\t\n\n\t“We have all these guys ‘doing their jobs’ but it’s also so dumb. It’s one big fuck-up after another, because they are making stupid decisions and applauding each other for them. Comedy is one of my go-to genres but I’m not interested unless it communicates something.” \n\n\t“We’re portraying this ridiculous situation where you have cops who totally lost their way and they don’t even realize it. Like, what the fuck?! Apparently, some potential financiers said there were too many male roles in the series, but the only smart character is a woman. It’s not always good to have all this testosterone in a room,” laughs De Schryver. \n\n\t“You can’t compare it to anything else made in Belgium,” he observes. “It has a very different color.”\n\n\t“Color is a right word,” deadpans Geudens. “We actually have color.” \n\n\tThe series – sold by jonnydepony and backed by Streamz and Amazon Prime Video NL – will premiere on Oct. 30, 2025. \n",

'cause TMZ has learned her team is actively exploring bigger venues and even a possible tour after overwhelming demand left thousands of fans in a frenzy.\n      \n    \n          Demi announced the L.A. show on her social media Monday morning, and sources with direct knowledge tell us over 200,000 people flooded the online queue for the October 25 concert at the Hollywood Palladium, which holds just 4,000 fans. Within 20 minutes, we're told the show was sold out.\n      \n    \n          Our sources say Demi's team immediately began discussing an expansion ... looking at larger venues and mapping out logistics for a potential multi-city tour tied to her upcoming album, \"It's Not That Deep,\" which drops October 24.\n      \n    \n          We're told the show was meant to be a small, celebratory performance ... a chance for Demi to reconnect with fans and debut songs from the new album, including her fan-demanded single \"Kiss,\" which dropped last Friday. But when ticket queues crashed and fans took to social media begging for more shows, the conversation quickly shifted from special event to possible tour strategy.\n      \n    \n          Our sources say the team is already reviewing options, however, nothing's locked in yet. As one source put it bluntly ... \"When 200,000 people try to buy tickets to a 4,000 capacity show, you don't ignore that kind of demand.\"\n      \n    \n          Demi's new era may have started as \"It's Not That Deep\" ... but judging by this response, it's getting a whole lot bigger.\n      \n    \n          We reached out to Demi's reps for comment ... so far, no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Demi Lovato\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

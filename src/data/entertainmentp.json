    "body": "\n\tNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was in the hot seat defending the streaming giant’s $83 billion deal for Warner Bros. at a Senate hearing Tuesday, amid pointed questions from lawmakers about the threat the pact poses to competition, jobs and streaming prices.\n\n\tThe hearing, “Examining the Competitive Impact of the Proposed Netflix-Warner Brothers Transaction,” was called by the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights.\n\t\n\n\tSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the subcommittee’s chair, opened the hearing by saying the deal raises “antitrust concerns” that warrant scrutiny. Netflix and HBO Max both offer subscription streaming services, and Netflix and Warner Bros. compete to produce TV shows and films, he said. Netflix, with WB’s library and production capabilities, would have “the incentive and the ability to put rivals at a disadvantage” by limiting content licensing, he said, and it could starve movie theaters of films.\n\n\n\tThrough the deal, Netflix could become the “one platform to rule them all,” Lee said.\n\n\tSen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), the subcommittee’s ranking member, said the sale of Warner Bros. “to any competitor” raises concerns about competition and have a negative impact on “tens of thousands” of workers in Hollywood by reducing the amount of TV shows and films that get produced. “We know Netflix’s power,” he said, noting that he streams a lot of content on the service. “I have concerns about Netflix gaining more power over consumers” and leaving them with “fewer options.”\n\n\tSarandos, in his opening remarks, said Netflix’s original productions have generated 155,000 jobs, with productions in all 50 states. He said the Warner Bros. businesses that Netflix is acquiring are “very different from ours,” and that Netflix plans to operate those businesses “largely as they are today.”\n\t\n\n\t“We’re buying a company that has assets we do not,” said Sarandos, reiterating Netflix’s pledge to preserve a 45-day theatrical window for WB’s movies.\n\n\tSarandos insisted Netflix and HBO Max are complementary, and claimed that 80% of HBO Max subscribers also subscribe to Netflix. “We will give consumers more content for less.” He also said Netflix faces increasing competition from “deep-pocketed tech companies trying to run away with the TV business,” naming Google’s YouTube, Apple and Amazon’s Prime Video. He noted that Netflix’s share of U.S. TV viewership for December was 9% and that with HBO Max will be around 10%, still behind YouTube’s share of TV viewing.\n\n\tOn Dec. 5, Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced their megadeal under which Netflix will acquire Warner Bros. Discovery’s studios and HBO Max for $27.75/share. Two weeks ago, Netflix switched to an all-cash offer, replacing its previous cash-and-stock terms — a change driven by pressure from David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, which has been pursuing a hostile takeover attempt of Warner Bros. Discovery with what it alleges is a superior deal for WBD shareholders.\n\n\tBooker said he invited David Ellison to the hearing given his company’s $108 billion hostile bid — but that Paramount declined to participate, citing the WBD’s board rejection of its offer.\n\n\tLee asked Sarandos that why Netflix needs to buy WB’s studios, if Netflix is already planning to spend $20 billion, up 10%, on original and licensed content in 2026. “Warner Bros. is both a competitor and a supplier,” Sarandos said. “Our history is about adding more” content and choices for consumers.\n\n\tLee also questioned Sarandos’ assertion that YouTube is a competitor, given that YouTube doesn’t fund original content directly. “They’re not in the same business,” the senator said, pointing out it doesn’t require a subscription or login. Sarandos said Netflix and YouTube are competing for the same content, viewers and ad dollars, and the exec pointed to “Iron Lung,” a self-financed movie from YouTube creator Markiplier, which led the box office over the weekend.\n\n\tNetflix and WBD say that their deal will preserve industry jobs, as Netflix doesn’t have a studio operation of the size of Warner Bros., and they’ve pointed to Paramount Skydance’s claim that it could realize $6 billion in cost savings through the acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery as predicated on massive layoffs. In addition, Netflix asserts that retail streaming prices will go down, arguing that consumers see HBO Max as complementary to Netflix’s service, and as such competitors like Amazon’s Prime Video and Disney+/Hulu will be forced to keep pricing in check to fight for market share.\n\t\n\n\tAlso testifying at the hearing was Bruce Campbell, WBD’s chief revenue and strategy officer. He said the deal will give Warner Bros.’ studios business access to Netflix’s distribution capabilities, while giving Netflix’s “nascent” productions operations a boost through WB’s studios.\n\n\tCampbell said Netflix will be able to offer Netflix and HBO Max streaming services together “at a discount” and that Netflix will be able to put more Warner Bros. content on its core streaming offering: “I think that too will be pro-consumer.”\n\n\tNetflix and WBD say they have proactively reached out to antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe to make their case for why the deal should go through. Indeed, the companies’ lawyers reached out to representatives in the Justice Department’s antitrust division the day Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced their pact.\n",

    "body": "\n\tContent creator, actor and beauty founder Claudia Sulewski has signed with WME for representation in all areas. \n\n\tClaudia Sulewski, who began her career as a beauty vlogger in 2009 — amassing nearly seven million followers across platforms — has now made the transition to Hollywood. The 29 year-old Sulewski made her feature debut in “I Love My Dad” in 2022 and currently stars in Apple TV+’s “Shrinking” alongside Harrison Ford and Jason Segel.  She has also had supporting roles in web and TV series such as “T@gged” and “The Commute,” and appeared in an episode of Marvel’s “Runaways.”\n\t\n\n\tThe creative has also dipped her foot into directing, working most closely with her fiancé, musician Finneas O’Connell. She helmed the music video for Finneas’s “2001” and “Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa,” as well as “David’s Brother” for The Favors (Finneas + Ashe).\n\n\n\t“I think because I’ve been doing YouTube for so long, I forget how much creative control I have in every aspect of it,” Sulewski told Variety last year about making the transition from social media to traditional filmmaking. “I think that was the thing that intrigued me so much about acting — you have to kind of let go and trust the process and trust the team around you.”\n\n\tOutside of film and TV, Sulewski is also the founder of the body care and fragrance brand Cyclar, which she launched in 2023. As of this week, Cyclar is set to launch online at Sephora on Feb. 21 and roll out to 500 of the retailer’s stores by mid-March. \n\n\tSulewski continues to be represented by Shelter PR and Ashley Silver at Brecheen Feldman Breimer Silver & Thompson.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGrammy-winning popstar Chappell Roan will join “Fortnite Festival” as the next “Icon,” “Fortnite” maker Epic Games announced Tuesday. The “Red Wine Supernova” singer will appear as the headliner in Season 13 of the in-game event, which will kick off on Feb. 5. \n\n\tA self-professed “Fortnite” player and fan (Roan once asked “Please give me a skin, please” in an interview), the star is ready to electrify the “Fortnite Festival” main stage, bringing with her the bold, theatrical universe she’s created. Known for her daring wardrobe choices that combine burlesque, fairytale and midwestern elements, players will be able to embody her trailblazing style in the game. \n\t\n\n\tInspired by her 2024 VMAs performance, players can try on a range of Roan-inspired skins, including the Roan of Arc and Chappell Roan outfits. Fans can also unlock accessories including the Pink Pony Star Back Bling, Midwest Princess Keytar, Subway Serenader Mic and Drumset Supernova with the Season 13 Heartcore Music Pass or a Crew subscription. In the shop, the “Pinky Pony Club” emote and the “Femininomenon” emote will also be available. \n\n\n\tThe “Main Stage” will also have a Roan-influence, pulling from the singer’s medieval castle-themed “Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things” tour design. Jam tracks including “Pink Pony Club” will join Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!,” “HOT TO GO!” and “The Giver” in the Fortnite shop. \n\n\tPreviously, multi-hyphenate K-pop singer, dancer and actress LISA was the Icon for “Fortnite Festival’s” Season 12, and jam tracks including “FXCK UP THE WORLD (Vixi Solo Version)” “Rockstar” and “New Woman” were added to the Fortnite Shop. While Season 11 featured a celebration of “Fortnite” original music in lieu of one singular icon, Gorillaz headlined the Season 10 festival. \n\t\n\n\tAdditional icons throughout the history of Epic’s “Fortnite Festival” include Bruno Mars (Season 9) Sabrina Carpenter (Season 8), Hatsune Miku (Season 7), Snoop Dogg (Season 6), Karol G (Season 5), Metallica (Season 4), Billie Eilish (Season 3), Lady Gaga (Season 2) and The Weeknd (Season 1).\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpanish athlete Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate won’t have to find a new song to skate to at the Winter Olympics after all.\n\n\tAfter he initially faced copyright issues, the 26-year-old figure skating champion said he’s been granted permission to perform his fan-favorite “Minions” routine in Milan. He’s skated to the sounds of the pint-sized agents of chaos, while dressed in their signature uniform of a yellow shirt and blue overalls, throughout the season. Sabate said Universal had reconsidered and granted the rights after an outpouring of social media support.\n\t\n\n\t“Huge THANK YOU to everyone who reposted, shared, and supported,” Sabate wrote on his Instagram stories. “Because of you, Universal Studios reconsidered and officially granted the rights for this one special occasion. I’m so happy to see that the minions hitting Olympic ice is becoming real again!!”\n\n\n\t(Universal Pictures shares a parent company with NBC, which airs the Olympics.)\n\n\tEarlier in the week, Sabate, who is making his Olympic debut in Milan, said he was informed that Universal Pictures, the studio behind the “Minions” film franchise, wasn’t going to grant him permission to use the pitchy, energetic song on the Olympic ice. That meant he’d have to find new music for the short program before the men’s event starts on Feb. 10.\n\n\t“This season I have competed with my ‘Minions’ routine to bring joy and a fun style to the ice, while complying with all of the obligatory elements and demonstrating that ice skating as a male Olympic figure skater can also be fun,” he wrote in a lengthy statement on his Instagram stories. Sabate noted that he “followed all required procedures and submitted my music through the ISU [International Skating Union] ClicknClear system back in August” and “competed with this program throughout the entire season.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “Unfortunately, just days before the Olympic inauguration, I was informed that I am no longer permitted to use this program due to copyright clearance issues.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSabate said on Instagram stories that the situation was “incredibly disappointing’\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBefore the decision was reversed, Sabate said he would remained optimistic: “I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney+ is going to Hollywood! Starting next month, “American Idol” will stream live on Disney+ in addition to ABC for the first time. (The show will also continue to stream tape-delayed the next day on Hulu). That means “American Idol” will join “Dancing With the Stars” as a live unscripted competition series that simulcasts on both ABC and Disney+.\n\n\tConcurrently with the news, Disney+ and Hulu are also launching the companion “‘American Idol’ Official Podcast.” The premiere of the new video podcast will coincide with the start of “American Idol” live shows at the end of March.\n\t\n\n\tBesides Disney+ and Hulu, the “American Idol” Official Podcast will be available on other podcasting platforms as well; host and other details are still to come. Per the podcast logline: “Each week, the podcast will dive deeper into America’s most iconic music competition series, exploring the performances everyone’s talking about, and offering exclusive interviews, behind-the-scenes insights, and expert analysis of the judges’ critiques.”\n\n\tThe new “American Idol” live stream on Disney+ starts on March 30, as the show continues to air live on ABC stations in local time zones. (“American Idol” airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.)\n\n\t“American Idol” returned for Season 24 (ABC’s Season 9) on Jan. 26 with its most-watched opener in four years, averaging 8.27 million viewers in live+3 and multiplatform viewing — including ABC, Hulu, Hulu on Disney+ and digital platforms. In adults 18-49, it was a 1.04 rating. That made it the best premiere for “American Idol” since 2022.\n\n\tThe premiere was also up a strong 20% in total viewers vs. last year’s regular premiere (6.88 million on March 9, 2025) and up 7% with adults 18-49 (vs. 0.97 rating). (The numbers from 2026 include Nielsen National Live+3 day big data plus panel program ratings and ABC multiplatform+3 day ratings, while 2025 is based on big data plus panel. Comparisons exclude last year’s post-Oscars sneak-peek episode on March 2, 2025.)  \n\t\n\n\tAlso, in linear, the “American Idol” season premiere was the No. 1 show of the night on broadcast and cable in both viewers (7.23 million) and 18-49 (0.72 rating) in live+3 ratings. And according to Talkwalker social content ratings, ABC said the premiere episode “drove more video views than any other premiere episode in the 2025-2026 TV season.”\n\n\t“American Idol” continues to be hosted by Ryan Seacrest, while Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie are the show’s judges. Among other changes this year: A new “‘Ohana Round” featured the show’s top 30 finalists performing for industry tastemakers (as well as family and friends) at Disney’s Aulani resort on ‘Oahu; also, “Hollywood Week” moved to Nashville this year, with just one round in “Hollywood Week: Music City Takeover.”\n\n\tFremantle and 19 Entertainment, a part of Sony Pictures Television, are the production companies behind  “American Idol.” Executive producers include Megan Wolflick (who is also showrunner), while Eli Holzman and Aaron Saidman executive produce for 19 Entertainment. Fremantle distributes the series worldwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFollowing Electronic Arts‘ big go-private deal announcement last fall, the video game publisher made another splashy move: revealing a multi-year partnership with the James Cameron-backed Stability AI.\n\n\tA few months into the teamup, which also included “The Sims,” “Battlefield 6” and “Madden NFL” maker EA taking a strategic investment in Stability AI during its latest round of funding in October, and the two companies still have quite a ways to go before gamers see the results of the pact. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s all still in the very early stages, though EA chief strategy officer Mihir Vaidya told Variety in a Jan. 16 interview that conversations between EA and Stability AI about a partnership started well before EA was being courted by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners for a $55 billion go-private move.\n\n\t“One thing we’re super proud of at EA is that, over the course of our history, I think we’ve taken great pride in our heritage as electronic artists,” Vaidya said. “And to be a great electronic artist, you need to have the very best technology and tools available to you. That’s been a core principle of how we’ve kind of thought about technology, is we always are looking out there for the very best technology and solutions for our creatives. Over the course of the last few years, naturally, we’ve been exploring like, what are the possibilities, as it relates to AI, from a tools and technology standpoint, to make available to our people?”\n\n\tVaidya said multiple AI tech companies were considered and EA remains in ongoing discussions for more opportunities, but the Stability AI deal was closed because of what it could offer that other companies couldn’t. \n\t\n\n\t“As we went along the journey, what really stood out to us and why we ultimately decided to partner with Stability was one of the things that we talked to all of our developers was this notion that we can’t control the tools that are available,” Vaidya said. “Certainly there’s gaps in capabilities, but even when the tools were capable, they’re not controllable. That’s incredibly frustrating for anyone in order to see their utility in the context of their work. And when we unpack, well, why are they not controllable? Turns out a lot of foundation models, generic, general foundation models, they’re black box. They’re incredibly capable across a range of tasks, but not very good at very specific tasks. So how do you make them more capable of specific tasks? Turns out you need deep customization. Customization means you have to be able to unpack the model, understand where representations of different concepts and capabilities lie, and then be able to preserve those representations but adapt them at the same time to your specific needs. It’s not a trivial task. It’s very, very difficult. And you need a partner that is able to do that. And Stability was not only able to do that, it was willing to do that.”\n\n\tRegardless of how generative AI can help a developer, it’s a scary addition to the industry, as many developers believe their jobs will become easier, but ultimately obsolete, with the progression of how AI is used.\n\n\tStability AI CEO Prem Akkaraju refutes this point by invoking the economic lump of labor fallacy. \n\n\t “If you add or introduce technology into making something more efficient what ends up happening is the workforce actually expands,” Akkaraju said. “Labor is not fixed, and so if it was fixed, you’re absolutely right, that would truly eliminate the jobs. \n\n\tAkkaraju offered the example of the invention of the ATM machine: “When those were rolled out in America in the 80s, every bank teller in America was up in arms, and they said, ‘This is what we do. We give withdrawals, we take deposits, and you’re taking our jobs away with this machine.’ And there’s more bank teller jobs today than in the ’80s, if you go point to point. And why is that? Because the banks did an analysis, and they went from 30 people that they needed for each location down to 13, and they did what came naturally, and they expanded. Now, there’s a bank around every single corner. And the average salary for bank tellers went up because their skills went up.”\n\t\n\n\tVaidya says he “absolutely” does not want to “trivialize” the “fears and the conversation around this notion of replacement,” because “there are real concerns.” However, he believes EA’s plan for the use of generative AI will lead to more of a change in what the available jobs look like than a great reduction in workforce.  \n\n\t“AI can play a role in augmenting a particular task, what’s naturally going to happen is there’s going to have to be a recomposition of certain tasks,” Vaidya said. “I think we have to get to that level in order to truly appreciate the impact on the workforce. Over the course of time, there’s naturally new job families that also emerge. And especially in the creative industries, more creatives that are actually part of the industry because the reality is that entertainment is certainly not a zero-sum game. It’s a pie that expands over time. There’s almost an insatiable demand for entertainment since the beginning of time. And so I think if these tools and technologies enable us to create, to increase velocity, to increase quality, to increase volume, to increase scope — demand increases. And as demand increases, it supports a bigger creative population. But the shape of that population might be different, and not necessarily in the wholesale case, but in select cases, because of the fact that AI affects things at the task level, which results in a little bit of a recomposition of what are the collection of tasks in any job. \n\n\tVaidya added: “I think the most important thing to do, if this is the case, is to be on the front foot and lead the conversation, because otherwise what happens is this notion of disruption kicks in because you’re not ready for that change. And as a result, this is especially the case if that disruption comes from folks that are not insiders in the industry, but outside of it. And that’s one of my biggest worries is that we become observers, as opposed to participants and leaders in this conversation, because market forces will lead to AI being deployed at scale. And there are many players outside of the creative industry today that are trying to leverage AI in the space of sport and entertainment.”\n",

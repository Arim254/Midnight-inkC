    "body": "\n\tSydney Sweeney is bracing herself for how emotional it will be to finish filming “Euphoria” Season 3.  \n\n\tThe Cassie Howard actress was honored Wednesday night at Variety’s 2025 Power of Women ceremony in L.A. as one of the cover stars. She shares that she’s going back for her last two days of shooting “Euphoria” Season 3 on Thursday and Sunday.\n\n\t“It’s gonna be a really bittersweet moment,” Sweeney told Variety’s Angelique Jackson about wrapping the season on the Power of Women red carpet. “I’m kind of terrified for how emotional it’s gonna be. It’s been such a journey. It’s been my entire twenties. They’ve been my family and friends for so long. I’ve been forever grateful for all of them.”\n\t\n\n\tSweeney, now 28, told Variety’s Marc Malkin this week that “I was 20 when I did the pilot, so being able to see a lot of the same people, it feels very comforting.”\n\n\tNot much is known about Season 3, other than it will release in spring 2026 and feature lots of returning cast members and new faces, like Trisha Paytas, Natasha Lyonne, Danielle Deadwyler and Eli Roth.\n\n\tSweeney’s co-star Jacob Elordi said that “Euphoria” creator Sam Levinson “constructed something that’s incredibly clever and cinematic.” \n\n\t“It was incredibly liberating,” Elordi said. “I got to play something so sort of far out from what I’ve done before.”\n\n\tNext up, Sweeney is starring in the boxing biopic “Christy” as real-life champion Christy Martin, who accompanied her to Power of Women. She’s also starring in and executive producing a “Barbarella” remake for Sony. Jane Fonda, who starred in the original 1968 sci-fi movie, also attended Power of Women on Wednesday. Sweeney said on the red carpet that she wanted to pick Fonda’s brain for her remake.\n\t\n\n\t“If you see us in a corner the entire time, just know I’m asking absolutely everything,” she said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRamsey Naito is exiting her post as president of Paramount Animation.\n\n\t“I want to share with you that I am leaving the company and closing this very special chapter with all of you,” she wrote on Wednesday night in a note to staff. “Leading this incredible team of talented storytellers, artists and dreamers, and watching the magic that you’ve spun from your imagination and dedication, has been one of the great joys of my career.”\n\t\n\n\tHer departure follows the studio’s recent merger with Skydance, which has resulted in several significant executive shuffles. David Ellison, the company’s new chairman and CEO, announced he’s undertaking a series of staffing cuts that are expected to eliminate approximately 2,000 jobs in the U.S. with additional layoffs taking place internationally.\n\n\n\t“We want to be as open and direct as possible about the reasons behind these changes,” Ellison wrote in memo earlier in the day about the companywide cuts. “In some areas, we are addressing redundancies that have emerged across the organization. In others, we are phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth. Ultimately, these steps are necessary to position Paramount for long-term success.”\n\n\tAn Oscar-nominated producer of 2017’s “Boss Baby,” Naito started her career at Nickelodeon and returned in 2018 before she was promoted to president of the animation division in 2021. Since then, Naito was responsible for breathing new life into broadly appealing franchises at the film studio such as “Smurfs,” “Transformers,” “PAW Patrol,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “SpongeBob SquarePants.” \n\t\n\n\tIn her previous role overseeing Nickelodeon Animation, Naito led animated content across all formats and platforms, spanning linear, digital, TV movies, theatrical motion pictures. This included the day-to-day operations of Nickelodeon’s franchises, including “SpongeBob SquarePants” and its spinoffs like “The Patrick Star Show” and “Kamp Koral” as well as a new “Dora the Explorer” series.\n\n\t“I am so proud of the work the animation teams and I have done for the last 8+ years. I am honored to have given new life and love to the beloved characters and stories within the vast Paramount and Nickelodeon libraries — from ‘SpongeBob’ to ‘PAW Patrol’ to ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ — and the birth of a whole new slate of originals for today’s generation,” Naito’s note continued. “Not only am I endlessly proud of what we’ve built, but even more so the spirit behind it — the collaboration, creativity, and kindness that define this team. Though I’m moving on, I’ll always be cheering you on (and singing along to the ‘PAW Patrol’ theme or humming the ‘TMNT’ riff when I see your work lighting up screens everywhere).”\n\n\tShe concluded, “Thank you to Josh, Dana and the fantastic leadership team who I know will keep propelling our animation business to great heights.”\n\n\tShe’s referring to Paramount Pictures co-chairs Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, who called Naito an “incredible partner and leader.”\n\n\t“We’re so appreciative of Ramsey’s creativity, dedication, and lasting influence on our animation slate,”  Goldberg and Greenstein said in a statement. “She’s been an incredible partner and leader, and her work has left a lasting mark on our studio as we look toward the future.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tSharon Stone was on hand for Variety’s Power of Women LA event on Wednesday, set to present honors to Sydney Sweeney as one of the evening’s honorees. The two actresses have been working on “Euphoria” Season 3 for several months now, including after Sweeney faced controversy for featuring in an American Eagle ad campaign in July. The commercials centered on the slogan “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,” a pun on “great genes”; it drew backlash from critics who alleged the ads glorified Sweeney’s white heritage and physique.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s okay to use what mama gave you. It’s really fine,” Stone told Variety senior entertainment writer Angelique Jackson on the carpet, voicing her support for Sweeney. “It’s hard to be hot, and I think we all know that. It’s really okay to use every bit of hotness you have — right here, right now — and go for whatever that is. Everybody has their own certain kind of hotness, their own certain thing, and you’re supposed to go for that. Because who are you not to be beautiful? You know, who you are isn’t an accident.”\n\n\tStone recounted a conversation that she had with Sweeney as the “great jeans” controversy was taking hold, as the two actresses continued production on “Euphoria.”\n\n\t“Because I was co-godparents with Jane Goodall, I said, ‘When Jane was on the cover of Life Magazine for her work with gorillas, she was in her safari shorts and shirt, sitting with one of the animals that she was working with. Other scientists said, ‘Well, she only got the cover of Life Magazine because she had good legs.’ And Jane said, ‘Well, if I did, then that helped me get more money for my research,'” Stone said. “Sydney said, ‘Yeah, and I’m sure I made a billion dollars for the jeans company, and I’m good with that. Because, you know what? I’ll get another job.'”\n\t\n\n\tStone is a new addition to the ensemble for “Euphoria” Season 3, which will reportedly take place after a years-long time jump following the events of Season 2. Sweeney is reprising her role from the first two seasons, as are stars Zendaya, Jacob Elordi, Eric Dane, Alexa Demie, Maude Apatow, Colman Domingo and others. While Stone may be a series newcomer, she says she’s been a longtime “Euphoria” fan. \n\n\t“I had to watch it for the 67th time to get caught up again,” Stone joked. “It was such a joy to go to work with these amazing young people.”\n\n\tDirector Paul Feig, who worked with Sweeney on her upcoming thriller “The Housemaid,” also offered his support for his star in her Power of Women Variety cover story, calling the “great jeans” controversy “manufactured” by “a certain segment of the media [who] blew it up.”\n\n\t“She’s probably one of the most confident people I’ve ever met in my life — in a good way. She’s very savvy,” Feig said.\n\n\tAlong with Sweeney, Variety’s Power of Women L.A. event on Wednesday honored Wanda Sykes, Jamie Lee Curtis, Nicole Scherzinger and Kate Hudson. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter several years in development, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation and New Line Cinema are finally moving ahead with the “Hello Kitty” feature film, dating it for July 21, 2028.\n\n\t“Hello Hollywood 🎀🌴🎬 #HelloKittyMovie is coming to theaters July 21, 2028!,” said an Instagram post from the studio on Wednesday.\n\n\t“The film marks Hello Kitty’s Hollywood theatrical debut as Hello Kitty and her friends embark on a cinematic adventure sure to delight audiences of all ages,” the studio said in a statement.\n\t\n\n\tLeo Matsuda is directing, while Dana Fox (“Wicked”) wrote the most recent draft of the script. Matsuda directed the short “Inner Workings” and worked as a story artist on films including “Zootopia” and “Wreck-It Ralph.”\n\n\tProducer Beau Flynn of FlynnPictureCo., spent nearly a decade working with Sanrio founder Shintaro Tsuji to get rights to the character. Shelby Thomas will oversee for FlynnPictureCo.\n\n\tJapan’s Sanrio first introduced the adorable big-headed feline in 1974 and quickly unleashed a merchandising juggernaut, with entire stores devoted to thousands of items branded with Hello Kitty and her friends, such as Dear Daniel and superhero alter ego Ichigoman. There’s a Hello Kitty theme park in Japan, Hello Kitty cafés, dozens of video games and numerous collaborations for high-end clothing and other adult-targeted products.\n\n\tThe English-language feature project was first announced by New Line in 2019, and was the first time Sanrio had licensed film rights to the classic cat. It’s not yet known whether Kitty White (yes, she has a last name) will speak in the film, but lacking a mouth, she has been completely silent to date in several animated series about her adventures. Sanrio also licensed rights to other characters, including the cracked egg character Gudetama, the rabbit character My Melody, and Little Twin Stars, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see them play in the same sandbox as Hello Kitty.\n\t\n\n\tMatsuda is repped by Verve and manager Stacey Lubliner’s SEL media company.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNew Zealand-based sales outfit Black Mandala has acquired “Nightfall: A Paranormal Investigation,” an Australian horror film directed by Myles McEwen and Ripley Stevens, with the production-sales company eyeing franchise potential, it was revealed on the sidelines of TIFFCOM, the Tokyo International Film Festival‘s market arm. \n\n\tSet in 1988, the paranormal thriller follows investigators Mick Sutherland and Archie Charlesworth as they respond to a desperate call from Elizabeth Blair’s isolated home, where they encounter a malevolent presence that unravels their sanity over seven days in what becomes known as Case 13.\n\t\n\n\tThe Adelaide-based filmmaking duo wrote, directed and star in the feature. The film pays homage to classics like “The Exorcist” while offering a fresh take on the paranormal-investigation subgenre.\n\n\n\tMcEwen revealed the project was inspired by unsettling personal experiences. “The film was inspired by a series of haunting events — I watched my co-star Ripley sleepwalk and speak for an entire week in a deceased man’s apartment in Budapest, whilst back in Adelaide, I was told my bedroom light switched on by itself several times,” he said. “It felt as though something spiritual — maybe even demonic — was haunting us.”\n\n\t“Nightfall” has drawn comparisons to James Wan and Leigh Whannell’s work, positioning McEwen and Stevens as part of a new wave of Australian horror filmmakers.\n\n\tBlack Mandala confirmed ongoing collaborations with McEwen and Stevens following the acquisition. The company recently boarded “Hollywood Hells,” a thriller that takes aim at the entertainment industry’s dark side. \n\t\n\n\tMichael Kraetzer and Nicolas Onetti launched Black Mandala in 2017, building it into a leading player in independent horror and genre distribution. Operating from Auckland, New Zealand, the outfit handles north of 100 titles and maintains a presence at major markets, championing visually striking material and cultivating ongoing relationships with genre filmmakers globally.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAI is “the next frontier” for YouTube, according to CEO Neal Mohan — and it might result in the video platform’s shrinking its employee headcount.\n\n\tMohan, in a memo Wednesday to YouTube staffers, announced a major reorg of its product team into three groups: Subscriptions Products (headed by Christian Oestlien), Viewer Products (led by Johanna Voolich, formerly YouTube’s chief product officer), and Creator & Community Products (with a lead yet to be hired).\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Mohan, the moves are related to positioning YouTube for an AI-centric future. “Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform,” Mohan said in an internal memo, as first reported by Alex Heath’s Sources AI newsletter. “We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity.”\n\n\n\tAs part of the shift to AI, YouTube is introducing a “voluntary exit program” for employees, per Mohan’s memo.\n\n\tA YouTube rep, asked for more info, confirmed that YouTube is offering a voluntary exit program with severance for U.S.-based employees who may want to leave the company. However, currently, there are no role eliminations or layoffs happening as part of these changes, the spokesperson said.\n\n\tOther big tech companies are already cutting jobs in anticipation of massive changes introduced by AI. On Tuesday, Amazon said it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, representing about 4% of the total corporate workforce, citing rapid developments in AI; more cuts are expected by the ecommerce giant in 2026.\n\t\n\n\tMohan’s AI-driven reorg memo came prior to parent company Alphabet reporting Q3 earnings. YouTube ad revenue for the period was $10.26 billion, a year-over-year increase of 15%, beating Wall Street analyst forecasts.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThailand has transformed from a scenic backdrop into one of Asia’s most competitive production hubs, backed by enhanced film incentives and robust infrastructure, according to unit production manager Apinat Obb Siricharoenjit, who presented at the MPA seminar at the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\n\tSpeaking at the event, the “Alien: Earth” production manager detailed Thailand’s journey from hosting location shoots to becoming a full-service production destination trusted by studios and filmmakers worldwide. The country has successfully increased its film incentive to 30% on local spend without any cap, up from the initial 15% when first introduced in 2017, with an uplift to 20% before the recent increase at the end of last year.\n\t\n\n\t“What you just saw is actually evidence that Thailand is no longer just a backdrop of any film. It’s rather now developed into one of Asia’s most competitive production hub trusted by studios and filmmakers all over the world,” Siricharoenjit said, following a video showcase of films produced in the country.\n\n\n\tThe production manager, whose company Living Films has put at least 15 films through Thailand’s incentive program and was among the first to utilize it, emphasized that the country’s appeal extends beyond financial incentives. “It’s also the infrastructure, the crew and the creativity of the local people,” he explained.\n\n\tThailand’s success stems from collaboration between government agencies and the private sector. The Ministry of Culture’s Department of Cultural Development and the Department of Tourism work alongside Thailand’s film office and private companies, with industry professionals sitting on advisory boards to guide policy development. “Our government recognizes that film is not just art. It is an industry and a bridge to soft power,” Siricharoenjit noted, adding that stable government policies and competitive incentives have been crucial to attracting international productions.\n\t\n\n\tThe scale of production activity has created substantial economic impact. “Alien: Earth” alone generated 24,000 jobs across the country, with 1,600 local crew members on weekly payroll and a construction crew of 450 people. The production bought out hotels in Krabi in southern Thailand and chartered planes for the shoot.\n\n\tSiricharoenjit emphasized the importance of crew pipeline development, noting that local departments have grown from small units to global-scale teams. “Crew became bilingual, trained by working side by side with the best people in Hollywood, Europe, Korea, Japan,” he said. However, he acknowledged challenges when multiple major productions overlap. During “Alien: Earth” production, at least 70% of Thailand’s crew base was employed, and the situation became more strained when “Jurassic World” arrived, bringing 400 crew members to service their shoot and competing for locations.\n\n\t“Alien: Earth” presented unique challenges that expanded Thailand’s capabilities. “There are departments and sections that we never done in Thailand before, like, for example, we never had a creature department,” Siricharoenjit revealed, explaining how collaboration with international teams helped develop new skills. The elaborate creature eggs featured in the production were crafted by Thai artisans.\n\n\tFilm production continues to drive tourism long after cameras stop rolling. Maya Bay, featured in “The Beach” (2000) starring Leonardo DiCaprio, remains a popular destination despite being “just only a small bay. Actually. It’s really tiny.” The Lebua hotel, which featured in “The Hangover Part II” (2011), still offers a Hangover Suite as one of its best-selling accommodations and serves a Hangover cocktail among its top sellers. More recently, “White Lotus” shot at a property in Koh Samui saw occupancy rates surge after the first two episodes aired, demonstrating “the economic impact of international films.”\n\n\tThe influx of international productions has catalyzed infrastructure development. “The ecosystem starts, and it’s followed with all the vendors, sound stages, rental houses, equipment, base. It’s all growing because of all these international productions that came in, and that’s the demand for it,” Siricharoenjit explained. \n\n\tThe combination of global expertise and local craftsmanship distinguishes Thailand’s offerings. “Art directors with infused local textures, costume teams that understand fabric traditions, crafts people, construction team who built sets. This mix of global skills and local artistry is what makes Thailand truly different,” he said. “Every production leaves more than images on the screen, and film is more than production. It is identity, influence and memory.”\n\t\n\n\tTo maintain its super hub status, Siricharoenjit stressed the need for continued evolution. “We must keep incentives competitive and predictable. Speed of approval, transparency of audit, and you must keep improving on the incentive,” he said, adding that the country must continue connecting film to culture. “We must continue trying film to culture, not just action films in Bangkok or epics in jungles, but dramas in historic towns, stories that showcase our creative cities, our crowds and our music. A super hub is not only a service platform, it is also a cultural part.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs part of Variety’s Screening Series, “Kokuho” production designer Yohei Taneda and producer Chieko Murata joined Variety’s co-editor-in-chief Cynthia Littleton for a candid conversation about the making of the Japanese drama on Oct. 26 in Los Angeles.\n\n\tMurata kicked off the conversation explaining what Kabuki theater offers Japanese audiences by having it as the film’s backdrop and discussed their desire to center a story about a young boy who, after his father’s death, develops into a gifted performer after being adopted by a famous Kabuki actor. \n\t\n\n\t“For Japanese people, especially the younger audience, and a regular U.S. audience, it’s similar,” Murata began. “They have never seen Kabuki and don’t know that much about it. It’s a discovery. Also, they don’t think of it as a movie about Kabuki. It’s a movie about art, two actors and the life of actors.”\n\n\tTaneda touched on the challenges of recreating the different periods of Japanese culture presented throughout the film, in addition to showcasing the elaborate Kabuki styles. \n\n\tOne of the biggest obstacles that Taneda faced was having to build a Kabuki stage from scratch on a sound stage for the last quarter of the film.\n\n\t“We were very cognizant of being able to use what we see as is,” Taneda said. “Generally, with my approach, all the different sets have elements about them that would be slightly different from a real Kabuki stage. One of the challenges is that you cannot rent a Kabuki stage or theater in Japan that actually exists.”\n\n\tMurata, who joined as the film’s producer about five years ago, said she resonated with the film’s themes of life, sacrifice and loneliness. “It’s this complex pressure and life of an artist that no other people can understand,” she said. “A lot of people could resonate with that. That’s universal.” \n\t\n\n\t“Kokuho” stars Ryo Yoshizawa, Ryusei Yokohama and Ken Watanabe. As the conversation ended, Taneda and Murata praised the cast for their performances. Murata said she was inspired by Watanabe’s focus and determination to tell the story while on set. \n\n\tTaneda admired Yokohama and Yoshizawa’s ability to bring depth and complexity to their characters while also introducing Kabuki to a new generation.\n\n\t“They were able to be interpreters of Kabuki to the current generation,” he said. “Through their friendship and lives, Kabuki all of a sudden became very accessible to this new younger crowd.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a Tokyo screening room filled with filmmakers and creators from around the world, Oscar-winning art director Tim Yip delivered a clarion call for preserving human emotion in an age of artificial intelligence. \n\n\t“Technology is so strong, you have to get something more than, higher than the technology to make it as a tool, so not as a god,” Yip said during the KlingAI NextGen Creative Contest awards ceremony and panel discussion.\n\n\n\tThe event, held alongside the Tokyo International Film Festival, showcased winning films from a competition that attracted more than 4,600 submissions from 122 countries and regions, competing for a $42,000 prize pool. But rather than celebrating technical prowess alone, the evening’s most powerful moments centered on deeply personal stories of memory, humanity and the creative partnership between humans and machines.\n\t\n\n\tZeng Yushen, representing Kling AI, set the tone for the evening by framing the contest as more than mere competition. “Tonight isn’t just about awards, it’s about celebrating creators and all the stories they bring to life,” he said. “At Kling AI, we always want to empower creators to give them tools to expand their creative freedom, as well as to give them new tools to do very new storytelling.”\n\n\tYip, who won the Academy Award for art direction for “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” praised the grand prize winner “Alzheimer” for its exploration of memory loss. The film, created by Chinese student C·one and inspired by a team member’s relative suffering from the disease, uses an oil painting aesthetic to depict the inner world of someone experiencing cognitive decline.\n\t\n\n\t“When you are young, the energies come from you, so that you always have a new energy to build up new ideas,” Yip reflected. “But at the end, you are leaving your body, your spirit, and living more and more. So I feel this is really important, no matter AI film or some modern film, or the classical film — they always talk about humans and the relationship with the world and the environment too.”\n\n\tSouth Korean director Lee Hwan-kyung, whose 2013 film “Miracle in Cell No. 7” became a box office phenomenon, echoed the emphasis on emotional authenticity. “I think it’s better to think about how we can collaborate together with AI so that we can bring this human emotion to the movies,” Lee said, drawing laughter when he joked: “I’m just personally hoping that the AI technology really slowly develops.”\n\n\tThe winning creators themselves spoke about how AI tools enabled them to realize deeply personal visions that would have been impossible through traditional filmmaking. Leammonn, a South Korean media artist and adjunct professor who won an official selection award for “I’m Not a Robot,” envisioned AI’s potential to create new forms of storytelling. “I imagine the future of the interactive film,” she said. “If we are making some kind of playground, using the things with technology or with some kind of network, it will be very powerful.”\n\n\tPolish filmmaker and motion designer Dawid Meller, whose “Lost & Found” also received an official selection, described AI as liberating. “I was collecting a lot of ideas, and there are many limits when you’re creating films and stories — you are limited by budget and technology and sometimes bad time of your collaborators,” he said. “But with AI, I could finally free myself and do a lot of these kind of things alone.”\n\n\tC·one, the grand prize winner, described the creative process behind “Alzheimer.” “When I use this AI tool, I just take the clean AI as the first step, like my camera,” he said. “It’s a process for me to start to organize this story and to do real thinking about this storytelling.”\n\n\tYip shared his own experimental journey with AI, describing how he created an alien character searching for human ruins in empty space. “I talked to him, and he changed. He will react to me,” Yip said of the AI tool. “Every time I’m not asking him to do what kind of things, but I am just asking him questions, and then they come up with all these reactions. So that I follow the reaction, and I come more deeper and deeper.”\n\t\n\n\tThe evening highlighted both the possibilities and anxieties surrounding AI in filmmaking. Yip warned against the medium becoming too focused on spectacle. “I worry about when we are still only working on the exciting moments, maybe after five years, no people have the really strong reaction of all that,” he said. “The most important thing is to going back to reality, try to repeat, try to create. But I think AI is really for me, it’s very exciting because I try to push it in some human touch, really sensible human touch.\n\n\tYet the panel’s overarching message was one of collaboration rather than competition. Lee suggested AI could help bridge the traditional conflict between screenwriters and directors by enabling rapid visualization of scenarios. “I believe that there’s a chance that we can actually integrate the one point between the script writer and the person who tries to direct it,” he said.\n\n\tMeller provided a concrete example of AI’s democratizing potential, describing how a scene that would have cost half his film’s budget and taken weeks with traditional effects was roughed out in five minutes using Kling AI. “Now, like, not only big Hollywood studios could afford to make really high quality productions,” he said. “Everyone, even smaller teams or single creators can can actually do it.”\n\n\tThe event was hosted by Kling AI, a platform that has surpassed 45 million users globally and reached an annualized revenue run rate exceeding $100 million within 10 months of launch. The NextGen Creative Contest offered a $42,000 prize pool, with China, the U.S., and India leading in submissions.\n\n\tAs the evening concluded, C·one announced plans to create a new AI film about his hometown region grasslands, while exploring how to better integrate AI with traditional storytelling techniques. Leammonn expressed interest in developing interactive films that could help combat social isolation, while Meller revealed he’s working on both a traditional sci-fi comedy and a fully animated AI series.\n\n\tPerhaps the most memorable insight came from Yip when asked what advice he’d give emerging AI creators. “I think you can do anything,” he said simply, before describing the creative process as moving “from outside to inside.”\n\n\tThe panel was moderated by Hanqing, founder of AI Talk. \n\t\n\n\tIn an era of rapid technological change, the Tokyo gathering suggested that the future of filmmaking may depend less on choosing between human and artificial intelligence, and more on their thoughtful synthesis — with human emotion firmly in the driver’s seat.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney has settled its differences with YouTube over the departure of Justin Connolly, a high-level exec who now oversees YouTube’s media and sports operations.\n\n\tConnolly left Disney in May after 25 years at the company. Disney immediately sued YouTube for poaching him, and sued Connolly for breaching his contract. According to the suit, Connolly was just five months into a new three-year contract as president of platform distribution.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s lawyers filed a notice of settlement on Tuesday, which did not reveal any details of the resolution.\n\n\n\tConnolly was paid $6 million in 2024, making him one of Disney’s highest paid executives. He oversaw a team of 300 people who were responsible for content distribution deals with cable and satellite providers, streaming services and YouTube TV. He reported to Jimmy Pitaro, Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, who in turn report to Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n\n\tAccording to Disney, Connolly’s defection came at a critical time, as the company was beginning its billion-dollar license renewal negotiations with YouTube — with Connolly as lead negotiator. Disney argued that Connolly was effectively switching sides, and would bring a wealth of inside knowledge about Disney’s strategy in those negotiations.\n\n\t(As of now, those talks appear to be at a standstill. Last week, Disney warned customers that its programming could be dropped from YouTube TV imminently if a deal is not reached.)\n\n\tDisney also feared that as YouTube enters into direct competition with ESPN for sports rights, Connolly would have inside information about ESPN’s ability to pay — putting Disney at a competitive disadvantage.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Connolly, he was personally warned by Iger and other top executives that Disney would seek to block him from moving to YouTube.\n\n\tYouTube argued in court that Connolly would be walled off from all negotiations with Disney, and would be required to adhere to his confidentiality obligations to Disney. YouTube’s lawyers also suggested that Disney was merely seeking to use its claim over Connolly’s services as a chip in the license renewal talks — seeking to expedite those talks by offering to release Connolly’s obligations once the talks were concluded. \n\n\tYouTube also argued that Connolly’s contract was effectively at-will, and not a fixed-term agreement, as Disney retained the right to terminate him at any time without necessarily paying out the remainder of his deal absent a release.\n\n\tIn June, Judge James Chalfant denied Disney’s motion for a restraining order to block Connolly from working for YouTube. The judge found that Disney had not shown the requisite emergency and had not shown that it was likely to succeed on the merits.\n\n\tConnolly told the court that he was grateful for the opportunities he received at Disney, and “saddened, though not terribly surprised, that Disney filed a lawsuit against me.”\n\n\t“I desire nothing more than to pursue my dream job at YouTube,” he stated. “And I hope that, in time, Disney will move on from their disappointment over my departure and that I will be able to restore my relationships with so many Disney colleagues.”\n",

The jury began deliberations Tuesday morning and returned the verdict Wednesday afternoon.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Remember ... Grayson was arrested in July 2024 after he killed Massey, who had called 911 in the first place about a possible prowler. Horrific body cam footage came out in the aftermath of the shooting ... which showed the conversation take a deadly turn after Massey turned off a burner on her stove and brought a pot of boiling water over to the sink.\n      \n\n        \n                    \n                      7/6/24\n                  \n      \n    \n          With another deputy looking on, Grayson loses his cool and tells her repeatedly to drop the pot ... before stepping around the counter and shooting her. The Sangamon County Sheriff's Office later fired Grayson -- who claimed he feared Massey meant to throw the boiling water at him.\n      \n    \n          Famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump -- who represented Sonya's family -- told us he and Sonya's father, James Wilburn, weren't buying Grayson's excuse after the body cam footage was released. The family has since secured a $10 million civil settlement connected to her death.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

According to ABC7 Los Angeles, further investigation also uncovered rapes he committed against several women over more than a decade -- he was also convicted of multiple counts including forcible rape, sexual penetration by use of force, rape of an unconscious person, and sodomy by use of force.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Prosecutors said Pearce reportedly met Giles and Cabrales-Arzola at an after-hours rave and later drugged them to facilitate a sexual assault.\n      \n\n          The details of Giles' and Cabrales-Arzola's last moments are disturbing. On November 13, 2021, Giles -- a model and aspiring actress -- was already dead when she was taken to Southern California Hospital at Culver City in the L.A. area, ABC7 reports.\n      \n    \n          Cabrales-Arzola -- an architect -- was in critical condition when she arrived at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Hospital. Her heartbroken family made the difficult decision to take her off life support later that month.\n      \n    \n          Prosecutors told jurors Pearce and co-defendant Brandt Walter Osborn were the ones who dropped the women off at the respective hospitals 2 hours apart ... after they overdosed at the apartment the men shared.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Giles reportedly died of a lethal mix of cocaine, fentanyl, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, and ketamine ... while Cabrales-Arzola died of multiple organ failure, with cocaine, ecstasy, and other undetermined drugs found in her system.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Pearce reportedly denied giving them the drugs that killed them, but after two and half days of deliberation, the jury decided they weren't buying it.\n      \n    \n          Osborn, 46 -- who was facing 2 counts of being an accessory after the fact -- is awaiting a potential retrial after jurors said they were deadlocked over his verdict.\n      \n    \n          Giles' mother, Dusty, reportedly said she was \"so proud\" of the prosecution for winning the case, and happy that Pearce's sexual assault victims \"finally had their day in court\" too.\n      \n      ",

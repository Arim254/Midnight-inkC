    "body": "\n\tDubai-based production companies Front Row Filmed Entertainment and Different Productions — the outfit behind Netflix’s “Dubai Bling” show — have teamed up with Lebanese model and fashion influencer Nour Arida and creative ad agency Read the Room to produce a new reality series for the Middle East market titled “Confidence Is Queen.”\n\n\tThe groundbreaking show, being launched at the Mipcom TV market in Cannes, will sees Arida assemble a team of well-known female mentors “to guide a selected group of Arab women through an emotional and entertaining journey of fears, tears, laughter and discovery,” according to a statement. “More than a reality show, ‘Confidence Is Queen’ aims to ignite a confidence revolution, proving that the power of sisterhood can uplift, inspire and rebuild from the inside out.”\n\t\n\n\tArida, who was born in the U.S. and raised in Beirut, has a social media following of more than 18 million followers on several platforms. She is one of the first Arab women to front worldwide campaigns of top brands such as Swiss watchmaker Audemars Piguet.\n\n\n\tThrough the show, Arida will “extend her advocacy for women’s empowerment to television, tackling the very real confidence and self-worth challenges faced by women across the region and beyond,” the statement noted.\n\n\t“I know this show is going to be revolutionary on so many levels, and I’m so happy with my partnerships in it. Between Front Row, Different and Read the Room, we’re bringing to the table something disruptive, entertaining and creative all at once,” Arida said in the statement.\n\t\n\n\t“Confidence Is Queen” will mark Front Row’s first foray into reality TV. The distribution company, which is headed by Gianluca Chakra, has been branching out into production in recent years. They previously produced Netflix’s first Arab original feature film “Perfect Strangers,” a remake of the Italian smash hit which went on to top the charts in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and reached the No. 3 spot globally, and psychological thriller “The Sand Castle,” which premiered on the platform in 2025 and also reached the No. 3 spot on Netflix’s global charts. \n\n\tRead the Room is an independent creative advertising agency created by five female founders, including former Leo Burnett Middle East Agency exec Natasha Romariz Maasri, with backgrounds in global ad agencies across Beirut, Dubai, New York, Montreal and Rio de Janeiro. The founders are known for impactful women’s rights campaigns in the Middle East and have collectively won many industry awards, including several from Cannes Lions.\n\n\tThe “Confidence Is Queen” project is being co-produced with Different Productions, the company behind Netflix’s hit “Dubai Bling,” “Shark Tank Dubai” and “It’s OK,” which is an intimate look at Lebanese superstar Elissa. “Dubai Bling” has been both a local and international hit, having reached the No. 2 spot globally on Netflix.\n\n\tRead the Room and Arida will also help co-develop and promote the show with an aim resonate both locally and internationally.\n\n\t“’Confidence Is Queen” is more than a show. It’s a statement. Our partnership between Front Row and Different Productions came naturally: one rooted in bold, thought-provoking cinema, the other in globally resonant and impactful reality storytelling. Together, we’re blending cinematic craft with raw authenticity to create something powerful, relatable and real,” Front Row’s Gianluca Chakra and Different Productions’ Mazen Laham jointly underlined in the statement. \n\n\t“At its core is Nour Arida, a woman who embodies elegance, vulnerability, and unapologetic confidence. She represents a new generation of Arab women unafraid to be both strong and imperfect. That truth is what makes this project not just entertaining, but deeply human and profoundly inspiring,” they added.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBBC Studios extolled the virtues of its partnership with YouTube at Mipcom on Monday.\n\n\tBBC Studios digital SVP Jasmine Dawson and YouTube’s EMEA boss Pedro Pina appeared at the Cannes TV confab in a panel hosted by Map of Media’s Evan Shapiro to shed light on how the two companies – ostensibly competing for the same audiences – are working together to build their fanbases.\n\n\t“Putting our audience obsession at the heart of everything we do is what makes our business work now. Being ‘fandom-first,’” said Dawson. “BBC Studios is proud to build the biggest fandoms across the world … that’s why the partnership of YouTube is so critical, because that partnership is enabling and driving that ‘creative earth’ mindset.”\n\t\n\n\tDawson cited the BBC Earth YouTube channel, which is one of BBC Studios’ longest-standing channels on the platform and boasts 14 million subscribers, as an example of the partnership’s success.\n\n\n\t“But what we are excelling at is finding our fandoms across the world who care about this, who are finding their place to be able to engage with the content they love and the content that resonates with them,” she said. “For us, that’s not just about finding the fandoms where they live, but also understanding we can monetize those audiences, both on platform and off platform.”\n\n\tDawson also made the point that the company, which is the commercial arm of U.K. broadcaster BBC, is not “sacrificing anything” by making its content available for free on the Google-owned social media platform. “We see this with so many of our IPs, it’s not a mutually exclusive game,” she said. “We’re not sacrificing anything. Actually it’s incremental. And that is a really powerful conversation to have our distribution partners, whether it’s ‘Bluey’ with Disney or some of our BBC Earth titles with PBS and other distributors, they understand that this is where the fandom grows, and then it drives incrementality.”\n\t\n\n\tYouTube’s Pina also made the case to the audience, comprised of many TV industry execs, as to why they should partner with what many imagine is a competitor to the distribution and broadcasting business.\n\n\t“We all know that there is amazing content creation happen around happening around the world. BBC Studios is one of the best content creators in our world, but there’s tons, and we found out they actually congregate here every year. So we decided to be here this year to actually say, look, the same rule that applies to our content creators applies to anyone who creates content. Everyone could be a YouTuber … You find smart and great ways of monetizing that we share that success. We don’t commission stuff so we don’t give money and then make profit back. What we do is if you’re successful, I’m successful. If you’re not successful, I’m not successful. It’s the best combination ever. The audience will determine whether the content is good or not.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTitan Operating System S.L. (Titan OS) has announced a strategic partnership with Tubi, a leading ad-supported streaming service. \n\n\tThe deal will grant Titan OS exclusive access to Tubi’s premium advertising inventory in the U.K., covering “pre-roll and mid-roll advertising on Tubi, which launched in the U.K. in 2024, and unlocking new opportunities for audience engagement and monetization on Connected TV,” it was stated. \n\n\n\tBarcelona-based technology, entertainment and advertising company Titan OS has branches in Amsterdam and Taipei. Tubi, a free streaming service headquartered in San Francisco – with over 100 million monthly active users – is part of Tubi Media Group, a division of Fox Corporation. \n\t\n\n\t“The Tubi partnership is a strong validation of Titan OS’s mission to rethink TV: to make Connected TV more open, measurable and monetizable,” Tobi Pfalzgraff, SVP People & Marketing, told Variety.\n\n\t“As the European CTV landscape matures, collaborations like this one will define the next phase of growth: where audience insight, quality content and advertising innovation converge to deliver value across the entire ecosystem.” \n\n\tTitan OS will act as an exclusive sales partner for Tubi’s ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) inventory across all CTV platforms, leveraging its in-house sales teams and SSP partners to bring campaigns to market. Both companies will also collaborate on “advanced data innovation,” combining insights from Tubi, Philips TVs, and JVC TVs to deliver “highly targeted campaigns and superior ad experiences.”\n\t\n\n\tJames Collins, CRO at Titan OS, called it “a milestone in our mission to redefine how brands connect with audiences through Connected TV.” By combining Titan OS’s data capabilities with Tubi’s content and audiences, they will now offer advertisers a “unique opportunity to unlock the full potential of AVOD.”\n\n\t“At Tubi, we are committed to offering advertisers innovative ways to reach audiences that are 100% addressable while providing viewers with a free premium entertainment experience that’s personalized to their tastes,” said Ross Appleton, GM, UK at Tubi. \n\n\t“Our partnership allows us to combine Tubi’s rich content collection with Titan OS’s cutting-edge data and sales expertise, creating a powerful proposition for both advertisers and viewers.”\n\n\tPfalzgraff noted that the partnership is “exciting because it brings together two complementary strengths: Tubi’s exceptional content offering and audience scale with Titan OS’s advanced advertising and data capabilities.” \n\n\t“Tubi has become one of the most popular ad-supported streaming platforms in the world and by integrating their inventory into the Titan OS ecosystem, we’re creating a premium, metrics-driven advertising environment that benefits viewers, advertisers and content owners alike. It’s a significant step forward in making Connected TV advertising as smart and effective as digital — but with the reach and impact of television.”\n\n\tFor Titan OS, this step “underlines our evolution from a CTV operating system to a full-scale monetization and data platform.” \n\n\t“It demonstrates the trust that global content owners like Tubi place in our ability to manage, enrich and monetize inventory at scale in European markets such as the United Kingdom.”\n\n\tAccording to Pfalzgraff, there’s a clear industry trend: content partners and inventory owners want local, metrics-driven monetization solutions that can deliver the right ad to the right audience while maintaining premium user experiences. \n\n\t“We expect more partners to lean into Titan OS’s monetization capabilities as this shift accelerates,” he said.\n\n\tAt Mipcom, the company is hosting its Annual Content Partner Summit, focusing on CTV inventory monetization, content monetization – with the Titan-Tubi partnership as a case study – and performance measurement on CTV, together with Kochava.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s all about building a sustainable and data-informed ecosystem where content owners, advertisers and technology partners thrive together,” summed up Pfalzgraff.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPropagate Content announced Monday at Mipcom that Sky has come on board to co-produce the feature documentary “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” an authorized but unfiltered documentary on comedy legend Chevy Chase.\n\n\tThe film, which is set to debut on Sky Documentaries in early 2026, is directed by two-time Emmy Award winner Marina Zenovich, whose work includes “Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic” and “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind.” \n\t\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to have Sky join the exceptional team behind this definitive portrait of Chevy Chase,” Howard T.

Marina Zenovich is the ideal filmmaker to take on the sharp edge and brilliance of this legend and we cannot wait to bring this film to Sky and NOW audiences.”\n\n\tIn the film, Zenovich attempts to bring viewers into Chase’s inner world through interviews with his family, friends and co-stars, revealing what is beneath the surface of his bravado.\n\n\t“I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not” is presented by CNN Films and West Buttermilk in association with Propagate Content, Five All in the Fifth Productions, and Sky. The film is executive produced by Zenovich along with P.G. Morgan for PMZ Pictures; Amy Entelis and Roxanna Sherwood for CNN Films; James Packer for West Buttermilk; Ben Silverman, Howard T.

    "body": "\n\tSome of the U.K.’s most prominent studios and screen organizations have been sent a legal warning over an industry boycott of Israeli film institutions.\n\n\tThe letter from U.K. Lawyers for Israel states that the boycott, which has been backed by Hollywood stars including Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Olivia Colman and Mark Ruffalo, is a breach of the U.K.’s Equality Act and may also have a knock-on impact on financing and insurance. \n\n\n\tThe U.K. outposts of Netflix, Disney, Amazon Studios, Apple and Warner Bros. Discovery are among those who have been sent the letter as well as domestic companies including the BBC, Film4 and ITV. Other recipients include film organizations such as the BFI and Pact, agencies Curtis Brown and United Agents and unions including Bectu and Equity.\n\t\n\n\t“[The Equality Act 2010] is the key legislation in the U.K. protecting against racism and discriminatory treatment,” states the letter, which has been seen by Variety. “If the U.K. television and film industry colludes with acts contrary to this legislation, organizations are themselves likely to be in breach. It also creates a dangerous precedent: one that condones the exclusion of individuals and/or organizations based solely on their nationality, ethnicity, and/or religion.”\n\n\tThe letter also claims that the boycott’s attempt at “selective application — exempting some institutions based on the ethnicity or religion of their members — strongly indicates that [its] operation is based not only on nationality but also on religion and ethnicity.” According to Film Workers for Palestine, which organized the boycott, it does not apply to Palestinian Israelis, for whom there are different “context sensitive guidelines.”\n\t\n\n\tAlthough the boycott claims only to target Israeli-linked film institutions and not individuals, the Equality Act protects organizations as well as people. This is likely to be particularly relevant in the screen industry, where many actors and producers contract their services through companies.\n\n\tStudios could potentially be liable for any breaches of the Equality Act carried out by their “staff and agents,” according to the letter. Actors, producers, agents, managers, production companies, producers and “anyone else who instructs, causes, induces, or helps to implement the Boycott– for example, encouraging a distributor not to deal with Israeli outlets, or advising a colleague to insist on a Boycott clause” could also incur liability.\n\n\tThe letter goes on to state that deliberate attempts to breach the Equality Act are “highly likely to be a litigation risk and a notifiable event” for the purposes of insurance and may even invalidate insurance policies.\n\n\tThere is also a potential knock-on effect on funding, with most funding bodies such as the BFI requiring productions to be compliant with the Equality Act.\n\n\t“It follows that a breach of the [Act] through the Boycott, would render a film ineligible for government funding, or trigger clawback of finance already granted,” the letter warns.\n\n\tMore than 4,000 film industry names have signed the boycott including Yorgos Lanthimos, Ava DuVernay, Adam McKay, Boots Riley, Emma Seligman, Joshua Oppenheimer and Mike Leigh. They have pledged “not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions — including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” In an asterisk, the letter clarifies that “implicated” is defined as “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them.”\n\n\tLast month, the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights under Law of Washington D.C. sent out a letter to U.S. companies stating that the boycott infringes U.S. Federal and State laws. “Numerous federal and state civil rights laws plainly prohibit applying the Hollywood Blacklist [Boycott] against Israeli, and specifically Jewish Israeli, individuals and organizations based or operating in the U.S., and offer victims a mechanism for holding accountable those organizations and individuals responsible for violating their rights,” the Brandeis Centre letter warns. “To be clear: these laws apply to you, and not only to those direct signatories who would unlawfully aid, abet, and incite you to apply the Hollywood Blacklist.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohn Oliver took the opportunity on Sunday’s episode of “Last Week Tonight” to do a deep dive on Bari Weiss, the opinion journalist and co-founder of the Free Press who is now the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\n\tParamount, the parent company of CBS which recently merged with David Ellison’s Skydance, announced last week that it would be acquiring Weiss’ Free Press and that she would be leading the broadcaster’s newsroom. The decision raised eyebrows as Weiss is known for her contrarian takes and, as Oliver pointed out, does not have much experience in hard news.\n\t\n\n\t“She’s been given editorial control of a massive news organization even though she’s never run a TV network, has no experience directing television coverage and, as one ’60 Minutes’ producer pointed out, is not even a reporter,” Oliver said. “That is true. She didn’t come up through the news side of a newspaper but through the opinion pages, which are a very different thing.”\n\n\n\tOliver then dissected her publication, the Free Press, which he said enforces a “pronounced theme” that “the left has gone too far.”\n\n\t“Basically whatever issue you feel that is true for — Israel, campus politics, DEI or police reform — you’ll find articles there to reinforce your opinion,” he said. “And look, I’m not saying the left never goes too far or that it’s immune from criticism at all. But it can sometimes feel like the Free Press’ conclusions can get out ahead of its evidence, which brings us to the fact that some of its pieces can be pretty poorly fact-checked, and in ways that feel important.”\n\n\tThough Oliver said that “there are many opinion-heavy outlets out there” — of which “Last Week Tonight” is one — he acknowledged that his show is “not the news.”\n\t\n\n\t“I wouldn’t want anyone who led a pure opinion outlet, not even one that I happened to agree with, to suddenly be running CBS News,” he said. “But it is especially alarming to have someone doing it who has spent years putting out work that, in my opinion, is at best irresponsible and at worst deeply misleading.”\n\n\tOliver then took aim at Paramount Skydance CEO Ellison, who recently also expressed interest in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\t“It is not just about Bari Weiss being at CBS, it’s about the fact that CBS is now under the control of someone who thinks that she, and her editorial sensibility, make her a good fit for the job,” he said. “And who, incidentally, is reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, home of CNN and — uh oh — HBO. Which isn’t ideal, although I’ve gotta say, if what he likes about Bari is that she forces him to have hard conversations that get a bit uncomfortable, maybe he’ll like this.”\n\n\tOliver continued: “But the thing is, it’s not just about Ellison either. Again, he’s just the latest in a string of billionaires who have taken over our journalistic institutions, from the Washington Post to the L.A. Times, and started making worrying changes. And whatever complaints I might have had with their coverage before, and I have had plenty, my solution would never have been this. Because when these takeovers get announced, it’s easy to think, ‘Well, thank goodness there are other outlets that aren’t under some billionaire’s influence.’ And that is true, because there is always another. Until there suddenly isn’t.”\n\n\tOliver admitted that he doesn’t “know what is going to happen next” and it’s possible that Weiss could “completely reshape CBS News.” \n\n\t“But it is worth keeping an eye out for subtle changes there. Because while I’m sure many of CBS’ good journalists will continue to do good work, if you start seeing people resigning or getting fired or you start seeing stories that seem off in some way — especially if it involves the left going too far on a topic Bari Weiss cares about — it’s worth asking yourself why that might be,” Oliver concluded. “Because unfortunately, the much bigger answer might be that a billionaire has chosen to inject contrarian, right-leaning opinion journalism into an American icon.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch Oliver’s full segment below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDearest gentle reader, prepare to swoon over the love story between Benedict and Sophie in Season 4 of Netflix’s “Bridgerton.”\n\n\tThe streamer has revealed the release dates and teaser trailer for the hit show, and it’s arriving in two parts. The first four episodes will debut on Jan. 29, 2026, and the remaining four drop on Feb. 26, 2026.\n\n\tPer Netflix’s description for Season 4, “’Bridgerton’ turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict. Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother’s masquerade ball.”\n\t\n\n\tThe new season stars Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton, Yerin Ha as Sophie Baek, Jonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton, Victor Alli as Lord John Stirling, Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury, Julie Andrews as Lady Whistledown, Lorraine Ashbourne as Mrs. Varley, Masali Baduza as Michaela Stirling, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Bridgerton and Hannah Dodd as Francesca Stirling.\n\n\n\tAdditional series regulars include Daniel Francis as Lord Marcus Anderson,  Ruth Gemmell as Violet Bridgerton, Florence Hunt as Hyacinth Bridgerton,  Martins Imhangbe as Will Mondrich, Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton, Luke Newton as Colin Bridgerton, Golda Rosheuvel as Queen Charlotte, Will Tilston as Gregory Bridgerton, Polly Walker as Portia Featherington, Emma Naomi as Alice Mondrich and Hugh Sachs as Brimsley.\n\n\tThe fourth season marks the halfway point for Netflix’s “Bridgerton” TV series adaptation. Based on Julia Quinn’s romance series about the eight siblings in the titular Bridgerton family, the streamer is set to adapt all eight books. It was previously announced that Netflix renewed “Bridgerton”  for Seasons 5 and 6.\n\t\n\n\tThe remaining Bridgerton siblings left to tell their love stories after Benedict include Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie), Francesca (Hannah Dodd), Gregory (Will Tilston) and Hyacinth (Florence Hunt).\n\n\tAdditional cast members in Season 4 include Simone Ashley as Kate Bridgerton, Isabella Wei as Posy Li, Michelle Mao as Rosamund Li and Katie Leung as Lady Araminta Gun.\n\n\tWatch the teaser for “Bridgerton” Season 4 below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBest known as a fast-rising producer with focus on diversity, Nigeria-born Londoner Joy Gharoro-Akpojotor made her breakout out in 2019 with “Blue Story,” Rapman’s musical crime drama that smashed box office records, and followed this in 2021 with Aml Ameen’s rom-com “Boxing Day,” the U.K.’s first all-Black Christmas movie. \n\n\tDespite having numerous projects in the pipeline through her Joi Productions banner, including “Animol.” the directorial debut of Emmy-nominated “Adolescence” star Ashley Walter, Gharoro-Akpojotor has now taken her own turn in the director’s chair for “Dreamers,” which she also wrote.\n\t\n\n\tThe film, which first bowed in London and has just had in U.K. premiere at the BFI London Film Festival, is a queer romance set within a British immigration center following two Nigerian asylum seekers who find love while battling the system and dreaming of a new life beyond confinement. As Gharoro-Akpojotor — who herself claimed asylum based on her sexuality — notes, “Dreamers” is deeply personal connections. It’s also landing in U.K. and Irish cinemas on Dec. 5, with We Are Parable having acquired rights.\n\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety, the filmmaker discusses making the leap from producer to director, making films that feel commercial but ask audiences “tough questions,” and the film she’s producing which she describes as like a London version of “The Goonies,” this time set in Hackney. \n\t\n\t\tWhere did “Dreamers” come from? I understand it has a personal connection?\t\n\n\tIt is loosely based on my own life. I was also an asylum seeker under my sexuality. And for me, when I was going through that process, I just remember at the time that you really get stripped of who you are. So I wanted to tell a story about actual women and their relationships. And for me, it was my friends that really kept me going. So I also wanted to do something about that as well, and to highlight the ridiculousness of the system. The rules have changed now, but at the time, when I was 25, you had to prove that you were gay. And it’s like, how do you prove that you’re gay? What does that even mean or look like?\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI feel like every film about immigration comes out at a particuarly poignant time, but right now, given what’s going on in the U.S. and the U.K. and across the world, it couldn’t be more important\t\n\n\tI think you’re right, now more than ever. Whenever I look at the news in any shape or form, it’s never about the immigrants themselves. It’s about everyone. It’s about the hatred towards them. It’s about the government making up these rules and policies. This film is meant to be about one woman who’s come through. This is her story of what was happening to her. And we never talk about that part of things. It’s the humanization of reminding people that immigrants are people as well.\n\n\tIt’s easy for people to hate immigration, because when Trump says something like they’re all criminals and they’re all rapists, you’re just thinking, oh, it’s a big group of criminals that’s come across, and now they’re here and they’re raping our women. it’s language that you use to collectivize people.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘Dreamers’\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSo what was it about this “Dreamers” that made you want to direct for the first time?\t\n\n\tBecause it’s so personal to me. It sounds cheesy, but I really felt a calling to tell this story. I think even with the films that I produce, they’re all part of me. I genuinely see myself in all of those stories. And part of the reason why even began Joi Productions was because, selfishly, I wanted to see myself on screen. I want to see Black lesbians, immigrants, women. I want to see people who look like me, people who love like me, people who’ve lived my life. I think there is a lack of diversity in diversity and by that I mean there is a lack of breadth of how we’re allowed to be diverse. Obviously, we’ve done immigration films before, but for me it was like, this is a love story that happens to be set in an immigration centre.\n\t\n\t\tHaving now made your directorial debut, are you planning to do more?\t\n\n\tYeah, and there’s one in particular. I optioned a book as a producer called “Ordinary People” by Diana Evans. I really love the book. And then I was like, actually, I think I want to direct this one. So I gave it to Emily [Morgan, producer]. She had a read and was like, yeah, I’m on board. So we’re doing that one, but I’m not writing it. Marissa Lestrade is. But that will be my second feature. I’m also doing a queer romcom as well. It was like, God, “Dreamers” was sad, we need to do something happy! It’s going to star Aiysha Hart, who was also in “Dreamers” and it’s about a Saudi family and a Nigerian family having a little wedding. The sisters have to save the wedding from falling apart and in the midst of that, they fall in love.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSo are you keeping your producer hat on or is that off for now as you focus on directing?\t\n\n\tOh no, I’m just trying to be an overachiever!\n\t\n\t\tWhat have you got coming up?\t\n\n\tI’m doing Ashley Walters’ debut “Animol.” We’ve locked the picture and it looks absolutely beautiful. I think when it does come out, people are going to be pleasantly surprised. And I think that people will look at Ashley in a very different way to the work that he’s done as an actor. It’s honestly such a beautiful film.\n\t\n\t\tIs there a through-line connecting everything you make at Joi?\t\n\n\tOriginally, the company was very much: Black, queer and female. But I will say, in all the projects that we do, we are always calling the audience for a challenge. There’s some sort of social change. So whether that’s “Dreamers” and immigration or “Animol,” which is about questioning the way we look at youth offenders. And there’s another film that we’re working on about young Black men and mental health. As a company, it’s about how can we make films that feel commercial but are really asking audiences tough questions.\n\n\tBut we do have a fun movie, which is sort of like our version of the “Goonies,” called “Back to the End.” There’s these four young teenagers whose estate is about to be taken over, but one of them finds that his granddad had some hidden treasure for his grandmother. So they goes in this epic journey through Hackney, while being chased by these dodgy guys. It’s a funny, young movie, but again, it’s really about how we’ve let communities slip for, I guess, money. And we’ve also got a creature horror about — and this sounds crazy — a worm that turns people racist. It’s based on a fairy tale and the idea is there’s this little worm that finds its way into the pipes and water system and feeds off people’s hate.\n\t\n\t\tAmazing. I’m sold. What stage are those films at?\t\n\n\tThe worm one, we’re gonna go out to a director, and then the Goonies one, it’s being written. But they’re all with the BFI or the BBC or somebody. So we’re very lucky that we’re being supported by the industry in that way. But like I say, all our films have some sort of commercial aspect to it, but they’re all saying something and doing something. Our little trojan horse!\n",

    "body": "\n\tA documentary about Taylor Swift‘s Eras Tour has long been the stuff of rumor, and now it’s finally confirmed as the stuff of reality — but there’s much more to it than expected. The singer announced Monday that a six-part docuseries, “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era,” will premiere on Disney+ on Dec. 12, accompanied by the simultaneous release of a new concert film, “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show,” shot at the tour finale in Vancouver, B.C.\n\t\n\n\tAs announced on “Good Morning America,” the documentary series is described as “an intimate look at Taylor’s life as her tour made headlines and thrilled fans around the world,” spotlighting “performers, family members, and friends” including tour opening acts Gracie Abrams and Sabrina Carpenter and guests Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch. The first two of the six episodes will go up for streaming on Dec. 12, with two more episodes at a time each of the two weeks after that.The concert film bows at the same time as those first two docuseries installments. It will mark the first time fans have gotten a chance to see the material that was added to the Eras Tour from the “Tortured Poets Department” on the big screen. Her earlier “Eras Tour” theatrical concert film (which also eventually made its way to Disney+) was released before that album came out or songs from it were added to the tour set list.\n\n\n\tA teaser trailer for the documentary lasting a minute and 39 seconds was released right after the announcement; watch it below.\n\n\n\n\n\t“It was the End of an Era and we knew it,” Swift wrote in announcing the projects on her social media. “We wanted to remember every moment leading up to the culmination of the most important and intense chapter of our lives, so we allowed filmmakers to capture this tour and all the stories woven throughout it as it wound down. And to film the final show in its entirety.”\n\n\t“Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era” is directed by Don Argott, co-directed by Sheena M. Joyce and produced by Object & Animal. “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show,” meanwhile, is directed by Glenn Weiss and produced by Taylor Swift Productions in association with Silent House Productions.\n\t\n\n\n\tThe concert movie will show viewers the Eras Tour finale that took place at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver on Dec. 8, 2024. (Read Variety‘s review of that show here.) Her setlist for that capper to the $2 billion-grossing, nearly two-year tour ran to 45 songs and included the additional “Female Rage: The Musical Segment” that had been added to the show after the release of “The Tortured Poets Department.” Additionally, the “surprise songs” segment for that show featured medleys of “A Place in This World”/”New Romantics” and “Long Live/New Year’s Day.” It wasn’t immediately revealed whether the concert film will include the entire length of the show.\n\n\tNews of which platforms would be running with Swift’s next project — or, as it now turns out, projects — had already been tipped on Sunday, when the logos for Disney+ and Hulu were overlaid atop the Instagram image “GMA” posted teasing a big on-air announcement from Swift for Monday morning. There’s synergy aplenty there, with the reveal coming on the Disney-owned ABC.\n\n\tThe likely existence of a documentary and/or concert film had weighed heavy on Swifties’ minds ever since they noticed the presence of camera crews above and beyond what was needed to fill the arena’s big screens during the final show of the Eras Tour in Vancouver, B.C., in December 2023. A previous concert movie filmed on the tour, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” had already come out in theaters at that time.\n\n\tThe superstar previously took “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” to Disney+ in April 2024 after the film’s record-breaking run in theaters. Just as “Eras Tour” had quickly become the highest-grossing concert movie ever in cinemas in late 2023, when it went to Disney+ months later it set a record for initial streaming of a concert film, getting 4.6 million views on the platform in its first three days of availability. The tour film going exclusively to Disney+ was a sign Swift was pleased with how the platform handled the late 2020 release of her documentary “Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions.” (Swift previously had concert films or documentaries go out through Netflix and Apple.)\n\n\tThis new docuseries and concert film will both be bypassing theaters, unlike the “Eras Tour” concert movie of two years ago. But theater owners don’t have too much to complain about on the Swift front right now. She did just give them “Taylor Swift: The Release Party of a Showgirl,” an album-release promotional event which was No. 1 at the box office with a $33 million gross in theaters for a mere three-day run.\n\t\n\n\tThe Eras Tour doc will come on the heels of Swift not only topping the box office with “Release Party” but topping the Billboard 200 with a record-breaking first week for the album “The Life of a Showgirl.” In only five days, it broke the high-water mark for an album in a single week, a record previously held by the debut outing for Adele’s “25” 10 years ago.\n\n\tBesides ABC sharing a corporate parent with Disney+, Swift taking to ABC for this announcement made good on her long-time association with “Good Morning America” — coming a week after she seemed to be showing NBC all the love with appearances on Jimmy Fallon’s and Seth Myers’ late-night talk shows. Ratings showed that “The Tonight Show” came away with the best ratings in the 18-to-49 demo in eight months, and Myers’ “Late Night” had its top audience in that demo since January.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTallinn’s Baltic Event Co-Production Market  – an industry sidebar to the Black Nights Film Festival – has unveiled exclusively to Variety the strong line up of 15 European titles from 13 countries competing for the hefty €20,000 ($23,200) Eurimages Co-Production Development Award.\n\n\tFor the second year, the lineup also takes in films aimed at kids and youth from the Black Nights Film festival (PÖFF)’s Just Film program.\n\t\n\n\tThe slate, completed from a record 111 submissions from 44 different countries, runs the gamut from debuts works to compelling stories from acclaimed directors. \n\n\n\t“It’s exciting to see strong and diverse voices shaping how stories are being told across Europe, said co-managers Helen Räim and Kärt Väinola who cite the Czech Talent Vojtěch Strakatý, Venice Orizzonti selected in 2024 with “After Party”, Laura Ferrés, (“The Permanent Picture”), “one of Spain’s most exciting emerging filmmakers,” and Tudor Giurgiu (“Why Me?“) “one of the most experienced directors in Romania.”\n\n\tThe co-honchos also underscored the number of “familiar names among the projects represented both from previous Co-Production Markets or other Industry@Tallinn sections” such as Spain’s Liliana Torres (a 2024 SXSW winner for “Mamifera”) who attended the Black Nights Film Festival (aka PÖFF) with “What Went Wrong” in 2021, or Albania’s Gentian Koçi who showcased “A Cup of Coffee and New Shoes On” at PÖFF official selection in 2022.\n\n\tRäim and Väinola also emphasized the larger geographical spread, allowing for wider co-production opportunities. “Thanks to the Catalonia Focus and Austrian Spotlight, we’re so glad to see possibilities for new collaborations between regions, towards Southern and Western Europe, where strong creative and production bonds are still being built. But we can see that the stories being told clearly really support this approach, opening up new opportunities for producers not only in financing but also in reaching new audiences.”\n\t\n\n\tTheme-wise, Väinolain (in charge of the Just Film industry program), said this year’s slate “really mirrors what’s happening in the world right now. The youth and children’s projects touched on topics like social media, mental health, and coming-of-age stories that didn’t shy away from life’s more difficult challenges. Luckily, there was also balance. While there were stories about hardships, there was also a strong focus on hope, growth and overcoming those challenges. So, we had the classic themes you’d expect in children’s and youth projects, but with a clear influence from the realities of today’s world.”\n\n\tHer colleague Räim underlined the overall running thread of “female protagonists navigating questions of identity, body and autonomy. This reflects a clear rise in female-driven storytelling,” she said. “Many of the works also engage deeply with mental health and grief, portraying emotional struggles, depression, loss, and healing, often through subtle poetic or surreal tones.”\n\n\tShe went on: “Alongside these intimate concerns, several films focus on social and political issues, reflecting Europe’s ongoing geopolitical anxieties. As many narratives extend the subject of belonging and displacement, characters frequently feel out of place, whether geographically or emotionally, whereas addressing themes of migration, exile, and nostalgia.”\n\n\tGenre-wide, Räim said this year’s crop also stands out hybrid tones of filmmaking, blending drama with humor or fusing realism and surrealism, rejecting rigid genre boundaries.” This year’s Baltic Event Co-Production Market jury includes Eurimages’ Els Hendrix, Danish producer Katrin Pors (Snowglobe) and ZDF commissioning editor Jörg Schneider.\n\n\tThe 15 selected teams will present their projects Nov.19 at a session moderated by Sibylle Kurz and Márk Szilágyu. They will also sit on around 300 pre-arranged meetings with industry reps.\n\n\tThe Baltic Event Co-Production Market will unspool Nov 19-21 and the full Industry @Tallinn & Baltic Event Nov. 14-21.\n\n\tFull Baltic Event Co-Production Market lineup 2025:\n\n\t“Alice Wants to Live” (Denys Sobolev, Ukraine, Latvia)Produced by Vitaliy Dokalenko, Ganzafilm, with Andrejs Ekis, Cinevilla FilmsAn intimate Kyiv-based war drama from Ukraine-born Sobolev (“The Hitcher Girl”). After a drone strike destroys her home, Alice, a graphic designer in her thirties, finds unexpected love with Vadym, a soldier briefly on leave. “The audience is tired of news, numbers, and analysis about war in Ukraine,” says Ganzafilm’s Olena Morentsova “This is not a film that explains war. It is a film that explains what it feels like to live through it.”\n\t\n\n\t“Climacteric” (Liliana Torres, Spain, Poland)Produced by Carla Sospedra Salvadó, Edna Cinema, and Miriam Porté, Gerard Marginedas, of Distinto FilmsFirst pitched at Locarno’s Match Me, the project reunites the team behind the 2024 SXSW winner “Mamífera:” Torres, actress Anna Alarcón and producers from Edna and Distinto Films. Alarcón plays A woman who transforms herself, aligning with nature and changing her reality when menopause converges with a world in destruction. “It’s an innovative and socially-relevant film that boldly addresses a universal yet silenced topic: menopause,” says Sospedra Salvadó. “Blending intimate realism with elements of body horror, it offers a unique voice with strong international potential.”\n\n\t“Cold Sun” (Gentian Koçi, Albania, France)Production by Gentian Koçi, Blerina Hankollari for Artalb Film Productions with France’s Halley ProductionsA psychological drama in which a man in his fifties, freshly released from 20 years in jail for the murder of his wife, starts to fall in love for a solitary woman, before realising that this love is becoming his real prison. “It’s a visually poetic meditation, stripped of conventional emotional cues and narrative exposition,” says seasoned Albanian director-producer Gentian Koçi (“Daybreak,” “A Cup of Coffee and New Shoes On”). “The film unfolds a complex male protagonist and brings to the big screen a perpetrator’s perspective, resisting redemption, catharsis, and moral resolution.”\n\n\t“Heart Beats” (Johanna Lietha, Austria, Switzerland)Produced by Karin Berghammer, Kathi Posch, Berghammer Film with NGF Vienna and Tellfilm ZurichThe sophomore pic by Lietha, whose debut “Lovecut” nabbed best screenplay at the Max Ophüls Festival. When Lia (12) has to move to Vienna with her father, she goes into full boycott mode, but an unwanted stepsister, a chaotic drummer and the magic of rhythms help her to express her anger and grief, allowing her to finally rediscover herself.“It’s a humorous portrayal of the challenges of a patchwork family, treating its protagonist with Down Syndrome like all the other characters, without reducing her to her disability,” says Berghammer.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHeart Beats\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Johnny” (Jaak Kilmi, Estonia, Latvia, Finland)Produced by Peeter Urbla and Sander Lebreht, Exitfilm, with Finland’s Bufo and Latvia’s Studio LocomotiveA historical drama by the seasoned Jaak Kilmi (“Vari,” “Disco and Atomic War”), selected last year at PÖFF with his period drama “The Shadow.” A biopic set in post-war Estonia, 1948, about the student years of Estonia’s former president Lennart Meri. “It’s a powerful coming-of-age story that mirrors the uncertainty and ideological tension of today’s world in light of recent Russian agression,” says Lebreht. “Through the eyes of the future Estonian president, the story explores how intellect, humor, and love can become acts of resistance against authoritarianism.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohnny\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExit Film\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Little Mary, Always the Virgin” (Anna Jadowska, Poland, France)Produced by Magdalena Sztorc, Mozaika Films, with France’s Thomas Lambert, Tomsa FilmsFrom internationally acclaimed Anna Jadowska, co-helmer of Netflix’s anthology pic “Erotica 2022” and the 2022 Tribeca winner “Woman on the Roof.” The film turns on Marysia (16) who tries to sell her virginity online. Producer Sztorc says “Little Mary” refers to the helmer’s earlier pic “Wild Roses, winner at the Stockholm Film Festival 2017.”It will create space for authentic conversation about female agency, desire, and the social constraints that young women navigate,” she says.\n\n\t“No Salvation Coming” (Vojtěch Strakatý, Czech Republic)Produced by Jan Čadek, Beginner’s MindA heist movie from Variety’s 2025 Czech talent to watch, recently selected at Karlovy Vary’s Proxima section for “The Other Side of Summer.” A group of four young adults, struggling to aﬀord rent and food despite their high qualifications and hard work, decide to rob a luxury house where one of them works as a cleaner. “Our film reimagines the heist genre as a socially charged, character-driven drama about a young generation struggling with rising living costs and unaffordable housing. It blends realism and genre style to explore how far ordinary people will go when even basic stability becomes out of reach,” says Čadek.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNo Salvation Coming\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“One Brother Too Many” (Tove Undheim, Norway)Produced by Ellen Ugelstad, Twentyone PicturesThe sophomore feature from Undheim after the live/animation “Twigson and the Sea Monster.” Based on the book “En bror for mye” by Linde Hagerup, nominated for Germany’s Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreiss.

It turns on an adopted girl who sets out on a whimsical yet emotional journey to save her biological parents. “The film aims to challenge stereotypes and foster empathy for both children and foster parents, says Rimkutė who underlines that writer Gabija Siurbytė and Jankauskas will “bring personal insight,” as both of them are adoptive parents.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Queen of England Stole My Parents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDansu Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Superheroine of the Wrong Side of Forty” (Dace Pūce, Latvia)Produced by Antra Gaile and Līga Gaisa, Air ProductionsThe fourth pic by Pūce whose breakthrough debut “The Pit” was Latvia’s candidate at the Academy Awards and won the top prize at the 2020 Lübeck Nordic Film Days. A dark comedy in which a disillusioned journalist in her fifties books a solo trip to Bucharest. When bitten by Dracula, she discovers that she can finally live on her own damn terms. “With its mix of absurd humour, emotional honesty, and social relevance, the film speaks to a vast audience ready for stories about transformation and visibility,” says Gaisa.\n\n\t“The King of the Air” (Laura Ferrés, Spain, France)Produced by Nadine Rothschild and Inés Massa, Materia Cinema, Marina Perales and Xavier Rocher, La Fabrica Nocturna CinémaSophomore pic by Ferrés after her Valladolid winner “The Permanent Picture” and multi-awarded Cannes-selected short “The Disinherited.” Co-written by the director with Chema García Ibarra (“The Sacred Spirit”).

An absurdist drama in which A young woman starts to question what she knows about her family, her foster sister and the nice people living under their garden well. “The Well” will make us dive into a surreal world while keeping us on a tight emotional grip around the themes of family, belonging and growing up. The story tickles the sweet spot between funny and sad, which I believe will translate into an enjoyable and touching film,” says producer Jauri.\n\t\n\n\t“Vanishing Point” (Tudor Giurgiu, Romania)Produced by Bogdan Craciun, Point FilmThe final instalment in a film trilogy about the relationship between the individual and freedom by high-profile Romanian film mogul and director Giurgiu.

Anna’s lies have kept her family apart. Now, with little time left, she spins one final deception, hiding her illness as she leads her teenagers to Spain, where the truth about their long-lost parent could either shatter them forever or bring them together at last. “We were captivated by Kamil Krawczycki’s vision to create heartfelt cinema that talks about meaningful topics, going beyond the traditional concept of drama,” says Lava Films’ Weronika Oleszek. “Framing the story as a road movie helps lighten its weightier subject matter.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWe’re Leaving\n\t\n\n\n",

Dispatch audio captured responders referring to a \"person down\" at her address. She later died at 79.\n      \n      \n          \n          ",

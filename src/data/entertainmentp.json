    "body": "\n\tThe “Heated Rivalry” takeover continues. Connor Storrie, who portrays Ilya Rozanov on the Crave/HBO Max hit, will make his late-night television debut on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” on Monday, January 12.\n\n\tThe news comes one day after it was announced that his costar, Hudson Williams, will make his late-night TV debut on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Wednesday, January 7.\n\n\n\tSince the series debuted in November, it has become a smash hit for both Bell Media’s Crave in Canada and HBO Max, who acquired the series right before it was released.\n\t\n\n\tAn adaptation of the “Game Changers” novels, “Heated Rivalry” tells the love story between Ilya and Shane Hollander (Williams), two closeted hockey players who get into a secret romantic relationship; over the course of the six episodes, the relationship grows from purely physical to deeply romantic. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHudson Williams, Connor Storrie, Dylan Walsh and Christina Chang in “Heated Rivalry” finale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsabrina lantos\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the finale, the duo finally gets to spend two weeks together and exchange “I love yous.” Their relationship is also revealed to Shane’s parents and Ilya stays by his side as he comes out.\n\n\t“That was the element of the story that I was most excited to get to because it’s really cool the way that [creator] Jacob Tierney wrote it,” Storrie recently told Variety about the finale at the cottage. “There’s this kind of cool crescendo where it was so fast and rapid — the editing, the writing – with so much energy upfront, and then it kind of lands and we’re just two people in a house for a few days.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “As an actor, that’s where a lot of the cool acting moments are, where we really get to sit in some of those scenes for a long, long time. It’s kind of the episode where there’s officially a catharsis. People don’t realize, because of all the intimate scenes, but this story really is about people falling in love at a distance. To finally see that come together, there’s a catharsis.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Housemaid” star Sydney Sweeney and director Paul Feig did something bad, and it felt so good that Lionsgate is going to let them do it again.\n\n\tThanks to the box office success of the psychological thriller — “The Housemaid” has grossed $133 million in its first two-and-a-half weeks of release — the studio has greenlit a sequel movie, titled “The Housemaid’s Secret.” The project, based on the second novel in Freida McFadden’s best-selling trilogy, has been in development for the past few months, and Lionsgate is planning a production start for later this year. \n\t\n\n\tIn “The Housemaid,” Sweeney starred as Millie, a young woman trying to escape her past, who is recruited to work as a live-in housemaid for the wealthy Nina (Amanda Seyfried) and Andrew Winchester (Brandon Skelnar), who have dangerous secrets of their own. Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” track, “I Did Something Bad,” features in the end credits as the movie teases Millie’s next steps. Michele Morrone and Elizabeth Perkins also star in the R-rated film, which has earned an impressive $75.7 million in North America and $133 million worldwide against a $35 million budget.\n\n\n\t“It’s clear from both the global box office and from the outpouring on social media that audiences have responded strongly — and audibly — to the totally unique and truly theatrical experience of The Housemaid and want to know what happens next,” Adam Fogelson, Lionsgate’s motion picture group chair, said in a statement announcing the greenlight.\n\n\t“We believed in these stories from the very beginning, and we are beyond excited to bring the next chapter of Millie’s story to life on-screen in collaboration with our outstanding creative partners Todd, Paul, Laura, Carly, Alex, and Sydney,” Fogelson continued. “‘The Housemaid’s Secret’ is another wildly thrilling book in Freida’s series that has captivated readers worldwide, and we look forward to translating it into a similarly rousing and riotous moviegoing experience.”\n\t\n\n\tScreenwriter Rebecca Sonnenshine will return to adapt the sequel for producers Hidden Pictures’ Todd Lieberman and Pretty Dangerous Pictures’ Feig and Laura Fischer. Sweeney and McFadden return as executive producers alongside Hidden Pictures’ Carly Elter and Alex Young.\n\n\t“It’s been thrilling to see audiences around the world fall in love with ‘The Housemaid’ and the incredible work of our talented cast and crew,” stated Feig. “We’re lucky that Freida McFadden has already extended Millie’s journey on the page, and that we get to work with Rebecca Sonnenshine and Lionsgate to bring this next story to audiences.”\n\n\tAdded Lieberman: “We’re thrilled with the reception and incredibly proud of this entire team from Freida McFadden to our partners at Lionsgate, and the outstanding work of Paul and Laura. Most rewarding has been seeing how strongly audiences are connecting with the film.”\n\n\tAt the Palm Springs International Film Festival, Seyfried confirmed that a sequel was all but guaranteed. \n\n\t“No one’s said anything about No. 2, but I guarantee there will be No. 2,” Seyfried told Variety’s Marc Malkin on Saturday. “And I almost guarantee that I’m gonna be some small cameo in it, because it’s about Syd and her working for a new family. And there’s so much that happens, especially with Michele’s character Enzo,” she explained. “I really wanna see how she keeps Nina Winchester in her pocket, because I will jump the fuck back into that.”\n\n\n\tThe sequel will be overseen by Lionsgate’s Chelsea Kujawa, who also oversaw the first film and brought the project into the studio, alongside Maria Ascanio. Robert Melnik negotiated the deals for the studio.\n\n\t“The Housemaid” book series has sold over 12 million units, with the second book accounting for four million of those. Translated into 40 languages, the first book has been a New York Times bestseller for 65 weeks and won the 2023 Goodreads Choice Award for best thriller.\n\n\tSonnenshine is represented by UTA, Circle Management + Production, Jill Fritzo PR and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox. McFadden is represented by Christina Hogrebe of Jane Rotrosen Agency; Angela Cheng Caplan of Cheng Caplan Company; and Allison Binder of Goodman Genow Schenkman Smelkinson + Christopher.\n",

    "description": "\n\tThere’s a lot of talk about narrative and messaging in Season 4 of HBO’s “Industry.” “In America, your story begins when you start telling it,” proc",
    "body": "\n\tThere’s a lot of talk about narrative and messaging in Season 4 of HBO’s “Industry.” “In America, your story begins when you start telling it,” proclaims one aspiring titan of finance. “Listeners tune in to the belief of the teller,” a nervous CEO is told mid-pep talk. “We don’t need proof,” a trader says of their most audacious play yet, “because we finally have a good story to tell.” \n\n\tWithin “Industry,” such statements are used to interrogate the line between masters of the universe who bend fate to their will and outright frauds. Antiheroine Harper Stern (Myha’la) is arguably the latter, having parlayed a fake college transcript into a position atop her very own fund. But Harper may have met her match, or at least a mirror, in Whitney Halberstram (Max Minghella), another American who’s attempting to reinvent themselves in London’s money market. Whitney is the co-founder and CFO of Tender, a payment processor known for supporting gray-market industries like gambling and pornography that’s trying to evolve into a legitimate bank. Harper is running a shorts-only operation, betting against companies she sees as overvalued and (hopefully) making money in the process. When Harper sets her sights on Tender, she ignites a war that gives the season its heart-pounding momentum.\n\t\n\n\tZoom out, however, and you can see why “Industry” creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay are so concerned with external perception. At the end of Season 3, the former Oxford classmates — whose brief stints in banking inspired the show — effectively burned their initial setup to the ground. “Industry” began with a quartet of new graduates, including Harper and pampered publishing heiress Yasmin Kara-Hanani (Marisa Abela), getting hired as grunt-work analysts at the fictional Pierpoint & Co. Slowly and then all at once, this shared setting started to fracture. Harper got fired for the aforementioned deception. Ensemble members like David Jonsson and Harry Lawtey left to pursue other opportunities, and thus their characters did as well. Yasmin exited finance altogether, embracing her destiny as the socialite bride-to-be of blue-blooded aristocrat Henry Muck (Kit Harington). And to cap it all off, Pierpoint itself collapsed after an ill-advised pivot into so-called ethical investing. The trading floor that saw so much of the series’s action is no longer in operation.\n\t\n\n\tDown and Kay could’ve called it right there, leaving “Industry” a tight, compressed yarn about the compromises of early adulthood. Instead, they opted to forge ahead, in part because Season 3 was the first to be a bona fide hit rather than a cult favorite of critics like myself. The downfall of Pierpoint has afforded the pair, who direct half of the new season in addition to showrunning, that most exciting and terrifying of prospects: a blank slate. The resulting vacuum creates the potential for wildly divergent paths in the meta arc of the show. One is that “Industry” rises from the ashes to become bigger and more ambitious than ever, joining the upper tier of HBO’s roster. The other is that, without its distinct angle and grounding ballast, “Industry” tips over into grandiosity, never quite establishing a sound basis for moving past such a natural endpoint.\n\n\tOver eight episodes, Season 4 hews much closer to the latter end of this spectrum than the former. The transition is not, nor would it likely ever be, seamless; about once an episode, especially the early ones, there’s a moment that made me worry “Industry” had jumped the shark into pure provocation. But as the Tender plot — which Down and Kay have said was inspired by “Michael Clayton,” an influence that grows increasingly more apparent — gets going, the season tightens and accelerates. And “Industry” continues to drill down on Harper and Yasmin’s relationship, a dynamic Season 3 identified as the heart of the show by elevating Abela to effective co-lead. She and Myha’la are better than ever in Season 4 as both their characters start to understand their seeming happy endings didn’t afford them as much freedom as they thought.\n\n\tIt’s true that the loss of a bottom-up perspective makes “Industry” less distinct on the page from analogs like “Succession” or “Billions.” In fact, “Industry” positively revels in its characters’ newfound status; the premiere sees a comfortably retired Eric Tao (Ken Leung) share a golf course with a distant, red-capped figure we’re meant to understand is Donald J. Trump, while Harper goes to visit her benefactor Otto Mostyn (Roger Barclay) in Parliament, where he’s recently joined the House of Lords. Once upwardly mobile strivers, these people are now firmly ensconced in the halls of power — an ideal opportunity for them to reenact the abuses they used to suffer from above.\n\t\n\n\tThat’s the real difference-maker: The audience didn’t meet Harper and Yasmin at the top. We know exactly what it’s taken and all they’ve endured to get where they are, from the strong implication that Yasmin’s father sexually abused her to Harper’s estrangement from her mother and twin brother. So when Harper realizes Otto’s backing comes with more strings than he’d led her to believe, or Yasmin has to do the heavy lifting when Henry’s loss of a safe parliamentary seat sends him into a tailspin of depression, we feel their disappointments as acutely as their triumphs. They’re the bridge that takes “Industry” from Pierpoint into its wider, if not necessarily brighter, future.\n\n\tThis transition nonetheless necessitates an infusion of new blood, especially from outside the world of finance. At Tender, Whitney clashes with his more hedonistic co-founder Jonah (Kal Penn) and bosses around his assistant Haley (Kiernan Shipka). Harper is tipped off to Tender’s shady dealings by reporter Jim Dycker (Charlie Heaton), widening a foothold in the world of journalism previously established by Henry’s tabloid baron uncle Alexander (Andrew Havill). Henry’s election defeat reflects the real-life Labour wave of 2024, introducing fresh faces like business minister Lisa (Chloe Pirrie) and MP Jenny (Amy James-Kelly) for Tender to lobby as it navigates regulatory hurdles. What was once a show about business is now a cross-section of the overlapping institutions that make up the status quo, and how much disruptors like Harper and Whitney can — or can’t — change them.\n\n\tAlumni of shows like “Mad Men,” “Stranger Things” and “Dept. Q” are a sign of “Industry’s” increased sway, though none ever threaten to steal the show from Harper and Yasmin’s electric, resentment-laden frenmity. (Yasmin may no longer have anything as tawdry as “a job,” but her new role as a behind-the-scenes connector of the rich and influential keeps her in Harper’s orbit.) But for those who stick around, a standout can work their way into the show’s core with surprising speed. It can be hard to remember Sweetpea Golightly (Miriam Petche), the Pierpoint intern who paid her way through university with OnlyFans nudes, was introduced only last season. Now doing research for Harper, whose adamant defense of Sweetpea’s erstwhile gig reveals a soft side to the ruthless Machiavellian, she’s by far the easiest ensemble member to root for. Though with this crowd, that’s not a high bar.\n\t\n\n\tThe widening scope makes it more difficult for “Industry” to maintain a consistent baseline. Often, Down and Kay play this to their advantage; a West African interlude quite literally takes the show to new places, while a spotlight on Yasmin’s domestic disappointment swaps Nathan Micay’s electronic score for “Barry Lyndon”-like strings. At other times, the sex and drugs that have been part of the “Industry” DNA from the start begin to feel more discordant. The show continues to up the ante of everyone’s after-hours activities, even as they mature and have more to lose. Keeping everyone together, or even on the same continent, requires some mild contortions: a move to New York Harper floated in the Season 3 finale clearly did not come to pass, while a diminished Rishi (Sagar Radia) continues to hang around even after his life has completely collapsed.\n\n\tBut stepping back to consider the sheer difficulty of what “Industry” is attempting puts these growing pains in perspective. Season 3 was the culmination of several years of pent-up tension. Season 4 is building something, if not entirely new, then without much of the scaffolding that once gave “Industry” a consistent structure. It’s an effort so commendable in principle and enjoyable in practice that a little leeway is the least “Industry” can ask. And by moving this far beyond Pierpoint, the show has proven it can, and should, keep going further still.\n\n\t“Industry” Season 4 will premiere on HBO and HBO Max on Jan. 11 at 9 p.m. ET, with remaining episodes airing weekly on Sundays.\n",

    "body": "\n\tUniversal Music Group has appointed James Steven as its executive vice president and chief communications officer, effective January 26, the company announced on Tuesday. According to the announcement, Steven will be responsible for leading the company’s internal and external communications, and oversee the communications functions of UMG’s operating companies worldwide. He will be based in New York and report to UMG’s chief administrative officer, Will Tanous.\n\t\n\n\tSteven joins from Warner Music Group, where he served as chief communications officer since 2015. A U.K. native, Steven worked with PR and marketing agencies before joining Warner in 2007 as part of the company’s international communications team based in London. He relocated to New York five years later and was promoted to senior VP upon Tanous’ departure from that company in 2013, and was promoted to EVP and chief communications officer two years later. Over the past decade he helped guide WMG through a transformative period, including the 2020 IPO and a CEO transition in 2022.\n\n\tTanous said: “I know first-hand the extraordinary skill and dedication James brings to strategic communications and storytelling.  His love of music and his broad experience across media and technology makes him an ideal fit for UMG as we enter the next phase of growth, driven by strategic initiatives that will unlock new opportunities for artists, songwriters, and fans alike.”\n\n\n\tUMG chairman-CEO Lucian Grainge said: “We welcome James to UMG and look forward to his contributions. Given Will’s broadened role, it was important that we brought in a communications executive with experience and perspective – one who was able to step right in to help us continue to shape the future of music.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA haunting tale of a ragamuffin teen who puts wealth before love, the Oscar shortlisted “The Girl Who Cried Pearls” also weighs in as the latest animated short from both the National Film Board of Canada and writer-directors Chris Lavis and Maciek Szczerbowski which bids fair for an Academy Award nomination this month. \n\n\t‘The Girl Who Cried Pearls’ is already one of five titles which scored an nomination for the 53rd Annie Awards in their best short subject category, announced Monday, one of only three shorts to score this double recognition.   \n\t\n\n\tAn Oscar nomination would be Lavis and Szczerbowski’s second after the notable “Madame Tutli-Putli” (2007) and the National Film Board’s 39th for an animated short. The NFB ranks as the third most-nominated entity in that category after Disney and MGM, as NFB chairperson Suzanne Guèvremont noted to Variety just before 2025’s Annecy Animation Festival.    \n\n\n\tPacking emotional force but also a fable about be-careful-what you-wish-for greed, “”The Girl Who Cried Pearls” is both an ode to the craftsmanship of stop-motion puppetry and a groundbreaking blend of tactile puppetry with digital innovation, reaffirming Lavis and Szczerbowski ’s status as pioneers in contemporary animation, Variety has observed.\n\n\t“The Girl Who Cried Pearls” begins in Paris with the camera creeping up on a white marble mansion in a leafy street with a view of the Eiffel Tower – the epitome of bourgeois success. The granddaughter of its owner, a crickety old man, discovers a pearl in an red apple-shaped holder. “Of all the treasures in the entire room, you’ve guessed what’s most precious to me. It would seem someone has discovered my secret,” her grandfather confesses, quite willingly. \n\t\n\n\tPushed by his granddaughter to say what the secret is, he tells his tale of when he was a homeless street-kid in Montreal at the turn of the 20th century who spies on a young girl whose tears transform into iridescent small pearls. He falls in love with her, he says, but also secures two pearls which he sells to a pawnbroker – and sets out to make the girl cry more, breaking her heart.\n\n\tThroughout their career, Lavis and Szczerbowski have drunk deep at the well of surrealism, the artistic movement inspiring many of the 20th century’s achievements which set out to decry the rationality and sense of propriety of middle-classes, priming the workings of the unconscious, chance and a lack of creative control. \n\n\t“Madame Tutli-Putli,” the film 2008 Academy Awards contender which brought Lavis and Szczerbowski to notice, plays out, for instance, like the fever dream of a 1920s bourgeois flapper dreamt many decades later. The narrative imagines her younger self without a home and then on a train where logic is replaced by chance as she confronts her deepest fears: sex, robbery, helplessness, the death of others (the train has a morgue-like dining car) and the inevitability of extinction (she pictures a moth drawn to the light at the film’s finale). Or that at least could be one interpretation. \n\n\tA highly useful article on the Canada National Film Board’s blog quotes Lavis and Szczerbowski about how their animation on “The Girl Who Cried Pearls” was shaped by happy accident. One case in point: the original maquette of the decrepit house where the young boy shelters from winter cold was left outside the studio to dry. But an unexpected rain squall hit and by the time Lavis and Szczerbowski returned, the prop was warped out of shape. \n\n\t“It looked so much better that way, so we incorporated the warps into the final model,” they say. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tModel for the house in ‘The Girl Who Cried Pearls’ Credit: National Film Board of Canada\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThat is reminiscent of an anecdote about how the great surrealist Luis Buñuel was sitting in Madrid bar Chicote drinking dry martinis trying to work out how he could cast Angela Molina as the supposed femme fatale of “The Obscure Object of Desire” when he already had Carole Bouquet under contract. Buñuel realized that the film would work much better if they were both cast in the same role.  \n\t\n\n\t“The Girl Who Cried Pearls” frames a tale within tale of the film, part set maybe 70 years later whose final stretches cannot be described without revealing multiple spoilers. Safe to say, however, that they add multiple levels of storytelling richness and reenforce the film’s social prescience in ages past and present of unfettered greed. \n\n\tThe 17-minute short is also animation art of the highest order, seen in the extraordinary bric-a-brac detail of a pawnshop, lending it an immersive authenticity. The puppets’ heads in the past are silicon moulds multi-layered by oil painting to look like aged wood. The film uses both claymation and plastic 3D printing and sets scrubbed with paint spread on garbage bags to make them look grimily weathered. \n\n\tVariety talked to Lavis and Maciek Szczerbowski about “The Girl Who Cried Pearls” which, produced by the National Film  Board, was one of five shorts to open the 2025 Annecy Festival. \n\n\tIt also won the Short Cuts Award for best Canadian short film at the Toronto Festival and the Canadian Film Institute Award for best Canadian Animation at the Ottawa International Animation Festival, the second most important animation festival in the world.\n\n\tIn a conversation with your composer Patrick Watson and artistic director Brigitte Henry about making “The Girl Who Cried Pearls” you say, Maciek, that “without the right story, there is no value” in anything else.  The grandfather says much the same towards the end of the film. I suspect here, as indeed in the film at large, that one key was the long time you spent making it, which maybe allowed you to evolve everything, including the story, more than is traditional in animation.\n\n\tMaciek Szczerbowski: This was our first story completely dependent on story. We joked that we usually make experimental films and the experiment this time was doing something traditional. For the most part, we’ve been exploring the worlds of dream logic and Dadaist accidents that create story in a kind of symbolistic way which we try to curate and control. Here the trick was to tell a very specific, concise story. If you don’t understand the two or three crucial moments, it probably means nothing. The result was almost like telling a joke— Proper timing. Good delivery.\n\t\n\n\tCould you give an early example of a crucial moment?\n\n\tSzczerbowski: Just a simple line which almost gets lost that the boy says about how he spent his days at Montreal’s old port, how he stole from boxes that had fallen off ships. \n\n\tChris Lavis: You’re absolutely right about how the story evolved as we worked on it. That’s a crucial element to the process. We had animated and edited the film and watched a first version and it didn’t work. It wasn’t virtuosic on any scale. It was stuttering. It had no proper structure. It was confusing. Two things happened. Our composer, Patrick Watson, made a suggestion that he needed the film to spend more time in the past, without cutting back to the present, for him to build the music properly.  \n\n\tAnd the second? \n\n\tLavis: It didn’t feel like the grandfather was telling a story. Characters were just speaking dialogue in the grandfather’s voice. What we did – maybe the oldest trick of filmmakers after that first hellish edit—was we went back to the first  impulse: The original treatment we gave to the National Film Board of Canada. We had written that like a short story. Those little narrative bridges missing from the grandfather’s dialogue were there in the original treatment. When we weaved them back into the film, it was like Eureka! Suddenly, the movie had structure and shape.\n\n\tWhich connects to the grandfather’s comment that “It’s always the story that gives something the value” and it’s the story of a girl whose tears become pearls is what strikes spectators most from the film….\n\n\tLavis: The story has two pillars. One, we were really interested in this idea of the grandfather, being extremely rich and wealthy and powerful, at the end of his life, discovering his granddaughter stealing something from his office and telling her his darkest secret. The second pillar is the idea that storytelling itself creates belief and value. \n\n\tSzczerbowski: In so many ways it’s a commentary on what people like us or writers do. You’re making value out of nothing by inventing a narrative, by building a mythology around an object that could otherwise have become utterly worthless, and turning it into something that could end up in a museum or be priceless.\n\n\tStorytelling dates back to the dawn of humankind. “The Girl Who Cried Pearls” could indeed be said to be in some ways traditionalist and in others, highly innovative, as Variety noted of your work in general. Making the film was often about using the new or making the new look old….. \n\t\n\n\tSzczerbowski: We wanted the story to feel like it was found in a box from 50 years ago. That’s the whole point of that process of aging and using garbage bags and paint. Oil paint is to remove the author from the process in a way. Especially when you’re creating a fable, you don’t want it to feel like a couple of guys were sitting around inventing a fable. It should feel like it came from the collective unconscious.\n\n\tA highly useful article on the National Film Board blog quotes you about how your animation was shaped by happy accident. One case in point: how you incorporated the rain-drenched warped version of your original maquette into the final model.  \n\n\tLavis: We call chance an invisible collaborator.\n\n\tSzczerbowski: This is part of our education, I guess. At some point, we were reading an article about Frank Gehry, the architect. He would build a maquette for a building he was designing and when it hit a particular level of of satisfaction where he knew he could have actually stopped, he would throw it out the window, and take the elevator down to the sidewalk collect all the pieces and re-glue it, knowing that it would never actually fit perfectly ever again, that there would be an element of chaos and accident. What John Cage calls indeterminacy. Something beautiful happens. You have to have had some experience in removing your own ego from your work in order to even play with these things. \n\n\tLavis: You get sick of your own decisions, too. That’s what makes it interesting.\n\n\tSzczerbowski: And you’re looking forward to surprise. The whole point of us working in in collaboration is to look forward to these moments when this kind of indeterminacy happens, either because of a thunderstorm or the other person’s intervention. Usually what you get at the end is something that is really different than what you thought it would look like. For some that might be a failure, but to us it’s always a boon.\n",

TMZ has confirmed.\n      \n    \n          Law enforcement sources tell us ... Reiner no longer has to wear a suicide prevention smock -- which mainly prevents inmates from hanging themselves -- inside the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Downtown L.A.

Nick has been charged with 2 counts of murder for allegedly fatally stabbing Rob and Michele inside their Brentwood home on December 14, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Prosecutors say Nick potentially faces the death penalty because they filed a \"special circumstance allegation of multiple murders,\" which also includes a \"special allegation\" involving the knife he's alleged to have used.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Michele Reiner\n              \n                          \n                Nick Reiner\n              \n                          \n                Rob Reiner\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

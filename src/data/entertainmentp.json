    "body": "\n\t“Saturday Night Live” lightly took on ICE during “Weekend Update,” hours after a 37-year-old Minneapolis intensive care nurse was killed by Border Patrol agents.\n\n\t“Vice President J.D. Vance criticized protesters confronting ICE Officers, saying they should instead write an op-ed or argue about it on social media. You know, just like these young scholars did on January 6th,” Michael Che said during the January 24 episode, motioning to a photo of the attack at the Capitol in 2021.\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “I get that ICE agents are people, allegedly, and they have a job to do. But at some point while you’re pepper-spraying old ladies or shooting at a nurse, do you ever stop to ask yourself, ‘Are we dicks?'”\n\n\n\tThe cold open on “SNL” was directed at Donald Trump with a spoof on awards shows, featuring Michael Myers returning as Elon Musk, who joked, “After what all my little freaks and psychos in ICE have been doing, I need more distractions.”\n\n\tEarlier in the day on Saturday, Natalie Portman spoke out against ICE at Variety‘s Sundance Studio, wearing “ICE Out” and “Be Good” pins, the latter referencing Renée Good, a woman who was killed by ICE earlier this month.\n\n\t“We’re also at a moment in our country’s history that is quite devastating,” Portman said. “It’s really impossible not to talk about what is happening right now and the brutality of ICE and how it has to stop immediately. But also, there’s a beautiful community that Americans are showing right now. They’re showing up for each other, protecting each other and fighting for their freedom. It’s a bittersweet moment to celebrate something we’re so proud of on the backdrop of our nation in pain.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tWhen you go into a movie knowing that it’s about two couples who get together for a dinner party, there are certain expectations about what’s going ",
    "body": "\n\tWhen you go into a movie knowing that it’s about two couples who get together for a dinner party, there are certain expectations about what’s going to happen that are just about wired into our moviegoing DNA. You expect that the dialogue, for a while, is going to be light, funny, brittle, caustic. You expect that as the evening wears on, the masks of civility will come off, revealing something more painful and maybe brutal under the surface. You expect that there might be serious flirtation (between the people who aren’t partners), and that the whole thing will wind up structured as a kind of truth game. And you expect that by the end, there will be wreckage…but maybe, in that destruction, a kind of healing.    \n\t\n\n\t“The Invite,” directed by Olivia Wilde (“Don’t Worry Darling”) from a script by Will McCormack and Rashida Jones, starring Wilde and Seth Rogen as a grousing, long-married San Francisco couple who have their upstairs neighbors over to dinner, is a movie that lives up to every one of those expectations. Yet it does so in a way that’s so original, so brimming with surprise, so fresh and up-to-the-minute in its perceptions of how relationships work (or don’t), that you watch it in a state of rapt immersion and delight.\n\n\n\tPart of what’s novel about the movie is its tone, which is bitterly funny yet sneakily serious. It’s as if we’re watching “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” remade by the Woody Allen of “Husbands and Wives.” The Allen connection is there, most prominently, in the characterization of Joe (Rogen), a former indie-rock musician who is now an associate professor at a music conservatory near Berkeley (he’s haunted by the fact that it’s not nearly as good), and Angela (Wilde), who graduated from art school but never followed it up, except for the loving eye with which she has furnished and renovated their apartment. She’s a high-strung bundle of nerve endings, while Joe is a wisecracking curmudgeon in the tradition of Allen and Larry David, though he’s so down on everything that his jokes emit a hint of toxic despair.\n\t\n\n\tThe two have a 12-year-old daughter, who’s away at a sleepover, and they live in a spacious, cozy apartment that Joe inherited from his parents, which makes him feel like a failure. So does the fact that after one album with a small hit, his indie-rock dreams fizzled. As soon as Joe arrives home, and Angela informs him that the neighbors are coming over that night, the two begin to bicker (about whether she told him this already, about Joe scarfing a pickle off her appetizer plate, about the rug she just bought, about the fold-up bicycle that hurts his back and that he can’t seem to fold up, about the fact that he didn’t buy a bottle of wine). It doesn’t take us long to see that these two will fight about anything under the sun, no matter how small, because that’s now their way of connecting.\n\n\tYet for all the controlled rancor on display, what draws us into “The Invite” is the remarkable flow of the dialogue, the characters often talking over each other in a lifelike way, with just enough witty one-upmanship to make even domestic anger, presented as authentically as it is here, a pleasure to behold. It’s the sound of two people who don’t like each anymore, but it’s also the sound of a communication that’s so spiked with downbeat emotion it plays like jazz. (The film opens with an image collage scored to a jazzy version of “Isn’t It Romantic?,” and yes, the use of that song is ironic in the extreme.)\n\n\tThen the other couple comes over. Pína (Penélope Cruz) and Hawk (Edward Norton) are everything Joe and Angela are not: mellow, glamorous, harmonious. She’s a psychotherapist and sexologist, he’s a retired fire fighter (though he acts more like a West Coast guru), and we know that they enjoy a robust sex life, because it has already been the subject of a major disagreement: They make so much “animal” noise at night that Joe wants to complain to them about it, whereas Angela, a compulsive people-pleaser, is horrified at the prospect that bringing that up could interfere with another woman’s orgasms. (At least that’s her rationale; you also get the feeling that she’s simply too timid to want to raise the issue.)\n\n\tAs soon as these two show up, Joe starts baiting Hawk, because that’s just his way, and we start to pick up on the subtlety with which these four are going to interlock. Joe has no filter, but Hawk says that’s what he likes about him. (He sounds sarcastic, until we realize he means it.) Pína, who is from Spain, keeps the conversation earnest (if not quite honest), while Angela is an ebullient nervous wreck whose instinct is to cover everything up.\n\t\n\n\tI can’t discuss what happens in “The Invite” without giving a little bit away, so here goes. The issue of that overly noisy sex is something Pína and Hawk bring up all by themselves, which defuses the tension over it for about a minute. But then they reveal why their sex is so noisy: They’re what used to be called swingers, only these two now present themselves as “enlightened” New Age addicts of group sex. The dialogue that emerges out of this is almost shocking in its casually explicit hilarity, because McCormack and Jones, in a brilliant act of screenwriting, have imagined this couple’s erotic encounters in a nearly cinematic fashion, as expressions of their character. The movie asks us to laugh at sexual folly and adventure without reducing it to a joke. And that’s before Pína and Hawk make the movie’s real invite: Do Joe and Angela want to join them in a foursome?\n\n\tThat sounds like the premise of a certain kind of Sundance movie — let’s call it kinky-cute. But “The Invite” is blessedly not that movie. Wilde, as a director, shoots it with an astonishing feeling of lived-in experience. The apartment where the entire film takes place looks real, with a history; it’s lit just right. And Joe and Angela’s reaction to their neighbors’ invitation isn’t reduced to one thing. Their response unfolds like a flower. It’s about horniness and loneliness and possibility, about the reasons they might actually want to have an orgy, and about how the movie is going to take this situation and run with it, neither playing it safe nor making it too easy.\n\n\tAll four of the actors are amazing. Rogen, while rooted in his vintage persona of crusty rationality, has never explored it this deeply. Wilde, who’s a spectacular actor, imbues Angela with so many frazzled shades of desire and unhappiness and dreams she’s still clinging to that her performance is like a blur that gradually comes into beautiful focus. Norton gets us giggling at Hawk’s Zen cowboy certitude, until we hear his own backstory, in a monologue you listen to in a spellbound hush. And Cruz, whose Pína is the catalyst of all this, projects an erotic life force that comes with its own gamesmanship. It’s Pína who says, in essence, that some relationships need to die so they can come to life again as something else. “The Invite” is marvelously entertaining, but part of the reason for that is that I think a lot of people are going to see themselves mirrored in this movie, which for all its sharp-tongued bravura is humane enough to play a truth game that rings true.\n",

    "body": "\n\tArtists create not because they’ve been given permission to do so, but simply because they must. This certainty illuminates filmmaking duo Hossein Keshavarz and Maryam Ataei’s Tehran-set drama “The Friend’s House Is Here,” a sophisticated and heroic celebration both of Iran’s brave communities of underground artists who boldly express themselves despite their autocratic government’s attempts to muzzle them, and of the country’s resilient women who recently led the pivotal “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement.\n\t\n\n\tShot entirely (and perilously) in secret, much like the recent, genre-defying work of Jafar Panahi (including the Oscar-nominated “It Was Just An Accident”), and completed in the aftermath of the June War, “The Friend’s House Is Here” was reportedly smuggled out of the country once the ongoing protests, with thousands of confirmed deaths, erupted. In that regard, Keshavarz and Ataei’s spirited effort feels like a modern-day heir to virtuosos like Panahi, as well as Abbas Kiarostami, whose 1987 masterpiece “Where is the Friend’s House?” is proudly honored by this film’s title. Like the essence of the masters it channels, “The Friend’s House Is Here” is defined not by the many constraints that it battled during its production, but by the artistic vision of the resulting work.\n\n\n\tMore importantly, the film is energized by a gentle and joyous quality throughout, with Keshavarz and Ataei refusing to succumb to a doom-and-gloom disposition in following their protagonists: Pari (Mahshad Bahraminejad) and Hanna (Hana Mana), two rebellious artists and best friends in contemporary Tehran. Like Bahraminejad, Pari is an underground theater artist of inventive performance pieces that challenge the status quo. It’s not exactly legal to perform works of art without governmental permission, but like the resourceful artists who stood against tyranny throughout history, Pari does so anyway, and always with an engaged audience. \n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile Hanna, like Mana, is an improvisational dancer with a popular Instagram account where she courageously posts her dance routines (again, deemed illegal by the government) in front of recognizable historical landmarks. Like many women in Iran these days (as we see in the background across Tehran), Pari and Hanna stroll the streets unveiled, and present themselves with idiosyncratic fashion choices, including hats and T-shirts adorned with Rumi’s poetry. Through a patient, observational aesthetic, the directors immerse us in the pair’s friendship, organically capturing the enviable ease and trust between these two women.\n\n\tOn that note, “The Friend’s House Is Here” is also a film about life-defining friendships, along with the healing properties of sisterhood. Not only do Hanna and Pari depend on each other as friends, roommates, and allies, but they are also sustained by a supportive ecosystem of fellow artists and theater troop members, the closest being Hanna’s best friend Ali (Farzad Karen).\n\n\tWith cinematographer Ali Ehsani’s meticulously choreographed but unfussy long takes and Arian Saleh’s understated score, we breathe in the kind of jubilant, unflappable atmosphere that perhaps only chosen families can conjure. This blissful mood is felt everywhere, from the ensemble’s good-humored bickering over the city’s rooftops, singing and dancing sessions at home, and dinner parties where hearty servings of tahdig are cheered on.\n\n\tThe movie never loses this upbeat air, though it turns quieter when we find ourselves in one of Pari’s performance art sessions. (For a while, thanks to clever camerawork, we can’t even tell that we’re inside a theatrical construction.) The short play is evidently about Hanna, whose relaxed attitude has at times clashed with Pari’s relative strictness. She is wondering about the whereabouts of her friend, who, in reality, is preparing for a life-changing trip abroad to advance her art. Has she been kidnapped by the government after posting one of her viral dance videos? Has anyone seen her? The feelings we sit with in the immediate aftermath of Pari’s performance are so powerful that we don’t suspect the intentions of the man who approaches her with compliments. But his praise quickly takes an aggressive turn, before we start to grasp his true identity. Soon after, the realization sinks in that the play has just ingeniously foreshadowed some imminent dark developments in the women’s lives. \n\n\tIt wouldn’t be fair to spoil further details of this narrative shift, but rest assured that Keshavarz and Ataei maintain their positive tone — they’re determined not to compromise on their defiant ambitions. But that hardly makes “The Friend’s House Is Here” a toothless fantasy. At every turn and with every dignified conversation between concerned people who are just trying to exist in peace — one between Pari’s mother and the selfless Hanna is especially heart-swelling — the directors acknowledge the stakes involved, and the high price that artists pay to claim their freedom and humanity against the odds. Their film feels like a compassionate gift, given in gratitude to all artists who refuse to be silenced.\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tThis week’s “Saturday Night Live” featured a surprise cameo from series alum Mike Myers, who returned to the long-running NBC sketch comedy show to once again spoof Elon Musk. \n\n\tThe cold open took place during The Trumps, an award show meant to honor “the best in being or succumbing to President Donald Trump.” Trump (James Austin Johnson) invited his “close ex-friend” Musk to the stage to accept the “lifetime achievement award for comedy, even though he might not always intend it.” \n\t\n\n\tMusk then took the stage, vacilating between hyperactive and completely stoic, telling the crowd “I feel so emotionless to be here.” \n\n\n\t“If anyone knows humor, it’s me,” he continued. “No tariffs on humor!” \n\n\tEarlier in the sketch, Trump told the crowd, “It truly is an honor to be here hosting The Turmps. After that lady, whose name I already forget, gave me her Nobel Prize, I thought ‘I need more awards!’ And after what all my little freaks and psychos in ICE have been doing, I need more distractions.” \n\n\tTrump then accepted the award for the best picture of himself from Vice President J.D. Vance (Jeremy Culhane), whom Trump naturally insulted every chance he got. Vance returned later as a nominee alongside Kristi Noem (Ashley Padilla) as nominees for best kiss, both getting nommed for kissing “Trump’s ass.” Even though they were up against Trump (for kissing “Putin’s ass”), Noem ended up winning, but Trump still managed to snag the award from her. \n\n\tWatch the full cold open below. \n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOlivia Wilde just landed a massive hit in the snow. \n\n\tThe director and co-star of “The Invite,” a couples dramedy that plays out over one night in a San Francisco apartment, unveiled the film on Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival. A packed house filled with industry heavyweights at the Eccles in Park City, Utah swooned for the project that also features Seth Rogen, Penelope Cruz and Edward Norton. \n\n\n\t“This was the dream, to premiere right here for you guys,” Wilde told the crowd, tossing in a final thank you to Sundance founder Robert Redford, who died last year at age 89. The subsequent 107-minute run followed a hapless, resentful couple (Wilde and Rogen) hosting their free-spirited new neighbors (Cruz and Norton). The ensuing madness — passive aggressive standoffs, food allergies, a swingers reveal, rug fetishes, tequila shots, and the concept of pegging — scored big laughs and poignant appreciation for relatable scenes from a marriage. \n\t\n\n\tAfter the credits rolled, Wilde returned to stage and received a standing ovation. She wiped away tears and asked the audience to sit down to bring out Rogen, Norton, her DP and crafts team and script co-writer Will McCormack. \n\n\tDuring the closing Q&A, Wilde was asked by Sundance programming head Kim Yutani how she walked a line of broad humor and raw emotion. \n\n\t“I heard a wise person say, you’re never as vulnerable as when you’re laughing. And I think that the great thing about this group is it allowed us to take people on that journey, to let them laugh, let them relax, and then just gut punch them,” she said. \n\t\n\n\tNorton praised Wilde for her third directorial outing, following “Booksmart” and “Don’t Worry Darling.” \n\n\t“Seth and I are both who have directed films that we’ve been acting in as well. Inevitably, you you come to moments where you say, ‘This was a terrible decision.’ It’s hard for me to overstate the grace and wisdom with which Olivia gave that performance and directed us.” \n\n\t“The Invite” is on the ground seeking distribution. \n",

    "body": "\n\tYou can exhale now: Alex Honnold successfully made it to the top of Taipei 101, in a live special on Netflix. “Sick!” he exclaimed at the top of the tower, after climbing the tower in one hour and 35 minutes. “I’m so psyched!” And then he took a selfie.\n\n\tThe “Skyscraper Live” climb, which started a bit after 8 p.m. ET (9 a.m. Sunday morning Taipei time) appeared to be mostly a piece of cake for Honnold, with a few hiccups: Mostly, he appeared to lose audio contact with his team at a few points — and most importantly, lost his in-ear music soundtrack. (Luckily, he eventually got it back.)\n\t\n\n\tAnd then, at one point near the end, Honnold admitted, “You know what, I am kind of tired.” Later, he also noted how windy it was toward the top. \n\n\n\tThe thousands of Taipei residents watching on the ground, and the hundreds more inside the Taipei 101 — taking selfies and waving — cheered and gasped as Honnold made it through each step of the 1,667-feet skyscraper that is the 11th tallest building in the world.\n\n\tThis was a different kind of climb for Honnold, who normally does his feats — including the one that made him famous scaling Yosemite’s El Capitan for the Oscar-winning doc “Free Solo” — in solitude. Honnold’s wife Sanni McCandless was on hand too, and she revealed that she generally isn’t in attendance for his climbs either. At the end of the climb, McCandless was waiting for Honnold, and the two shared a long embrace.\n\n\tVariety spoke to Honnold about an hour after his climb, from the 88th floor of the Taipei 101. And given that he had just made history by finishing the highest free solo climb of an urban structure in history, he was in good spirits. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about the climb. An hour, 31 minutes, is that around what you were expecting? Were you a little faster, or right on schedule to what you’re thinking?\t\n\n\tI kind of thought it’d be like between 1:25 and two hours or 2:15 even. I didn’t really have a good sense of it. And then once I started, I had no way to keep track of timing or pace or anything. So it was perfect. I felt like I was going slowly, and it was all pretty casual.\n\t\n\t\tYou hit the mark perfectly for this show to end at the two-hour point.\t\n\n\tI didn’t even know! When I when I was standing on the top, I was kind of like, “Am I slow? Am I fast? Should I stay here forever?” I was just having a great time.\n\t\n\t\tThat king of the world shot on top and that selfie, which we need to get a copy of.\t\n\n\tI just got one on my phone. I was gonna send it.\n\t\n\t\tWe need to share it with our Variety readers! Was that always the plan at the top? Had you rehearsed what you wanted to do when you got to the very top?\t\n\n\tI definitely didn’t rehearse anything. Production had said, “would you take a selfie or anything?” I was like, “yeah, if I was by myself, I would get to the top, and definitely I would take pictures.” I would probably take some panoramas at the landscape so I could show my family. If I was totally alone and there was no came around, for sure I would take pictures when you get to a position like that. It was not unrealistic to snap a few photos when you’re on the top of this incredible spire.\n\t\n\t\tIt was only toward the end that we started to hear your concerns with the wind and also being a little tired. At that point, what were the conditions like? Was that the hairiest things got?\t\n\n\tI wouldn’t necessarily say hairiest, but the wind definitely got stronger the higher I went. Which is not surprising. That’s the way the building’s been all the time. The top of the building rips wind and then, just by coincidence, the wind direction happened to be hammering the corner that I was climbing. Other aspects of the building would have been more sheltered. I don’t know if you can see, there were a few places where I would hug around to the left a little bit, because it basically was sheltering me from the wind a tiny bit more. But then when I climbed the corner itself, I would just be getting hammered. I was like, “ah!” And then the same when stepping onto the dragons. When I was on the left face of the dragon, I would be sheltered from the wind. But if I reached my hand around the dragon, it would basically be like, “Wow, it’s so windy!” I definitely noticed the wind. And then, yeah, I was getting tired a little by the top. I wasn’t concerned that “Oh, I’m so tired. I’m gonna fall off.” But I was like, “OK, I’m feeling it!”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWas there any moment where you had any real concern?\t\n\n\tThe challenge is not getting complacent up the bamboo boxes, because it’s 64 of the same sequence over and over. And each one you’ve got to make sure you don’t slip. You want to pay attention and execute each one well.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s climbing those dragons elicited the most gasps from the crowd.\t\n\n\tThe dragons, they’re also probably the scariest thing to actually do. I mean, they’re really fun, they’re really cool. It’s an incredible sequence, cool position. But every time I set up on the dragon, I’d be like, “this is kind of crazy.” You’re like, out over the abyss. It’s cool.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAlex Honnold\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix © 2026\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEspecially because you didn’t have to do the dragons, right? Could you have climbed around the dragons?\t\n\n\tYou can wedge yourself in behind the dragon and squirm up the back of it. But that’s actually not as easy as it seems like it would be. Because the inside of the dragon is actually like a smooth sheet of metal. So, yeah, you can climb it, but it looks very undignified. It’s full body strenuous, and it’s not that much easier. And so, actually, the dragon is kind of the better way. If you’re climbing with a rope, you for sure always do the dragon, because it’s more fun, it’s joyous. It’s just slightly scarier, because the position is so exposed.\n\t\n\t\tDefinitely got the most reaction, although once you were on top you told Sanni that you kind of missed the dragons once you were done with the dragons. You seemed to be getting into it by the end.\t\n\n\tDefinitely after the last dragon, I was kind of like, “oh, this is probably the last time in my life that I’ll ever climb a dragon.” What an experience.\n\t\n\t\tI mentioned the crowd gasping and cheering. Is that super distracting? That’s something that you don’t usually deal with when you’re doing your climbs.\t\n\n\tNo, I think it was actually kind of motivating or enlivening. This is probably true for all athletes, in mainstream sports when people play and the crowds are roaring. As a climber, you never experience that. So I was like, no wonder when people are playing in the Super Bowl, it must be super motivating. It was my first taste of something like that.\n\t\n\t\tIt sounds like it worked to your benefit.\t\n\n\tI think so. And actually, over the last several days, my perspective started to shift a little. From like, “this feels kind of intense” and I’m nervous or whatever, to actually feeling pretty excited for it and feeling motivated. I felt like there was a perspective shift of embracing the whole spectacle side of it. I was like, if I just wave at all the people on the inside and have a good time as I’m going by, it makes the whole thing more fun. One of the main challenges of the climb is the pacing. If you have to go really fast, you get tired, but if you take your time and you wave to people and you enjoy the experience and enjoy the views, you don’t get as tired. It makes the whole thing feel less scary. And so I was kind of like, “I’m just gonna embrace the experience and just have a good time, and it’ll make it all feel better.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIt’s got to be surreal too, to be climbing and seeing people in the observation decks waving at you. It kind of concerned me that they might be distracting you.\t\n\n\tThat’s funny, I definitely waved at a lot of people. And I would look at people. But there were a bunch of folks who were trying to get me to make little heart symbols and things. It’s really popular here in some of the photos. And I was like, no, I draw the line at making hand signals. Like, I am still holding on!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSanni McCandless Honnold and Alex Honnold\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix © 2026\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAnother thing that’s really unique with this is that you got to see Sanni halfway up. And wave at her. That must have been so different. Was that distracting?\t\n\n\tNo, it’s not distracting. Because also, I passed camera people 10 or 12 times. I don’t know if it was used in the broadcast or not, but I was talking to the camera people every time I go by. I’d be like, “Mikey, good to see you! Hey, Pablo!” And then each camera guy would have an assistant camera person, plus a safety person to help shuttle them around the building. All those teams are friends of mine. And so every time I’m passing balconies and things, I’m like, “Oh, my friends!” So it’s not distracting. If anything, it’s part of the fun. We’re all up here having this incredible experience on the side of a building. It’s so cool.\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned a few times that you were losing some communication, and your music at some point wasn’t showing up, but then it came back. Was any of that a problem?\t\n\n\tI was totally unstressed about all that stuff. There were times I couldn’t hear anyone. It doesn’t bother me in terms of climbing, because obviously I can just climb in my own little bubble. I was only worried about it in terms of the broadcast. I have no idea what the timing is, if I’m supposed to be doing something, if someone’s telling me to go faster or slower. I was like, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, but I’ll just climb. It was fine. It’s to be expected with communications. It’s kind of magical that it even did work at all. There are a bunch of spots on the building that are basically dead zones, probably because they have their own transmitters and things. Cell service dies in a bunch of places in the building. So for me to have pretty good communication the whole way up this giant thing in the middle of the city, I was like, it’s pretty good.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat about the music? What were you listening to today?\t\n\n\tIt was mostly Tool. It’s just like a random playlist that I made, that I shared with production. I made it months ago while I was driving. I’ve been training to it a bunch. Basically rock music that I’ve liked my whole life. Part of the appeal of music is that actually it helps me with pacing. Each bamboo box had been taking me about five to six and a half minutes. I just know how long the songs are. So it gives you it gives you a sense of if you’re going fast or slow. But in this case, it all kept cutting out anyway, and I couldn’t really hear and I was kind of like, “whatever. I’m just doing my thing.”\n\t\n\t\tHow many times did you scale Taipei 101 with the ropes? And what did you learn as you were getting to know the building?\t\n\n\tI came here for a scout in September, and that’s when we shot some of the promotional stuff. On the scout, I climbed it from bottom to the top with the rope once, just to make sure that it was possible. Because I was kind of like, “before we all commit to this TV project, I better make sure that it’s possible.” Then on this trip, I did it from bottom to top once again. And then I did various sections here and there, depending on conditions. One day it was raining, and I did a couple boxes — but basically determined that I couldn’t climb it at all in the rain. I don’t wanna say impossible, but it was basically impossible. It was so slippery. Not surprising, it’s metal and glass, and in the rain it was so slick. Before I’d come here, I was kind of like, if it rains, maybe it’s still possible, just a little harder. And then I tried it with a rope in the rain, it was like, no, that’s completely impossible. But that was good to know, because then yesterday, when it was raining, it was no, full stop.\n\t\n\t\tThat was good to know yesterday. It looks like it didn’t rain a ton, right, but it still rained enough.\t\n\n\tIt doesn’t need to rain that much [for it to be a problem]. Also, the top of the building is almost like a microclimate, because it’s 1700 feet above town. There’s misty, low clouds, but it means that the whole top of the building is in a cloud just getting hammered. High winds and high clouds, and so it’s all foggy and wet.\n\t\n\t\tWas it frustrating yesterday in making that call not to do it?\t\n\n\tClimbing is always at the mercy of nature. Everything about climbing, you’re always at the whim of of conditions. Is it too hot? Is it too cold? Is it windy, is it rainy? My whole climbing life is always dictated by the weather, by nature. And so yesterday didn’t feel that different. The only reason that it was at all stressful is because it’s supposed to be a live broadcast. The idea of pushing this a day, I was like, “man,  I don’t know how many crew people are here, but they’re a lot, and all their flights need to change today, and all their hotels change.” That sounded like so much work for some poor person who’s managing all this. And because so many of the people doing the work are friends of mine, I’m was sort of like, “oh God, that seems terrible!” You prefer that it all go according to plan, just so that nobody has all this extra work. But I wasn’t too stressed. I did a good little gym session, trained a bit, and then went for a long hike with my wife. What a nice day.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI think that was a concern that people had was that you would still go ahead with a climb, even if it wasn’t quite right, because you didn’t want everyone involved with the live event to be inconvenienced.\t\n\n\tNo, no. Everybody on the production side was like, “obviously, it’s always up to you to make the call.” I’m never going to climb something that I don’t want to or that I can’t.\n\t\n\t\t‘Free Solo’ really changed your life. How have you embraced this world where you are such a public figure, and now this is just going to add another layer of the mystique of Alex Honnold?\t\n\n\tI’ve basically structured my whole life around trying to find a way to be able to rock climb for a living. I love rock climbing. How do I get to live my life doing that as much as possible, while still supporting my family? Miraculously, it’s working. I’m able to climb full time, and I’m able to support my family. That’s freaking perfect. I can’t ask for more. This whole project is part of that. I get to climb something that I’m proud of that’s this inspiring. I couldn’t ask for better.\n\t\n\t\tHave you gotten the need to climb a skyscraper out of your blood now? Comparing this to your traditional rock climbing, this was so different.\t\n\n\tI think I would continue to climb any skyscraper I get permission for. The experience is insane. I feel like I’ve learned so much about Taipei. The views are amazing. Most of the time when I go to mega cities around the world, if they have some kind of mega skyscraper, I’ll pay the money to go up to the observation deck and take in the view. I like heights, and I like seeing everything. I think anytime I’m given permission to climb on the outside, if it’s possible, and if it seems reasonable, I would definitely do that. But it’s very rare to get permission.\n\t\n\t\tMost skyscrapers, I assume, don’t have the kind of crevices and things that you can climb. This one seemed perfect for a climb.\t\n\n\tYeah, this one is so perfect for climbing. There are some buildings that are almost too easy for climbing. Like, ones that have a window washing track on the outside, where you’re just hand over handing on some track the whole way. You can climb it, but it’s not a challenge. The thing about Taipei 101 is it’s perfectly in the sweet spot for me, where it’s possible, and it’s not too insanely hard. But it is definitely challenging enough that that it’s very engaging.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAnd skyscrapers have different challenges, like your shoes and your hands get extra dirty because of the grease.\t\n\n\tBut that’s all fine. When you’re climbing on real rock, you also often clean your shoes off, or you get mud on your hands, you’re climbing through bushes. There are plenty of crazy things climbing on rock that are also challenging conditions. The fun of climbing skyscrapers is learning about new sets of challenges\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned you’re heading home and you immediately have another climb that you’re ready to do. But is there a new white whale, something in particular that’s the next goal?\t\n\n\tNo, nothing big. I have a bunch of small goals, training goals, things that I’m excited about. But I don’t have any big expeditions planned this year. Basically, a bunch of family time, and then a bunch of personal training goals.\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s that next climb that you’re going to do back home?\t\n\n\tIt’s in a sport cave, this overhanging little wall where I’ve been going to train for once, twice a week for the last two and a half months to get pumped. I’ve been trying to do one that’s hard for me and I wasn’t able to do it before I left. So now I’ll try to do when I go home.\n\t\n\t\tLet me ask you real quick about Netflix. First off, are they giving you Netflix free for life?\t\n\n\tI don’t know, I haven’t asked, but I’ll ask!\n\t\n\t\tAlso, with a live special, how different is that for you? Does that change how you attack a climb?\t\n\n\tThis was my first live thing I’ve ever done. I think it’s in many ways a better experience than shooting a documentary. Because I do the climb and then I’m done. Normally, you do the climb and then you spend the next week up on the wall, shooting close ups, shooting tights, shooting different angles, shooting different conditions. That’s a lot of work. Doing a live event, you just do the climb, be done, go home.\n\t\n\t\tYou mentioned the most family friendly climb you’ve done, because it was so quick. And it was in a city. Normally, you’re living in a tent somewhere.\t\n\n\tYeah, it’s so chill. People were like, “how could you do that? It’s so crazy!” And I’m kind of like, I don’t think you understand how extreme it is to go to eastern Greenland and put up big walls in remote places and drag a sled across glaciers for weeks. Normally when you’re doing extreme rock climbing, in extreme places, it’s pretty full on. It’s funny, with this project, so many people were like, “but what about the wind? What about the weather?” And I’m kind of like, when you go to eastern Greenland to go rock climbing, it’s pretty extreme. Windy in a city, it’s just not the same as windy in the big mountains.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow long have you been in Taipei? How long of a trip is this?\t\n\n\tI’ve been here a week. I came early because I wanted to make sure that I would adapt to jet lag. I wanted to feel really good. I will say it’s all basically gone perfectly according to the plan. I woke up this morning, felt great, ate my normal breakfast, climbed a building.\n\t\n\t\tAnd you still have an afternoon in Taipei to just chill.\t\n\n\tExactly, I’m chilling.\n\n\n\tGiven the complexity of climbing a major skyscraper without any ropes or safety nets, Netflix and producers Plimsoll Prods. Ltd. worked closely with Honnold and risk management firm Secret Compass to plan out a meticulous set of safety protocols. “Skyscraper Live” was originally scheduled to take place the previous day (Saturday morning in Taipei, Friday night in the U.S.), but weather conditions forced Honnold and the production team to postpone by a day.\n\n\t“Every scenario has been mapped out, as you might expect,” Plimsoll CEO Grant Mansfield told Variety in a story published earlier this week. “The main focus has been on keeping Alex safe. This is a building he knows very well. It’s a building which is very well suited for climbing. If at any point he decides that he’s too tired when he’s on the building, we can get him off there as well. But Alex really knows what he’s doing. He’s an extraordinary kind of athlete.”\n\n\tIn that same story, Netflix unscripted series VP Jeff Gaspin said Netflix did have a contingency plan in place for a worst-case scenario. “It’s obviously a conversation that everybody has,” Gaspin said. “You can imagine what we’ll do. It’s nothing momentous. We’ll cut away. We have a 10-second delay. Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen. But we will cut away, and it’s as simple as that.”\n\n\tHonnold spent a great deal of time in recent months preparing for the Taipei 101 climb, including practice climbs of the tower. The Taipei 101 climb started with Honnold crefully making his way up the tower’s slab base. From there, he got on the building’s middle section, designed like eight-story “bamboo boxes,” which required steep climbing over these overhanging sections. On the corner of those boxes are dragon figures, which Honnold mounted to get to the next level. The top part of Taipei 101 had overhanging sections where Honnold’s legs were dangling, and he used his upper body strength to scale up. He climbed a swinging ladder (moving due to heavy winds) to the very top, featuring a small, four-foot platform where he was truly the highest man in all of Taiwan.\n\n\tElle Duncan hosted the special, with commentary and contributions from the WWE’s Seth Rollins, YouTube star Mark Rober and climbers Pete Woods and Emily Harrington. Al Berman is showrunner and executive producer of “Skyscraper Live,” while Honnold, Grant Mansfield, James Smith, Alan Eyres and Jonathan Retseck are also EPs. Joe DeMaio is director.\n\t\n\n\tWatch below as Honnold makes his way to the very top of Taipei 101:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOlivia Wilde is at the Sundance Film Festival with two movies, but like most everyone else this weekend, she’s concerned with the devastating news that Alex Pretti, a 37-year old nurse, was killed by ICE in Minnesota Saturday morning. \n\n\tOn the red carpet for the Seth Rogen comedy she directed, “The Invite,” Wilde had some emotional words about what’s happening in the country right now. “We’re all here getting to celebrate something really beautiful and hopeful in film storytelling,” she said. “But the world is hurting right now, and this country is hurting. And it’s appalling.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m appalled and sickened,” Wilde continued on the carpet. “We can’t go another day just sort of accepting this as our new norm. It’s outrageous. People are being murdered. And, I don’t want to normalize seeing people being murdered on the internet. On film. It’s. It’s hideous. And so if we can do anything out here to support the movement to cast ICE out, to delegitimize this unbelievably criminal organization, then that’s what we should be doing.”\n\n\tWilde, who is also at the festival to promote her appearance in Gregg Araki’s “I Want Your Sex,” said it was inspiring to see so many people protesting the government’s deployment of ICE.\n\n\t“I think so many Americans are [speaking out]. I mean, you see the marches happening around the country. Americans are speaking up in huge numbers, and it’s dangerous to be a protester now and people are still going out to the streets, which is incredibly inspiring.”\n\n\tEarlier on Saturday, Natalie Portman wore pins saying “ICE Out” and “Be Good” while talking about her film “The Gallerist” at the Variety Studio. “This is such a joyful community celebrating film here and we’re so excited to be showing ‘The Gallerist,’ but we’re also at a moment in our country’s history that is quite devastating,” Portman said. “It’s really impossible not to talk about what is happening right now and the brutality of ICE and how it has to stop immediately. But also, there’s a beautiful community that Americans are showing right now. They’re showing up for each other, protecting each other and fighting for their freedom. It’s a bittersweet moment to celebrate something we’re so proud of on the backdrop of our nation in pain.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs the competition continues to heat up on Season 4 of “The Traitors,” Peacock has released a statement urging passionate fans of the show to cool off. \n\n\t“We are committed to making our casts feel safe, respected, and supported – on screen and off,” reads the statement, which was posted to the “Traitors” Instagram account Saturday. “The cast of ‘The Traitors’ are real people, and what happens in the game should never lead to cyberbullying or harassment. There’s a difference between discussing a show and targeting individuals.”\n\t\n\n\t“Let’s not ruin the passion for this show with unwarranted negativity and personal attacks,” the statement continued. “We appreciate your support!” \n\n\n\tThe statement comes as online discourse around the season’s cast — specifically “Bachelor” alum Colton Underwood — has reached a fever pitch. But this isn’t the first time Peacock has had to remind viewers to be mindful of their words. The streamer released a similar statement last summer on the “Love Island USA” X account, urging viewers to remember the “amazing group of Islanders” are “real people – so let’s be kind and spread the love!” \n\n\tOn “The Traitors,” reality stars from a range of franchises are chosen to be Faithfuls or Traitors. To win, Faithfuls must successfully vote out the secret Traitors, whose goal is to claim the $250,000 prize for themselves. This season, Lisa Rinna (“Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum), Rob Rausch (“Love Island USA”) and Candiace Dillard Bassett (“Real Housewives of Potomac” alum) are the three chosen Traitors. \n\t\n\n\tSo far, all of them are still in the competition, along with Faithfuls including Underwood, Dorinda Medley, Eric Nam, Johnny Weir, Kristen Kish, Mark Ballas, Maura Higgens, Natalie Anderson, Stephen Colletti, Tara Lipinski and Yam Yam Arocho.\n",

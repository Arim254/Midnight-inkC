    "body": "\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\tDec 31, 2025 10:00am PT\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tVariety’s 2026 Media Predictions: ‘The Odyssey’ Domination, Disney CEO Shuffle and Netflix Winning Warner Bros. Deal\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShannon McCarthy \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tFrom megamergers to disruptive new technologies, the media industry has a lot to pack into the next 12 months. Artificial intelligence continues to reshape the way movies, shows and music is made, roiling a business that is worried it will lead to more job cuts. Bob Iger is finally ready to move on from Disney (he pinkie-promises this time), setting up a succession battle for the ages. And Netflix and Paramount are locked in an epic fight over Warner Bros., a clash of titans — and egos — that shows no sign of abating. All of this is taking place as the box office is in a rut, cable is in free fall and the overall economy is teetering. So yeah, fun times! \n\t\n\n\tWe can’t say for certain what 2026 has in store, but we’re going out on a limb and channeling Nostradamus with predictions about the drama to come. \n\n\n\t“The Odyssey” Will Be the Year’s Biggest Hit\n\n\tThe name on everybody’s lips is gonna be Odysseus. Some of the biggest franchises in Hollywood history are returning to screens with sequels and spinoffs to “Star Wars,” “The Avengers,” “Toy Story,” “Super Mario Bros.” and “Dune.” But the film that will reign above them all is based on a piece of IP that’s been in the public domain for millennia. Christopher Nolan’s adaptation of Homer’s “The Odyssey” will dominate popcorn season: Who but Nolan could put Imax tickets on sale an entire year in advance and have fans snap them up in record time? And if he could turn the creation of the atomic bomb into a blockbuster, having people show up for an epic survival story that dates to the sixth century B.C. should be a piece of cake. \n\t\n\n\tNetflix Will Win the Warner Bros. Deal\n\n\tThe year is ending on a major M&A cliffhanger: Will Netflix or David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance score Warner Bros. Discovery? It sure looks like Netflix’s to lose, having swayed the WBD board with strong financials, its status as the No. 1 subscription streamer and co-CEO Ted Sarandos’ promise to keep the studio putting films in theaters. But there’s some regulatory uncertainty about the tie-up, and Trump remains a wild card. Meanwhile, Ellison and ultra-wealthy dad Larry Ellison aren’t going away without a fight. But to prevail in the hostile takeover move, the Ellisons need to get 90% of WBD shares voted for their all-in offer. It’s hard to see that happening unless Paramount and its backers are willing to go higher than the $30-a-share proposal on the table.\n\n\tThe Next Leader of the Magic Kingdom Is …\n\n\tBob Iger (finally!) is exiting stage left with his Mickey Mouse gold watch at the end of 2026. Who will get the call? Wall Street expects the shortlisted candidates to be Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, and Josh D’Amaro, head of the conglomerate’s parks and experiences division. Walden has the entertainment bona fides; D’Amaro is a respected leader at the company. It’s possible the board opts for a co-CEO arrangement, but that doesn’t feel like the Disney way. The board could also throw a curveball — and hire someone from the outside. But the directors are surely doing their fullest due diligence, given how things turned out last time. Let’s give the edge to D’Amaro. \n\n\tCan Hollywood Get Its Arms Around AI?\n\n\tIn the Wild West of artificial intelligence, entertainment companies are trying to swing both sticks and carrots. Disney, Universal and Warner Bros., for example, have sued two AI startups alleged to have ripped off their intellectual property. And Disney is trying to control its own AI destiny by going into business with OpenAI. Ultimately, Disney is betting eventual technical and legal guardrails will let it participate in the gold rush — and not be sideswiped by the slop. Expect the rest of the industry to explore similar strategies.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the music industry faces its own struggles with AI. For a few months, it seemed as though the biz was on the same page in viewing generative AI as a looming threat to human creativity and compensation. In July 2024, Sony, Universal and Warner teamed with the Recording Academy for two copyright infringement cases against AI music services Suno and Udio. But as AI music has gone from fringe to foreground — Xania Monet, for instance, became the first AI act to debut on a Billboard radio chart in November — the majors have instead struck deals; by the end of 2025, Warner had partnered with Suno. The big three forged licensing deals with AI music startup Klay, and joined forces with Spotify to address issues with AI usage. The concern from artist and songwriter communities is valid — almost all of the deals were announced in amorphous terms. Proof of concept is likely to come in 2026, when the products resulting from these partnerships are expected to launch.\n\t\n\n\t Big Questions for the Small Screen\n\n\tIn 2026 all eyes will be on what two powerful ex-Netflix execs do at their new homes: Paramount Skydance streaming chief Cindy Holland’s ultimate vision for Paramount+ should come into view. And new Amazon MGM Studios head of global TV Peter Friedlander will put his stamp on that company. Meanwhile, as Versant kicks off as a stand-alone company, keep an eye on what its networks might do in live TV and program acquisitions. In broadcast, the future of CBS News under Bari Weiss will be a top concern. In late night, what happens on CBS after “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” ends its run (our prediction: The Eye network expands its 11 p.m. local news to an hour) will soon be known. In development, a hot topic will be the microdrama business — and how it might be adapted to TV. And the unscripted world is focused on runaway productions as more series find it cheaper to ship contestants overseas. Then there’s the looming specter of Hollywood strikes with the guild contracts expiring.\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tOn a windy winter morning in New York, Ryan Seacrest and Rita Ora pose for photos in front of the freshly revealed New Year’s Eve Ball.\n\tThe decorated ball, perched 25 stories high atop One Times Square, is the largest to date (fitted with 5,280 Waterford crystals and LED pucks). As photographers, journalists and publicists huddle around them in scarves and beanies, the hosts power through photo ops and interviews, sustaining the same charisma and smiles that families have grown accustomed to watching at the end of every year. \n\t\n\t“Any chance we can take this interview inside?” Seacrest quipped to Variety. “What’s great is families don’t have to leave the house for all the excitement. That’s what we do. For hours.”\n\n\tSeacrest and Ora may bundle up even warmer than usual. This year’s show (as the upgraded ball already indicated) is bigger than ever. “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2026” has been expanded by 90 minutes, marking the longest telecast in the show’s 54-year history. And for the first time, there’s a live Central Time Zone countdown from Chicago, co-hosted by Chance the Rapper, and parties across New York, Las Vegas, Chicago, Puerto Rico and L.A.Over 42 performers are set for the night, spanning more than 90 songs — a lineup that collectively boasts 925 million monthly Spotify listeners and 102 billion streams across their catalogs. Diana Ross will headline from Times Square, with additional performances from Post Malone, Chappell Roan, Ciara, LE SSERAFIM, Little Big Town, Maren Morris, and more. West Coast performers include Mariah Carey, Demi Lovato, OneRepublic, 50 Cent, Charlie Puth, and Huntr/x from “KPop Demon Hunters.”“You just know everyone’s going to be tuning in this year,” Ora said. It’s the British singer’s third year hosting the holiday event. For Seacrest, it’s his 21st.\n\tThis year hits differently for Seacrest. His father, Gary, died in October after a long battle with prostate cancer. “This was a tough year. I lost my best friend,” he says, noting that time with family has reshaped what this night means to him. “People want to feel good. You can watch this show and you can feel alright for a few hours. And then you can set the scene for a big start in the new year.”\n\t\n\tOra, with a fourth studio record and tour on the horizon, is approaching 2026 with intention. “It’s about getting in tune with my creativity,” she says. “Where I want to take it next year. I’ve been so inspired by the music coming out. I just want to see where that leads.” But she’s not ready to tease the music just yet. She kindly (but firmly) shut down the opportunity to tease what the sound of her new album will be like. Seacrest grins, “New album, let’s go!”“Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2026” airs live Wednesday, Dec. 31 at 8/7c on ABC, with next-day streaming on Hulu. Produced by Dick Clark Productions, NYRE remains the nation’s No. 1 New Year’s celebration, reaching an audience 2.5 times the size of its closest competition at 11:30, CBS’ “New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash.”",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Avengers: Doomsday” marketing campaign continued with a Thor-centric teaser that delighted many Marvel fans by standing in stark contrast to the divisively silly “Thor: Love and Thunder,” the 2022 tentpole that marked Chris Hemsworth‘s last outing as the God of Thunder. The teary-eyed Thor who appears in the “Doomsday” teaser praying before battle is miles away from the wise-cracking goofball Thor became in the MCU.\n\n\t“Father, all my life I’ve answered every call, to honor, duty, to war. Now fate has given me something I never sought. A child, a life untouched by the storm,” Thor says in the “Doomsday” theater in an ultra-serious tone. “Grant me the strength of the old fathers, so that I may fight once more, defeat one more enemy, and return home to her. Not as a warrior, but as warmth, to teach her not battle, but stillness, the kind I never knew. Please father heed my word.”\n\t\n\n\tGiving Thor his own brooding “Doomsday” teaser sends a clear message to Marvel fans that the superhero is changing tone for his return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While “Love and Thunder” earned a robust $760 million worldwide in summer 2022, it polarized fans by pushing Thor to the limit of silliness. Even Hemsworth criticized the movie, admitting in a 2023 GQ magazine profile that “Love and Thunder” was “too silly” for its own good.\n\n\t“I think we just had too much fun. It just became too silly,” Hemsworth said about the movie. “It’s always hard being in the center of it and having any real perspective…I love the process, it’s always a ride. But you just don’t know how people are going to respond.”\n\t\n\n\tHemsworth said his biggest critics were his son’s friends. “It’s a bunch of eight-year-olds critiquing my film. ‘We thought this one had too much humor, the action was cool but the VFX weren’t as good,’” he said. “I cringe and laugh equally at it.”\n\n\tThe actor doubled down a year later in Vanity Fair’s May 2024 issue, saying: “I got caught up in the improv and the wackiness, and I became a parody of myself. I didn’t stick the landing.”\n\n\tHemsworth added he grew frustrated with the character while playing him in four standalone Marvel films and additional “Avengers” movies, explaining: “Sometimes I felt like a security guard for the team. I would read everyone else’s lines, and go, ‘Oh, they got way cooler stuff. They’re having more fun. What’s my character doing?’ It was always about, ‘You’ve got the wig on. You’ve got the muscles. You’ve got the costume. Where’s the lighting?’ Yeah, I’m part of this big thing, but I’m probably pretty replaceable.”\n\n\tDespite the self-criticism, Hemsworth was always clear that he wanted to give Thor another shot and gives fans the God of Thunder they deserve after the misstep of “Love and Thunder.” He also told Entertainment Weekly in 2023 that his next Thor movie would need to be “unpredictable.” \n\n\t“I don’t want to continue to do it until people are so exhausted that they roll their eyes when they see me come on the screen as that character,” Hemsworth said “If an audience wants to see it, and if there’s something that we believe is exciting and fun, then great. I’ve loved being able to reinvent that character a few times. I don’t have the answer yet, but I would love to try and [figure out] how we can do that again and keep it a little unpredictable.”\n\n\t“Avengers: Doomsday” opens in theaters Dec. 18, 2026. Watch the Thor teaser in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

Thunderous spectacles unfurled alongside hushed, inward-facing character studies. Some films swung wildly and missed — gloriously so — while others landed with such quiet authority, they seemed to rearrange the room. It was a year defined by daring, by filmmakers who trusted audiences to lean in rather than sit back.\n\n\tStart with the consensus triumphs — films that felt instantly canonical.\n\n\tChloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” is a masterwork of grief rendered as poetry. Jessie Buckley delivers a performance of almost unbearable emotional clarity as a mother splintered by loss, yet somehow still breathing.\n\n\tRyan Coogler’s “Sinners” is something else entirely — muscular, ambitious and alive. It’s the work of a filmmaker proving, yet again, that his range knows no borders. Michael B. Jordan’s dual performances are feats of control and intensity. Breakout Miles Caton and the indelible Wunmi Mosaku provide the emotional ballast that keeps the film grounded even as it soars.\n\n\tStill, the pulse of my deepest excitement beats in Brazil, for the second straight year after Oscar winner “I’m Still Here.”\n\n\tKleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent” is a slow-burning thriller that tightens its grip almost imperceptibly. Wagner Moura is hypnotic, coiled with tension and weary intelligence, while Tânia Maria storms in with scene-stealing authority. Meanwhile, Tunisian auteur Kaouther Ben Hania’s “The Voice of Hind Rajab” is a gut punch — filmmaking that refuses comfort or distance. Saja Kalani, criminally overlooked, gives a raw performance of elemental power as an emergency call center volunteer in Gaza. And Oliver Laxe’s Spanish-language “Sirāt” is a fever dream that feels like the long-lost cousin of “Mad Max: Fury Road,” built for the biggest screen you can find.\n\n\tThen there are the films fighting for oxygen, the ones that slipped through the cracks or hovered just outside the safety of consensus.\n\n\tClint Bentley’s “Train Dreams” gives William H. Macy a late-career performance of startling grace, a meditation on American solitude etched into every line of his face. Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia” divided audiences with its trademark strangeness. Still, Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons are mesmerizing together, while Aidan Delbis announces himself as a talent of rare specificity and soul. Rian Johnson’s latest “Knives Out” whodunit, “Wake Up Dead Man,” offers Josh O’Connor another showcase for his chameleonic range, while James Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg” sees Russell Crowe delivering his most commanding work in two decades in a historical drama that feels uncomfortably contemporary. And the discovery of multi-hyphenate Eva Victor with the poignantly moving “Sorry, Baby” is a moment we’re taking for granted.\n\n\tIf I had an Oscar ballot, I’d use it to honor films that risked misunderstanding, performances that revealed something frightening or tender about being human and directors who believed audiences would meet them halfway. \n\n\tWe can’t forget about the best of TV.\n\n\tTelevision is considered here with the same rigor as the films championed, and not through the mechanics of Emmy categories, but through cultural impact and artistic achievement. This list prioritizes series and performances that defined the year’s conversation, measuring critical distinction alongside visibility, virality and sustained audience engagement. These selections reflect television experienced in real time: debated, dissected, memed and argued over. It’s an Oscar-style snapshot of TV in 2025, honoring the shows and singular achievements that didn’t just excel, but dominated the cultural imagination.\n\n\tAlways nice to include a disclaimer. If a movie isn’t present in any given category, it doesn’t mean “I hated it.” Making the top five in anything is difficult. Every ballot tells a story about what we value in art. This is mine.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Picture of the Year\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon)\n“The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa)\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features)\n“Sirāt” (Neon)\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n“Sorry, Baby” (A24)\n“Bugonia” (Focus Features)\n“It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)\n“Nuremberg” (Sony Pictures Classics)\n\n\n\n\tWinner: “The Secret Agent” — Kleber Mendonça Filho, Emilie Lesclaux, Wagner Moura, Brent Travers\n\n\tKleber Mendonça Filho’s slow-burning Brazilian thriller is a masterclass in atmospheric tension. Every frame feels loaded with moral ambiguity and political dread.

Her camera work is intimate without being invasive, and observational without being detached. She understands that bearing witness is an active choice, not a passive act, and “The Voice of Hind Rajab” becomes a document of both crisis and humanity. \n\n\tNotable mentions: Clint Bentley (“Train Dreams”); Mona Fastvold (“The Testament of Ann Lee”); Yorgos Lanthimos (“Bugonia”); Richard Linklater (“Nouvelle Vague”); Jafar Panahi (“It Was Just an Accident”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Actor in a Leading Role\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nOscar Isaac, “Frankenstein” (Netflix)\nDwayne Johnson, “The Smashing Machine” (A24)\nMichael B.

His work is largely internal with flickers of doubt, suppressed panic and dangerous calculations playing out behind tired eyes. This is acting rooted in the understanding that power isn’t loud; it’s the choice to stay silent when speaking out could cost everything. \n\n\tNotable mentions: Will Arnett (“Is This Thing On?”); Russell Crowe (“Nuremberg”); Paul Mescal (“Hamnet”); Sean Penn (“One Battle After Another”); Jesse Plemons (“Bugonia”); Tonatiuh (“Kiss of the Spider Woman”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Actress in a Leading Role\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nJessie Buckley, “Hamnet” (Focus Features)\nKate Hudson, “Song Sung Blue” (Focus Features)\nSaja Kalani, “The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa)\nRenate Reinsve, “Sentimental Value” (Neon)\nEva Victor, “Sorry, Baby” (A24)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: Jessie Buckley\n\n\tBuckley’s portrayal of Agnes, a mother undone by grief, is nearly unbearable and impossible to look away from. She inhabits sorrow and its physical weight, bending posture, fracturing speech and draining energy from the body. Buckley captures the brutal truth that grief isn’t singular but cyclical: rage, numbness, guilt and suddenly, a piercing clarity colliding without warning. In “Hamnet,” her performance has the potential to be considered an all-timer — one that we may look back on 50 years from now and wonder how she ever did it.\n\n\tNotable mentions: Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked: For Good”); Ariana Grande (“Wicked: For Good”); Elizabeth Olsen (“Eternity”); Amanda Seyfried (“The Testament of Ann Lee”); Emma Stone (“Bugonia”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nJames Belushi, “The Chronology of Water” (The Forge)\nMiles Caton, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\nAidan Delbis, “Bugonia” (Focus Features)\nBenicio Del Toro, “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros.)\nWilliam H. Macy, “Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: Miles Caton\n\n\tCaton arrives in “Sinners” and immediately claims space alongside Michael B. Jordan’s dual powerhouse performance without flinching. His work is grounded, specific and emotionally and musically transparent. Caton brings a naturalism that anchors the film’s more heightened elements, reminding us that even in genre storytelling, the smallest human gestures matter most. This is a breakout performance that doesn’t feel like one; it feels like watching an actor who’s been doing this forever.\n\n\tNotable mentions: Damson Idris, “F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.); Jacobi Jupe (“Hamnet”); Lewis Pullman (“The Testament of Ann Lee”); Alexander Skarsgård, “Pillion” (A24); Leo Woodall (“Nuremberg”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Actress in a Supporting Role\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nOdessa A’zion, “Marty Supreme” (A24)\nNaomi Ackie, “Sorry, Baby” (A24)\nMariam Afshari, “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon)\nKirsten Dunst, “Roofman” (Paramount Pictures)\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph, “Eternity” (A24)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: Odessa A’zion\n\n\tA’zion steals every scene she’s in with a turn that balances old Hollywood glamour with modern ferocity. She understands that supporting work isn’t about fading into the background — even if you are sharing the screen with Timothée Chalamet — it’s about knowing exactly when to step forward and take control of the entire room. A’zion plays intelligence as flirtation and ambition as survival, never letting the character become a type. Her work in “Marty Supreme” is electric, funny and surprisingly moving.\n\n\tNotable mentions: Emily Blunt (“The Smashing Machine”); Zoey Deutch (“Nouvelle Vague”); Regina Hall (“One Battle After Another”); Wunmi Mosaku (“Sinners”); Mari Yamamoto (“Rental Family”)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Original Screenplay\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Neon\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Dead Man’s Wire” (Row K Entertainment) — Austin Kolodney\n“Eternity” (A24) — Pat Cunnane and David Freyne\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — Kleber Mendonça Filho\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Ryan Coogler\n“Sorry, Baby” (A24) — Eva Victor\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “The Secret Agent”\n\n\tFilho’s script is a miracle of structure and restraint. He builds tension through conversation, paranoia through silence, and political commentary through character. “The Secret Agent” never stops to explain itself, trusting that audiences can navigate moral complexity without a map. The dialogue crackles with subtext and every exchange feels like a negotiation over life and death.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Black Bag” (Focus Features); “A House of Dynamite” (Netflix); “Is This Thing On?” (Searchlight Pictures); “It Was Just an Accident” (Neon); “The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Adapted Screenplay\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Agata Grzybowska\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Bugonia” (Focus Features) — Will Tracy\n“The Chronology of Water” (The Forge) — Kristen Stewart\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — Maggie O’Farrell and Chloé Zhao\n“The Life of Chuck” (Neon) — Mike Flanigan\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Hamnet”\n\n\tO’Farrell and Zhao adapt grief into something cinematic without diminishing its literary power. “Hamnet” never loses sight of what the story is actually about — a parent’s unbearable loss and a marriage tested by sorrow. The script makes space for silence, for the moments when language fails, and structures the narrative like memory itself.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Frankenstein” (Netflix); “Lilo & Stitch” (Walt Disney Pictures); “Nuremberg” (Sony Pictures Classics); “Superman” (DC Studios); “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” (Netflix)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCasting\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Colle\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nNicholas Campbell and Jessica Wolhuter, “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight” (Sony Pictures Classics)\nNina Gold, “Hamnet” (Focus Features)\nStéphane Batut, “Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix)\nRebecca Dealy, “The Plague” (IFC)\nFrancine Maisler, “Sinners” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Nouvelle Vague”\n\n\tBatut’s casting for “Nouvelle Vague” feels like discovering a secret. The ensemble operates as a true collective, each actor bringing specificity without overwhelming the whole. Batut understands that casting isn’t just about finding the “right” actor for each role; it’s about building a chemistry that makes the entire film feel alive. Especially when looking for the actors to play Jean-Luc Godard, Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Bugonia” (Focus Features); “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” (A24); “Lilo and Stitch” (Walt Disney Pictures); “The Secret Agent” (Neon); “Sirât” (Neon); “Weapons” (Warner Bros.)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Animated Feature\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: GKids\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Arco” (Neon)\n“In Your Dreams” (Netflix)\n“KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix)\n“Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” (GKids)\n“Zootopia 2” (Walt Disney Pictures)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain”\n\n\tThis animated gem finds wonder in the most minor details. “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” is quietly radical in its refusal to overexplain or condescend. The animation is painterly and patient, allowing moments to breathe and images to linger. It truly is one of the year’s most delightful movies.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “The Bad Guys 2” (DreamWorks Animation); “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” (Crunchyroll); “Elio” (Pixar); “Predator: Killer of Killers” (Hulu); \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Production Design\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Focus Features\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — Fiona Crombie and Alice Felton\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — Thales Junqueira\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Hannah Beachler and Monique Champagne\n“Superman” (DC Studios) — Beth Mickle and Rosemary Brandenburg\n“Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” (Netflix) — Rick Heinrichs, Kathryn Pyle and Raelyn Tepper\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Hamnet”\n\n\t“Hamnet” doesn’t merely recreate the Globe Theatre — it conjures a world where grief is present within walls. Every room feels lived-in, and every texture worn by hands and time. This is design work that understands its job isn’t decoration but is to tell a story, using space and objects to make the invisible visible. \n\n\tNotable mentions: “Bugonia” (Focus Features); “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” (Marvel Studios); “Frankenstein” (Netflix); “Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix); Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Cinematography\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“No Other Choice” (Neon) — Kim Woo-hyung\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — Evgenia Alexandrova\n“Sinners” (Warner Bros.) — Autumn Durald Arkapaw\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Adolpho Veloso\n“The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa) — Juan Sarmiento G.\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Train Dreams”\n\n\tVeloso shoots the American West like a fading memory. It’s beautiful, harsh and disappearing even as we watch. His work in “Train Dreams” is all long takes and patient observation, allowing landscapes to dwarf the human figure while never losing sight of the man within them. The cinematography knows that loneliness is a spatial relationship. Shatters the heart into pieces.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Black Bag” (Focus Features); “The Chronology of Water” (The Forge); “F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.); “Sentimental Value” (Neon); “Sirāt” (Neon)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Costume Design\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“Frankenstein” (Netflix) — Kate Hawley\n“Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix) — Pascaline Chavanne\n“Nuremberg” (Sony Pictures Classics) — Bartholomew Cariss\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Malgosia Turzanska\n“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures) — Paul Tazewell\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Wicked: For Good”\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is a riot of color, texture and character specificity. Every outfit tells a story about who these characters are becoming, how power shapes presentation, and how rebellion looks when it refuses to be drab. The costumes balance fantasy with truth, never letting spectacle overwhelm character.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Hamnet” (Focus Features); “Sinners” (Warner Bros.); “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” (20th Century Studios); “The Testament of Ann Lee” (Searchlight Pictures); “The Ugly Stepsister” (IFC)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Film Editing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“The Alabama Solution” (HBO Documentary Films) — Page Marsella\n“Hamnet” (Focus Features) — Affonso Gonçalves and Chloé Zhao\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon) — Matheus Farias and Eduardo Serrano\n“Sirāt” (Neon) — Cristóbal Fernández\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix) — Parker Laramie\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “The Secret Agent”\n\n\tFarias and Serrano edit “The Secret Agent” like a suspense mechanism tightening one notch at a time.

Every engine roar, every scrape of metal, every moment of sudden silence becomes a narrative beat. This is sound work that creates a sensory experience that demands the biggest, loudest theater you can find. \n\n\tNotable mentions: “Bugonia” (Focus Features); “Frankenstein” (Netflix); “KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix); “Sinners” (Warner Bros.); “Warfare” (A24)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Visual Effects\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Apple Original Films\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“F1” (Apple Original Films/Warner Bros.)\n“In Your Dreams” (Netflix)\n“Superman” (DC Studios)\n“Train Dreams” (Netflix)\n“Wicked: For Good” (Universal Pictures)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “F1”\n\n\tThe visual effects in “F1” are so seamlessly integrated that you forget you’re watching them. The racing sequences feel tactile and dangerous, putting you inside the car without ever breaking immersion. The effects team knows the spectacle means nothing without spatial coherence. Nonetheless, you always know where you are, how fast you’re going, and what the stakes are.

The song functions as an emotional anchor, a blues lament that carries the film’s themes of loss, survival and resilience, partnered with the hope for the future. Aside from being, in my estimation, the scene of the year, it’s the kind of song that feels like it’s always existed and has been a part of us.\n\n\tNotable mentions: “Free” from “KPop Demon Hunters” (Netflix); “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” from “Sinners” (Warner Bros.); “Clothed by the Sun” from “The Testament of Ann Lee” (Searchlight Pictures)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest Documentary Feature\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Apple TV/Courtesy Everett Coll\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“The Alabama Solution” (HBO Documentary Films)\n“Come See Me in the Good Light” (Apple Original Films)\n“The New Yorker at 100” (Netflix)\n“The Perfect Neighbor” (Netflix)\n“Predators” (MTV Documentary Films)\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “Come See Me in the Good Light”\n\n\tA meditation on memory, aging and dignity, the filmmaking of Ryan White’s beautiful ode to a beautiful life is patient and compassionate, never rushing its subjects or imposing external narrative. “Come See Me in the Good Light” lets people speak for themselves, trusts their stories to land without manipulation, and finds profound beauty in ordinary lives lived with intention. \n\n\tNotable mentions: “Apocalypse in the Tropics” (Netflix); “BLACKNWS: Terms & Conditions” (Rich Spirit); “It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley” (Magnolia Pictures); “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” (Apple Original Films); “2000 Meters to Andriivka” (PBS)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBest International Feature\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Victor Juca\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n“It Was Just an Accident” (Neon) \n“Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix)\n“The Secret Agent” (Neon)\n“Sirāt” (Neon)\n“The Voice of Hind Rajab”\n\n\n\n\tWINNER: “The Secret Agent”\n\n\tBrazil’s “The Secret Agent” is a political thriller that feels urgently contemporary no matter where you’re watching it.

    "body": "\n\tA Disney World Hollywood Studios employee was struck by a prop boulder during a showing of the “Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!” stage show after the 400-pound rubber sphere became displaced from its track.\n\n\tIn a video of the accident shared on social media, the boulder bounces off its designated path and onto the stage. A staff member rushes in to stop the boulder before it makes contact with the audience, but the impact of the prop is too strong, and it knocks him over. Another cast member quickly rushes in to help before the video cuts off.\n\t\n\nNEW: During Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! at Disney’s Hollywood Studios today, a 400-pound boulder prop dislodged from its track. A Cast Member was injured stopping it before it reached the audience. Disney says the Cast Member received immediate care and is recovering. pic.twitter.com/TxbWYV25OX— Scott Gustin (@ScottGustin) December 31, 2025\n\n\n\t“We’re focused on supporting our cast member, who is recovering,” a Disney spokesperson told Variety. “Safety is at the heart of what we do, and that element of the show will be modified as our safety team completes a review of what happened.”\n\n\n\tThe “Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!” is part of the Discovery Disney event series, which includes “educational backstage tours and sessions just for participants on the program to learn more about how our parks and resorts create magic for guests,” according to the Disney Parks Blog.\n\n\tThe “Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!” show is based on scenes from the Steven Spielberg-directed 1981 film “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” starring Harrison Ford as the title character. Other than the boulder, the stunt show at Disney World also features a bullwhip demonstration and falls from tall buildings, as well as stunts with axe-swinging stone soldiers and punji stick pressure plates. According to the show’s official description, there are dozens of “contingencies” for the performers if things go wrong. The first scene alone, which features only the Indiana Jones performer, has 12 possible backups.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” is going down in the Disney record books.\n\n\tThe animated sequel is now Walt Disney Animation’s highest-grossing movie in history with $1.46 billion at the global box office. It beat the previous record holder, “Frozen 2,” which made $1.45 billion in 2019.\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” has made $333 million domestically and a whopping $1.13 billion overseas. Over the Christmas holiday weekend, it surged at the box office in its fifth week of release, adding $87.9 million to its already impressive tally.\n\t\n\n\tThe film hit the coveted $1 billion milestone after just 17 days of release, and it was the fastest PG-rated movie in history to do so. It’s been a particularly huge success in China, where many Hollywood movies have floundered in recent years. At just the Chinese box office, “Zootopia 2” has already zoomed past $500 million, the highest total for a U.S. movie by far. The only other film coming close is Disney’s fellow recent release “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” which is nearing $100 million after it premiered on Dec. 19.\n\n\n\tIncluding “Zootopia 2,” only three movies have crossed $1 billion globally this year: Disney’s live-action “Lilo & Stitch” remake, which has $1.03 billion; and China’s animated “Ne Zha 2,” which stands as the year’s biggest movie with more than $2.2 billion.\n\n\tStarring Ginnifer Goodwin as the rabbit Judy Hopps and Jason Bateman as the clever fox Nick Wilde, “Zootopia 2” reunites the two critters as buddy cops in the sequel to Disney’s original 2016 hit. This time, the two friends must discover a reptilian mystery that threatens to turn the animal haven of Zootopia upside down. \n",

    "body": "\n\tLook at the biggest recent mergers and acquisitions in the worlds of entertainment, media and sports, from the record-setting $55 billion buyout of Elec­tronic Arts to the Skydance-Paramount merger and the dueling offers for Warner Bros. Discovery, and you’ll notice the same handful of names showing up again and again, often together in the same deal. They’re investment firms with names like RedBird Capital Partners, the Raine Group, LionTree Advisors and Silver Lake. Most provide financing for these huge transac­tions, while others, like Moelis & Company, are pure advisors who help structure and execute capital raises.\n\t\n\n\tIf you don’t work in or near the gilded trenches of high finance, you might be ask­ing yourself, “What the hell is going on?”\n\n\n\t“When you’re dealing with artists and film and music, it is as relationship-driven as I’ve ever seen,” explains Angelo Rufino, who, as head of special situations at the 41-year-old Bain Capital, works in the same sectors and spirit as those younger com­panies. “It is really important who you are, what you can add and bring to the table. I think at times that can be lost with the bigger firms.”\n\n\tOnce upon a time, corporate M&A was dominated by decades- and, in some cases, century-and-a-half-old Wall Street behe­moths that controlled trillions in assets. Then came the 2008 financial crisis, trig­gering massive losses that pushed some to the brink of ruin and others (e.g., Leh­man Brothers) into extinction. Survivors like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into bank hold­ing companies to gain access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window lending pro­grams and deposit insurance, subjecting them to stricter government oversight.\n\t\n\n\tThe challenges faced by the old giants were compounded by post-crisis federal regulations (via the Dodd-Frank Act and the Volcker Rule), which targeted specu­lative trading that created conflicts of interest with clients and required higher asset-to-debt ratios for leveraged invest­ments. As a result, the most aggressive strategies were no longer legal or profit­able enough to pursue at scale, opening the door for smaller, more nimble firms drawing on private equity, led by ambi­tious refugees from money center banks.\n\n\tMany of these upstarts developed a niche in showbiz. According to Carlos Jimenez, a managing director at Moelis & Company, the reason for this is very sim­ple: “No one ever gets bored talking about media, sports and entertainment,” he says.\n\n\tThat was especially true in 2025, when the most talked-about drama in Hollywood was not anything on the big or small screens, but rather Skydance Media’s on-again, off-again and, finally, on-again $8.4 billion merger with Paramount, backed by RedBird.\n\n\tRedBird founder and managing partner Gerry Cardinale says that the deal wasn’t necessarily the emotional roller coaster it appeared to be.\n\n\t“To a certain extent, it was business as usual,” says Cardinale, who retired from Goldman Sachs in 2012 and launched Red­Bird two years later. “Obviously, this was a very complicated transaction where, in a certain way, we had to almost buy it three times. [But] the one thing that has distinguished us over my 35 years [in the business] is that we’re persistent, we’re tenacious, we don’t get emotional about these things.”\n\n\tNonetheless, Cardinale agrees that this investment is uniquely significant, both personally and financially. It gives his company RedBird 22.5% voting power in the resulting company, Paramount Sky­dance, and Cardinale a seat on its board of directors. It puts him second in line behind Skydance Media founder David Ellison, who took the title of chairman and CEO, and his father, tech mega-billionaire Larry Ellison, who collectively control 77.5% of the voting power.\n\n\t“I looked at a lot of things and passed on them,” says Cardinale. “And what changed it for me was that you had someone like David Ellison, who is a true owner-operator.”\n\n\tThis isn’t the first time a New York-based power broker has gotten a hand on the reins of Paramount. In 1966, Austrian-born Charles Bluhdorn’s automotive parts man­ufacturing and distribution conglomerate Gulf+Western bought the financially trou­bled studio, eventually leading to a golden age that produced such classics as “The Godfather” films and “Chinatown.”\n\t\n\n\tUnlike Bluhdorn, Cardinale isn’t a Hol­lywood newcomer. As he’s quick to point out, this is far from the only significant showbiz investment made by RedBird in recent years. In 2021, it was part of a con­sortium that bought a significant minority stake in LeBron James and Maverick Car­ter’s media and entertainment firm Sprin­gHill Company, and the following year it committed a minimum of $100 million to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon’s pro­duction company Artists Equity. It’s also been active in the sports world, with bets that include paying $750 million for an 11% minority stake in Fenway Sports in 2021 and $1.3 billion for the full acquisition of AC Milan in 2022. More importantly, it’s been investing in Skydance since 2019.\n\n\t“Redbird, to a certain extent, is an intel­lectual property monetization engine,” says Cardinale. “We’ve had a long track record of being able to buy into IP-based businesses and effectively we underwrite them, reinvigorate them and reposition them for the 21st century for technological disintermediation,” where middlemen are removed from the supply chain, enabling more efficient and profitable direct-to-consumer transactions.\n\n\tOn the investment side, the results are clear: the entity putting in the money gets an ownership stake. But what do these firms get for their advisory services? Typi­cally, advisors collect retainer fees ($10,000 to $50,000 a month) and success fees (1.5% to 10% of deal value), with the larger deals commanding larger retainers, but lower success fee percentages. With a mega-deal like the sale of Warner Bros. Discovery, which has received dueling offers from Net­flix and Paramount topping out at $108.4 billion, the worst-case piece of the deal pie can’t help but be impressive.\n\n\tAnd what do the companies get from the advisors?\n\n\t“We basically do two or three things,” explains Jimenez. “We put our arm around clients during their most important trans­actions, and that typically is M&A when folks are looking to buy or sell. Also, cap­ital raising, which is when they’re raising debt equity or going public. And then we also have a restructuring business, which is good when things go sideways,” he says, pointing to the work Moelis has done with AMC Theatres, which includes advising on a $600 million strategic investment from Silver Lake in 2018 and its 2020 restruc­turing strategy. “If you ask [AMC chairman and CEO] Adam Aron, he’d tell you that we had a big hand in keeping his company afloat during really tough times during the pandemic,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tAfter serving as one of the advisors to Skydance on its Paramount merger, Moe­lis advised Netflix on its deal to buy War­ner Bros. Discovery, which was quickly met with a hostile offer from the company it just helped create. The Raine Group also advised Skydance on the merger (along with BofA Securities and, of course, Red­Bird), while LionTree and Rothschild & Co. advised Paramount, along with Centerview Partners, which advised the independent special committee of the Paramount board.\n\n\tBut when you untangle these deals, things tend to be a bit less crowded than they might appear to an outsider, accord­ing to Jimenez.\n\n\tOn big transactions, “there’s just so much to do in a short period of time, you often need a lot of help, but that’s not always the case,” he says. “Depending on the transaction, sometimes even on some of the big ones, there’s only one or two banks on each side.”\n",

This year, many of the big English-language titles that lit up Cannes and Venice have struggled to turn red carpet frenzy and long standing ovations into box office heat or sustained best picture momentum. \n\n\tStill, in a crowded, jittery marketplace, a Cannes or Venice berth is considered one of the last true power moves for filmmakers with ambitions for Oscars glory and global stature. Questioned by Variety about how the sluggish box office could impact studios’ festivals strategy, Barbera remained optimistic. “Getting an invitation for a big festival like Cannes, Venice, or later, Telluride and Toronto, is one of the most profitable way to promote a film and the international premiere of a film,” he said while on the red carpet at Marrakech Film Festival. “I think that the studio will keep on attending big festivals with their best films, for sure.”\n\n\tAnd 2026 is shaping up to offer Fremaux and Barbera many attractive options that could garner an impressive roster of stars. These include Steven Spielberg’s UFO movie “Disclosure Day,” starring Emily Blunt and Josh O’Connor; Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s “Digger” with Tom Cruise; David Fincher’s “The Adventures of Cliff Booth” starring Brad Pitt; Ruben Östlund’s “The Entertainment System Is Down” with Keanu Reeves and Kirsten Dunst; and Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Three” headlined by Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya. The 2026 festival pipeline is stacked — at least on paper. \n\n\tWe’ve limited our wishlist to 10 titles, but there are many more films from revered auteurs which we expect to see launch at either Cannes or Venice, notably “Minotaur” from Andrey Zvyagintsev, the two-time Oscar-nominated Russian filmmaker of “Loveless” and “Leviathan”; “Sheep in the Box” (already bought by Neon) or “Look Back” from Palme d’Or-winning Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda; Quentin Dupieux’s Paris-set film “Full Phil” sarring Woody Harrelson and Kristen Stewart; “The Unknown,” starring Lea Seydoux and directed by Arthur Harari who won an Oscar for the screenplay of “Anatomy of a Fall” (shared with Justine Triet); and Nanni Moretti’s next film “It Will Happen Tonight,” among others.\n\n\tBelow, Variety rounds up 10 of the most anticipated films (in alphabetical order) we’re betting could land on the Croisette or the Lido next year, assuming the courting pays off and the stars align.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘The Adventures of Cliff Booth,’ David Fincher\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThree years after presenting “The Killer” in competition at Venice, Fincher could return to the Lido with “The Adventures of Cliff Booth,” his anticipated sequel to Quentin Tarantino‘s 1960s-set “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” The spinoff brings back Brad Pitt, reprising his role as Cliff Booth the effortlessly cool, occasionally hilarious and fearless stuntman — a performance that won him an Oscar for best supporting actor in 2020. The movie, which reteams Pitt with Fincher after “Fight Club” and “Seven” and shot on location in L.A., follows Booth as he starts a new career as a Hollywood studio fixer. It’s the third movie that Fincher has done for Netflix after “Mank” and “The Killer.” But since it’s a Netflix movie, it’s safe to assume it won’t play at Cannes (where Netflix pics aren’t allowed in competition).\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Her Private Hell,’ Nicolas Winding Refn\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tRefn is expected to show up in either Cannes or Venice with “Her Private Hell,” his mysterious next film which marks his feature film comeback a decade after delivering divisive body horror “The Neon Demon.” While the plot is under wraps, Refn teased the project in an interview with Variety at Venice 2024, saying it will boast “lots of glitter, sex, and violence.” The subversive Danish director, best known for “Drive,” “Pusher,” “Bronson” and “Only God Forgives,” has assembled an alluring cast of up-and-comers including Charles Melton, Sophie Thatcher, Kristine Froseth and Havana Rose Liu. Neon bought worldwide rights to the film and will be releasing it in U.S. theaters. We’re curious to see if Refn still has it, after a 10-year big-screen absence during which he directed a couple series, Netflix’s “Copenhagen Cowboy” and Amazon’s “Too Old to Die Young.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Bunker,’ Florian Zeller\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Louis Amourette\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAn elevated psychological thriller, “Bunker” is Zeller’s third film after “The Son,” which competed at Venice and earned Hugh Jackman a best actor nomination at the Golden Globes, and “The Father,” which won best actor for Anthony Hopkins and best adapted screenplay at the Oscars. The movie’s star-studded ensemble is led by Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem alongside Stephen Graham, Patrick Schwarzenegger and Paul Dano. “Bunker” sees Cruz and Bardem play a married couple whose relationship and family implode after a powerful tech mogul steps into their lives with a mysterious construction project. As it’s currently shooting and will likely be completed in the spring, “Bunker” could technically premiere on the Lido, like “The Son” did.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Digger,’ Alejandro González Iñárritu\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Variety via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIñárritu’s first English-language feature since his Oscar-winning “The Revenant,” “Digger” is a darkly comic drama billed as “a comedy of catastrophic proportions.” The film stars and is produced by Tom Cruise, who plays Digger Rockwell, “the most powerful man in the world,” as he races to prove he is humanity’s savior before the disaster he’s unleashed destroys everything. The Warner Bros. and Legendary title — whose cast is completed by Sandra Hüller, John Goodman, Michael Stuhlbarg, Jesse Plemons, Sophie Wilde, Riz Ahmed and Emma D’Arcy — has set an Oct. 2 release date, positioning it for a potential fall festival debut. Venice is a natural possibility, having hosted Iñárritu premieres including his latest film “Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths,” as well as “Birdman” and “21 Grams;” though Cannes also looms as a possibility given the director’s long-standing relationship with the festival dating back to “Amores Perros.” Cruise also has a soft spot for Cannes, having recently premiered “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Mission: Impossible. The Final Reckoning” there.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Disclosure Day,’ Steven Spielberg\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Universal Pictures \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tCould Spielberg’s next film, “Disclosure Day,” bow on the Croisette? It’s surely on Fremaux’s radar since Universal Pictures has set a June 12 release date. The science-fiction movie stars Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell and Henry Lloyd-Hughes. Spielberg developed the UFO story with screenwriter David Koepp, with whom he previously worked on “Jurassic Park,” “Jurassic Park: The Lost World,” “War of the Worlds” and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” If the movie launched at Cannes, it would most likely play out of competition where Spielberg presented “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” in 2008, “The Color Purple” in 1986″ and “E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,” which played as the closing night film in 1982. Cannes is also close to Spielberg’s heart because his first film, “Sugarland Express,” won best screenplay at the fest in 1974. He was also president of the jury in 2013.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Dune: Part Three,’ Denis Villeneuve\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tBesides “Digger,” Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment have another hot movie that could land a big festival premiere: Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Three,” whose cast is stacked enough to draw dozens of headlines and carry an entire festival. Based on Frank Herbert’s second “Dune” novel, “Dune: Part Three” sees Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya reprising their roles alongside Robert Pattinson, Florence Pugh, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson and Anya Taylor-Joy. Barbera, who hosted the world premiere for “Dune” out of competition at Venice in 2021, told Variety at Marrakech that he’s already talked to Villeneuve about coming back to the Lido with the third opus. “He just finished shooting the film,” Barbera said, adding that “It will be released in the fall of next year. So it could be a possibility.” In fact, Warner Bros. has set the release date for the winter, rather than the fall, on Dec. 18. The last installment, “Dune: Part Two” skipped festivals and bowed in London.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘The Entertainment System Is Down,’ Ruben Östlund\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for BFI\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tOne of our surest bets is the return of Östlund to Cannes’ competition with his next satirical black comedy, “The Entertainment System Is Down,” starring an ensemble cast including Kirsten Dunst, Keanu Reeves and Daniel Brühl. The Swedish provocateur spent four years making this new film — his most ambitious yet — after winning two Palme d’Ors back to back with “The Square” in 2017 and “Triangle of Sadness” in 2022. Acquired early on by A24 in an eight-figure deal, the big-budget project unfolds on a long-haul flight between England and Australia where the entertainment system fails, sparking chaos and rage among bored passengers. Östlund shot it in a real Boeing 747 which was acquired for the film. Speaking to Variety about the project a couple of years ago, Östlund said it will be “a study of how human beings interact in this little laboratory that is a plane” and “how modern human beings are wrecked under these circumstances.” Östlund also seemed confident that it “will cause the biggest walkout” in the history of Cannes Film Festival.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘1949,’ Paweł Pawlikowski\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Christian Hüller\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tPaweł Pawlikowski, the Oscar-winning Polish director of “Ida,” is now in post on “1949,” a period drama starring Sandra Hüller (“Zone of Interest,” “Anatomy of a Fall”) which marks his first film since his Oscar-nominated 2018 hit “Cold War.” The film is set at the height of the Cold War and revolves on the relationship between German writer Thomas Mann and his daughter Erika, an actress, journalist and rally driver, as they embark on a road trip in a black Buick cruiser across a Germany in ruins — from U.S. dominated Frankfurt to Soviet controlled Weimar. It’s produced by Mubi and Lorenzo Mieli and Mario Gianani’s Our Films. Exploring once again themes of identity and family bonds in post-WW2 Europe, “1949” could open at Cannes where Pawlikowski won best director with “Cold War” in 2018 and earned three Oscar nominations the following year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Paper Tiger,’ James Gray\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJames Gray’s “Paper Tiger,” a gritty crime story starring Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson and Miles Teller, doesn’t yet have a release date but is expected during the first half of 2026 which means that it could world premiere at Cannes. It would be a homecoming of sorts for Gray, who is beloved in France and considered a Croisette regular having already presented five films there, including “Armageddon Time,” “The Immigrant,” “Two Lovers,” “We Own the Night” and “The Yards.” He also sat on Cannes’ jury in 2009, the year it was presided over by Isabelle Huppert. Yet, the mix reception of “Armageddon Time” at Cannes in 2022 could temper expectations. “Paper Tiger” was independently produced and doesn’t have U.S. distribution yet.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t‘Parallel Tales,’ Asghar Farhadi\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Corbis via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIranian auteur Asghar Farhadi looks like a natural fit for Cannes 2026 with his latest film,” Parallel Tales.” Slated for a spring release, the film shot in Paris with a dazzling French ensemble led by two of the country’s most iconic actresses, Isabelle Huppert and Catherine Deneuve, alongside Virginie Efira and Vincent Cassel. Cannes has consistently championed Farhadi’s dramas over the years. His previous French-language film, “The Past,” marked his first film in competition at Cannes in 2013 and won best actress for Berenice Bejo. He has presented three other movies in competition: “The Salesman” which won best screenplay and best actor for Shahab Hosseini in 2016, the Spanish-language film “Everybody Knows” which opened the festival in 2018, and “A Hero,” which won the Grand Prize in 2021. He served on the jury (presided over by Vincent Lindon) the following year.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom Amazon to REI, These Are the Best New Years Deals to Shop Online Right Now\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA Miami Manse With a Wraparound Pool and Private Dock Just Listed for $30 Million\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow Facial Recognition Tech Took Over U.S. Sporting Events\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWWD’s 2025 Celebrity Superlatives\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Each year, a new crop of gruesome, devastating and, admit it, often fascinating documentaries about the dark side of the human condition rocket to the top of streaming charts and activate heretofore unknown fears in viewers who willingly subject themselves to each one. Seemingly, we can’t get enough of the awful things that humans do to each other. We lose sleep over the unanswered questions, and invite in intrusive “that could be me” thoughts that plague our waking moments. These documentaries also activate corners of the internet where online sleuths wait like bloodhounds looking for their next all-consuming obsession.\n\n\tIn honor of all the true crime documentaries and docuseries that scared us this year, we’ve ranked some of the most watched new additions to the genre. But this list isn’t exhaustive, nor does it attempt to wrap its arms around every subgenre of true crime. Is that even possible these days, when new docuseries drop seemingly every week? This list doesn’t include celebrity-centered stories, which could be their own ranking. So if you are looking for the fallout from Netflix’s Diddy docuseries a “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” you can learn about that project here. This list also doesn’t include one-off editions of established programs like “Nightline” and “Dateline.” \n\n\tInstead, the 18 entries in the ranking below pull from traditional episodic or feature-length documentaries that burrowed their way into our psyches in 2025, and haven’t let us forget them since.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tCold Case: The Tylenol Murders (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFor all the panic that the Tylenol scare of the 1980s set off, and the sweeping changes in over-the-counter medication regulations it inspired, this documentary from co-directors Yotam Guendelman and Ari Pines lacks the punch to deliver the message. At its core, the sheer randomness of the deaths from cyanide-laced Extra Strength Tylenol capsules was and remains an incomprehensible horror. It’s scary knowing the basic act of treating a headache or a sore limb could be the fatal mistake that drops you into someone’s game to inflict suffering and fear just for the hell of it. But what’s missing in this series is a clear vision for the story it wanted to tell, perhaps because the murders are still unsolved. Did it want to probe the collective realization that we are more vulnerable than we care to admit? Or was it interested in bringing forth alternate theories about Johnson & Johnson’s potential involvement in the crimes? Unfortunately, while still a gripping crime, the series leans more to the latter and therefore loses a bit of its bite. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tFred & Rose West: A British Horror Story (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe “House of Horrors” in Gloucester, England is one of the most famous nightmares of the 20th century. Fred West killed, sexually assaulted and dismembered at least a dozen women and young girls over 20 years from 1967-1987, most of them with the assistance of his wife Rose. The sheer scale of their crimes, most buried in the garden in their backyard, makes them a classic case for the true-crime treatment. However, there is way more to this story than director Daniel Dewsbury clues the audience in on. Despite the first two episodes being named for its killers, the series doesn’t examine their backgrounds, how Fred groomed a much-younger Rose into their relationship and the lasting trauma of this two-decade tragedy. The victims deserve their time in the modern-day true crime conversation, but this is an introductory case study at best.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tBurden of Guilt: Haunted By Lies (Paramount+)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of CBS/Paramount+\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA woman who learns she was, as a 2-year-old, accused of killing her baby brother goes on a dogged personal quest for answers about her parents’ real involvement in the crime. While not the most refined doc this year, Tracyraquel Berns is an interesting enough figure whose life is boiled down to the twists and turns of a death that has haunted her entire life — even before she was told it had been laid on her shoulders. It’s an intriguing setup, but it also falls into the trap of stretching a story to its limits to fill an episodic order, versus telling a full story that actually needs four episodes.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSpy High (Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Prime Video\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tIn 2010, a Philadelphia high school student was accused by his principal of selling drugs — the supposed proof of which was a photo taken of him in his bedroom on a school-issued laptop. The scandal of how a school invaded a minor’s privacy spirals into a criminal investigation that uncovered more than 50,000 photos taken of students in their homes without their knowledge. The most chilling thing about this documentary is the fact that this happened 15 years ago. Imagine what our computers are doing to us today without us even knowing about it.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAileen: Queen of the Serial Killers (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tMale serial killers are the ones who usually get immortalized in films, TV series and documentaries about their depravities. But America is still working through how it feels about female killers. Aileen Wuornos is probably the first of them to come to mind for most, and her story has already nabbed Charlize Theron an Oscar for “Monster” (and Sarah Paulson is gearing up to play her as well for Ryan Murphy’s “Monster” Season 4). But no one speaks to this Florida serial killer’s life and legacy better than the woman herself. In interviews granted in 1997 before her execution, Wuornos reckoned with her own demons, regrets and image in the final days of her life. It’s a stirring reflection on someone’s own understanding of themselves, the totality of their life and what could have been.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMy Father, The BTK Killer (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tA key component to most true-crime sagas is the inevitable recollections of those closest to the perpetrators who never saw it coming. The family and friends blindsided by the double life led by their loved ones. But few can claim to be closer to generational evil more than Kerri Rawson, the daughter of Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer. By shifting the focus of the documentary to Rawson, director Skye Borgman manages to track the ripple effects of BTK’s crimes, especially the permanent wounds left on a daughter picking up the pieces of her life after so much death.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDeath in Apartment 603: What Happened to Ellen Greenberg? (Hulu/ABC)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tAccording to a Pennsylvania medical examiner, schoolteacher Ellen Greenberg died by suicide after stabbing herself 20 times in the back and neck in 2011. Her parents don’t buy it, and for those who watched this series from director Nancy Schwartzman and producers Dakota and Elle Fanning, it’s not hard to see why. Too often, the true crime that warrants attention from documentarians involves a miscarriage of justice or a botched investigation, and this four-episode series lays out why all the above could be at play in Greenberg’s death. Unfortunately for those hoping this thoughtful, meticulously researched series might move the needle on her death determination, the city of Philadelphia upheld the suicide ruling a few weeks after the episodes hit Hulu. But her parents have vowed to keep fighting.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t Mr. & Mrs. Murder (Hulu/ABC)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Hulu\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tTwo devout Christian couples in Florida are shattered in 2000 when one of the men goes missing while hunting and is feared eaten by alligators, as is one’s lot in life in Florida. But that isn’t the crazy part. His wife almost immediately seeks his life insurance and shacks up with his best friend, who abandons his own wife in the process. Years later, the odd woman out leads an investigation in growing suspicions the gruesome twosome may have been involved in the husband’s death. While simply told, calling this is a wild ride would be an understatement as its protagonist takes viewers on a revenge trip for the ages and mines from it a rarity in the true-crime space: a happy ending where bad people get (some semblance of) what they deserve.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAmerican Murder: Gabby Petito (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tEveryone had seen the video: a terrified Gabby Petitio being questioned about a domestic violence incident by police on the side of a desert highway, just days before she went missing in 2021. The tragedy of 22-year-old Gabby’s murder, at the hands of her fiancé Brian Laundrie, is deeply felt in this three-episode series from director Michael Gasparro and Julia Willoughby Nason. But even more viscerally, the expanded episodic runway makes viewers sit with the uncomfortable raw footage of Gabby and Brian’s increasingly volatile on-camera interactions while trying to be YouTube vloggers. The resulting format is a show within a show: First, there’s the documentary telling Gabby’s story through her family and friends; and second, there’s a frozen-in-time archive of a romantic partnership warped by micro and macroaggressions that fostered an environment of control, hostility and ultimately a murder-suicide carried out over the course of weeks.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAmy Bradley Is Missing (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tNothing digs a documentary into your marrow more than a lack of answers, and “Amy Bradley Is Missing” is steeped in unanswered questions. In 1998, a young woman disappeared without a trace from her family’s cabin on the Royal Caribbean’s Rhapsody of the Seas cruise ship and has not been seen since. Whether you think Amy Bradley was the victim of human trafficking, or she fell overboard, or she is living a new life she brokered for herself, directors Phil Lott and Ari Mark give you all the facts and let you decide. Better yet, they let each subsequent theory cast enough doubt on the last to leave the viewer questioning everything, while also wanting more.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Yogurt Shop Murders (HBO)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of HBO\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe power of memory — as a tool and as a weapon — is at the center of director Margaret Brown’s compelling three-episode look at the 1991 murder of four teenage girls in an I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt shop in Austin, Texas. Working with unused footage from a young filmmaker overwhelmed by the scope of the case, Brown retraces the steps of ostracized investigators, sits down with the still-searching families and talks to some of the suspects who the public never fully exonerated. The engaging A24 production is more of a mood piece than a traditional doc, peeling back the ways this quadruple homicide lingers over Austin like a sinister cloud to this day. Unfortunately for viewers, it is only half the story. Less than a month after the doc dropped on HBO, DNA evidence linked the case to a deceased serial killer — leaving new questions that aren’t interrogated in the doc and may never be answered for those left behind. Season 2, perhaps?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Mortician (HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of HBO Max\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t“I don’t put any value in anybody after they are gone and dead, as they shouldn’t in me when I’m gone and dead.” That’s an acceptable stance for the average person to have, but it’s not the kind of opinion you want to hear from the man in charge of your loved one’s cremation. And yet, that is how freely David Sconce talks about his time as a mortician during the 1980s when, among other injustices, he cremated thousands of people a year –– most of them together, which is not protocol to say the least. Director Joshua Rofé’s series is a sobering trek through the crimes and callousness of Sconce, whose bizarring candidness offers a lens into the mind of a truly terrifying individual who is part Mafia boss, part Scrooge McDuck jumping into his mountain of coins and entirely devoid of remorse for profiting off the vulnerability of his clients. Everybody dies, and this series leaves its audience with a new fear they might end up in the hands of someone as cold blooded as Sconce.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDevil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke (Hulu)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Hulu\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tWhile 2025 doesn’t offer as many new entries into the subgenre of cult documentaries as years past, the closest audiences got was Hulu’s reckoning with Ruby Franke and the poisonous nature of fame, fortune and the illusion of perfection. As a YouTube mom-fluencer, Franke projected the image of an infallible Mormon family of eight to her thousands of followers, offering parenting advice and an inside look at their home life. Years later, she had cast half that family out of her house and pleaded guilty, along with her live-in spiritual counselor Jodi Hildebrandt, to half a dozen counts of child abuse for imprisoning and torturing two of her children whom she believed were possessed. (Hildebrandt herself is now the subject of the Netflix docuseries “Evil Influencer: The Jodi Hildebrandt Story,” set for a Dec. 30 release.) Franke is an infuriating figure to spend any degree of time with, but director Olly Lambert manages to wring from her story an important lesson for the age of influencers — never trust the life someone shows you online.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tOne Night in Idaho: The College Murders (Prime Video)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFollowers of the Idaho college murder case were rocked this summer when news broke that Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of brutally killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, had taken a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. The news came mere days before co-directors Liz Garbus and Matthew Galkin’s four-part series on the case was set to drop on Prime Video, leaving the filmmakers scrambling to add a new coda to their work. Nevertheless, the series was exactly what watchers of the case had waited for: intimate interviews with victims’ families, the friends who were closest to them and those who became collateral damage of the toxic social-media sleuths that sought to solve the case by any means necessary. While sensationalized, the moments with the families are gut-wrenching yet hopeful for the future, which is a delicate balance to walk when every breath is singed with sorrow.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Alabama Solution (HBO Max)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of HBO Max \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tLargely told through cell-phone video and calls from men serving life sentences inside the Alabama prison system, this film from directors Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman will render you speechless with what it reveals about the cruelty so casually inflicted upon the state’s incarcerated citizens. Beaten, bloodied and even killed, the documentary asks audiences to muster empathy and understanding for why even those charged with the most heinous of crimes should still be treated according to the law. Jarecki (who directed “The Jinx”) and Kaufman make the case that insidious behavior like this, enacted against those with no recourse to defend or protect themselves, is an evil that can spread if not cut out –– something the Alabama government doesn’t seem interested in doing.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tUnknown Number: The High School Catfish (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tThe documentary about a teenage couple who is relentlessly bullied through anonymous text messages immediately became a phenomenon when it premiered in August. The 2025 version of word of mouth — TikTok users filming their families and friends watching the twist that comes about halfway through — made the film from director Skye Borgman (who also helmed “My Father, the BTK Killer”) a spectacle that everyone was talking about. But it is also a well-crafted (albeit deceptive at times) cautionary tale about how those closest to us are in the best position to hurt us. While no one gets murdered in this one, the scars left behind by the perpetrator (who is heavily featured in the film) are laid bare in a way that sickens as much as it shocks.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tThe Perfect Neighbor (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tFirst premiering at Sundance in January, this film pieced together from body camera and interrogation room footage chronicles the story of a predominately Black Florida neighborhood put on edge by a white woman who repeatedly calls the police for nonsensical threats while antagonizing the children playing in a nearby lot. The frustrating, foreboding sense of dread that hangs over each false cry for help ratchets up the tension until someone is dead and a community is forever changed. By stripping away the traditional hallmarks of a documentary (the talking heads, the endless news segments, etc.) and simply showing the increasing concern, anger and ultimately heartbreak from the neighbors, director Geeta Gandbhir trims away any agenda or bias to simply show the facts about a case that should have never happened. Gandbhir understands that sometimes the best way to tell a story is to let it speak for itself, and this one speaks volumes about the systemic failures of the laws meant to protect citizens. It lands as a searing indictment of America today, where communities quietly live their lives until they are devastatingly interrupted by the will of one.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tGone Girls: The Long Island Serial Killer (Netflix)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDirector/producer Liz Garbus spent nearly a decade pouring over the facts in the case of the Gilgo Beach murders, first for 2020’s narrative film “Lost Girls” and then for this year’s “Gone Girls: The Long Island Serial Killer” docuseries. Her investment in this story –– particularly the victims and their families –– comes through loud and clear in this disheartening look at how willing communities are to look past hateful violence simply because of someone’s profession or circumstance. The victim-forward series centers the more than a dozen women, many of them sex workers, who were killed and disposed of on or near Long Island between 1993 and 2011. Within that, she also charts the fraught 30-year investigation that only recently led to the arrest of Rex Heuermann, who is charged with killing seven of the victims. Despite the revelation, Garbus never veers far from her intent to chronicle the lives lost and the supportive community built on the shared pain of those left behind. That’s what the killer thought he had stolen from his victims, but their stories only grow louder and more prescient with Garbus’ staggering work.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t",

The formula incorporates Bader’s proprietary TFC8® technology, a complex of amino acids, vitamins, and peptides designed to support skin renewal and improve texture over time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBeckham, who first partnered with the German skincare house in 2019, has steadily built a line that merges clinical performance with luxury branding. Earlier collaborations included Cell Rejuvenating Priming Moisturizer and Power Serum, both of which quickly became cult favorites among beauty insiders. The new expansion cements Beckham Beauty’s commitment to long-term skin health while broadening its reach into the complexion category.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe partnership with Bader is both strategic and deeply personal for Beckham, who has long been candid about her challenges with sensitive skin and her preference for formulas that combine efficacy with elegance. The packaging — minimalist, weighted, and glass — continues her brand’s signature design language, balancing precision with polish.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the foundation, the line introduces a <a href=\"https://go.linkby.com/FBEHTJNU/us/en/the-concealer-pen\" target=\"_blank\">Concealer Pen </a>infused with the same TFC8® complex, further blurring the boundary between coverage and care. More complexion products are expected in early 2026, as Beckham Beauty continues to expand its presence in the luxury skincare-meets-makeup space.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tShop Beckham’s full Augustinus Bader skincare collection here, and a few standout products below:</p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.linkby.com/FBEHTJNU/us/en/the-foundation-drops\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-06-at-3.38.22-PM.png 1522w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-06-at-3.38.22-PM.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-06-at-3.38.22-PM.png?resize=300,281 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-06-at-3.38.22-PM.png?w=1024\" alt=\"Victoria Beckham Augustinus Bader Makeup: Shop Online\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.linkby.com/FBEHTJNU/us/en/the-concealer-pen\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-06-at-3.37.25-PM.png 1494w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-06-at-3.37.25-PM.png?resize=147,150 147w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-06-at-3.37.25-PM.png?resize=293,300 293w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-06-at-3.37.25-PM.png?w=1001\" alt=\"Victoria Beckham Augustinus Bader Makeup: Shop Online\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n</div>",

LaNasa and husband Grant Show were among the judges, alongside Judy Greer, Cheri Oteri, Dan Bucatinsky, Camryn Manheim, Kathey Kinney, and <em>Variety</em>’s own Marc Malkin.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tCelebrating its 30th year, Best in Drag raises funds for APLA Health’s Alliance for Housing and Healing to support displaced and unhoused individuals with HIV/AIDS, providing subsidized apartments and emergency financial assistance in Los Angeles. This year’s event, hosted by casting director Patrick Rush, raised $250,000. This year’s winner was circus-inspired bearded Miss Wisconsin, Bailey Barnum. \n</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\t“Best in Drag is just fun as hell, and it’s about accepting everybody where they are, celebrating people as they are,” LaNasa said. “I hope that this event teaches people that drag queens don’t kill, and there’s nothing to be afraid of here.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe pageant was the the subject matter of “The Little Pageant That Could,” a 2024 documentary centering around the creation and rise of Best in Drag. Oteri said watching the documentary inspired her to want to be involved with the show.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I really was taken by the documentary, which made me want to come [to support]. I’d say to let your freak flag fly, because it’s so fun to watch and to be an audience member,” the former “Saturday Night Live” star said. “It’s wonderful for every gay young person to learn that there are all different types of ways to be gay.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/tom-blyth/\">Tom Blyth</a>‘s acting career hit a newfound peak when he starred as a young Coriolanus Snow in 2023’s “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-hunger-games/\">The Hunger Games</a>: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,” which topped the box office on its way to nearly $350 million worldwide. Some might think headlining a major Hollywood franchise movie might bring dramatically life-changing fame, but Blyth recently told <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/features/tom-blyth-plainclothes-interview-hunger-games-b2838192.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Independent </a>that fanfare around his “Hunger Games” prequel was short-lived and “calmed down very quickly.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“In this age of social media, everything’s hot for a minute and then the next thing comes out,” Blyth said. “It taught me really quickly not to buy into [things] too much. And I’m glad it happened when I was 27 and not when I was 19 or 20. I was like, ‘I know why I do this. It’s not for the attention. It’s for the love of it.’”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” certainly elevated Blyth’s career, it appears the 30-year-old actor is not actively seeking out another Hollywood franchise. Sure, the fame boost he got from the prequel was big enough where he’s now a fixture at fashion week shows, but even there Blyth said: “You’re in this elite world for about five minutes and then you step back into real life.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBlyth might be getting another huge career boost at the start of next year when Netflix streams “People We Meet on Vacation,” the streamer’s highly-anticipated film adaptation of Emily Heny’s bestselling book. Blyth headlines the romance opposite Emily Bader, and the movie already has a baked-in fanbase that could turn the movie into a streaming sensation.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It’ll probably last five minutes,” Blyth predicted to <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/features/tom-blyth-plainclothes-interview-hunger-games-b2838192.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Independent</a> about the expected success of “People You Meet on Vacation,” which streams Jan. 9, 2026, on Netflix. “Then I’ll be back to walking my dog.”<br /></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lukas-gage/\">Lukas Gage</a> is living his true authentic life like never before.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe openly gay 30-year-old actor – best known for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/podcasts/murray-bartlett-physical-white-lotus-1235156501/\">“The White Lotus,”</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/you-season-5-ratings-netflix-views-1236381635/\">“You”</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/podcasts/lukas-gage-companion-road-house-sequel-the-last-of-us-1236296338/\">“Companion,”</a> among others – tells all in his new memoir, “I Wrote This for Attention.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe writes candidly and humorously about his traumatic childhood, substance abuse, STDs, checking into a mental health treatment center and his short-lived marriage to celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m an over-sharer,” Gage tells me during a Zoom video interview from his publisher Simon & Schuster’s offices in New York City. “I probably say too much. But I love memoirs where they overshare and maybe crossing the line, but they entice people to have conversations about things that may be taboo.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat includes revealing his borderline personality disorder diagnosis. “It’s very stigmatized and perceived quite negatively but I was so inspired after Julia Fox and a few other artists who I looked up talked about it. It made me feel less alone,” Gage says. “It made me feel like I didn’t have something to hide and be filled with shame. The two hardest things for me to talk about were the shame associated with my sexuality and the shame associated with my mental health stuff and I hated how small I felt when I would talk about it and I guess I just had that moment where I was like I am not going to hold back anymore, I’m not going to be apologetic for who I am.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the ill-fated romance with Appleton – Kim Kardashian officiated their wedding in Las Vegas – Gage says, “If I’m being completely transparent, that was a lot less hard for me to talk about than the mental health and my sexuality and the addictive behaviors and my family.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGage grew up in San Diego. He and his two brothers were raised by his mother after their parents divorced and his father started another family with his new wife. Gage’s acting career began when he was 18. His big break was in the first season of “The White Lotus,” specifically for a scene in which his character Dillion is seen being rimmed by Armond (Murray Bartlett).</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it’s what Gage did off camera while filming “The White Lotus” that first garnered him international headlines. In 2020, he released a video a clip from a Zoom audition during which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/tristram-shapeero-takes-responsibility-lukas-gage-comment-1234838809/\">director Tristram Shapeero</a> didn’t realize that the actor could hear him criticizing his apartment because he wasn’t on mute.</p>\n<p>\n\tRead below for an exclusive excerpt from “I Wrote This for Attention,” where Gage details his decision to release the audition footage on social media.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>Excerpted from “I Wrote This for Attention” by Lukas Gage. Copyright © 2025 by Lukas Gage.  Reprinted by permission of Simon & Schuster, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tAuditioning is the most fucked-up thing you can do to an artist. You’re handed a few pieces of paper usually the night before and at 9 a.m. the next morning expected to sell your soul—with charisma. Prepandemic, it meant filing into a holding pen with your competition, all of whom look like rough drafts of you. Some are hotter, taller, or more experienced. Actually, maybe you’re a rough draft of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we all missed that room. At least you didn’t have to worry about all the technical problems of virtual meetings.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo sitting with my castmates, it only felt natural for me to show</p>\n<p>\n\tthem the audition video. I expected a few laughs. Which came. What I didn’t expect was how much it hit home.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I can’t believe you have a documented moment of how terrible actors can be treated,” Molly Shannon said.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’ve been wanting to post it, but I feel like I would, like, get canceled?”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Why would you get canceled?” somebody asked.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Or blacklisted? I don’t know. I don’t want to ruin some guy’s life?”</p>\n<p>\n\tWe stayed up talking all night, yet I was gripped with the feeling that I was peering over the edge of a cliff and trying to decide if I had the balls to jump.</p>\n<p>\n\tOutside, the sound of the waves gently crashing on the shore started to feel like they were egging me on. <em>Maybe I should write a draft of something to post. I’ll just cosplay for a second, get everything out of my system</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tI started typing out a heartfelt message full of phrases like “shed light.” Then I deleted it all. It didn’t feel right. It felt too earnest, too cheap, too insincere. So I let instinct guide me.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tpsa if youre a shit talking director make sure to mute ur shit on zoom mtgings</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was a bit too strong, but <em>fuck it</em>, I told myself.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Tweet.</em><em> </em><em>Copy.</em><em> </em><em>Paste</em>. <em>Post.</em><em></em></p>\n<p>\n\tI sat up in bed, listening to the waves growing more violent. <em>You’re such a fucking idiot</em>, they seemed to say. <em>You shouldn’t have done that.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tI tossed the phone away to the foot of the bed. For five minutes, I stayed there—naked, with the covers bunched beneath me, and my head peering over the mattress—waiting for the worst. But my phone remained silent.<em></em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Maybe</em><em> </em><em>this</em><em> </em><em>is</em><em> </em><em>going</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>be</em><em> </em><em>okay.</em><em> </em><em>This</em><em> </em><em>will</em><em> </em><em>just</em><em> </em><em>be</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em> </em><em>fun</em><em> </em><em>reminder</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>try</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>make</em><em> </em><em>this</em><em> </em><em>process</em><em> </em><em>for</em><em> </em><em>actors </em><em>a bit easier</em>, I kept repeating before finally falling asleep.</p>\n<p>\n\t“WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?” Phoebe screamed at me over the phone when I woke up a few hours later.</p>\n<p>\n\t“What do you mean? I’ve been asleep.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“LUKAS, YOU JUST DROPPED THE MOST INSANE VIRAL VIDEO AND WENT TO SLEEP?”</p>\n<p>\n\t“WHAT?”</p>\n<p>\n\t“WHAT DID I DO? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?”</p>\n<p>\n\t“This is amazing,” she said. “Joe Jonas just gave you his full-throated support.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Wait, really? Hot.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Yeah! You need to listen to me. This is a good thing. You’re like fully viral.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“What if I don’t want to be viral, though?”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Why would you not want to be viral? Especially for something so funny.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Well . . . what if they turn on me?”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Why would ‘they’ do that? They love you, and they hate him.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s a no-lose situation.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Exactly. I don’t like that. This is all getting way too out of hand. I just posted it to be funny, and now people are. . . freaking out. What if they find out who it is? I don’t want to ruin someone’s life—”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Relax. You didn’t name him. And you didn’t do anything wrong. You posted a funny audition tape.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I don’t want to be known as the viral-audition-tape guy for the rest of my career.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Lukas. People don’t have the attention span to care about anything for longer than, like, a day. Enjoy your moment in the sun, and also enjoy the literal sunshine in Hawaii.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMy phone was practically a vibrator, perpetually buzzing with notifications. Every second brought another text, call, and email.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the first few minutes, I was excited. It felt like some primal itch that had been there my whole life had finally been scratched. Every ping was a microdose of approval. The praise was coming from everywhere—Seth MacFarlane, the Jonas Brothers, people I never expected to know I existed. Strangers around the world congratulated me on how composed, strong, and brave I was. In my heart of hearts, did I believe these things were true? Well, no, but—</p>\n<p>\n\tThen, an all-consuming dread started to set in: I’d spent my whole life begging to be seen, and now they’d seen me, and I wanted to hide.</p>\n<p>\n\tI was petrified that they were going to uncover “the truth.” What “the truth” was, I didn’t exactly know, like what if a nude of me in an unflattering position suddenly surfaced online.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I was back on set, the actors were supportive and happy to see me. Some were even proud. I avoided the producers like the plague—which was exhausting, considering we were in an actual plague.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe familiar lights and sounds should’ve felt like routine. But they didn’t. All I could imagine was the discussion they’d have after work about what a liability I was. I just knew they were going to fire me and find someone else to get his ass eaten on camera.</p>\n<p>\n\tI stared at myself in the mirror, doing that cliché “splash water on your face” after something really traumatic happens. It didn’t help, it just broke my AirPods.</p>\n<p>\n\tI also got messages from other producers and directors; apparently all British people sound alike? Because they all asked me to confirm that it wasn’t them and that they didn’t deserve to be canceled. I answered some of their requests, confirming who it <em>wasn’t</em>. However, it only set off a chain reaction from strangers, demanding that I say who it was.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This</em><em> </em><em>must</em><em> </em><em>be</em><em> </em><em>what</em><em> </em><em>real</em><em> </em><em>famous</em><em> </em><em>people </em><em>feel like</em>, I thought. So I went to the most trustworthy famous person available to me, Jennifer Coolidge.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Coolidge, what the fuck did I do?” I asked, cornering her at the breakfast bar.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen she stepped away from the pressed-celery juice, and gave me the best advice I’ve ever gotten. Words I’ve lived by ever since.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Who cares?!” she said, looking at me with a cheeky, conspiratorial grin. <em>Who cares?! </em>It was like she’d just handed me the meaning of life. And in that moment, God, I believed it.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe next day, I told myself I wasn’t going to check my phone. That I’d give myself over to the universe, or whatever that meant. The moment I sat my ass in a beach chair, my phone rang. An unknown number.</p>\n<p>\n\tI ignored it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen it rang again. The same number. And again.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again—</p>\n<p>\n\t“Yes? Hello? What do you want—” I said.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Lukas, this is COVID compliance. You tested positive. Please self-quarantine for the next fourteen days, and do not come into contact with anyone.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFuck. I’d gone viral. Again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.pngtiw=639\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.png 639w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.png?resize=150,55 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Just-for-Variety-Logo-Lockup-Headshot.png?resize=300,111 300w\" /></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tMonday is usually a day of rest for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/broadway/\">Broadway</a>. But instead of catching up on sleep, this season’s biggest stars were out in force at <em>Variety’s</em> Business of Broadway Breakfast to preview the fall’s buzziest shows.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I had a really great joke about the name of this breakfast,” said Ethan Slater, who hosted Monday’s event, presented by City National Bank. “I was workshopping it, but it took, like, seven years to develop, and we’re struggling to get the funding. Hopefully next season.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSlater, the star of “Wicked: For Good” and the upcoming play “Marcel on the Train,” spoke about the close-knit theater community before he introduced the featured conversations, including “Chess” stars Lea Michele, Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher; “The Queen of Versailles” actors and creatives Kristin Chenoweth, F. Murray Abraham, Stephen Schwartz, Michael Arden and Lindsey Ferrentino; “Waiting for Godot” leads Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter”; as well as “Ragtime” stars Caissie Levy, Brandon Uranowitz, John Clay III and director Lear DeBessonet.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“What a beautiful thing it is to be a part of a community where people devote their time and energy, whether or not they’re getting paid, to creating art, to creating something that speaks to people,” Slater said. “And thank you, <em>Variety</em>, for giving this community a place to eat without having to pay the bill.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHere are four takeaways from the artists bringing some of the most exciting theater to New York.</p>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tAll the Knight Moves\t</h3>\n<p>\n\t“Chess” star Lea Michele is brushing up on the rules of the game as she prepares to debut the revival that revolves around two grandmasters who clash during the Cold War. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m reading ‘Chess for Dummies.’ I have two kids, so I’m trying to read as much as I can,” she confessed before cracking, “No reading jokes, please,” referencing an internet rumor that falsely claims she’s illiterate. “I have a lot of chess jargon I say throughout the show. I’ll look through the guide and be like, ‘Oh, that’s what that means. But don’t ask me to play chess right now.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMichele, who is co-starring in the revival with Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher, is taking on another challenge — to make “Chess,” a cult favorite that’s notoriously difficult to adapt, into a mainstream hit. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Every revival brings a history for better or worse,” she said. “We’ve seen recently revivals come back, like ‘Merrily We Roll Along.’ Sometimes it’s just the right time, right place and right people.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs she gears up to return to the stage, she won’t be too far from fellow “Glee” actors, Jonathan Groff, who plays Bobby Darin in “Just in Time,” and Darren Criss, who returning to “Maybe Happy Ending.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I haven’t been on Broadway at the same time as Jonathan in many years, so we’re very excited,” Michele said. “We’re basically neighbors. Jonathan, Darren and I are on a text chain, so we plan to get together once ‘Chess’ is up and running.”</p>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tBill & Ted, Back for More…? \t</h3>\n<p>\n\tSamuel Beckett seems far removed from Bill and Ted, the two slacker buddies that made Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter famous, but the deep friendship forged by the duo while making the 1988 comedy “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure” and its two sequels was helpful in their stage dynamic in “Waiting for Godot.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“[Director] Jamie [Lloyd] remarked that our friendship, our history together, really suits the play because of the friendship and connection that two characters have,” says Winter. </p>\n<p>\n\tAsked if they’d revive their buddy act and do a fourth “Bill & Ted” movie once their Broadway run ends in 2026, Reeves emphatically said, “Yes and yes.”</p>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tDon’t Judge a Trophy Wife by Her Couture\t</h3>\n<p>\n\tIn “Queen of Versailles,” Kristin Chenoweth had to confront her own preconception in portraying the socialite Jackie Siegel. She met the woman behind America’s most over-the-top McMansion and realized Siegel is more grounded than her Chanel pumps would suggest.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There’s a dichotomy with her. Did she marry somebody or did she work hard?” Chenoweth said. “This is just an example of who Jackie can be: I was meeting her and she had on a dress. I said, ‘I love your dress.’ That night she sent me the dress and said, ‘I couldn’t find it in your size, but maybe you can alter it.’ That took me off guard. I made an assumption about someone.” While the two have their differences, she adds, “that’s what makes the world go around.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tComposer Stephen Schwartz added that he admired Siegel’s response to having her life dramatized to song and dance.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Imagine if somebody came to you and said, ‘We’re going make a show about you. It’s going to be your name. A lot of the facts are going be your life, though not all of them. We’re going make some up, but we’re not going tell people which ones we’re making up and which ones are true. And you have no right to approve any of it.’ How many of us would be brave enough to say, ‘Sure, go ahead and do that.'”</p>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tHistory Repeats Itself\t</h3>\n<p>\n\t“Ragtime” is set in the dawn of the 20th Century, but its searing look at race relations, the immigrant experience, and political polarization isn’t too far off from America today. </p>\n<p>\n\t“There are some elements that are truthful to this society that we live in today. Sometimes systems can outlive people and democracy has a way, we would hope, of prevailing most of the time,” says John Clay III, who portrays Booker T. Washington in the musical. “But I just would love people to walk out of the theater and just pay attention to certain signs of ‘are we going backwards or are we moving forward?’ And ‘what part are we actually playing in that?'”</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst produced on Broadway in 1998, the musical is returning to the stage after three decades amid a period of unprecedented upheaval.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re in a moment of intense fatigue and almost numbness in some ways because of the inability to sustain those operatic feelings at all times,” said the show’s director Lear DeBessonet. “This is a space not just to feel something by yourself, but to actually reconnect to other in a unique space of emotion. I hope that feeds a deep human need that we all have.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dwayne-johnson/\">Dwayne Johnson</a> experienced the worst box office opening of his career with “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-smashing-machine/\">The Smashing Machine</a>,” the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/a24/\">A24</a> drama that debuted to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/taylor-swift-release-party-showgirl-box-office-debut-smashing-machine-bombs-1236540485/\">a rough $5.9 million</a> domestically. But the actor is taking the bad news in stride. Johnson posted on Instagram that “you can’t control box office results” and praised director Benny Safdie for changing his life with the film, which casts Johnson as MMA fighter Mark Kerr.</p>\n<p>\n\t“From deep in my grateful bones, thank you to everyone who has watched ‘The Smashing Machine,'” Johnson posted. “In our storytelling world, you can’t control box office results — but what I realized you can control is your performance, and your commitment to completely disappear and go elsewhere. And I will always run to that opportunity.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“It was my honor to transform in this role for my director, Benny Safdie. Thank you brother for believing in me,” Johnson added. Truth is this film has changed my life. With deep gratitude, respect and radical empathy, DJ.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs <a target=\"_blank\">reported by <em>Variety:</em></a> “‘The Smashing Machine’ cratered in third place at the box office with $5.9 million from 3,345 venues. Those ticket sales were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/taylor-swift-showgirl-projected-box-office-smashing-machine-1236534820/\">below projections of $8 million to $15 million</a> and marked a career low for Johnson, below his 2010 thriller ‘Faster’ ($8.5 million, not adjusted for inflation). It’s also a blow to A24, which spent $50 million to produce the movie — and many millions more on promotional efforts, including stops at Venice and Toronto Film Festival.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Smashing Machine” was largely acclaimed when it premiered at Venice, with Safdie winning the fest’s best director prize. Even reviews that were not favorable to the movie still praised Johnson’s leading turn, which has been widely tipped as a major contender in the Oscar race for best actor.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJohnson plays two-time UFC heavyweight champ Kerr in the true story drama opposite Emily Blunt as Kerr’s wife Dawn, Staples. The film tracks their volatile relationship amid Kerr’s professional high and lows in MMA, including his substance abuse struggles. Kerr was a mixed martial artist who fought from 1997 to 2009, winning four ADCC World Championships in his career. </p>\n<p>\n\t“The Smashing Machine” is playing in theaters nationwide from A24. </p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tHeld at southern Madrid’s Matadero, a former slaughterhouse reopened as a culture center, 2025’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/iberseries/\">Iberseries</a> & Platino Industria broke all time attendance records, surging to over 2,700 accredited participants. More than 1,500 companies were represented at the film-TV conference and market, up 50% on 2024.  </p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s good reason for that. Netflix’s Top 10 of non-English TV shows has “Billionaire’s Bunker,” from Money Heist’s Alex Pina and Esther Martínez Lobato at No. 1, “Angela,” an Atresmedia TV, “It’s stunning how Spanish titles travel, as originals and formats,” said Beta Film CEO Moritz Von Kruedener, at an Iberseries spotlight session, where he drilled down on how Beta Film has sold Spanish shows from 2011’s “Grand Hotel,” which pretty well sold out the world.   \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tGlobal streaming services have also taken note. In 2024, global streamers poured €2.0 billion ($2.2 billion) into Spanish original content — second only to the U.K. at €2.9 billion ($3.1 billion), and far above France and Germany (€0.8 billion – $860 million each) or Italy (€0.7 billion – $750 million), according to the European Audiovisual Observatory.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cost of production has hardly come down. Shows still have to cut through an inordinate clutter of offers in post-peak TV. </p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is the age of collaboration. Current international TV business is “about trying to find common interests, what could work and travel between different countries. That’s why there are different alliances and forums of trying, you know, to to see what can make sense because it needs to work for more than one country, Al De Azpiazu, SVP Distribution, Fremantle said at an Iberseries panel. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Windowing is the only way to make an asset and the only way to make something stand out,” added David Atlan-Jackson, CCO, Vuelta Entertainment      </p>\n<p>\n\tBoth require on-site acquaintance, making TV meets-marts, if they catch fire, ever more popular. 10 Takes at 2025’s Iberseries & Platino Industria, which ran Sept. 30-Oct. 3.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Disney+: The Pivot</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t“To amp up our local presence, we’re looking for co-productions and acquisitions,” Sofía Fábregas, VP, Original Production, Disney Plus+ Spain, explained at a Iberseries keynote, saying it was already advancing on two co-production. Disney+ will also drive into theatrical feature film production, co-financing around four movies a year. Fábregas noted. The announcement comes just weeks after Disney+ and Atresmedia struck what they described as a landmark deal, granting Disney+ access to 300 hours of <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/atresmedia/\" target=\"_blank\">Atresmedia</a> content, presented under an Atresplayer label. Titles include hit “Mar afuera,” “La Voz” and daily series “Sueños de Libertad.” As in the U.K., where it is now licensing ITVX shows, and in Germany, partnering with ZDF, Disney +’s days of sourcing local content via 100% owned global originals look truly over.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Buzz Titles</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSet for global release by Prime Video on Oct. 31, supernatural thriller “Cometierra,” created by Daniel Burman, received a rousing reception at an Iberseries & Platino Industria panel as did another powerful Mediapro Studio series, “Raza Brava,” from Hernán Caffiero (“The Suspended Mourning”), about the rise and ethical fall of the head of a Colo Colo soccer club fan gang.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was great word also on “The Anatomy of a Moment,” about how democracy was won and almost lost in Spain over 1976-81, premiered to acclaim at San Sebastián. Beta Fiction Spain walked an audience through “Cronos,” a high-stakes terrorist manhunt thriller based on real-life police reaction to 2017 Barcelona terrorist attacks which looked like one of the potential big Spanish movies of 2026. Mediterráneo Mediaset’s “La Agencia,” a makeover of France’s “Call My Agent,” and Atresmedia’s “The Maid’s Daughter” look like major Mipcom plays from Spain.  </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Streaming Services Out in Force</strong>\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney+’s shift was the largest strategic announcement from a streamer at Iberseries. Elsewhere, however, the streaming services were out in force. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/movistar-plus-2/\">Movistar Plus+</a>, the biggest Spanish pay TV/SVOD operator, confirmed 35 international sales deals, led by “La Mesias,” “Querer,” “The New Years” and “Marbella.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn stage at Iberseries, SkyShowtime Chief Content Officer Kai Finke unveiled a new show, “<a href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/the-tribute/\" target=\"_blank\">The Tribute</a>,” (“El homenaje”), a new family crime thriller, created by Sergio Casanovas and re-teaming SkyShowtime Spain, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/secuoya/\">Secuoya</a>, Stellarmedia and much of the cast of “Shades,” though in new roles. Showrunner Daniel Burman presented “Cometierra,” made by Oficina Burman, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cimarron-2/\">Cimarrón</a> and Exile Content Studio for Prime Video Mexico.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Co-Production: The Go to Option</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIberseries & Platino Industria’s single biggest deal: A Telemundo Studios-<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/the-mediapro-studio/\">The Mediapro Studio</a> U.S. & Canada strategic alliance to develop and produce original films for U.S. Hispanic audiences and beyond. The partners had just announced Spanish-language romcom “Atrápelo quien pueda,” teaming with Mexico’s Cinepolis. At another spotlight session, Secuoya Studios presented its latest wave of international production partners: BlackBox Multimedia (U.K.), Make it Happen Studios, (France), Act4 (Iceland) and Permanent Wave Productions (U.S.). “Together, we will continue to set new standards for top level production in the industry,” said Telemundo Studios head Javier Pons. Without co-production, that’s becoming a big ask.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Gaumont USA Drives Into IP</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFounded in 1895, and now turning 130, France’s Gaumont is the oldest film studio in the world, with a host of hits down the decades way before “Lupin.” Most, moreover, are movies. It is now putting that to good use. At Iberseries & Platino Industria, Gaumont USA unveiled new projects with Kate del Castillo’s Cholawood – action thriller “Point Blank” and buddy comedy “La Chef,” from Noé Santillán-López, behind 2025 mega hit “Gift Table,” both starring Del Castillo – plus “Las Wannabes,” with cast head by “How to Get Away With Murder” star Karla Souza. In Brazil, it also unveiled “Me Engana Que Eu Gosto,” to be directed by Pedro Amorim. All four titles adapt Gaumont modern movie classics, and play off Gaumont USA’s still excellent relationships with streamers which are moving ever more into movie production as well as Gaumont’s top-notch talent relations. “Our aim is to partner with the best writers, directors, actors, talent and producers in each of those countries,” said Gaumont USA President Nicolas Atlan, who delivered a first day keynote at Iberseries.   \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Germany’s Beta Film: Still Looking to Spain </strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBeta Film announced at Iberseries that it has boarded Secuoya Studios’ romantic action thriller “Under a Volcano” and crime thriller “Road to Arcadia,’ both starring William Levy, slotting into a two-title three-way deal between Secuoya, William Levy Entertainment and TelevisaUnivision streamer ViX. The deal continues Beta Film’s multi-milestone sales relationship with Spain, featuring landmark deals on titles – “Grand Hotel” and “Velvet”  – or with series from game-changing Spanish creators, such as Alex Pina and Esther Martínez Lobato on “The Pier.” Beta Film and Movistar Plus+ signed a three-year production and distribution deal in 2019. “The key is a personal contact with creative talent, plus IPs, Beta Film CEO Von Kruedener said at an Iberseries & Platino Industria spotlight.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>TV Markets Are Foreign Lands….</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThey do things differently there, in some territories, at least, suggested a GECA study presented at Iberseries. In Europe and Latin America, the U.K. ruled over the 2024-25 season, bowing 95 new scripted series over Sept. 1 2024 – Aug. 31, 2025 followed by France (81), Mexico (69), Germany (66) and Spain (60), noted GECA’s Gloria Saló. Free-to-air channels dominate output levels in most European big markets, led by the BBC in the U.K., France’s TF1, Germany’s ZDFneo and Italy’s RaiUno.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Mexico, however, SVOD operators, headed by Netflix and Disney+, dominated new series numbers. Likewise Spain, where SVOD services repped 42 of the 60 new series released, driven by Netflix, Atresplayer Premium, Disney+ and Movistar Plus+. Sweden stands out for the power of VOD channels, led by SVT Play, Poland for its vibrant streaming scene, led by 16 scripted series premieres, principally from Netflix, HBO and SkyShowtime.    </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Facilitating Sustainability: Banijay Iberia, Mrs Greenfilm</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAt another Iberseries session, Banijay Iberia and Mrs Greenfilm presented a “Practical Eco Management Guide,” collecting best practice from shoots and sets, often made in response to the demands of public administrations, broadcasters and streamers, and drilling down on current standards and certifications. “Our commitment to building a more sustainable audiovisual industry is a fact. Productions such as ‘Operación Triunfo’ or the trilogy that began with ‘Culpa Mía’ are already pioneers in this field, and that is the path we aspire to in all our projects,” said Pilar Blasco, Banijay Iberia CEO. “That’s no small matter. Banijay Iberia comprises nine companies including Spanish industry leaders DLO Producciones, Pookepsie Films, Shine Iberia, Portocabo and Diagonal TV. Parent Banijay Entertainment owns over 130 companies in 23 territories. Launched in 2021, Mrs Greenfilm has already worked on 200 productions. Larger sustainability at least is a gathering reality.   \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What People View: Thrillers, But Watch Out for the Micro Drama Boom </strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAmong scripted series, thrillers dominate pretty much everywhere in Europe in the number of new bows. In the U.K., dramas, especially 6-8 episode thrillers, repped nearly 50% of bows, with mini-series, above all real event based, were No. 2, said GECA’s Gloria Saló. In Germany, thrillers, cop shows and YA comedies rule the output roost. Thrillers are Spain and Italy’s most popular genre, Saló noted. Latin America does things differently. The biggest number of new series in Colombia, in contrast, however, are now micro dramas released on smart phone apps in vertical formats, either adapting titles from broadcaster Caracol or dedicated U.S. titles on ReelShort. In Mexico, micro-dramas are booming, led by ViX Micro, mostly romantic micro novelas.        </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Deals</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA score announced at Iberseries & Platino Industria:</p>\n<p>\n\t*<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/eugenio-derbez/\">Eugenio Derbez</a> and wife, actress-singer Alessandra Rosaldo announced on stage at Iberseries the launch of Studio DRBZ, a content venture to create original material for digital platforms, where Derbez parents will partner with the three adult children, Aislinn Derbez, José Eduardo Derbez and Vadhir Derbez.

One year later, and the dark olive green — Elphaba’s skin color in the beloved musical — is once again splashed atop everything from sweatpants and nail polish to shoulder bags and sunglasses ahead of the adaptation’s second installment.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ariana-grande/\">Ariana Grande</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cynthia-erivo/\">Cynthia Erivo</a> star as Glinda and Elphaba, respectively, in the long-awaited “Wicked: For Good”, set to release next month. And Universal isn’t wasting any time marketing the film with as much fervor as they did the first time around.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“We live in an environment where monoculture doesn’t happen in the way it used to,” Universal chief marketing officer Michael Moses told <em>Variety</em> during the marketing onslaught ahead of the first film. “So, you have to be everywhere.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, like any high-saturation marketing moment, not every piece of merch or branded apparel is worth the buy. Sometimes brands agree to a partnership to make sure they’re a part of the cultural conversation, but care less about the tangible product they put out. Plus, brands know there are enough “Wicked”-heads to fly any green and pink-hued limited-edition merch off the shelves no matter the product. </p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, there are actually some really<em> good </em>“Wicked” merch that will likely stand the test of time beyond this fleeting Blockbuster moment.

Shot at his home, the campaign captures the quarterback in candid, approachable moments as he tries on the pants, pieces designed for comfort, versatility and effortless style.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe pants take the spotlight, but the campaign also hints at the rest of <a href=\"https://go.linkby.com/JDENXUYQ/\" target=\"_blank\">TravisMathew’s</a> seasonal lineup, including lightweight jackets, knit polo and layering staples that define the brand’s signature easygoing, playful aesthetic. Garoppolo’s natural, relaxed demeanor brings the collection to life, showing that TravisMathew isn’t just about performance-inspired apparel — it’s about clothes you actually want to live in.\n\t</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://go.linkby.com/JDENXUYQ/collections/mens-fall-edit\" target=\"_blank\">TravisMathew</a> has long embraced a playful, laidback approach to lifestyle apparel, blending golf-inspired performance with casual, everyday wear. Their latest Fall drop continues that philosophy. The brand is also a favorite among athletes and entertainers who regularly appear at the American Century Championship, from the Kelce brothers to former tennis pro Mardy Fish, as well as comedians and actors like Nate Bargatze and Michael Peña.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what make the brand a magnet for athletes and Hollywood stars? It’s the personality baked into the brand. TravisMathew doesn’t take itself too seriously. lts campaigns lean into humor, its ambassadors feel authentic and its clothes are designed to keep pace with real life. Stretchy, buttery-soft fabrics and moisture-wicking polos check the performance boxes, but it’s the playful, easygoing spirit that makes the label stand out. In a menswear space often crowded with basics, TravisMathew makes everyday essentials feel like elevated staples.</p>\n\t<h2>\n\t\t<a

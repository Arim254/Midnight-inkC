    "body": "\n\tTaylor Swift has released the official trailer for her upcoming Disney+ special “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show,” releasing on December 12.\n\n\tThe film will be a full concert experience captured during the final show of her tour in Vancouver, B.C., featuring the entire set of “The Tortured Poets Department” for the first time. That portion of the show was added to the tour following the album’s release in April 2024. Fans were able to watch an earlier iteration of the “Eras Tour” theatrical film on Disney+ before those songs were added to the tour set list.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve had so long to prepare for the end of this tour and we get to play one last show for you here tonight,” says Swift in the trailer, which shows her performing “Long Live.” “I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date.”\n\n\n\tIn addition to the release of “The Final Show,” Swift is planning to drop the first two episodes of her six-part docuseries “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era,” also on December 12. That series has been described as “an intimate look at Taylor’s life as her tour made headlines and thrilled fans around the world.” Opening tour acts, including Gracie Abrams and Sabrina Carpenter, will appear in the series, as will guests Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch. Following the first episode releases, two additional batches of two episodes will be released in the following weeks.\n\n\t“Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era” is directed by Don Argott, co-directed by Sheena M. Joyce and produced by Object & Animal. “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show,” meanwhile, is directed by Glenn Weiss and produced by Taylor Swift Productions in association with Silent House Productions.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the official trailer below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesian director Yosep Anggi Noen (“The Redemption of Sin”) is bringing Leila S. Chudori’s acclaimed novel The Sea Speaks His Name” (Laut Bercerita) to the screen. \n\n\tThe ensemble cast features Reza Rahadian, Dian Sastrowardoyo, Yunita Siregar, Eva Celia, Christine Hakim and Arswendy Beningswara.\n\n\tThe film, unveiled at the JAFF Market, is currently in production through PAL8 Pictures in cooperation with VMS Studio, Jagartha, Lynx Films and Brandlink, centers on the Wibisono family whose eldest son, Biru Laut, vanishes during the 1990s. While parents Arya Wibisono and his wife maintain hope their son survives, daughter Asmara Jati becomes convinced her brother is gone.\n\t\n\n\tSet against Indonesia’s democracy movement of the 1990s, the narrative follows university student Biru Laut, whose commitment to justice leads him into the Winatra group, a secret circle of activists writing and speaking in defiance of authoritarian rule. The story unfolds through dual perspectives: Laut’s own voice, characterized by poetry and idealism, and his sister Asmara Jati’s later search for traces of her disappeared brother among families still waiting for answers.\n\n\n\t“This is not a conventional love story – it is a narrative of young people holding onto their principles, to speak of their voices,” Noen said. The filmmaker emphasized that resistance transcends time, belonging to all generations.\n\n\tNoen is adapting source material that has been reprinted over 120 times, with approximately 700,000 book copies sold and an expected readership of 1.4 million. The production will incorporate period visual markers including demonstrations, mass movements and underground meetings set against popular music of the era, along with fashion, communication technology and entertainment icons designed to emphasize parallels with contemporary youth.\n\t\n\n\t“In a world where history is buried beneath misinformation, propaganda, and digital echo chambers, fiction becomes essential,” Noen noted, describing the approach as extracting real events and reconstructing them to ignite curiosity.\n\n\tBehind the camera, the production team includes producer Gita Fara, co-scriptwriters Chudori and Noen, cinematographer Batara Goempar, production designer Ahmad Zulkarnaen, editor Dinda Amanda, costume designer Retno Ratih Damayanti and makeup designer Aktris Handrajasa.\n\n\tPAL8 Pictures, a production house under Tempo Media Group with over 50 years in the press industry, is making its feature debut with the project before moving forward with additional titles. The company aims to produce films relevant to societal issues, including stories with social or historical backgrounds.\n\n\tCo-producers include VMS (Visual Media Studio), known for titles including “Pemandu Jenazah,” “Assalamualaikum Baitullah,” “Maryam: Janji dan Jiwa yang Terikat” and “Penerbangan Terakhir”; Jagartha Group, recognized as a pioneer in film financing in Indonesia with credits including “Mencuri Raden Saleh,” “Jatuh Cinta Seperti di Film-Film,” “Agak Laen” and “Sore: Istri dari Masa Depan”; and Lynx Films, founded in 2004 and known for collaborations with director Garin Nugroho on “Samsara,” with recent short films “Pulang” and “Galura Tropikalia Alive” selected as entries at this year’s Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival.\n\n\tThe production is targeting a third quarter 2026 release.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGuillermo del Toro shared an emphatic message about artificial intelligence in filmmaking while accepting the Vanguard Tribute for “Frankenstein” at Monday night’s Gotham Awards: “Fuck AI.”\n\n\tFlanked by stars Jacob Elordi and Oscar Isaac, de Toro opened his acceptance speech by paying homage to Mary Shelley’s immortal horror story. Del Toro said when he first picked up the book at age 11, he knew he would one day adapt it to film.\n\n\n\t“I understood that back then, through her work and the first glimpse of Boris Karloff, that I did not belong in the world the way my parents, the way the world expected me to fit,” de Toro said. “That my place was in a faraway land inhabited only by monsters and misfits. They have been my kin ever since.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “So to return to this tale now at 61 with artists as extraordinary as Oscar and Jacob has been truly one of the greatest privileges of my life, and in them, I found another family.”\n\n\tAfter brief remarks from Elordi and Isaac, del Toro returned to the podium to honor the artisans who handcrafted the world of “Frankenstein” and to denounce AI in Hollywood.\n\n\t“I’d like to tell the rest of our extraordinary cast and our crew that the artistry of all of them shines on every single frame of this film that was willfully made by humans, for humans,” del Toro added. “The designers, builders, make-up, wardrobe team, cinematographers, composers, editors, this tribute belongs to all of them. I would like to extend our gratitude and say: Fuck AI.”\n\n\tDel Toro’s “Frankenstein” premiered in August at the Venice Film Festival, where it received a rapturous 13-minute standing ovation. The film premiered on Netflix on Oct. 17. Come Oscar time, “Frankenstein” is expected to compete in nine categories, including best picture, best supporting actor for Elordi, best adapted screenplay and best production design. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Heated Rivalry” creator Jacob Tierney said during a recent interview with Xtra that the real-life sexualities of his stars are irrelevant compared to the “enthusiasm and willingness” they bring to HBO’s new queer, sports drama series.\n\n\t“I don’t think there’s any reason to get into that stuff,” Tierney said when asked if the sexualities of stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie are relevant to the show. “I’ll tell you something about the casting of both of these roles. You can’t ask questions like that when you’re casting, right? It’s actually against the law. So what you have to gauge is somebody’s enthusiasm and willingness to do the work.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “And that’s what’s so impressive about both of these guys is they came into this being like, ‘Yeah, we’re here to do this, and we are here to make this story feel authentic and to be as real as possible.’ And they fucking hit it out of the park.”\n\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” stars Williams and Storrie as emerging hockey pros Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov, respectively. Despite playing for rival teams, the pair develops a romance off the ice.\n\n\tWilliams recently told Out Magazine that his chemistry with Storrie has an intense and unexpected authenticity unrivaled by other potential co-stars.\n\n\t“I read with one other possible Ilya, and it was good. But something about Connor,” he said. “There was an inexplicable X-factor that just felt realer than what I thought it could possibly be. And that was something. I had a quote I told Jacob, at one point, about my read with Connor in particular.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the same interview, Tierney recalled meeting with Williams after the fact: “Hudson told me, ‘The other guy was good, but Connor felt like he was going to pin me down and fuck me,’” later adding, “That is literally what he said. And I was like, ‘Well, I think I cast this right.’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tVisinema — the studio behind Indonesian and Southeast Asia’s all-time animated box-office champ “Jumbo” — used its JAFF Market platform to urge the country’s entertainment sector to prioritise long-term IP creation, with CEO Herry B. Salim calling for a shift away from one-off projects and for stronger government support to help local players compete globally.\n\n\t“When we talk about evergreen IPs it’s not just an end product we try to sell. It’s about storytelling [as its medium] in creating a sustainable creative ecosystem,” he told Variety. “When they create a storytelling product, they have to think of IP and not merely a one-off anything.”\n\t\n\n\tAt the JAFF Market Visinema booth over a mini talkshow regarding the future of Indonesian film industry, Salim discussed how much more mainstream film products are; so far as to say it’ll become “similar to FMGC [Fast-moving consumer goods].” “The way people consume these [film] ‘goods’ will definitely be up to par,” he added.\n\n\n\tWith how fast the industry is growing, Salim emphasized the importance of not only becoming consumers of the film products itself but to dare to compete globally. “Sure we consume so much of foreign products. But what do we get from just consuming them?”\n\n\tSalim firmly believes in the strength of creating entire IPs, and calls upon the desired support coming from the government as well. Malaysia’s animation industry has been proven to flourish since the Digital Economy Corporation created a grant program for digital content creation including the production of animated motion pictures. He said, “If you produce an animation movie in Malaysia, the government grants a portion of its cost. How can we flourish and compete with a program as such, if not through the same support systems?”\n\t\n\n\t“We have to understand who our viewers are,” Salim added. The studio revealed the teaser for “Na Willa (2026)” at their booth at the second year of JAFF Market. The release of the film was previously unveiled in November with the team behind animation hit “Jumbo” reuniting.\n\n\tThe studio’s upcoming feature carries on the essence of its previous hit counterpart, as it highlights its tagline “For us, our children, and the inner child within us.” This theme is a significant part of Visinema’s DNA, according to Salim. “It’s about storytelling that matters.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt a JAFF Market panel, leading creators from Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea argued that Asian animation is shifting into a higher gear, driven by breakout hits like Visinema’s ‘Jumbo,’ Malaysia’s expanding teen-leaning storytelling and Korea’s growing global ambitions. \n\n\tAcross the board, panelists stressed that the region now needs scale, investment and better distribution pipelines to meet surging demand for quality animation.\n\t\n\n\tMalaysian marketing firms have made it possible for the country to investigate narratives in animation. These include slice-of-life neighborhood tales in “Upin & Ipin” to stories like “Boboi Boy” and “Ejen Ali,” which tackle issues of grief and beyond. \n\n\n\tIn Malaysia, animation has evolved topics appropriate for viewers aged 13 and up, rather than just 12 and under. Ahmad Izham Omar, chief explorer at Malaysia’s Komet Production, described the upcoming animated comedy series “Kisah Bawah Tanah” as “something new, giving them a sense of entering adulthood.”\n\n\tDespite the success of Visinema’s “Jumbo,” which has screened in more than 40 countries and is the highest grossing motion picture in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, Indonesia is a relative newcomer to the animation industry. “Not only is it new [in the film industry locally]. How can we make it sustainable?,” Visinema chief content officer Anggia Kharisma said at the panel.\n\n\t“The ‘Jumbo’ production team consists of more than 420 individuals. It has created fresh opportunities for the future of Indonesian film,” she continued. “We’re taking fresh approaches to delivering products made for kids and families. As a mother, I worry about the material that Indonesian children are exposed to. We are not attempting to dictate to children how or what they should feel. However, create stories that help them to grow.”\n\t\n\n\tAt the moment, the content available digitally is widely scattered and unfiltered throughout Indonesia, she said. With so many different types of digital material available today, the way to provide inspiring and aspirational content is “building a rainbow bridge to connect us with stories that matter requires consciousness,” Kharisma said.\n\n\t“‘Jumbo’ took nearly seven years to create,” Kharisma said. “We need the ecosystem [investors] and distribution partners to believe in us, in our stories, because the best business plan is in the quality itself.”\n\n\tOver in South Korea, with a budget of more than $20 million, “Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarves” was a very ambitious production, said Suh Young-joo, CEO of the country’s Finecut. \n\n\t“Korean animators have plenty of dilemmas in creating animation. It’s expanding to wider audiences more than ever now,” Suh added. “To know the market [globally] helps us understand what the domestic market can compete with as well.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a major copyright case, the Supreme Court on Monday heard arguments about whether internet providers can be blamed for their customers’ acts of digital piracy.\n\n\tCox Communications, the cable provider, appealed a lower court ruling in favor of Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group and other labels. The record companies sued Cox in 2018, alleging that its users had illegally downloaded some 10,000 songs, and that the cable provider had ignored repeated complaints about it.\n\t\n\n\tAt trial, the jury awarded the labels $1 billion. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court’s ruling on willful contributory infringement, but overturned on another theory of infringement and ordered a new trial on damages — which Cox estimates could rise as high as $1.5 billion.\n\n\n\tIn its appeal to the Supreme Court, Cox argued that merely providing internet service to users who illegally downloaded songs was not enough to establish secondary liability under copyright law.\n\n\tThe Motion Picture Association and the Electronic Frontier Foundation — traditional antagonists on copyright matters — took opposing sides in amicus briefs. The MPA, which represents seven Hollywood studios, argued that the threat of liability encourages service providers to take anti-piracy measures.\n\n\t“If this Court were to embrace Cox’s theory, the existing safeguards against ubiquitous piracy could crumble,” the MPA wrote in its brief.\n\n\tThe EFF, meanwhile, warned that the lower court ruling, if allowed to stand, could make service providers so fearful of liability that they might cut off internet access for millions of innocent users.\n\t\n\n\tSome of the justices appeared skeptical of Cox’s arguments, noting that the labels had repeatedly alerted the company to illegal downloads by particular IP addresses.\n\n\t“You know that a particular location is infringing, and most of the time you’re doing nothing,” said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. “Why aren’t you contributing to that infringement?”\n\n\tJoshua Rosenkranz, representing Cox, argued that the company is a good corporate citizen that takes affirmative steps to combat piracy. But Justice Elena Kagan noted that Cox’s theory would immunize the company regardless of its anti-piracy efforts. \n\n\t“As I understand your argument, it could be the worst corporate citizen of all time and still it doesn’t matter that there would be no liability?” she asked.\n\n\tA couple of the conservative justices warned about expanding the scope of liability for infringement, suggesting that such policy matters should be left up to Congress.\n\n\t“Congress still hasn’t defined the contours of what secondary liability should look like,” said Justice Neil Gorsuch. “Here, we are debating them, right? So shouldn’t that be a flag of caution for us in expanding it too broadly?”\n\n\tPaul Clement, who represented Sony, was pushed on the potential consequences of a ruling in Sony’s favor. Justice Samuel Alito suggested that a provider might have to cut off access to an entire university to punish a handful infringers on campus.\n\n\t“I really don’t see how your position works in that context,” Alito said.\n\n\tAfter some back-and-forth, Clement said, “the ISP is supposed to sort of have a conversation with the university.”\n\n\tAlito suggested that it would be impossible for the university to police its students’ internet behavior in order to maintain service.\n\n\t“I just don’t see how it’s workable at all,” he said.\n\n\tSotomayor suggested a possible rule by which providers would be liable for refusing to cut off infringing households, but would not be liable for larger accounts, like universities.\n\n\tGorsuch, meanwhile, pushed for a narrower ruling — either limiting the scope of secondary liability, or by simply finding in Cox’s favor.\n\n\t“Obviously, I prefer door number 3,” Clement said.\n",

Zach Bryan resisted when they used one of his songs on a promo video ... even the Pokémon company objected to that treatment.\n      \n    \n          Sabrina has yet to say anything regarding the video ... we've reached out to her camp for comment, so far no word back.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Sabrina Carpenter\n              \n                          \n                ICE\n              \n                          \n                Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Engelmayer says Netflix and its CEO Ted Sarandos are screwing him over by misappropriating footage Diddy's been recording since he was 19 years old. Diddy's rep says the footage was meant for him to \"tell his own story, in his own way.\"\n      \n    \n          What's more, Engelmayer claims ... \"Netflix is plainly desperate to sensationalize every minute of Mr. Combs's life, without regard for truth, in order to capitalize on a never-ending media frenzy.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          The rep adds ... \"If Netflix cared about truth or about Mr. Combs's legal rights, it would not be ripping private footage out of context -- including conversations with his lawyers that were never intended for public viewing. No rights in that material were ever transferred to Netflix or any third party.\"\n      \n    \n          50 Cent's been known to troll Diddy on social media, and Diddy's pissed 50 is involved in the docuseries, \"Sean Combs: The Reckoning.\"\n      \n    \n          Engelmayer says ... \"It is equally staggering that Netflix handed creative control to Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson -- a longtime adversary with a personal vendetta who has spent too much time slandering Mr. Combs.\"\n      \n    \n          Bottom line for Diddy's camp ... \"Beyond the legal issues, this is a personal breach of trust. Mr. Combs has long respected Ted Sarandos and admired the legacy of Clarence Avant. For Netflix to give his life story to someone who has publicly attacked him for decades feels like an unnecessary and deeply personal affront. At minimum, he expected fairness from people he respected.\"\n      \n    \n          Shots fired!!!\n      \n      ",

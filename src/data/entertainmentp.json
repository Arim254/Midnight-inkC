    "body": "\n\tIce-T recently told “The Breakfast Club” (via Entertainment Weekly) why he swapped the lyrics from his 1992 track “Cop Killer” to “ICE Killer” during a live performance. The Grammy winner explained that when he first did it during a Los Angeles show in July, it wasn’t a premeditated change.\n\n\t“I have political things I think about,” Ice-T said. “Now when I did that, that didn’t happen just recently. It happened when we played in L.A. at the Warped Tour. When I was there, ICE was active out there. So it’s like, I’m in the midst of ICE raids and stuff like that, and I’m in front of an L.A. audience, and it just came out. I didn’t know I was gonna do it.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “My brain just said, ‘Do “ICE Killer.”‘ And it went over.”\n\n\tTensions with ICE have been at an all-time high in the U.S. following the killing of two American citizens at the hands of federal agents: Minnesota residents Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Ice-T maintained that whether he says “Cop Killer” or “ICE Killer,” the message is the same. He said of the song’s purpose, “I’m just protesting.”\n\n\t“I think we’re headed to some really ugly terrain,” he said. “And Black people really ain’t got nothing to do with it. It’s bad. I think the moment somebody shoots an ICE agent, it’s gonna get bad.”\n\n\tDespite protesting with his music, Ice-T said the only ones who should have any authority on social issues are the people “that really carry it with them daily.”\n\n\t“If that’s who you are. If it’s not, don’t do it for publicity. Don’t do it for hype,” he said. “Don’t let your publicist tell you, ‘Speak on this topic.’ Because if you’re not educated enough to speak on it, you’re going to end up caught out there.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTaking a breather from the imperiling of Gerard Butler — their latest collaboration “Greenland 2: Migration” opened just three weeks ago — director Ric Roman Waugh puts Jason Statham through a similar action wringer in “Shelter.” This mix of espionage intrigue, shoot-outs and rather rote sentimentality has the star as a recluse revealed as a fugitive, who then must flee an army of deadly pursuers while protecting a teenaged innocent (Bodhi Rae Breathnach from “Hamnet”). None of these elements feel very fresh, least of all in Ward Parry’s formulaic screenplay. But they’re executed with sufficient slick professionalism to make for a passable if unmemorable diversion. \n\t\n\n\tA man we eventually learn is called Mason (Statham) lives alone on an otherwise uninhabited small island in the Outer Hebrides off Scotland’s west coast. His presence is a mystery; the lighthouse one initially assumes he maintains has been inoperable for years. All he seems to do is drink, play chess with himself, and accept weekly deliveries of supplies (mostly booze) from the owner of a fishing trawler (Michael Shaeffer) and his orphaned niece Jessie (Breathnach). She grows irked that this surly, stand-offish stranger refuses any overture of friendliness. Yet they’re thrown together soon enough, when she and her uncle get caught in a storm. Mason has to rescue the girl, then tell her that her only remaining relative has drowned. At first she fears she is now some creep’s captive, as her host is evasive about returning to the mainland. But he has other reasons for that wariness.\n\t\n\n\tForced to visit a pharmacy himself in order to treat her wounds, Mason is spotted by the pervasive hidden spyware that’s just gotten the Prime Minister (Harriet Walter) and current MI6 chief Manafort (Bill Nighy) in hot water with Parliament. To quell that scandal around governmental invasion of public privacy, Manafort agrees to “retire.” Nonetheless, he orders a full assault team to track and exterminate this newly-found “most wanted” criminal, a purported international terrorist. Heavy armed hordes sporting night-vision gear invade the island — only to find it booby-trapped, their prey quite capable of dispatching the lot single-handedly. However, surviving that immediate crisis only means Mason must flee with the now equally-imperiled Jessie, trying to stay one step ahead of various hunting parties.\n\n\tThey include both legit law enforcement and “rogue” units under Manafort’s direction. It doesn’t take long for two of his more principled subordinates (Naomi Ackie, Celine Buckens) to realize Mason is no terrorist, but a onetime M16 agent framed by former colleagues for the offense of refusing some particularly dastardly commands. Now of course those ex-allies want him — and anyone unlucky enough to cross his path — dead in order to keep their own past misdeeds covered up. \n\n\tThis “Bourne”-like premise, hinging on a near-unkillable protagonist whose existence incriminates corrupt state officials, doesn’t develop much intricacy in Parry’s script. Instead, it simply provides an excuse to lunge from one action setpiece to another. Everywhere man and child seek safety becomes the scene of a siege: A farmhouse, a former colleague’s (Daniel Mays) rural home, eventually a private London nightclub. \n\n\tHeavy on bullets, knives, miscellaneous household items (not excluding a nailgun) and punches thrown, these violent sequences are vigorous and stunt-filled. But they lack the conceptual or staging novelty to linger in the mind. And between melees, we’re stuck trying to believe in or care about the evolving bond between brusque loner Mason and needy adolescent Jessie, which does not benefit from pedestrian dialogue or flat character psychology. \n\n\tStatham, as ever, has scant trouble convincing us he’d be able to thwart an endless line of lethal assailants. Waugh keeps the tone sober enough to prevent that from growing ludicrous, however short on credibility this story may be in general. But the cocksure authority that makes this actor so effective an action figure does little to sell the glibly penned “parental” dynamic between leads. Breathnach, who played ill-fated Hamnet’s older sister and here resembles adolescent Saoirse Ronan, is trapped by a part that requires little more than cowering and whining. The highly capable support cast (also featuring Bryan Vigier as Manafort’s most dogged hitman) likewise can’t do much to elevate routinely conceived roles, with Nighy punching the clock as a stock villain. \n\t\n\n\tStill, “Shelter” has energy, good pacing, and solid production values…even if neither style or content achieve the distinguishing personality that might make you remember this generically-titled entertainment a week later. Irish locations stand in for some purported Scottish ones in Martin Ahlgren’s widescreen cinematography. (Closing credits thank 1970s celebrity psychic Uri Geller for “filming at Lamb Island,” the tiny land mass he owns, and has claimed hides buried ancient Egyptian treasure.) David Buckley, composer for Waugh’s last several films, contributes a score that’s functional if nondescript until it moves into thumping techno terrain for the last reel. \n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 14, Episode 4 of “The Masked Singer,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Night,” which aired Jan. 28 on Fox.\n\n\tC",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 14, Episode 4 of “The Masked Singer,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Night,” which aired Jan. 28 on Fox.\n\n\tCowabunga, dude. “The Masked Singer” sent home its latest notable on Wednesday during “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Night.” Unmasked on the episode was comedian Claudia Oshry, from the popular Instagram account @GirlWithNoJob and podcast “The Toast.”\n\n\n\tOshry ended her run as Queen Corgi, after performing “Unstoppable,” by Sia on this week’s episode. (She had previously performed “Don’t Rain on My Parade,” by Barbara Streisand, in the Season 14 premiere episode.) But instead of being eliminated, Oshry/Queen Corgi announced that she was stepping down from the competition.\n\t\n\n\tOshry told Variety that she decided to bow out of the show after she realized the time commitment was impacting her role as a new mother. “I moved my whole family out there,” she said. “I had a four-month-old at the time. I was breastfeeding exclusively. I was pumping in the trailer, and it really started to take its toll. I was spending a lot of time away from my baby. That’s just not what I thought it was going to be. I was having so much fun, but I was so conflicted between continuing on and, obviously winning, and being at home with my baby. Ultimately, I decided that after some my performances, this has fulfilled a dream. This has checked the box. I’ve sung on national TV, I did what I came here to do. And so that’s when I was like, ‘You know what, I think I can go out, let somebody else win.’ And go out gracefully.”\n\t\n\n\tGiven the unusual end to the episode, there wasn’t even a final guess from panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg, Ken Jeong and Rita Ora. Earlier, Jeong thought it was Amy Schumer, Ora guessed Ali Wong, and Thicke went with Whitney Cummings.\n\n\tOshry said she informed the producers about her desire to exit early — but that the panelists were not informed. “I can say everyone was so supportive, pretty much,” she said. “The producers, the execs, everyone who I worked with were mostly women. One of them was even pregnant. So I felt like I was chatting with people who understood, and they were really eager to make me comfortable. They told me that this was an option. And I was like, You know what? I think that would work for me. I think it would work for the show. I didn’t want to be super disruptive to the flow of the show, because they know how it works. But I also just wanted to prioritize my experience and myself. I feel like we came to a really good place of it. And I think it ended kind of storybook.”\n\n\tThis reps the second time that a “Masked Singer” decided to unmask rather than wait to be eliminated; in Season 4, Mickey Rourke decided to take off his costume on his own after a performance.\n\n\tCelebrating the 40th anniversary of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” the night opened with Jeong singing along to the franchise’s theme song — which means, coincidentally, that songwriter Chuck Lorre will now be getting a check from the show.\n\n\tGalaxy Girl, Stingray, Cat Witch and 14 Karat Carrot join Pugcasso, Snow Cone and Crane in moving on to the next round. Still waiting their turn: High Voltage, Calla Lily, Owl and Eggplant.\n\n\tClaudia Oshry (Queen Corgi) joins Taraji P. Henson (Scarab), Tone Loc (Handyman), Tiffany Haddish (Le Who Who), Todd and Julie Chrisley (Croissants) and David “Big Papi” Ortiz (Googly Eyes) as the celebrities unmasked so far on “The Masked Singer” Season 14.\n\n\tBack for Season 14 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists McCarthy Wahlberg, Jeong, Ora and Thicke.\n\n\tNew this season is “America’s Insider,” in which singer, dancer and social media personality Kylie Cantrall will share behind-the-scenes hints and clues for viewers. The twist: Cantrall is in costume as Cat Witch, but will only unmask for viewers — so the audience knows who she is, but the panelists don’t.\n\t\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” Season 14 themed episodes include a tribute to “Star Trek,” the ‘90s comedy “Clueless,” the comic franchise “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and the blockbuster “Twilight Saga” films. Also Fox’s new “Fear Factor” reboot will feature host Johnny Knoxville in a “Fear Factor: House of Fear Night,” and an “Ozzfest Night” honors late rocker Ozzy Osbourne, including a special tribute by “Masked Singer” alum Kelly Osbourne (Season 2’s Ladybug) saluting her father’s musical influence.\n\n\tThe 18 Masked contestants in Season 14 include Eggplant, Pugcasso, Queen Corgi, the Croissants, Owl, 14 Karat Carrot, Snow Cone, Galaxy Girl, High Voltage, Googly Eyes, Scarab, Handyman, Crane, Le Who Who, Pangolin, Stingray, Cat Witch and Calla Lily.\n\n\tPer the show, the Season 14 contestants have sold a combined 94 million records, received 47 Teen Choice Award nominations, 12 Emmy nominations, two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one Tony Award win and one Academy Award nomination.\n\n\tHere were the performances on Wednesday’s two-hour premiere episode.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCat Witch, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCat Witch\t\n\n\tSong: “Teenage Dream,” by Katy Perry\n\n\tPrevious song: “Abracadabra,” by Lady Gaga\n\n\tClue: Pocket watch that says 10:10. “With limited time in the business, I’ve starred in some incredible films and movies. In fact, I think some of you have watched them.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Victoria Justice, Ashley Tisdale, Lisa from Blackpink\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Charli D’Amelio, Addison Rae, Lisa from Blackpink\n\n\tCat Witch voiceover: “One of the coolest thing about the Ninja Turtles has always been collecting the action figures. It was a first question I asked when I became a star: Am I going to be a toy? The first time I saw it at Walmart, I freaked out. And to my surprise, they couldn’t keep them on the shelves. But the coolest part? Knowing it’s probably the first action figure that some kids will ever get. That’s a dream come true. See you in the toy box.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStingray, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tStingray\t\n\n\tSong: “Momma Song,” by Benson Boone\n\n\tPrevious song: “Stayin’ Alive,” by Bee Gees\n\n\tClue: Sushi. “Owning restaurants is just one part of my empire.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Jaden Smith, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Donald Glover\n\t\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Lenny Kravitz, Jaden Smith, Lil Romeo\n\n\tStingray voiceover: “When you’re swimming with the sharks in Hollywood, it’s easy to get swept away in the currents of fame. But I had a secret weapon: I had an oracle in my home. I go them for all my advice. Relationships, career. She’s literally changed the world. Certainly changed mine. She’s my mom. Life moves fast, and we don’t always get the chance to say it. So let me tell you right now: Mom, thank you for all your advice, for holding my hand, making room for me in your bed when I was scared. I love you.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGalaxy Girl, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGalaxy Girl\t\n\n\tSong: “Just A Girl,” by No Doubt\n\n\tPrevious song: “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl,” by Chappell Roan\n\n\tClue: Jingle bells. “Holidays are definitely an important time in my career. I love the holidays and the cheer.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Dixie D’Amelio, Anne Hathaway, Hillary Duff\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Lindsay Lohan, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Emma Stone\n\n\tGalaxy Girl voiceover: “I know first-hand, when you spend your life in front of cameras, people try to control your every move. Especially as a woman. They try to tell you what to wear, how to talk, your whole image. But I am not here for all of that. The night before one of the biggest shoots of my life, I changed my whole look. And I didn’t tell anybody. The next day, when they saw what I had done, everyone panicked. But they don’t know what’s best for me. I do. And I was right, the shoot went global. Oh, and my look? Iconic.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQueen Corgi, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSong: “Unstoppable,” by Sia\n\n\tPrevious song: “Don’t Rain on My Parade,” by Barbra Streisand\n\n\tClue: Avocado toast. “I wouldn’t be anything without my morning toast.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Amy Schumer, Ali Wong, Whitney Cummings\n\n\tPrevious panel guesses: Nikki Blonsky, Maya Rudolph, Aidy Bryant\n\n\tQueen Corgi voiceover: “Comin at cha from New York, it’s the Call Me Corgi podcast. Queen Corgi, great to have you on the podcast.” “Thank you, it’s so great to be back in my hometown. I used to waddle past Madison Square Garden dreaming that it would be my name in lights one day. That’s for Lady Gaga, not me. But I look better in a meat gown than Lady Gaga. But when I finally got a chance to headline my first tour, you know I saved the best for last. Madison Square Garden. And guess what, I sold out. As a new mom, I want my baby to know that no dream is too big.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t14 Karat Carrot, “The Masked Singer”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWild Card: 14 Karat Carrot\t\n\n\tSong: “Hold On, I’m Comin,” by Sam and Dave\n\n\tClue: Five 24K carrot. “I made a few bad judgements when I was younger. But now I’m living the golden life.”\n\n\tPanel guesses: Al Green, Otis Williams of the Temptations, Morgan Freeman, Verdine White\n\n\t14 Karat Carrot voiceover: “Being a wild card is a little bit out of my comfort zone. Because I play by the rules. But it wasn’t always that way. I used to be trouble. I ended up hitting rock bottom. I got locked away. With no promise of a golden future. I was letting my family down. And that was no way to live. So I cleaned up my act. I guess deep down, I was always a good guy. Justice really is the balance between carrot and the stick.”\n\n\tPast “The Masked Singer” winners include T-Pain as Monster (Season 1), Wayne Brady as Fox (Season 2), Kandi Burruss as Night Angel (Season 3), LeAnn Rimes as Sun (Season 4), Nick Lachey as Piglet (Season 5), Jewel as Queen of Hearts (Season 6), Teyana Taylor as Firefly (Season 7), Amber Riley as Harp (Season 8), Bishop Briggs as Medusa (Season 9), Ne-Yo as Cow (Season 10), Vanessa Hudgens as Goldfish (Season 11), Boyz II Men as Buffalos (Season 12) and Gretchen Wilson as Pearl (Season 13).\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment. Rosie Seitchik, Craig Plestis and Cannon are executive producers, while Seitchik serves as showrunner. The series is based on the South Korean format created by Mun Hwa Broadcasting Corp.\n",

Pretti's wearing a remarkably similar outfit to the one he wore 11 days later when he was shot.\n      \n    \n        Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n      \n    \n          The clip starts with Pretti yelling and appearing to spit on the vehicle as federal officers are driving away from the area ... before he brings his foot up and kicks and shatters the rear right tail light, leaving it hanging by cords.\n      \n\n          Agents jump out of the SUV and chase Pretti down ... slamming him to the ground while a crowd gathers around them and screams at the agents.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Inexplicably, after the tense altercation ends and Pretti's able to get back to his feet, agents just let him go ... leaving him on the street corner despite the damage he's done to the vehicle.\n      \n    \n          A rep for the Pretti family tells TMZ ... they knew about the incident on January 13. The rep says Alex sustained injuries but did not get medical care.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As Pretti pulls away from the agents, you can see the butt of a handgun in the rear waistband of his pants -- just as it was during his fatal encounter with the feds.\n      \n    \n          Steve Schleicher, the attorney for the Pretti family tells TMZ ... \"A week before Alex was gunned down in the street -- despite posing no threat to anyone -- he was violently assaulted by a group of ICE agents. Nothing that happened a full week before could possibly have justified Alex’s killing at the hands of ICE on Jan 24.\"\n      \n    \n          As we've reported ... 11 days after that initial clash, feds again wrestled Pretti to the ground on a city street ... and a Border Patrol agent and a Customs and Border Protection officer fired a series of shots at Pretti. He died at the scene.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Protests have exploded all over Minnesota and the rest of the country in the days after the killing. Trump administration officials have already publicly labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n      \n    \n          The Department of Homeland Security tells TMZ ...

TMZ Sports has learned.\n      \n    \n          A spokesperson for the Miami Gardens Police Department says Davis was scooped up on Wednesday. U.S. Marshals were involved in the search for the undefeated boxer, but the circumstances surrounding how he was ultimately tracked down remain unclear at this time.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As we previously reported ... authorities in the 305 announced on Jan. 14 the 31-year-old was wanted on three charges -- battery, false imprisonment and attempted kidnapping.\n      \n\n          Officials said it all stemmed from an alleged incident with a woman at a local gentleman's club.\n      \n    \n          The woman -- who claimed she had an intimate relationship with Tank for five months -- said the boxer approached her while she was working at the establishment around 4:15 AM in late October. The woman said he \"grabbed her by the back of her head, pulling her by the hair with one hand and by her throat with another.\"\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                    \n                  \n      \n                    Miami Gardens Police Department\n          \n    \n          She told cops that Gervonta \"forcefully escorted her\" down a stairway and to the parking garage, all while he maintained a grip on the back of her head. Once in the parking area -- she said Davis then released her -- and she ran toward her co-workers for safety.\n      \n    \n          The woman, who cops would not identify, then went to the local station two days later to report it.\n      \n    \n          Officials stated the lead detective obtained and reviewed video footage \"that corroborates key elements of the victim's statements.\"\n      \n    \n          Prior to his arrest ... Davis was also sued by the woman on Halloween over the same altercation.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          This alleged assault derailed Tank's fight against Jake Paul, which was set to take place in November. After these accusations came to light, Paul and Most Valuable Promotions called it off.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Gervonta Davis\n              \n                          \n                Jake Paul\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Boxing\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

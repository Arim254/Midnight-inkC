    "body": "\n\tHalle Berry might not be reprising her role as the weather-controlling Storm in the forthcoming “Avengers: Doomsday,” but don’t count the Oscar-winning actor out of a future Marvel reunion. \n\n\t“While I’m sad I won’t be in ‘Doomsday’ this round, there are other rounds,” Berry told ScreenRant while promoting her new movie “Crime 101.” “And I would do that in a heartbeat.”\n\n\n\tBerry also noted how proud she is to have been a part of the X-Men world: “I think the whole world of the X-Men and being mutants and outcasts. [They’ve] been movies that I’ve been proud to have my children watch. They have so much to say that I thought has been really important, especially for my children as they’ve grown. So they’re beloved.” \n\t\n\n\tThe “Catwoman” actor played Storm from 2000 to 2014, appearing in “X-Men,” “X2: X-Men United,” “X-Men: The Last Stand” and “X-Men: Days of Future Past.”\n\n\t“Storm is a very special character to me,” Berry continued. “I’ve been so blessed [that I’ve] gotten to play her.”\n\n\tWhile Storm won’t be returning, a long list of names from the “X-Men” universe are set to reprise their roles in “Avengers: Doomsday,” including Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Kelsey Grammer, Alan Cumming, James Marsden, Channing Tatum and Rebecca Romijn. \n\n\tAlso set to appear are Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Mackie, Danny Ramirez, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Tom Hiddleston, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Simu Liu, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen and Lewis Pullman. Robert Downey Jr. will also be in “Doomsday,” though not as Tony Stark — he’ll instead play Doctor Doom, a villain. \n\t\n\n\tDirected by MCU regulars Anthony and Joe Russo, “Avengers: Doomsday” is set to release on Dec. 18.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBrad Arnold, the lead singer and founding member of the American rock band 3 Doors Down, died on Saturday after a battle with cancer. He was 47.\n\n\tA rep for Arnold said he died peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by his wife and family.\n\n\tArnold, the original drummer and vocalist of 3 Doors Down, helped form the band in 1996 in Escatawpa, Miss. He was responsible for writing and producing the 2000 hit “Kryptonite,” one of the group’s most enduring tracks. Arnold famously wrote the lyrics for the song when he was just 15 years old.\n\t\n\n\tIn May of 2025, Arnold revealed in a social media video that he had been diagnosed with Stage 4 kidney cancer.\n\n\n\t“Hey everybody, it’s Brad from 3 Doors Down. I hope you’re having a great day today,” he said in the video. “Got some not so good news for you today. So, I’d been sick a couple of weeks ago and then went to the hospital and got checked out, and actually got the diagnosis that I had a clear cell renal cell carcinoma that had metastasized into my lung. And it’s stage four, and that’s not real good.”\n\n\tHe added, “But you know what? “We serve a mighty God, and he can overcome anything. So I have no fear. I really sincerely am not scared of it at all. But it is gonna force us to cancel our tour this summer. And we’re sorry for that. And I’d love for you to lift me up in prayer every chance you get. And Ithink it is time for me to go listen to ‘It’s Not My Time’ a little bit, right?”\n\n\tArnold is survived by his wife, Jennifer\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 4 of “The Lincoln Lawyer,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAs Season 4 of the hit Netflix series",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 4 of “The Lincoln Lawyer,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tAs Season 4 of the hit Netflix series “The Lincoln Lawyer” gets underway, Mickey Haller (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) has lost his cherished vintage Lincoln Continental — temporarily, anyway — as well as his freedom.\n\n\tIt’s the most emotional season yet for the Los Angeles-set legal thriller, based on the books by Michael Connelly, as Mickey must defend himself against a murder charge that could see him imprisoned for life. \n\t\n\n\tAs the 10 episodes build up the tension about his case, Mickey manages to execute some tricky last-minute legal maneuvers. But he doesn’t do it alone — midway through the season, Mickey (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) makes a strategic shift in his co-counsel, swapping out ex-wife No. 2 Lorna (Becki Newton) for ex-wife No. 1 Maggie (Neve Campbell), a seasoned prosecutor who knows how the other side thinks. Having Maggie on his team means they’re thrown together much more intensely than when they were merely co-parents — which seems to lead to some simmering feelings being rekindled.\n\n\n\tWhile Season 4 revolves around numerous tense courtroom scenes, there’s also plenty of action and suspense in the jail where Mickey is being held and across the streets of Southern California as Mickey’s investigator Cisco (Angus Sampson) chases down possible clues and witnesses that could help Mickey’s case. Back at the office, newly-minted attorney Lorna is hustling to keep the firm afloat by taking on new cases while assistant Izzy (Jazz Raycole) pitches in with help from her new law student friend.\n\t\n\n\tMickey is also grappling with his daughter Hayley’s reaction to his arrest. Not only is he devastated to have Hayley (Krista Warner) see him looking so vulnerable in prison, but her peers are circulating damaging gossip about the case on social media. \n\n\tCo-showrunners and directors Ted Humphrey and Dailyn Rodriguez broke down some of the most dramatic beats of Season 4, how Rodriguez used details from her own relationship with her father to help illuminate Hayley’s feelings — and what could be in store for Season 5, which has already been greenlit. \n\t\n\t\tHow do you feel this season compares to the previous three?\t\n\n\tTed Humphrey: We feel that is our most emotional season, and most personal season. Emotionally, the show has been building to that. We’ve taken this character on such an emotional roller coaster, but it’s been building to this.\n\t\n\t\tWhat kinds of changes were made from the Connelly book “The Law of Innocence,” on which this season is based?\t\n\n\tDailyn Rodriguez: Mickey’s in jail for most of the book, and it has a lot of internal monologues that are very self-reflective — and kind of dark, and a little depressing. So considering that our show is not quite tonally the same as Michael’s books, we’re a little bit more of a light L.A. crime noir, we had to figure out a way to get him out of jail, but then a really big plot twist get him back in again.\n\n\tHumphrey: We felt that it was not going to be very dramatic or compelling for the audience to watch him just sit in jail for the whole season, and have his team on the outside doing stuff. We needed him to be on the outside, and so we took him to that bleak place in the first couple episodes. And then we get a little bit of a respite from that. It’s a little bit more of a roller coaster ride than the story of the book.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNeve Campbell has a more prominent role as Maggie in Season 4 of “The Lincoln Lawyer.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of emotional, Mickey doesn’t have a chance to form any new dating relationships this season, but his relationship with his ex Maggie seems to go to another level. \t\n\n\tRodriguez: We decided it was inevitable that some feelings would have been sparked again between the two of them, working together so closely. But our show lives on this push-pull between Mickey and Maggie. So we can’t have them get back together. I think the biggest scene in the finale where Hayley has picked up on all of this. She’s like, “Jack’s great, but I don’t think you’re into him.” And Maggie — I don’t think she can go there, not really, at least not yet — but it’s giving you a window into how she really feels.\n\t\n\n\tHumphrey: That relationship is the beating emotional heart of Mickey’s character in the show. The idea of Maggie coming back and being his co-counsel is in the book. It gave us the opportunity also to reignite this relationship. We felt in the life of the show, it was just time to have Maggie back as a major character, to keep that flame burning.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your thinking in shaping Constance Zimmer’s Dana “Iceberg” Berg character, the prosecutor who is laser-focused on winning at any cost?\t\n\n\tRodriguez: Her character is really difficult. She’s just a very by-the-book, very intense, dog-with-a-bone character. I think her whole look added to it, the severity of the bangs and the hair. Our costume designers did such a great job — it just sold the character.\n\n\tHumphrey: That was very much our putting our heads together, thinking how do we visually translate this character to the screen? And Constance really knocked it out of the park in terms of her performance.\n\t\n\t\tCutting straight to the ending, the viewers don’t get the dramatic pronouncement of a jury verdict. How did you ramp up the drama in other ways?\t\n\n\tRodriguez: We felt like we needed Mickey to be more involved in his own rescue at the end. Hence, we created this whole bit with Jeanine Ferrigno to be able to allow us to have this big turn and have Lorna and Mickey do their little hijinks to trick the FBI into playing ball. In the book, the FBI just plays ball, which is not as interesting dramatically.\n\n\tHumphrey: The thing the book does really beautifully, which we did our best to translate to the screen, was the emotion and the personal stakes for Mickey. And so that’s kind of encapsulated in the scene with him and Maggie afterwards. They both, without having to say much to each other, realize what just happened and how by the skin of their teeth they’ve come through it. That feeling from the book is really powerful, and we wanted to translate that as much as possible to the screen.\n\t\n\t\tTell me about what’s behind Mickey’s decision to defend himself.\t\n\n\tHumphrey: The show has been building to this for four seasons. We keep upping the stakes in various ways, professionally, personally, emotionally. What could be higher personal stakes than this, than being on trial for your own life? As far as defending himself, he doesn’t do it alone. He has help. But of course, it’s “The Lincoln Lawyer,” and we weren’t going to have a story where he’s sitting on the sidelines and somebody else is doing all the talking.\n\t\n\n\tRodriguez: I don’t think it’s in Mickey Haller’s nature to have anybody else defend him. He’s so pissed off this is happening that he has to channel it somehow. \n\t\n\t\tWhat was it like for for Manuel this season? How has he changed since he started on Season 1, when he really had not had as many American acting credits?\t\n\n\tRodriguez: He’s become a star. That’s the one thing that’s changed. He’s gotten more comfortable with the language, I would say.\n\n\tHumphrey: But he remains the same. He’s a genuinely lovely person to work with, and he’s funny and self-deprecating and there’s no diva about him.\n\t\n\t\tSo, Elliott Gould’s character, Legal, sadly dies this season. Why now?\t\n\n\tHumphrey: That character has been such a major figure in Mickey’s life. But when you look at movies and TV and literature, Yoda always dies, right? The Yoda character always dies, which is really what Elliott is, and then becomes, in some strange way, more powerful after their death. And that’s kind of what happens with Legal. He’s taken the help he can give Mickey as far as he can in life. And now it’s really about the memory of this person that will be Mickey’s guiding North Star from now on.\n\t\n\t\tHow is Mickey’s close relationship with his daughter Hayley affected by him being arrested for murder?\t\n\n\tHumphrey: Hayley’s very upset by it, and that upsets Mickey, and that’s probably one of the biggest driving motivations for him, not just to save his own life, but to save his daughter and his family from the ramifications of this.\n\n\tRodriguez: My father was incarcerated a couple times, and specifically that scene in the first episode where she goes to visit him and they start calling out the inmates’ names, that happened to me. It dehumanizes people when they’re called by numbers and not names, and it was very hard for me to watch that when it happened to me with my father, so I pitched that in the room for Haley and how it would affect Mickey. I’ve been at my father’s arraignment, and it’s just very hard to see that happening to a parent. So I brought a little bit of that to the table this season, and I think that it adds to Mickey’s emotional turmoil.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBecki Newton, left as Lorna Crane, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Mickey Haller and Angus Sampson as Denis “Cisco” Wojciechowski confer about Mickey’s case in “The Lincoln Lawyer.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKIM ALEXIS/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat about Lorna? It seems like the more stress she’s under, the shorter her skirts get.\t\n\n\tRodriguez: Becki and her quirky wardrobe — It’s the one place where we can have a little bit of fun. And I think she enjoys it. I think that she’s growing up. She starts out with a win, and then realizes it’s not that easy. She realizes she’s in over her head being Mickey’s co-counsel. By the end of the season, she grows so much as a person and as an attorney, and her relationship with Cisco really deepens.\n\t\n\n\tHumphrey:  In Season 1, she’s basically intimidated by Maggie, and they have this kind of frosty relationship. But now, by Season 4, she’s seeing herself as more of an equal to Maggie, and they’ve developed a kind of burgeoning friendship and certainly, colleagueship, that is built around the fact that they both care about Mickey and they both want to help Mickey.\n\t\n\t\tDailyn, you directed for the first time with Episode 7. What was that like?\t\n\n\tRodriguez: It was daunting, of course. But I’ve been writing in television for about 24 years. So I relied a lot on my experience being on sets and watching actors. The most rewarding part of it was to work with the actors and feel like I had a shorthand because I’ve been on the show for four seasons and understand the characters so much. I learned a lot that has informed my writing after that. Manuel even gave me some flowers on my last day, which is very sweet. It was a very difficult episode as a first episode, because it was very court-heavy. I had both opening statements from both Maggie and from Dana, which was figuring out how to differentiate them visually and tonally. And I had our first witness. I came out feeling a lot of empathy for guest directors.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was it like for Maggie to go over to the defense side?\t\n\n\tHumphrey: It’s a professional conflict, in the sense that the DA office probably isn’t thrilled. For her, there’s a fair amount of cognitive dissonance. There’s a big learning curve for her in doing this, not just in how to do it, but in how it makes her think about everything that she does.\n\t\n\t\tIt was fun to see cameo from Mozza owner Nancy Silverton. Are you having fun picking all the restaurants shown in the series, from Triple Beam to Musso & Frank?\t\n\n\tRodriguez: I think it’s a nice little Easter egg for people that live here. A lot of times it’s just even seeing a prop on the screen, whether it’s a coffee cup or, you know, bag of food.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was the most complex scene to film when you were outside of the courtroom?\t\n\n\tHumphrey: I directed the first two episodes of the season, and the opening of the season is probably our most ambitious.\n\n\tIt involved combining helicopter footage, which we shot of L.A., which we then handed off to a drone in mid-air. We wanted to go from this big sweeping vista of L.A. from a bird’s eye point of view, all the way down right to this building that is kind of the thematic fulcrum of that opening sequence, and then past the tree and into this building, which is a crime scene, and then right through the door and see what’s going on in the building. It actually involved the drone flying down and then being picked up by a handheld operator, who then operates it like a handheld camera and takes it into the place and takes it back out, and then lets it go again and it flies off.\n\t\n\n\tThat whole opening sequence took about 50 meetings and years off of our life to plan and execute, but we pulled it off. It was fun.\n\t\n\t\tJust when Mickey’s life seems to be calming down, he gets a surprise when he opens the door to a woman who announces she’s his sister. What can we expect from that revelation?\t\n\n\tHumphrey: This is a character who has really strong ideas about who he is and where he came from, and we thought it would be really interesting to turn those on their head and and suddenly present him with the conundrum of, “What if everything I thought I knew about myself maybe isn’t quite right?”\n\n\tIn Michael’s books, the character Bosch is Mickey’s half-brother, and that’s something we can’t do in the show because of the fact that Bosch is a character on another platform. But we found a way to do the personal aspects of that by creating this other character.\n\t\n\t\tSo will we be seeing more of his sister?\t\n\n\tHumphrey: Well, we cast Cobie Smulders, so that’s very much the plan. We’re super excited to have Cobie come and work with us. The last shot of the season is Mickey looking like somebody’s completely blown his mind. And so now the next question is, what is this? Is it true? What does it mean for Mickey going forward? \n\t\n\t\tHave you already decided which novel Season 5 will be based on?\t\n\n\tHumphrey: We may not use a novel directly, or it may be pieces of a novel. It may be the season that we invent the most.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "description": "\n\tAn absurdist satire, a horror story, science-fiction, a historical drama, a black comedy: this year’s Oscar-nominated composers were called to score",
    "body": "\n\tAn absurdist satire, a horror story, science-fiction, a historical drama, a black comedy: this year’s Oscar-nominated composers were called to score a variety of engaging scenarios. But they had one thing in common: a special scene in which they could take pride, moments where music made a difference in each film.\n\n\tFor Ludwig Göransson, up for Oscars in both song and score categories, it was the juke joint scene in “Sinners” where Preacherboy (Miles Caton) sings “I Lied to You” and, thanks to director Ryan Coogler’s restless camera, we see images of music-making from throughout Black history, from African drummers to a Jimi Hendrix-style guitarist to modern-day hip-hop artists and DJs with turntables.\n\t\n\n\t“He closes his eyes, starts playing and he’s connecting with his ancestors and his future self through his music,” the composer says. “That also tells the evolution and the history of the blues where he came from.” Göransson wrote the song with Raphael Siddiq the day before leaving for the Louisiana set where he would spend more than three months writing and coordinating the musical sequences.\n\n\n\t“We had one day to shoot it,” he adds. “We knew we had to go from point A to point B within seven or eight bars of music, but (Caton) is not going to move exactly in time. Because I had my (music) rig there, I was able to cut back and forth and do small trims on set.” The scene is one of the most talked-about in the film.\n\n\tIn the case of “Hamnet,” composer Max Richter’s music led director Chloe Zhao to rethink the conclusion of her film. “Toward the end of the shoot, Chloe found herself dissatisfied with the written ending,” the composer says. That’s when actress Jessie Buckley (who plays Shakespeare’s wife Agnes) sent her Richter’s “On the Nature of Daylight,” a track from his 2004 album “The Blue Notebooks.”\n\t\n\n\t“Daylight” is one of Richter’s best-known pieces and has often been used in films and TV, including prominent placement in “Arrival” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” “Chloe listened to it in the car,” he reports, and “three or four days before the end of the shoot, she had a kind of epiphany, a vision of the end of the film. And then they played that music on the set 10 hours a day for four days, and they made the end of the film.”\n\n\tAlthough Richter wrote new music for that sequence, Zhao “was really adamant” that “Daylight” needed to close the film because “the music had, in a way, unlocked the ending of the film for her. And I supported that idea in the end.” (The remainder of the music in “Hamnet” is original, and that’s what was nominated.)\n\n\tFrench composer Alexandre Desplat found a clever musical solution for the scene in Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” in which Victor (Oscar Isaac) visits battlefields, collects corpses and begins choosing the parts he will assemble into a “new” body to be reawakened as part of his monstrous experiment.\n\n\t“The first instinct is to emphasize this horrific moment, but it would have been unbearable,” says Desplat. “But if you consider his point of view, which is that of an artist creating his masterpiece, the excitement, suddenly you share his passionate action and you don’t really look at the corpses in the same way.”\n\n\tHis response was to create a grand waltz for orchestra and choir. “There’s even a sense of dark humor to it,” he adds. “I play with that, of course, with the score taking pauses and starting again. It’s a counterpoint to what you see on the screen.”\n\n\tFor “Bugonia” composer Jerskin Fendrix, the special moment wasn’t a scene in Yorgos Lanthimos’ film but rather all the research that went into it. Lanthimos refused to show him a script or discuss any specifics about the film, but instead gave him three words (“bees,” “basement,” “spaceship”) and sent him off to write music about those topics well before shooting started.\n\n\t“I spent months and months by myself doing all this esoteric, bizarre research on bees and spaceships and so on,” Fendrix says. “I knew that meetings were happening, the film was being made, none of which I was allowed to be privy to. I was starting to get a bit paranoid.” He wrote more than an hour of music and recorded it with a 90-piece London orchestra, which Lanthimos assembled into a score.\n\t\n\n\tWhen he finally saw the film, the story felt familiar. “I saw this guy, a real loner, who was doing all the research, getting really paranoid, and just hoping that all this effort means it’s right,” he adds. “A lot of the music echoes the psychology of Teddy (Jesse Plemons), this kind of frantic grandiosity.\n\n\t“My interpretation is that this is a form of ‘method composition.’ I’m basically put in the same position so I can actually live a similar psychological experience.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s shaping up to be a slow weekend at the box office, with major studios understandably hesitant to launch their films against the unstoppable ratings machine that is Sunday’s Super Bowl. That meant Friday was wide open for the K-pop concert film “Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience” to take the top spot.\n\n\t“Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience,” which recounts the titular K-pop group’s world tour and their sold-out performance at L.A.’s SoFi Stadium, grossed an estimated $3 million on Friday from 1,724 North American theaters. Domestic gross should reach $5 million by Sunday.\n\t\n\n\tIn second place was “Send Help,” which earned $2.8 million on its second Friday at the domestic box office, representing a 61% decline from its opening day. Disney and 20th Century’s bloody comedy-thriller, which follows a dorky, survival-savvy employee (Rachel McAdams) and her douchey younger boss (Dylan O’Brien) who become stranded together on a remote island, should add $9 million to $10 million by Sunday for a total domestic gross of $34 million. Although landing at No. 2 on Friday, “Send Help” is expected to win the weekend. \n\n\n\tThird place went to Angel Studios’ newcomer “Solo Mio,” which grossed an estimated $2.7 million from 3,052 theaters. The rom-com should pull in $6.6 million by Sunday. Starring Kevin James, the film follows a man who was left at the altar and decides to go on his honeymoon alone.\n\n\tIndie distributor Angel Studios broke into the theatrical market with 2023’s “Sound of Freedom,” which became a sleeper hit after grossing $250 million worldwide. Some of its other recent titles include “David,” “The Senior” and “Grow.”\n\t\n\n\t“Iron Lung,” the feature directorial debut of YouTube star Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach, landed at No. 4 on Friday with $2.04 million domestic, according to rival estimates. That’s a 77% decline from its opening day earnings. Based on the 2022 indie horror game, the film follows a convict in a post-apocalyptic future who must scavenge for resources in an ocean of blood. “Iron Lung” should make $5.7 million by Sunday, bringing its domestic total to $30.7 million.\n\n\tFischbach served as co-director with “Iron Lung” game developer David Szymanski. He also wrote, edited, executive produced, distributed, financed, editied and starred in the film. After “Iron Lung” grossed $21 in its debut, Fischbach went live on his YouTube channel and extended an emotional thank you to his fans.\n\n\tIn a distant seventh place was horror newcomer “The Strangers: Chapter 3,” which grossed $1.58 million on Friday from 2,565 North American theaters. The third and final instalment in the rebooted “Strangers” trilogy should cut down $3.8 million by Sunday. Starring Madelain Petsch, Gabriel Basso, Froy Gutierrez and Ema Horvath, “The Strangers: Chapter 3” follows a young woman who is relentlessly hunted by a trio of mask-wearing psychopaths.\n\n\tThe original “Strangers” film came out in 2008 and was followed by a sequel, “The Strangers: Prey at Night,” in 2018. 2024 saw the start of a new reboot trilogy with the release of “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” which was followed by “The Strangers: Chapter 2” in September 2025. Those films made $5.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, on opening day.\n\n\tAt the No. 5 spot was Vertical’s “Dracula,” from “Fifth Element” director Luc Besson. The film earned $2.03 million on Friday, according to rival estimates, and should bite down on $4.1 million by Sunday. Caleb Landry Jones stars as the titular bloodsucker, while Christoph Waltz plays his nemesis in Van Helsing. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJennifer Hudson is reacting to Kelly Clarkson announcing that she’s ending her talk show.\n\n\t“Kelly is amazing,” Hudson told me Friday at the premiere of her new animated movie, “Goat.” “I wish her the absolute best. She’s done really well – and she’s a GOAT!”\n\n\tClarkson announced on Feb. 2 that the current seventh season of “The Kelly Clarkson Show” would be its last. “Stepping away from the daily schedule will allow me to prioritize my kids, which feels necessary and right for this next chapter of our lives,” she said in a statement, in part.\n\t\n\n\tProduction on Season 7 of “The Kelly Clarkson Show” will continue as previously planned, with the series airing its final episodes this fall. The season will also feature special guest hosts to be announced at a later date.\n\n\t“The Kelly Clarkson Show” premiered in 2019. The series features Clarkson as she interviews celebrities as well as non-celebrities with inspiring stories. Each episode opens with a “Kellyoke” segment, in which Clarkson and her band perform covers of other artists’ songs. “The Kelly Clarkson Show” has won 24 Daytime Emmys, including four consecutive wins for both outstanding daytime talk series and talk show host.\n\n\tThe show is produced by Universal Television and distributed by NBCUniversal Syndication Studios, airing in over 200 markets nationwide. Alex Duda serves as showrunner and executive producer.\n\n\t“The Jennifer Hudson Show” premiered in 2022. It has been nominated for 12 Daytime Emmys.\n\n\tA day after Clarkson’s announcement, Sherri Shepherd’s show, “Sherri,” was cancelled by producer Debmar-Mercury after four seasons.\n\t\n\n\t“Goat” follows the story of Will (Caleb McLaughlin), a goat who aspires to play roarball, a basketball-like game played by the most powerful animals in the world. Hudson plays Will’s mom. The cast also includes Gabrielle Union, Stephen Curry (who is also a producer on the film), Nicola Coughlan, Nick Kroll, David Harbour, Jenifer Lewis, Aaron Pierre, Patton Oswalt, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Eduardo Franco, Sherry Cola and Jelly Roll. \n\n\t“My son is my GOAT,” Hudson said. “I’m proud of him. He’s leaving his basketball practice to come to the premiere. Steph Curry is a GOAT. Michael Jordan is a GOAT. LeBron [James] is a GOAT. That’s why I love sports. I am a basketball mom, and I love sports. It is so inspiring to me to see people, no matter what, fight for their dreams, goals, whether they win or lose and they go down with a ball, OK? I love it.”\n\n\t“Goat” is in theaters on Feb. 13.\n\n\tSee more photos from the premiere below.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKaavia James Union Wade, Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Hudson \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAyesha Curry and Stephen Curry \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCaleb McLaughlin \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael Buckner\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tColton Underwood, Jordan C.

    "body": "\n\tFor only the second time in Academy Awards history, two of the five nominated songs are from documentaries—and one of them is an aria performed an opera star, also only the second time during the 91-year history of the category.\n\n\tVeteran songwriter Diane Warren earned her 17th nomination for “Dear Me” (written for a documentary about her career). The surprise in this list (outpolling songs by Stephen Schwartz, Miley Cyrus and Sara Bareilles) was “Sweet Dreams of Joy” from an obscure documentary titled “Viva Verdi!”\n\t\n\n\tThe film is about a retirement home for musicians, built in 1896 by Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi (composer of such operas as “Aida” and “La Traviata”) and still in operation in Milan today.\n\n\n\tComposer Nicholas Pike watched a 12-minute compilation of scenes and was so moved that he wrote, in a day, a song he called “Sweet Dreams of Joy.” But, as the filmmakers were still shooting, he had plenty of time to consider how best to present it.\n\n\tSince most of the residents of Casa Verdi were active in classical music, he decided to recast it in operatic form and ask a soprano to perform it. Ana Maria Martinez, who sang “Carmen” with the Los Angeles Opera and “Tosca” with the Pittsburgh Opera, loved both the song and the idea of the film and agreed to record it.\n\n\tPike wrote both music and lyrics, inspired by the residents (ages 77 to 103) who were still mentoring young musicians. “These people, in their third act in life, were just so full of joy and passion; I was feeling the energy of the place,” he says.\n\n\tThe composer, who is better known as a score composer (TV’s “The Shining”), sees the piece as “a celebration of life as an artist, living a life through music.\n\t\n\n\t“These residents at Casa Verdi have that, and shared that with Verdi, so the aria is a musical rendering in the most visceral way of joy, inspiration and possibilities. And because the aria is steeped in more of a classical vibe, it naturally brings a deeper level of complexity, finesse and weight that appeals, I think, to anybody with musical leanings.”\n\n\tMartinez’s soaring soprano, Pike’s classically styled piano and an ensemble of strings lend an air of sophistication as well as a nostalgia for the kind of music once practiced by Europe’s practitioners of grand opera. Pike was pleased that the Academy’s music branch had, he said, “acknowledged a song outside of the norm.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tCountry singer Brantley Gilbert has taken to social media to defend the controversial alternative halftime show being put on Sunday by Turning Point",
    "body": "\n\tCountry singer Brantley Gilbert has taken to social media to defend the controversial alternative halftime show being put on Sunday by Turning Point USA, insisting “I’m not playing this show to be divisive” and that diverting viewers from Bad Bunny’s actual Super Bowl performance fits in with his belief that “we stand united” in America.\n\n\tHis statement on X, Instagram and Threads also says that one reason for doing an alternative to the real Super Bowl halftime is that country artists have been all but shut out of it.\n\t\n\n\t“It’s been more than 20 years since a country artist has been asked to play the Super Bowl halftime show,” Gilbert stated.\n\n\n\tAdditionally, he said that performing as part of the TPUSA show — which many have characterized as a protest against the NFL booking Bad Bunny, who sings entirely in Spanish — is for him a fulfillment, of sorts, of his dream of singing at the Super Bowl.\n\n\t“I respect that some people may see this differently, but I’m not playing this show to be divisive,” Gilbert wrote. “I was offered this opportunity and imagined my kids watching their daddy perform at halftime during the biggest game in American Football. Everything I do, I do for them.”\n\n\tInevitably, dismissive comments followed on all the social platforms where Gilbert posted, with detractors writing that Gilbert performing “during” the big game comes hardly counts. Among the replies from non-fans: “You’re not playing in the Super Bowl half time show. You’re playing in a pretend half time show because 1/2 of this country hates immigrants.” “Nothing says UNITED like doing a SEPARATE show.” And: “If I run out to my front yard and scream a song into the street I have performed at halftime of the Super Bowl in the exact same way you have.”\n\t\n\n\tGilbert is correct in stating that it has been more than two decades since a country artist was booked for the Super Bowl halftime. Historically, it has only happened twice: in 2003, when Shania Twain shared halftime duties with No Doubt, and a decade before than in 1993, when the Judds, Clint Black, Tanya Tucker and Travis Tritt were part of a “Rockin’ Country Sunday” halftime. \n\n\tHowever, country artists have taken part in other Super Bowl music duties in recent years, especially the singing of the national anthem. Country performers had a four-year streak of doing “The Star-Spangled Banner” this decade: Reba McEntire in 2024, Chris Stapleton in 2023, Mickey Guyton in 2022, and Eric Church doing it alongside Jazmine Sullivan in 2021. Luke Bryan and Carrie Underwood sang the anthem going further back into the 2010s.\n\n\n\tEven if the TPUSA show is being seen as, in effect, a protest event, Gilbert suggested that it will actually be unifying, not divisive, although he did not say who he expected to be unified by the show.\n\n\t“The way I treat people isn’t conditional based on what our differences may be. I believe ‘united we stand, divided we fall,’ and my prayer for our country is that we stand united,” he wrote.\n\n\tGilbert is one of four performers announced in advance for the alternative show, being put on by the conservative organization TPUSA, founded by Charlie Kirk and now led by his widow, Erika Kirk. The others are fellow country artists Gabby Barrett and Lee Brice and the event’s always-polarizing headliner, Kid Rock.\n\n\tThe full text of Gilbert’s statement reads: “For those asking ‘who is Brantley Gilbert?’ and ‘why is he playing this event?’ I’m a songwriter who grew up and still lives in Jackson County, GA, whose goal in the music business was to sell out the local theater a few miles from my house and somehow make my living writing songs. I’m a recovering addict with the history of all the bad choices that come with it. I’m not proud of those choices, but I am proud of the choice I’ve made to live in another direction. I share my story through my music, in hopes that it may help and inspire others in their darkest hour. I’m a Christian, and I love our country, despite its flaws. I’ve dedicated part of my life to the men and women who fight for it, and the families of those who gave their life for it. Above all, I’m a proud husband and father of three. \n\t\n\n\t“We’re celebrating 250 years as a country, and it’s been more than 20 years since a country artist has been asked to play the Super Bowl halftime show,” his statement continues. “I respect that some people may see this differently, but I’m not playing this show to be divisive. I was offered this opportunity and imagined my kids watching their daddy perform at halftime during the biggest game in American Football. Everything I do, I do for them.”\n\n\tGilbert concluded, “The way I treat people isn’t conditional based on what our differences may be. I believe ‘United we stand, divided we fall,’ and my prayer for our country is that we stand united. Thank you to my road family and all the fans who have stood beside me. Looking forward to hitting the stage this Sunday and giving folks a hell of a show.”\n\n\tGilbert’s most recent album for the Big Machine label group, “Tattoos,” debuted at No. 42 on the Billboard country albums chart in 2024. He had a run of significant hits in the 2010s, racking up five No. 1 country airplay singles between 2011-2019.\n\n\tOutside of music, Gilbert has been known for his gun rights advocacy. In 2015, he got a full-back tattoo consisting of script from the second amendment to the Constitution and two giant-sized pistols.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump on Friday night told reporters on board Air Force One (via TMZ) that the investigation into the abduction of Savannah Guthrie‘s 84-year-old mother is going “very well” and “definitive” answers as to what happened could be released in the coming days.\n\n\tWhen asked for an update on the case, Trump said, “I think we’re doing very well in that regard. You’re probably surprised to hear that. I think we’re doing very well. Very well meaning we have some clues, I think, that are very strong, and I think we could have some answers coming up fairly soon.”\n\t\n\n\tHe added, “We have some things, I think, that will maybe come out reasonably soon, from DOJ or FBI, or whoever that could be.”\n\n\n\tWhen asked if authorities have a suspect, Trump kept it vague: “Could be definitive. A lot has taken place in the last couple of hours.”\n\n\tNancy Guthrie went missing on Sunday, Feb. 1, after she was last seen on Saturday, Jan. 31, at her home in Tucson, Ariz. Her daughter, “Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie, reported her missing after Nancy did not attend her usual Sunday church service.\n\n\tSince Nancy’s disappearance, police in Pima County, Ariz., have been searching for her, along with aid from the FBI and federal government. Officials held two press conferences in the days following her disappearance and said they suspect foul play to be involved. On Tuesday, Feb. 3, news outlet TMZ, which first broke the news of Nancy’s disappearance, received an apparent ransom note demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin. The note had two deadlines set for Thursday, Feb. 5, at 5 p.m. and Monday, Feb. 9., which was described as a more serious deadline.\n\t\n\n\tSavannah and her two siblings posted an emotional video on Wednesday, Feb. 4, pleading with Nancy’s kidnappers to speak with them and show proof of life for Nancy.\n\n\t“She’s 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, and she needs it not to suffer,” Savannah said in the video. “We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.”\n",

Josh Singleton, Commander of the Santa Clara County Human Trafficking Task Force, tells TMZ ... his team of federal, state, and local law enforcement officers ain't messin' around when it comes to sex workers -- and if you get caught messin' around with them, you're gonna wind up in handcuffs!\n      \n    \n          Singleton gives everyone fair warning ... \"Come have a good time at the Super Bowl.

Singleton tells us during Super Bowl week he's seen an estimated 1.3 million visitors come to Northern California, where the Seattle Seahawks will battle the New England Patriots at Levi Stadium in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n      \n    \n          Due to the large influx of football fans, Singleton says his officers have arrested a high number of sex traffickers and pimps, who force underage girls and young women into online sex work and street prostitution.\n      \n    \n          Singleton says these scumbags sometimes force their prey into having sex 15 times a day while pocketing most of the proceeds. Plus, it can get pretty pricey for the Johns ... Singleton says they can pay between $250 to $350 for a 30-minute sex session with a condom ... but because the rates are so competitive over Super Bowl week, the prices can drop to as low as $60 a pop.\n      \n    \n          And get this ... There's also been a major uptick in arrests of Johns this week because of undercover operations, Singleton says. The commander expects the number of busts to climb even higher over Super Bowl weekend.\n      \n    \n          Piece of advice, guys ... keep your d*** in your pants!!!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Super Bowl\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Police\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\t“Timeless,” the brooding trap collaboration between the Weeknd and Playboi Carti, made its live debut before it was actually completed. According to XO co-founder Amir “Cash” Esmailian, it was backstage at the Weeknd’s “One Night Only” concert in São Paulo that the Canadian artist, aka Abel Tesfaye, said, “Let’s perform the song we worked on today.” \n\n\tIt was a high-profile debut, witnessed by thousands in the stadium and on the livestream. “We knew we had to capitalize,” says Republic’s Marleny Reyes. Afterward, the internet was ablaze with anticipation for a studio version. “For us, it’s always about following Abel’s lead and augmenting his vision,” she says. “Nobody is better at organically building buzz than he is.” \n\t\n\n\tWhile its arrival was near instantaneous, “Timeless” had been gestating for months. “I got the rough track early on, before Abel even laid down vocals,” says producer Mike Dean. “Backstage in São Paulo, the vibe was right.” So Dean dusted off the file and added “piano chords, lead lines and some layers” to piece it all together. \n\n\n\tThere’s even a clip that captures the moment when Dean learned that he was flipping a beat from a fellow production legend. “You can see me in the video asking Carti who started it,” he says. “That’s when I found out it was Pharrell.” \n\n\tThe track’s hypnotic atmosphere was heightened by Ojivolta and Twisco. “Abel is one of our favorite artists,” Oji (aka Mark Williams) says. The goal, according to Volta (Raul Cubina), was to create “a song that resonated with the world but had an atypical structure.” Twisco, for his part, used “analog sources like SOMA’s Lyra-08 in juxtaposition with granular resynthesis” to build out the soundscape. \n\t\n\n\tFor Dean, the song exemplifies their many years of collaboration. “We don’t really have to talk much anymore,” he says. “It’s pure flow.” Then it was up to Republic and XO to nurture their creation. “The song has continued to thrive for well over a year,” Reyes says. “We’re always looking beyond the first day, week and month.”\n\n\tSongwriters: Abel Tesfaye, Jordan Terrell Carter, Pharrell Williams, Mark Williams, Raul Cubina, Tariq “BL$$D” Sharrieff, Kobe “BbyKobe” Hood, Devon Chisolm (Lawson), Jarrod “Twisco” Morgan, Mike Dean \n\n\tProducers: Mike Dean, Ojivolta, Twisco, Pharrell Williams \n\n\tHitmakers:\n\n\tMike Dean, producer \n\n\tOjivolta, production duo \n\n\tPharrell Williams, producer \n\n\tAmir “Cash” Esmailian, manager, XO\n\n\tMarleny Reyes, general manager, Republic\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt was a hectic time in Elkan’s life, and the Sierra Leone-born producer’s phone was constantly buzzing. Taking refuge from the barrage of calls, he began singing repeatedly in the shower: “Who’s calling my phone?” \n\n\tHe recorded the hook, which eventually became the centerpiece of Drake’s “Nokia,” one of the biggest rap songs of the year. “It turns the pain into praise,” Elkan says, calling the track a “miracle record” that “brings the fun back to the party and makes people forget about the nonsense in their lives.” What started as a plea to be left alone turned into a joyful anthem about hitting the dance floor and ringing your friends to find the action. \n\t\n\n\t“Nokia” opens with that cooing hook — “Who’s calling my phone?” — before sliding into a bouncy retro beat that Drake skates over: “Where the fuck the function?” Trickling in the background are marimba-like melodies reminiscent of a mid-2000s ringtone, coupled with R&B vocals and futuristic synths. \n\n\n\t“When I’m making music, I’m always thinking, ‘What does 2050 sound like? What are my grandkids going to dance to?’” Elkan says. \n\n\tHe started making the beat for “Nokia” in his sister’s spare bedroom, sitting on the floor and playing with a MIDI keyboard. He was drawn to the catchy melodies of childhood. “I love lullabies. When I started making music, I would babysit my stepsister, and I always had Cocomelon on,” he says, referring to the kids’ sing-along channel. “Those melodies permeate my brain, and it’s something that I put into my music.” He also mentions the Eurodance sensation Crazy Frog as an inspiration: “It’s annoying, but it’s memorable.” ‘\n\t\n\n\tEventually, Elkan sent the beat to Drake and was “euphoric” when he first heard the rapper’s verses. “This was something I’d been working on for years,” he says. “To hear the record was thrilling.” \n\n\tAs for advice for other artists, Elkan says high-quality equipment isn’t essential to making high-quality art. “A lot of producers and musicians are all about the gear,” he says. “Honestly, you don’t need any of that. It’s all about you as a human.” \n\n\tAnd in another memorable if annoying turn, the producer can barely ring up a friend these days without hearing his infectious catchphrase on the other line: “Who’s calling my phone?”\n\n\tSongwriters: Drake, Elkan \n\n\tProducer: Elkan \n\n\tLabels: OVO Sound, Santa Anna Records & Republic Records \n\n\tHitmakers: \n\n\tElkan, co-writer and producer \n\n\tTheo Skudra, video director \n\n\tKelly Jeffrey, cinematographer \n\n\tMr. Morgan, president, OVO\n",

    "body": "\n\tLeon Thomas was chilling with his dog Terry while watching the “Elvis” biopic in 2022 when the idea for his breakthrough solo single, “Mutt,” came to him. “[The film] talked about the hound dog, and I was like, man, I want to be on some Black Elvis shit — but find my own way to make it happen,” he recalls.\n\n\tThe 32-year-old Brooklyn native had only recently moved into the foreground as a solo musician, having previously gained fame as a child star on Nickelodeon’s “Victorious” and a hit songwriter for SZA (he was a Variety Hitmaker in 2023 for his work on her smash “Snooze”), Ariana Grande and others. He’d released mixtapes and EPs here and there, but signing with Ty Dolla $ign’s EZMNY Records as its flagship artist in 2022 opened the lane to release his debut album, “Electric Dusk,” and its follow-up, “Mutt,” last year.\n\t\n\n\tThomas wrote the title track knowing it would be the project’s banner single. He already had the chorus in pocket and developed the verses over text with Bizzy Crook before fleshing out the song with producers D. Phelps and Freaky Rob. For the song to hit, Thomas was “looking at it from a pace level,” speeding up the tempo about 10 BPMs for more urgency. “I also knew it was going to be a good radio record because the hook was catchy and singable. I like to call it the ‘drunken fun’ method: Can somebody sing this drunk at a club or at your shows? If it’s not that easy to sing, it’s probably not gonna travel too far.”\n\n\n\tThe theory paid off: Following its release last August, “Mutt” slowly but surely ascended the charts, becoming the third-longest climb to the Top 10 in Billboard Hot 100 history. Now, he’s up for six Grammys, including best new artist. “It’s gratifying, you know?” he says. “I think now is a great moment of just showing how God can develop a human being into what I’m supposed to be at the right time. And there’s no mistakes here.”\n\t\n\n\tSONGWRITERS: Leon Thomas, Rob Gueringer, David Kenneth Phelps, Lazaro A.

    "body": "\n\tAmong the many burning questions about Netflix‘s potential acquisition of Warner Bros. is: What would happen to HBO Max? Would customers continue to subscribe to both, or would it ultimately roll into Netflix?\n\n\tAt least immediately, Netflix has said HBO Max would continue as a separate entity — but makes no promises that it wouldn’t ultimately be consumed into Netflix. HBO becoming a tile on Netflix, just like Hulu being slowly taken over by Disney+, is a likely possibility.\n\t\n\n\tBut here’s one that no one seems to be asking: What about the linear HBO service? You know, the pioneering network that essentially ushered in the cable age when it launched in 1972? HBO, the channel that revolutionized “prestige TV” with “The Sopranos,” and everything that came after that?\n\n\n\tEven if HBO as a brand survives this merger, the idea of HBO as a standalone enterprise may soon be history. And it would also pretty much double as the last nail in the coffin of “premium cable” as we knew it. \n\n\tAlready, Paramount has destroyed the one-vibrant Showtime brand — first, by killing the standalone Showtime app, and then even renaming to remaining linear channel to “Paramount + With Showtime.” Now, there’s no Showtime infrastructure to speak of, and the cabler’s last remaining shows — like the “Dexter” spinoffs and “Yellowjackets” — are instead promoted as Paramount+ originals. Showtime, a flagship premium cable network that first launched in 1976, may live on in bits of leftover branding in some corners of the media universe, but it’s mostly dead.\n\n\tFX wasn’t officially a premium cable network since it’s free on basic cable, but it evolved into a “premium” brand, inspired by the success of HBO in delivering its own diet of high-end, quality fare. Like HBO, FX changed the programming game and for a moment made basic cable a hot place for creators to bring their passion projects, as did AMC during the “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad” eras. FX still exists, but mostly as a tile on Hulu. Not all of FX’s fare airs on the linear channel — which now mostly schedules library movies and repeats. When people talk about “FX,” they’re not talking about the linear channel anymore. (Meanwhile, with the writing on the wall for linear, AMC has attempted to migrate its viewers to its AMC+ streamer, with mixed results.)\n\t\n\n\tAmong the smaller premium channels, MGM+ remains a linear/stream hybrid under Amazon ownership, while Starz also programs a linear suite of channels, even as it prefers to focus on its digital platform. But both would prefer you think of them as digital brands, not legacy TV channels.\n\n\tAnd that brings us to HBO. Even under Warner Bros. Discovery, the pay cabler has been pulling back on its linear offerings: Earlier this year, the company shut down multiplex networks including HBO Family, ThrillerMax, MovieMax and OuterMax. \n\n\tThose cuts came from a company with leadership that was rooted in cable. Imagine, now, how much patience Netflix’s Ted Sarandos might have for what’s left in the HBO linear stable. (The answer? Not much.) Sarandos and Netflix have never shown any interest in owning or operating linear properties, after all. Netflix purposely didn’t include the channels being spun off by the “Discovery” portion of “Warner Bros. Discovery” in its bid. So how long would it tolerate programming HBO linear, rather than forcing those remaining customers to move to digital?\n\n\tRight now, HBO linear subscribers still get free access to HBO Max — which was part of the promise of HBO Max when it initially launched in 2020. Would Netflix put up with those hybrid linear customers accessing the streamer that way? When it comes to cutting costs in the merger, will Netflix decide having a linear network infrastructure still makes sense, or will it be an easy thing to whack off the spreadsheets and the bottom line?\n\n\tJust like the sunsetting era of basic cable, the fate of premium cable perhaps had already been sealed no matter what. In 2024, HBO averaged just 154,000 viewers in primetime — down 7% from the previous year, but a huge slide from recent years (including 726,000. in 2017) as viewership continued its migration to streaming.\n\n\tNetflix launched its original programming efforts in the early 2010s by emulating the HBO model — starting with high-end fare like “House of Cards.” It wanted to out-HBO HBO, and eventually got so big that it went from boutique to warehouse. Now, Netflix has out-broadcast the broadcast networks instead, while HBO remains a high-end bespoke destination, but mostly on HBO Max. Netflix garners a large awards nomination haul thanks to its sheer output volume, but HBO also dominates thanks to its quality curation. \n\t\n\n\tIf Netflix does buy Warner Bros., it will be only a matter of time until premium cable dies. HBO would be just one more brand to add to the Netflix’s bulging menu, alongside the WWE, the NFL and more. The narrative of Netflix vs. HBO has ruled over TV discourse, particularly in the awards space, for more than a decade. But now Netflix might not have to be HBO anymore, nor would it have to beat it — instead, it would just consume it.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThere are eight weeks left on the holy Hollywood awards calendar until Oscar nominations are announced, and it’s not just artists and craftspeople hunting for trophies. Momentum has been building in the auction for the TV rights to air the Academy Awards, Variety has learned through many recent conversations with sources close to the negotiations.\n\n\tThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been seeking a new broadcast licensing agreement for the better part of 2025 – an all-important strategic partnership and revenue source that keeps the AMPAS coffers full, and the industry focused on glorifying movies for theaters as the highest art form in the town (anything else happen today that could threaten theatrical movies?). The Academy is seeking a deal term of 5-10 years for its next contract, numerous sources said.\n\t\n\n\tABC has long been the Academy’s broadcast partner and currently has rights to air the show through 2028, which will culminate in the milestone 100th Oscars ceremony. Over the summer, media reports said a slew of unconventional buyers had come into the mix as potential suitors, including Netflix and YouTube. The field has narrowed as concerns swirl over the real cost of mounting the Oscars in a sector wracked with financial anxiety.\n\n\n\tFor starters, Netflix is out, two sources familiar with the ongoing talks told Variety. While the streamer kicked the tires mid-summer, one of the sources was definitive that the new presumptive owner of Warner Bros. is no longer involved. CBS, owned by David Ellison’s Paramount, was never meaningfully engaged in conversations despite earlier reports.\n\t\n\n\tNBCUniversal has gained ground as an interested party, according to three sources familiar with those Academy discussions. Following a triumphant show with 2024 Summer Olympics, the Comcast company is leaning further into its identity as a producer of live entertainment (look at this month’s ratings for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, a record-shattering 34.3 million viewers across linear TV and Peacock). It also makes perfect sense that NBC would want the Oscars as a tentpole given Universal Pictures’ standing in the filmmaking community. NBCUniversal Entertainment and Studios Chair Donna Langley arguably has the best talent relationships in town, and the studio has more overall talent deals (over 20) than competitors like Warner Bros., Sony, Paramount, Walt Disney Pictures or any of the streamers. One insider with knowledge of the ongoing talks said a particularly attractive selling point for the Academy would be the forthcoming Los Angeles Olympic Games in 2028 – where NBCU could unleash a firehose of marketing synergies to hype its first perspective Oscars broadcast in 2029.YouTube also remains an active bidder in the process, two sources familiar with those talks said. The Google subsidiary has exploded as a viewership juggernaut, representing the most-connected TV app in the U.S. and abroad for the past two years, per Nielsen. One person intimately familiar with YouTube’s wares pointed out that it earns far more viewership on clips and speeches from past Academy Awards broadcasts than the broadcast partners earn for the live event itself.Then there’s ABC. The Disney network has aired most Oscar telecasts throughout history and has been AMPAS’ consistent network partner since 1976. NBC carried the telecast on TV and radio in 1953. The Oscars moved to ABC for a 10-year run in 1961. NBC was back in the mix from 1971 through 1975.\n\n\tBy 2028, ABC will have aired 50 consecutive ceremonies. Sources close to ABC said its Academy relationship goes beyond that of a traditional distributor, with much of the institutional memory surrounding the show hanging in the balance. Two sources were doubtful ABC will make it to the finish line with a new deal and painted the network as “less aggressive” than others involved. There’s also the glaring fact that ABC just negotiated a 10-plus year deal to air the Grammys across linear, Disney+ and Hulu, ending CBS’ long partnership with the recording academy. Another individual familiar with ABC disputed this, saying the network is heavily invested in its Academy partnership. They also extolled the value of Disney’s own corporate synergy – which sees the Oscars promoted at theme parks, on cruises, even in bits and story arcs on scripted programming for ABC and Hulu. The insider was optimistic about the Oscars remaining at ABC, and added that the Grammys in no way diminishes its commitment to Hollywood’s biggest night.\n\n\tWhat the deal comes down to, as it always does, is not gold but green. Dollar figures for what the Academy is asking from each of its potential new partners were difficult for sources to express. In some instances, talks have yet to result in a hardline financial ask for the telecast rights. But there’s a resounding feeling from sources close to NBCUniversal, ABC and YouTube: “We’re not overpaying.”\n\n\tThree separate sources said that ABC spends about $120 million annually for the Oscars, which includes spending on the rights, ceremony production and other institutional support. That figure is eye-popping for top dealmakers in show business, especially given the steady ratings decline all awards shows face in the streaming era. This year’s Conan O’Brien-hosted event pulled in a 5-year ratings high on ABC and Hulu at 19.69 million viewers, but that number is far off the nearly 40 million that watched the show a decade ago.\n\t\n\n\tThe financials get even more complicated for YouTube, as two insiders with knowledge of those talks said the Academy would expect a big premium to sell its rights to an exclusively digital buyer. Filmmakers and talent could revolt at the idea of celebrating cinema on a streaming platform owned by the biggest tech company in the world. Sources at the studios also pointed out a problem in the Oscars having proximity to other content that powers the video service. \n\n\t“Are you going to have the Academy Awards roll into an autoplay of Ms. Rachel?” asked one source, referencing the extremely popular children’s educator who makes her bread on YouTube.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJon M. Chu did not simply direct “Wicked: For Good.” He governed a small nation.\n\n\tFor five years, he lived inside L. Frank Baum’s universe — shaping two films, welcoming three new children, and guiding an army of actors and craftspeople through one of the decade’s most scrutinized adaptations. Yet when Chu speaks now, he avoids talk of scale, spectacle or box office. Instead, he returns to responsibility, trust and the emotional architecture required to shepherd a story as fiercely protected and beloved as “Wicked.”\n\t\n\n\t“When you live with something for five-plus years, and you dream about it and wake up with nightmares right in front of you, it sticks with you,” Chu says during the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast. “I have not processed it yet.”\n\n\n\tListen below!\n\n\tMuch has already been written about the mechanics — the split structure, the risk of adaptation, the evolution of Oz. But in conversation, Chu emerges as a filmmaker defined less by vision than by stewardship. His sets are built on protection, transparency and the willingness to dismantle anything — even a wall — if a scene asks for it.\n\n\tHis creative circle, from cinematographer Alice Brooks to editor Myron Kerstein to composers John Powell and Stephen Schwartz, operates more like a family than a crew. For Chu, assembling this tribe has been the realization of a childhood dream.\n\n\t“All of us are underdogs,” he says with pride. “Nobody in the business fully believes in us, and we’re used to that. You’ve always got to prove yourself on the next movie. That mentality doesn’t get us down — it fires us up.”\n\t\n\n\tTheir loyalty is anchored in a shared tolerance for risk. Chu insists true collaboration requires the courage to be unsettled.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCynthia Erivo is Elphaba in WICKED FOR GOOD, directed by Jon M. Chu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGiles Keyte/Universal Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It’s about being able to feel uncomfortable in those unknown moments and know that you’re protected on all sides,” he says. “If you don’t know the person, everyone’s trying to protect their own reputation. But this — we live in the uncomfortable. We search for that thing.”\n\n\tThat philosophy became essential as “Wicked: For Good” moved through awards season, earning 10 Academy Award nominations, including best picture, though Chu did not receive a directing nod. He shrugs it off with characteristic warmth.\n\n\t“When you’re a kid, you imagine making movies with your friends,” he says. “In the real business, people hire individuals — not groups. So when you find a team who loves their job and shares your heart, it’s everything.”\n\n\tCasting “Wicked,” meanwhile, was an exercise in trust rather than industry math. No conversations about follower counts, marketability or online chatter entered the room.\n\n\t“At first I thought, let’s keep it open to anybody,” Chu says. “The studio never put pressure on us about names or followers. Not one word.”\n\n\tWhat he sought was electricity and the unmistakable charge of destiny.\n\n\t“When Cynthia walks in and sings, you feel it in your bones,” he declares. “And when Ari sat there and became Glinda, there was no question.”\n\n\tChu likens their partnership to discovering a secret too powerful to share before its time. “I knew what everyone is seeing now — I got to see it on day four,” he says.\n\n\tDuring the interview, Chu gravitates again and again toward the story’s emotional weight and startling modernity. When he first revisited the musical during the pandemic, he wondered whether a 20-year-old stage work remained relevant. The answer arrived instantly.\n\n\t“It felt like the most relevant thing I’d ever read,” he says.\n\n\tFor Chu, the story’s resonance is not political but human — a portrait of fractured communities, weaponized narratives and the ease with which society can turn toward villainy.\n\n\t“The truth is not a thing of fact or reason,” he quotes from the film. “It’s just what we all agree on.”\n\t\n\n\tThat line, written decades ago, feels alarmingly current. “Every week it gets more relevant,” he admits. “The pressure is up on a story like this.”\n\n\tWith “Wicked” completed, Chu has turned to his first animated feature, “Oh, the Places You’ll Go,” slated for 2028. His development slate is full, but he is in no rush to choose his next live-action project.\n\n\t“I thought I was going to be exhausted after this,” he says. “But no — I feel energized. I feel like we have a lot more to do.”\n\n\tBefore he can begin again, however, he must say goodbye to the world he built.\n\n\t“I think the office is empty now, which is really sad,” Chu says quietly. “I don’t want it to end.”\n\n\tThen he smiles, with the filmmaker’s instinct flickering.\n\n\t“But that’s storytelling, right? You build something, you live in it completely, and then you have to let it go so other people can make it their own.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker who spent half a decade exploring friendship, loyalty and self-discovery seems to have absorbed those lessons deeply. In Chu’s Oz, the real magic was never the spectacle or the effects — it was the trust, vulnerability and chosen family that made it possible.\n\n\t“That’s through this movie,” Chu says. “We get to link arms and prove to people — and maybe to ourselves — that we could reach this.”\n\n\tThey did.\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is now playing in theaters.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television.

    "body": "\n\tMusician, actor, visual artist and entrepreneur Tyler, The Creator will be honored with the Innovator of the Decade Award at Variety’s annual Hitmakers celebration on Saturday, Dec. 6.  \n\n\t“We’re recognizing Tyler for his completely unique and unmistakable creative vision, which we first saw with Odd Future nearly 15 years ago, and extends across every discipline he touches,” said Variety executive music editor Jem Aswad. “His lyrics, music and production, most recently on his two albums “Chromakopia” and “Don’t Tap the Glass”; his mind-bending videos and stage sets; his film and TV work, from his comedy show ‘Loiter Squad’ to the animated series ‘The Jellies!’ to his forthcoming appearance in Josh Safdie’s A24 feature film ‘Marty Supreme’ (also starring Timothee Chalamet); and his work in apparel, from his own le FLEUR* and Golf Wang fashion lines to his capsule collection with Louis Vuitton and his line of Converse sneakers. It’s all one vision, consistently brilliant and unmistakably Tyler.”\n\t\n\n\tJosh Safdie, writer and director of “Marty Supreme,” says of Tyler’s honor: “Tyler is a rare artist and creator in that everything he does is completely vertically integrated: There is little to no difference between a song and the larger picture, which is the album, or a bottle of cologne, or a T-shirt, or a music video he’s directing, or in this case, with me, a character that he’s developed.\n\n\n\t“One of the reasons I cast Tyler was, A, he’s timeless to his bones, and B, he’s a constant creator and a director and a performer, and the confluence of all those things would allow me to know that any moment within a scene he would not only be present but be bringing ideas. For that I’m incredibly grateful.”\n\t\n\n\tTyler joins previously announced Hitmaker of the Year Sabrina Carpenter, and previously announced honorees Tate McRae, Buddy Guy, Megan Moroney, Role Model, Rosé, BigXThaPlug, Alex Warren, the Marías, Fuerza Regida; Addison Rae, Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser; EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI (the singing voices of HUNTR/X); Sounwave, Mustard and Jack Antonoff; Atlantic Music Group CEO Elliot Grainge; Republic Records; and Riot Games. \n\n\tPresenters at the event include 2024 Hitmakers honoree Laufey, “Sinners” co-star Miles Caton, comedian Jake Shane, multiplatinum producer-songwriters Jimmy Jam and Benny Blanco, and more.   The honorees will also be recognized in the accompanying website and magazine looking back on the year in music and acknowledging the writers, producers, publishers, managers and executives who helped make — and break — the 25 most-consumed songs of the year, as measured by Billboard and Luminate Charts.  This year’s event sponsors include Premier Partner TikTok, who will celebrate the communities and trends that helped make the year’s top 25 songs achieve their hit status with a custom video installation. Additionally, TikTok is the presenting partner of two pre-Hitmakers episodes of Variety’s “Behind the Song” series featuring Madison Beer’s “bittersweet” and Sombr’s “Back to Friends” as well as Sabrina Carpenter’s inaugural episode of the new video series “Variety’s Tour Diaries” (out Dec. 3).  Riot Games is a Premier Partner of the event, and Global Head of Music Maria Egan will accept the Hitmakers Interactive Music in Media Award. Premier Partner Cash App will sponsor a photo booth for guests to take home a snapshot from the event. Eternal Water will be the Official Water Partner and L-Acoustics will be the Official Audio Technology Partner. Dos Equis is the Official Beer Partner of the event. Johnnie Walker Black Label will be an Official Partner, providing signature cocktails including the Go Go Highball.

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Everything Trying,” the Season 1 finale “The Last Frontier, now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tThe season",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “Everything Trying,” the Season 1 finale “The Last Frontier, now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tThe season finale of Apple TV+’s “The Last Frontier” would have looked a lot different if its creators had stuck to their original plan.\n\n\tIn the final hour, CIA agent Sidney (Haley Bennett) and Havlock (Dominic Cooper) corner their former boss Jacque (Alfre Woodard) at a conspicuously vacant but operational dam, pressuring her to fess up to a career of burning agents and feeding them to the wolves –– some of whom had showed up to back the married couple’s coup. But in the chaos of a gunfight, Jacque breaks free and fights Sidney with a literal axe before being sent over the dam to her watery and chilly grave. While fending off Jacque, Sidney is stabbed, leaving U.S. marshal Frank (Jason Clarke) to use a dog sled to transport her to the hospital for a life-saving blood transfusion. Does it get any more Alaskan than that? Then, Havlock fakes his own death while Sidney recovers and faces prosecution, giving the appearance that everything from the season premiere’s plane crash (remember when this was a prisoner-of-the-week show?) is finally cleaned up.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut Frank isn’t buying it. In the end, his plans to open a bed and breakfast with his wife Sarah (Simone Kessell) in their once-quiet corner of the world are immediately jeopardized when Havlock calls his former sparring partner with a warning –– ”Your corner of the world is now the center of everything,” Havlock professes, as he gets ready to stage a prison break for his incarcerated wife, Sidney.\n\t\n\n\tBut none of that was supposed to happen, at least not yet, because creators Jon Bokenkamp and Richard D’Ovidio originally discussed leaving the audience with the bombshell that Sidney was behind the plane crash orchestrated to expose the agency’s secrets. Instead, that revelation came in Episode 7 of the 10-episode first season.\n\n\t“Richard and I had talked for a long time about how the reveal that Sidney was behind the plane crash felt like a great gut punch to take you out at the end of the season, in a Keyser Söze sort of way,” Bokenkamp tells Variety. “But in a time where there are so many cliffhangers on so many shows that stop and come back two years later to pick up the story, we felt like the most fair thing to do for the audience was to have that reveal a little bit earlier. It’s the end of our second act, and then you live with it and let it unfold and see the ramifications of that through the finale.”\n\n\tWith big reveal about Sidney out of the way, the series was able to bring its real villain to the forefront –– Woodard’s cold, calculated bureaucrat Jacque. Originally, the role was written for a “crusty, old white man,” Bokenkamp says. But when Woodard expressed interest, she asked they change only one thing: the character’s name went from Jack to Jacque. Otherwise, Woodard was on board for the incredibly physical finale set piece that begins with a declaration fit for a battlefield  –– “If I must be painted the villain, please, please paint my colors bright,” Jacque screams into the universe as she jams a knife into a guy’s neck.\n\n\t“She was all in,” Bokenkamp says of the Oscar nominee. “She was on those wires clear up in the sky, hanging off sets. She was carrying that axe. It was very physical. She didn’t want to take the edges off, and that got us excited.”\n\n\tSpeaking of the axe, Jacque is out for blood, and she wields an axe to get it from Sidney, who is trying to upload Archive 6 to expose Jacque’s misdeeds. “That axe fight was Daniel Hargrave, our stunt coordinator, and his team,” Bokenkamp adds. “We can script that there are axes in the scene, but it’s not until Daniel and his team get in there that it’s like the crazy cousins at Christmas who go nuts trying to figure out how to make it bigger and crazier.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tUltimately, Jacque’s desperate measures end with her and Sidney dangling from the dam wall, and Jacque has the unfortunate fate of joining the fishes at the bottom. Even with a game Woodard in their arsenal, the creators never second guessed killing her off. They only doubted whether or not they should prove it to the audience.\n\n\t“We needed the satisfaction of somebody going into the drink and knowing that they’re not coming back,” Bokenkamp says. “We had scripted that we found bits of Jacque down the river, but we didn’t quite go that far.”\n\n\tWhile it takes Frank’s sled-dog skills and a tremendous amount of blood, Sidney survives her encounter with Jacque, only to awaken to the crushing reality check of what she has done. In order to avenge her father, she downed a plane with her husband on it, lied to Frank and jeopardized the safety of his entire town. In front of her may be jail time, but she is far more concerned with the personal reckoning that awaits her, even if Frank tries to soothe her guilt with kind words –– “Your father would agree that you’ve spent yourself on a worthy cause.”\n\n\t“She certainly regrets what happened,” D’Ovidio says. “When she found out that the plane was full of inmates and innocent people, that’s where we meet her in the opening scene when she starts drinking in the car. We come back around to that moment to show why she was in so much pain before she goes into that party. She has to put on this face where she pretends she doesn’t know anything about the disaster in front of her. So when you watch it again, I think you will see she was changed all the way back in the beginning.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor now, Frank is also a changed man. After he confessed to his wife and son about really happened in Chicago –– that he planted evidence to get the wrong man convicted of his daughter’s murder –– they come home to the cabin with one request: He must bury the remaining evidence so they can move on (we would have chosen to dispose of it in a river that isn’t a popular fishing hole, but that’s just us). In a flashforward, the family is all smiles as they give the cabin a face lift ahead of the bed and breakfast’s opening. But that’s when Havlock calls, cautioning Frank to not get too comfortable in his quiet life.\n\t\n\n\t“I hope what’s relatable about Frank is that he will always answer that call,” Bokenkamp says. “He doesn’t have to, but it’s who he is. It is his self-concept, you know? I relate to that. We invest so much of ourselves in our work, and it’s not just a job. Frank very much feels that way, perhaps in a little bit of a romanticized way. But that’s a difficult thing to switch off. Whatever the case of the season or week, or who the bad guy is, he’d answer that call if it was a cat in the tree. That’s the impulse Frank has to fight.”\n\n\tBokenkamp and D’Ovidio have already pondered possible Season 2 stories off Havlock’s call, although the series is still awaiting a greenlight from Apple.\n\n\t“I think that we’ve discussed many avenues to take with the second season, but we’ve pretty much exhausted a lot of stories in Alaska,” D’Ovidio says, acknowledging the show changed drastically from the plane crash premiere to the government espionage finale.\n\n\tWith Havlock poised to spring Sidney from jail, a Bonnie and Clyde-style vigilante duo could be one possibility for the future. “We’ve certainly talked a lot about where they end up, maybe a beach somewhere.” Bokenkamp says. “But it also occurs to me that the U.S. Marshals hunt bad guys around the world. Sidney and Havlock represent a problem to Frank, but that doesn’t mean they are his only problem.”\n\n\tSo fans probably shouldn’t bother booking time in the quaint bed and breakfast the Remnicks are building, huh?\n\n\t“Season 2 could certainly involve a bed and breakfast, but it probably won’t be quite like ‘Newhart,” Bokenkamp says with a laugh. “Frank might have to let that one go.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe White House’s social media team had to back down this week on including Sabrina Carpenter‘s “Juno” in a post touting ICE’s migrant arrests — but they’re hardly going away quietly. Shortly after deleting the initial X post, the administration snapped back by posting a new clip of Carpenter doing a commercial for her recent “Saturday Night Live” appearance, with the audio overdubbed so that she appears to be calling cast member Marcello Hernández “illegal” instead of “hot.”\n\t\n\n\tIn the original, unaltered “SNL” commercial, Carpenter stood alongside Hernández and said, “I think I might need to arrest someone for being too hot.” “Oh well, I turn myself in,” responded Hernández, extending his hands, as if to be cuffed. “You’re under arrest!” she cooed. But with the White House’s alteration of the clip, the overdubbed audio now has a voice like Carpenter’s saying “…too illegal,” as the highly popular Latino cast member puts his wrists out.\n\n\n\tThe caption for the TikTok and X video reads: “PSA: If you’re a criminal illegal, you WILL be arrested & deported.” Following the altered footage of Carpenter and Hernández’s repartee, the remainder of the White House’s post — as with the previous, now-deleted video that appropriated Carpenter’s music — consists of footage of immigrants being chased down and arrested.\n\n\n\tCarpenter’s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\t\n\n\tIn the case of the previous video with the “Juno” soundtrack, Carpenter made her feelings clear, writing, “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”\n\n\tThe earlier video consisted of the repetition of the “Juno” lyric “Have you ever tried this one?” accompanying shots of migrants being tackled and detained. It’s not known whether the White House voluntarily deleted the tweet; a version of it on TikTok remained, with the contentious audio removed.\n\n\tThe White House’s initial response to the pop superstar’s objection to having her music used as a soundtrack for the video was to mockingly use Carpenter’s lyrics against her, in a statement. Spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN: “Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”\n\n\tThe White House has seemingly delighted in taunting pop stars and their fans with posts twisting their messages to support pro-ICE or pro-Trump videos. On Nov. 3, the administration’s social media posted a video using Taylor Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia” as the soundtrack for a Trump-glorifying montage. That video remains online.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER WARNING: This story contains spoilers from “HDP,” Episode 6, Season 1 of “Pluribus,” now streaming on Apple TV. \n\n\tSet amid the backdrop of Albuquerque, New Mexico, the world of Carol Sturka (Rhea Seahorn) has forever changed in Apple TV’s “Pluribus.” After the sudden loss of her partner, Helen (Miriam Shor) and the realization that everyone around her has been infected with a seemingly incurable extraterrestrial virus, Carol finds herself in a crossfire of grappling with her grief while simultaneously trying to figure out how to save the world from happiness. As one of only 13 individuals who are immune from the virus, Carol is introduced to others like her who have been spared from The Joining, only to find that those who have not been infected want nothing to do with her plan to find a cure.\n\t\n\n\tIn Episode 2, audiences are introduced to Koumba Diabaté (Samba Schutte), who whisks the other immune people into Air Force One — which he has commandeered — where his desire for opulence and his extravagant personality take center stage. In Episode 6, titled “HDP,” we learn that Koumba has been staying in Las Vegas, living out his wildest fantasies with those in The Joining. When Carol arrives to reveal that the infected have been harvesting and eating human carcasses as protein to survive, the two find themselves at odds in how they are approaching humanity’s demise, all while being monitored from afar.\n\n\n\tSchutte spoke with Variety about Koumba and Carol’s dynamic, Koumba’s inner loneliness — and what he thinks The Joining really think about his character.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat were some of your early conversations with “Pluribus” creator Vince Gilligan leading up to Episode 6?\t\n\n\tEpisode 6 was the first episode I filmed. What I loved about was that it informed me immediately who this guy is, and what he wants. When I talked to Vince, he was very clear that this guy is not a sleaze bag. He’s a kid in a candy store who’s just got access to a genie in a bottle who will give him everything he wants. He did not come from a life of opulence, and then suddenly the world has changed. So of course, he’s going to live it up and be James Bond and have Lamborghinis and self-portraits of himself everywhere.\n\t\n\t\tThere’s a scene in the beginning of the episode where Koumba and some of those who’ve been infected are playing a game of poker, and because they’re infected  only to spread happiness, he asks them to “play along” to replicate experiencing anger. How do those infected view him, do you think, since he’s one of only 13 people who hasn’t become a member of The Joining?\t\n\n\tUp to this point, we’ve seen him embrace this new world and enjoy seeing that these others are so happy and live in harmony. There’s a side of him who’s fascinated by them. He’s fascinated by Zosia [Karolina Wydra], and that she’s all about love and unity and harmony. He sees them as angels on earth who will give him everything he wants. But really, it’s asking who is using who.  \n\n\tAt the end of the day, the others are very clear that they want to turn the original humans without their consent because they will understand once they join. To them, he’s one of the most fascinating people in the universe, because he’s immune to their virus, and at the same time, they see him with love — like, they love Carol unconditionally. They want him to have everything he wants until they can find a way to turn him. There’s a side of him who is very much like, “Yeah, I know what your end game is, so I’m just going to live it up as much as I can while finding a way to keep my individuality too.”\n\t\n\t\tKoumba is essentially the only person who cares about Carol, and continuously tries to make her feel comfortable after she’s been excluded by the others. Does he care for her because he sees pieces of himself inside of her internal loneliness and grief?\t\n\n\tWhat he finds in common with Carol is that loneliness. Both of them don’t have family members. He’s surrounded by supermodels, but he doesn’t have anyone in his life. He sees that she’s lonely, and he’s asking the others [that are not infected] to help her. He cares about her that way, because when she comes to town, everyone just abandons him. He realizes that she’s a lonely person, and he really wants her to not be, and to help give her answers that she needs so she can move on and accept this world. They both just handle it differently.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere’s almost like a sibling dynamic between the two, especially during the moment where they’re sitting at the table eating breakfast and he copies making her avocado egg sandwich.\t\n\n\tIt was so fun to agitate Rhea, because all her notes when we were acting that scene just said, “I want to strangle you.” So yes, it’s very much sibling energy!\n\t\n\t\tKoumba reveals to Carol that unless they consent to having their stem cells extracted from their body, The Joining will not be allowed to change them. Carol makes it clear that she will never consent to it, and it’s revealed that Kouma also didn’t consent to the procedure. \t\n\n\tHe has been doing his own research about what are the rules of the game, and how long does he have left. He’s learned the rules, and he’s so excited to hear that they can’t turn him — because that means he can keep living his wildest dreams. That’s why he’s so excited to find out that they get to enjoy this world, because they will never become one of them without consent. \n\t\n\t\tWe don’t get to see who Koumba was before The Joining began. What would you imagine his upbringing was like?\t\n\n\tWhen I first got the audition, his name was Mr. Koumba. In my culture, Koumba is a woman’s name, but the only way you get a woman’s name is if you take your mother’s name after she’s passed away during childbirth. I thought that was a really interesting detail, and I told that to Vince and he had no idea. We kept that detail, and it really informed who he is. He does not have family members. He came from a place of poverty, did not have opulence. Vince said he did not have a good life before the world changed, and experienced discrimination and racism. Because of this new change in the world, he can just live out his greatest fantasies. He’s seen how rich people act, and there’s that side of him that has this childlike eagerness and curiosity to experience things in life.\n\t\n\t\tIn the final moments of Episode 6, Manousos (Carlos-Manuel Vesga) begins his journey to find Carol in Albuquerque. Since Koumba and Manousos are both on opposite ends on how they are coping with The Joining, how do you think they will get along when they inevitably meet?\t\n\n\tI love Vesga so much, and we keep talking about these two very contrasting guys meeting! Manousos wants to change the world, and save it by killing everybody. Carol wants to save the world by scientifically reversing it, and Koumba wants to save it by stopping people from starving to death and living in harmony. I think that aspect of it is gonna be so fun. Koumba will be like “Relax, here’s a martini! Let’s go to Hawaii!” to Manousos when they meet.\n\t\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed. \n",

The move was intended to remove any risk of danger to the other children in their home.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Shauntel reportedly revealed this information Friday during a custody hearing. The court appearance stemmed from Shantel's ex-husband, Thomas Hudson, reportedly filing an emergency custody motion requesting that a judge grant him custody of their youngest daughter, who lives with Shauntel and Christopher.\n      \n    \n          Thomas's motion was possibly out of concern the stepbrother might harm the daughter he shares with Shauntel.\n      \n    \n          Remember ... Anna was found in a room she was sharing with her stepbrother, asphyxiated from a choke hold. While the FBI is investigating the stepbrother, no charges have been filed and officials have not named a suspect.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Anna was reportedly found by a cabin steward on November 8 -- wrapped in a blanket and tucked under a bed -- during a Caribbean cruise with her family.\n      \n    \n          A recent report claims Anna’s stepbrother allegedly had a weird infatuation with the teen cheerleader ... even climbing on top of her in bed once, according to Steven Westin, the father of Anna’s ex-boyfriend.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Anna Kepner\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

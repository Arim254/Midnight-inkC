    "body": "\n\tThe Golden Globes debuted a new award for best podcast this year — but hugely popular host Joe Rogan claimed he declined to participate, saying he refused to pay the awards org’s $500 submission fee.\n\n\tRogan was among the list of top 25 most popular podcasts that were eligible to be nominated, based on listenership data. But “The Joe Rogan Experience” was not among the six shows that received nominations. Comedian and actor Amy Poehler ended up winning the inaugural Golden Globes podcast award for her talk show “Good Hang.”\n\t\n\n\tOn Thursday’s episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” Rogan said he declined to pay the $500 submission fee to the Golden Globes, saying he turned it down because “I don’t want to be a part of that.”\n\n\n\t“A lot of people say, ‘Why wasn’t Joe Rogan nominated for the Golden Globes? Why did Amy Poehler win?’ I didn’t submit,” Rogan said on the show. “They asked me to submit to be nominated for the Golden Globes and you had to pay $500. And the $500 is like for paperwork or whatever. I said, ‘No.'”\n\n\tRogan said he has not seen Poehler’s podcast but said, “I’m sure it’s good. It won. I’m sure someone must love it. If it sucked, they would give it to someone else, right?”\n\n\tHe continued, “I just know that Amy Poehler won and a lot of people are upset. ‘She’s had a podcast for six months and she won. Great, you gave it to a famous person.’ Which, you know, in that world that’s what they do.”\n\n\t“I just know that I didn’t submit” for the Golden Globes award, Rogan said. “I don’t want to be a part of that. I don’t care. You’re just a group of people that just decide, all of a sudden, that you’re going to give an award out? ‘I get a trophy’? Fuck off!”\n\t\n\n\tIn discussing the Golden Globes’ best podcast award with his guest Bert Kreischer, Rogan claimed, “I already won,” citing his regular position at the top of podcast rankings. The comedian’s interview podcast has been the No. 1 podcast on Spotify for five straight years and also topped the Apple Podcast and YouTube rankings for 2025.\n\n\t“You can’t tell me I didn’t win. I’ve been number one for six years in a row,” Rogan said. “All of sudden, you’re going to have a contest in front of all these people wearing tuxedos and you’re going to say now I’m not number one? Fuck off — I don’t care that I’m number one, but I am, in fact, number,” he said.\n\n\tOther podcasts that were eligible for Golden Globes consideration included “The Megyn Kelly” show. Reps for Kelly said she also declined to formally submit her show for consideration for the award.\n\n\tThe 2026 Golden Globes nominees for best podcast were “Good Hang With Amy Poehler”; “SmartLess,” co-hosted by Poehler’s ex-husband Will Arnett, alongside Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes; “Armchair Expert With Dax Shepard”; Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy”; “The Mel Robbins Podcast”; and NPR’s “Up First.”\n\n\tDisclosure: The Golden Globe Awards and Dick Clark Prods. are owned by Penske Media Corp., parent company of Variety.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Triangle of Sadness” director met with Variety following his explosive presentation of much-anticipated “The Entertainment System Is Down,” which might be heading to Cannes in 2026. Or in 2027. \n\n\tYou don’t care about spoilers, but why did you reveal such crucial plot points at Göteborg Film Festival? Including the ending?\n\n\tWhen I think about some of the directors I really admire, I like it when they make me curious about how they’re going to visualize things. When I watch a movie or hear about a great idea, I don’t care how it ends. All I want to know is: How will it be made? That’s what creates my curiosity. \n\t\n\n\tAround 2005, YouTube changed the way we look at moving images because these videos always give away the ending in the title. Yet, you still click on them. You go to the theater knowing how “Hamlet” will end. When we hear about a film, we’re curious to see how the director and his team will approach it. Cinema must establish a relationship with the audience much more quickly nowadays. Anything that piques their curiosity is something you can use. \n\n\tOne way to quickly establish a relationship with your viewers is to shock them. Or, at the very least, make them uncomfortable. \n\n\tThe goal is to make them think. Shocking them just for the sake of it is not interesting. It’s easy. Making them think is the hard part. They should think about themselves and the themes you want to discuss. I always have to use my own experiences, even if I haven’t lived them myself. Maybe I’ve just heard about them? I think the core of being a director is that you have to look inside yourself and deal with your own experiences and pain.\n\t\n\n\tYou showed some behind-the-scene material, too. Why did you want to build this airplane, basically from scratch?\n\n\tShooting a film on an airplane is extremely difficult. If you’re not careful, you won’t end up with a good movie. For my previous film, I drew the storyboard images myself. But this time, imagine drawing the same storyboard image on an airplane, over and over again. It would be incredibly boring! When our DoP, Fredrik Wenzel, was introduced to VR, he suggested we try it. I was in Mallorca, Fredrik was in Stockholm, and the set designer was here in Gothenburg. We could go into this VR world as avatars, walk around, and talk to each other.\n\n\tYou talked about the dilemmas some of your characters will face. One couple will discover infidelity. Going through something like that somewhere you can’t hide or escape from would be my biggest nightmare. \n\n\tMine too. At the same time, which is something I haven’t mentioned yet, I also shot images outside the airplane. You can see the airplane flying 1,000 kilometers per hour, 10,000 meters above the clouds. Meanwhile, inside, people are fighting about trivial things. It’s absurd. \n\n\tKeanu Reeves is cast as an electrician here. He has appeared in the “Bill & Ted” films [as well as “Good Fortune” in 2025]. However, comedy is not the genre with which he is most associated, would you agree? \n\n\tYes, exactly. He has a very deadpan comedic quality to his acting, and it worked out really well. I’m looking forward to seeing how the audience reacts to his performance. He’s introduced in the film beautifully. When it comes to the lady whose husband dies of heart attack, they are asking him: ‘Excuse me, could you change seats with the widow? She’s in shock. And we have no place to store the body, so you’ll have to sit next to the corpse, you know.’ Playing with the public’s perception of Keanu Reeves in relation to his character in this film was so much fun. \n\n\tIn your work, you often talk about terrible, unpleasant things. And then you make it funny.\n\n\tI’m happy it turns out that way. It’s absurd to make dramas about human beings. Come on, we are quite privileged, right? When I look at my own life and the conflicts I’ve been dealing with, they seem quite trivial. Especially considering we’re all going to die. \n\t\n\n\tI did a retrospective in the U.S. called “In Case of No Emergency” and that title says something about my films. There’s basically never any physical danger. There will be physical danger in this film, but the characters won’t realize it until the last 15 minutes of their lives. We feel that being human is so painful. It’s interesting to examine our herd mentality and how sensitive we are to socializing. I’ve been interested in that for a long time. From the day we’re born, we start training in socialization. Later, it’s possible to just pull the strings and quickly make things quite painful. Out of all feelings, shame is the one that takes over most brain processes. We can almost feel it physically.\n\n\tDon’t you think that feeling shame can be healthy?\n\n\tTrump would probably appear more sympathetic if we could see that he was ever ashamed.\n\n\tEveryone is expecting to see this film at Cannes. Why wait until 2027 which, as you said, might be the case?\n\n\tIn February, we’ll see how much longer we need. As a director, what would be even more important to me is seeing the dynamics in the cinema when people are watching it. I need to be able to conduct test screenings because there are many sensitive elements here, including a 15-minute sequence. I had a painful experience with “Play” because I didn’t have time for test screenings beforehand. I’m not going to put myself in that situation again. Also, I want to maximize my films’ potential. \n\n\tMany European directors, upon hearing “test screenings,” would just run for the hills.\n\n\tThey’re completely wrong because the collective experience of being in a cinema changes the pacing of the film. It’s not about asking the audience: “Did you like this, or did you like that?” It’s about sitting with them as a director and feeling the energy in the room. \n\n\tI started doing this with “Force Majeure,” “The Square” and “Triangle of Sadness” because I felt that European cinema had lost its connection with audiences. It was imitating and copying a certain arthouse tradition. But if you look back at the 1960s, ’70s, or ’80s, the connection with the audience was much better back then. John Cleese fine-tuned the humor in “A Fish Called Wanda” after 12 different screenings. It’s not just about making things comfortable for them.  But it’s very ignorant to think that you don’t have to carefully consider how the audience will react.\n\t\n\n\t(The interview has been edited for clarity and concision.)\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tDuring the 2025-26 season, the Detroit Pistons, led by all-star Cade Cunningham, surprised the NBA with high-level play and tough defense to make a name for themselves at the top of the Eastern Conference. With just the second season under head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, the Pistons have gone from the longest losing streak in NBA history with 28 losses in a row to a promising young future with hopes of winning the conference and, perhaps, the NBA Finals in June.\n\t\n\n\tOn the other side of the ball, the Golden State Warriors are at the tail end of a long run of success with aging superstar Stephen Curry, all-star Draymond Green and head coach Steve Kerr leading the way. Although the Warriors haven’t won the NBA Finals since 2022, the team is still considered a contender — if only for their winning and once-elite past. However, with a recent season-ending injury to one of their all-stars Jimmy Butler, the end may come sooner than later for Golden State.\n\n\n\tThe matchup pits young and old against each other, as the Pistons play to retain their lead in the east, while the Warriors play to clawback into the playoff picture instead of the play-in tournament — where the team is currently seated in the west. Either way, it should be a fun and exciting game in “The City by the Bay.”\n\n\tWith game day on Friday, Jan. 30, you can watch the Detroit Pistons battling against the Golden State Warriors at Chase Center in San Francisco, California on ESPN. Tipoff starts at 10 p.m. ET/7 p.m. PT. ESPN is featured with Sling Orange.\n\n\tRight now, Sling Orange starts at just $4.99 for a Sling 1-Day Pass, or $45.99/month to go month-to-month. The package comes with ESPN for NBA fans, while Sling Orange comes with other networks, like ESPN2, ESPN3 (for ABC simulcasts) and MotorTrend, to watch even more live sports.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Sling Orange also features over 30 other channels, like Disney Channel and FreeForm, as well as A&E, AMC, BBC America, BET, CNN, Comedy Central, Food Network, Fuse, HGTV, History Channel, IFC, Lifetime, Nick Jr., QVC, TBS, TNT, Travel Channel, Vice and other channels.\n\n\tIn addition, Sling now has flexible subscriptions, so brand new subscribers can get access to Sling Orange for a short period of time. This is best for sports because it’s a super fast and convenient way to access live TV.\n\n\nSling 1-Day Pass: $4.99, Sling Orange for 24 hours\nSling 3-Day Pass: $9.99, Sling Orange for 3 days\nSling 7-Day Pass: $14.99, Sling Orange for 7 days\n\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, all Sling TV plans have live TV over the web, on-demand movie and TV shows, 50 hours of cloud DVR storage and up to three streams across devices — such as smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, laptops, web browsers and others — at the same time.\n\n\tOn Saturday, Jan. 30, you can livestream the Detroit Pistons vs. Golden State Warriors, with a start time of 10 p.m. ET/7 p.m. PT on ESPN with Sling Orange, below:\n\n\tPlease note: Prices and channel availability depends on your local TV market.

Dedicated to recognizing those who have made a significant contribution to the advancement of the Texas film and media industry, the awards will take place on March 5 at Troublemaker Studios in Austin, Texas. \n\n\tSchnabel will be honored for his contributions to cinema, including his bold paintings and acclaimed art films “Basquiat” and “Before Night Falls.” The artist and filmmaker spent his formative years in Brownsville, Texas and studied at the University of Houston. Since, he’s won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director and the Golden Globe Award for Best Director. \n\t\n\n\tBorn and raised in Austin, Chandler will receive the Rising Star Award for her work in films including “Alien: Earth,” “Pistol,” “Don’t Worry Darling” and “Sugar.” The actress is deeply connected to the Austin community, where she is involved with organizations including the Austin Farm Sanctuary. \n\n\n\tHaving appeared in more than 50 film and television productions over his decades-long career, Texas native Davis’ credits include “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” “Thelma & Louise” and “The ’Burbs.” But Davis first became cemented in Texas independent film history after his turn in the Texas-set 1983 film “Last Night at the Alamo.”\n\n\tIn celebration of the 25th anniversary of “Spy Kids,” the film will receive the Star of Texas Award, which is awarded to iconic Texas film and television shows. Shot across Austin and San Antonio, “the 2001 film ‘Spy Kids’ has become a landmark Texas-made film, having helped establish Austin as a major production hub for director, writer, and producer Robert Rodriguez and producer Elizabeth Avellán’s Troublemaker Studios,” the festival said in a statement. Rodriguez, Avellán and members of the principal cast will be in attendance at the awards. \n\t\n\n\tMusician Adrian Quesada and AFS Board member Celeste Quesada are the evening’s chairs, and Noah and Kyle Hawley, co-founders of 26 Keys Productions, will serve as the event’s honorary hosts.  The awards will benefit the Austin Film Society’s artistic and educational programs as well as grants, which have awarded nearly $3 million to more than 700 independent film projects since 1996. \n\n\tPrevious inductees to the Texas Film Hall of Fame include Carol Burnett, Matthew McConaughey, Willie Nelson, Ethan Hawke, Renée Zellweger, Luke Wilson, Sissy Spacek, Glen Powell, Shirley MacLaine, Forest Whitaker, Paul Thomas Anderson, Michelle Rodriguez, Noah Hawley, Farrah Fawcett, Guillermo del Toro and Margo Martindale.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The White Lotus” Season 4 is adding three new cast members. \n\n\tHelena Bonham Carter, Chris Messina, and Marissa Long are all set to join the new season of the hit HBO series. Bonham Carter and Messina had previously been reported to be in talks for roles this season, but it had not been official until now. \n\n\tAs is usually the case with “The White Lotus,” exact character and plot details are being kept under wraps. The new trio joins previously announced cast members Steve Coogan, Caleb Jonte Edwards, Alexander Ludwig, and AJ Michalka. \n\t\n\n\tAs previously reported, Season 4 will take place in France, including Paris and multiple locations along the French Riviera. Series mastermind Mike White is the writer, director, and executive producer. David Bernad and Mark Kamine also executive produce.\n\n\n\tHer appearance in “White Lotus” will mark Long’s television debut. \n\n\tBonham Carter has received two Oscar nominations in her career — one for best supporting actress for “The King’s Speech” and the other for best actress for “The Wings of the Dove.” She is also a nine-time Golden Globe nominee, including nods for her work in films the like the aforementioned two as well as “Sweeney Todd” and for her role in two seasons of “The Crown.” She is likewise a five-time Emmy nominee, including two for “The Crown” along with “Merlin,” “Live From Baghdad,” and “Burton and Taylor.” Her other notable film roles include “Fight Club” and the “Harry Potter” film franchise. \n\n\tMessina’s recent TV credits include “Based on a True Story” at Peacock, the Starz Watergate drama “Gaslit,” Season 3 of the popular USA Network series “The Sinner,” and HBO’s “Sharp Objects.” He is perhaps best known for his role on the comedy series “The Mindy Project,” in which he starred as Danny Castellano. On the feature side, Messina has been in films like “Air,” “Argo,” “Away We Go,” “Juror #2,” “I Care A Lot,” and “Birds of Prey.” \n\t\n\n\tBonham Carter is repped by Conway Van Gelder Grant. Messina is repped by Entertainment 360, CAA, and Sloane Offer. Long is repped by Canopy Media Partners, Next Model Management and Yorn Levine Barnes. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJay Duplass is back where he always wanted to be — behind the camera. \n\n\tIn the early aughts, Jay and and his brother Mark exploded on the indie scene with low-budget mumblecore offerings like “Cyrus,” “Baghead” and “The Puffy Chair” that were produced for a fraction of the price of most features. The siblings were scrappy self-starters with an entrepreneurial streak, and, for awhile, they embodied a kind of DIY filmmaking that paved the way for other directors to operate outside the studio system. In recent years, however, the brothers found themselves in greater demand as actors. Mark Duplass appeared in everything from “Zero Dark Thirty” to “The Morning Show,” while Jay Duplass scored raves for his supporting turn in “Transparent.”\n\t\n\n\tBut deep down, Jay Duplass still wanted to be calling the shots. In 2025, he directed “The Baltimorons,” a comedy about a man in desperate need of emergency dental surgery that won the Audience Award at SXSW before getting picked up by IFC and Sapan Studios. It was the first movie he directed in 13 years and one of the only ones he made without Mark. \n\n\n\t“It felt like a comeback,” Duplass says during a recent sit-down at Variety‘s midtown Manhattan office. “And it felt good to be doing what I really love again.”\n\n\tDuplass has followed that up with “See You When I See You,” an adaptation of Adam Cayton-Holland’s memoir “Tragedy Plus Time: A Tragi-Comic Memoir.” The film dramatizes a comedy writer dealing with his sister’s suicide and stars Cooper Raiff, one of the Duplass’ directing protegés, as well as David Duchovny, Hope Davis and Kaitlyn Dever. “See You When I See You’s” mixture of humor and tragedy resonated at the Sundance Film Festival, where the film earned a standing ovation at its world premiere.\n\t\n\n\t“I cried really hard when I read the script and I laughed really hard too,” Duplass says. “This is a family that is very intelligent and very good at navigating life in general. But this is so much bigger than them and it really sends them spinning. And I think a lot of people can relate to that feeling.” \n\n\tOver a wide-ranging conversation, Duplass talked about orchestrating “See You When I See You’s” tonal shifts, as well as the struggles of making personal films in an industry that loves to sand off all the edges. \n\t\n\t\tUntil “The Baltimorons” was released last year, you took a long break from directing features. What was behind that gap? \t\n\n\tThe last movie Mark and I made together was in 2012 with “Jeff, Who Lives at Home.” Mark started to become kind of a famous actor around that time. Then the mini-major studios where we worked were going away as TV and streaming were becoming bigger. So we did “Togetherness” for HBO as a TV show, and then I became an actor accidentally when I was hired for “Transparent.” So that set me down this path of acting in other people’s movies and shows. At a certain point I realized, I miss making movies. That’s actually where my heart is. It’s always been there.\n\t\n\t\tWhat appealed to you about “See You When I See You”?\t\n\n\tIt is a little bit of an heir to “The Big Sick,” but the humor is darker and it’s more tragic, because someone has died in this story. This movie is about when terrible things happen, are you going to be able to climb out of it? Some people talk about it as a grief movie, because this family is grieving the loss of the daughter. But that’s not really what the plot is about. The plot is about this kid who has PTSD, and he doesn’t know it.\n\t\n\t\tWhat made you think of Cooper Raiff for the lead ? \t\n\n\tA long time ago, Cooper tweeted at me, “You’re my favorite filmmaker! I dare you to watch this thing I made.” And I watched this little documentary and eventually I helped him develop that into his first movie, “Shithouse.” So I was kind of like ghost producer movie dad for him and we’ve been close ever since. Now, “See You When I See You” is not a cheap movie, so most companies would probably want somebody famous in that role. And even though Cooper is known, he’s not selling territories overseas. But, he has this very unusual combination of having emotional access to everything, and being very funny and willing to laugh at himself. I just couldn’t find anyone else with that level of confidence and as well that level of vulnerability. It had to be Cooper. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou used to direct as a duo with your brother Mark. Do you still work together? \t\n\n\tMark and I are still super close. Even though we’re not directing together, we’re running a production company. We’ve been able to consciously uncouple as writer-directors. We’re actually getting along better now than ever. There’s something about being a director team, that puts you on this forced march. You’re spending so much time together. It was weird to go to a party and have somebody be like, “where’s your brother?” It’s like, “I am a full fledged human being.” I don’t need someone to finish my sentences, even though that’s what we will do if we are together. Now, we’re still sharing ideas, but when we get together, it’s because we decide to get together. \n\t\n\t\tDoes one of you like directing more than the other? \t\n\n\tHonestly, it took us like 13 or 14 years to figure out that I can’t live without directing and that he is not that interested in it at all. He’s definitely much more of a producer. He likes to have a lot of things going on and to apply a light touch to all of them. I just want to do one thing. I want to pour all my concentration into that project.\n\t\n\t\tHas your experience acting changed the way you direct?\t\n\n\tIt’s taken the preciousness out of it. It’s made me more comfortable with actors and acting. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“See You When I See You”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJim Frohna\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen you started out, you got a lot of attention for making micro-budgeted movies. Your first film, “The Puffy Chair,” cost $15,000. Digital technology has made it possible to make movies cheaply and platforms like YouTube have made it easier to distribute work. But is it harder to get attention for the movies people make today?\t\n\n\tIt is harder to get movies seen overall, just because there are so many more movies being made. It’s so competitive. That said, it’s incredibly difficult to make a good movie. Everything has to come together. It’s wonderful that we have democratized the process and that people feel more empowered. I just don’t know if people have enough fear and respect for how hard it is to really pull it off. It’s a very complex art form. Buyers have told me there are a lot of movies out there, but there aren’t a lot of good movies. \n\t\n\t\tWhat are your thoughts about AI? Obviously, it’s very disruptive and it could lead to fewer jobs, but it also has the potential to lower costs, which could result in more artistic freedom. \t\n\n\tIt’s scary, and it’s scary exciting. There’s a movie that I would like to make that cost $12 million and it’s been hard to set it up. And someone recently proposed to me that that movie could easily cost $6 million if I used AI for the complex, big, sweeping scenes I want to shoot. And I was like, “Well, I don’t want to take the jobs away from people that would get that job.” And they were like, “Well look at it this way. If you can’t get the movie made, nobody is going to get any jobs.” I don’t know how I feel. Ethically, it’s something that I’m still mulling over. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat about AI generated movies? Do those scare you?\t\n\n\tNot really. AI is taking all these elements that audiences have liked before and putting them all together. It’s like audiences like dogs and flying people and cities exploding. We’ll throw them in one script. But when you combine all those things it just feels cookie cutter. \n\t\n\t\tI keep reading obituaries for cinemas. Do you feel optimistic about the state of indie film? \t\n\n\tI do. I think audiences are starting to come back. It’s still tough out there. We’re competing with TikTok and streaming. That’s what we’re all up against. But I have faith. This is the art form I grew up on. You know what my least favorite word in our industry is? “Content.” I’m not making content. I’m making a fucking movie. I’m making a piece of art. \n",

For one thing, Abrams says she \"absolutely\" backs Democrats holding up this week's major funding package ... voting no on the package would restrict a substantial amount of money that's already been allotted to ICE.\n      \n    \n          If the Senate can't cut a deal by Friday night, the country faces another government shutdown following the 43-day closure in October into November -- the country's longest. All Democratic senators and seven Republicans blocked the package Thursday as negotiations continue ahead of the deadline.\n      \n    \n          The way Abrams sees it, the Senate has a responsibility to represent the United States citizens, and that means \"not funding a masked, armed military that is roving our streets and killing our citizens.\"\n      \n    \n          But while this all sounds scary, Abrams assured us she says she's not afraid. \"I'm determined,\" she said. \"It's one of the reasons I launched the 10 Steps Campaign.\"\n      \n    \n          Go to 10StepsCampaign.org to learn more about what dangers Abrams thinks our country is facing and how to get on a better path.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                ICE\n              \n                          \n                Politics\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Shootings\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

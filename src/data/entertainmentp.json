    "body": "\n\tTony Dokoupil suddenly has fewer people helping him produce each day’s broadcast of “CBS Evening News.”\n\n\tA significant chunk of the production team behind “CBS Evening News” has opted to take buyouts that were offered in late January, according to three people familiar with the matter, the latest sign of ambivalence by journalists at CBS News regarding the plans of the unit’s leader, Bari Weiss. She recently articulated a new vision that would place more focus by the Paramount Skydance operation on streaming video and stories that are “differentiated, that are things you can’t get anywhere else.”\n\t\n\n\tApproximately 11 members out of a production staff of about 40 have opted to leave, according to these people. Some of the depatures come from among the youngest members of the CBS News staff, two of these people say, a dynamic that has raised concern about the ability to bring new perspectives to familiar routines. At least two employees taking the buyouts, however, were veteran producers, who played significant roles in getting “CBS Evening News” out each weekday.\n\n\n\tCBS News declined to make executives available for comment.\n\n\tThe exodus puts a new spotlight on CBS News under Weiss, whose experience is largely tied to opinion writing and not the ins and outs of newsgathering. Weiss’ lack of knowledge has resulted in several errors since her arrival in October, after Paramount bought her conservative-opinion site The Free Press for $150 million. There have been entanglements with “60 Minutes”; exits by senior executives; and a rough start for Dokoupil’s new tenure at “CBS Evening News” following comments he made online about his intentions for his new job.\n\t\n\n\tOne senior producer, Javier Guzman, left “Evening News” in January, with people familiar with the matter saying he had issues with the new direction of the program. Several of the producers leaving were previously tied to an uptick in production of investigative segments that were aired under the rubric “Eye on America.” But that has changed as part of Dokoupil’s tenure.\n\n\tThere are still sings of a stressed out staff. On Wednesday, a letter from one producer, Alicia Hastey, described a scenario under which stories might be judged by Weiss’ take on a certain topic, rather than the facts that are gathered. “Stories may instead by evaluated not just on their journalistic merit, but on whether they conform to a shifting set of ideological expectations — a dynamic that pressures producers and reporters to self-censor or avoid challenging narratives that might trigger backlash or unfavorable headlines.” Hastey is among the staffers leaving the program.\n\n\tHastey could not be reached for immediate comment on the note she wrote.\n\n\tDuring a January town hall, Weiss restated a mantra she has used since her arrival at CBS News — mainstream media is no longer trusted — and stressed that CBS News had to be a place where viewers could come to hear all sides of a debate, even if doing so made them uncomfortable. Independent Americans “want to equip themselves with all the facts,” she said at the time, “and are curious to hear what is actually going on, even if it offends their sensibilities.”\n\n\tThere are good reasons to shake up “CBS Evening News.” The program has long run in third place behind ABC’s “World News Tonight” and NBC’s “NBC Nightly News.” Before Dokoupil, CBS News experimented with a two-anchor format that relied on Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson, as well as an emphasis on enterprise and feature reporting. Viewers did not embrace the concept, and ratings dropped.\n\n\tFor the four days ended December 5, “CBS Evening News” notched an average of nearly 4.57 million viewers, according to data from Nielsen, compared with 8.98 million for ABC’s “World News Tonight” and about 7.23 million for “NBC Nightly News.” All three networks did not submit their Friday newscasts for consideration owing to the start of the Winter Olympics. And while both the NBC and ABC programs captured an average of 1.1 million or more people between 25 and 54 — the audience coveted by advertisers in news programming – CBS’s show only lured 579,000 — a 7% downturn from the previous week and a decline of 14% from the year-earlier period.\n\t\n\n\tSome of the staffers leaving are said to have become “a bit intransigent,” according to one of the people familiar with the matter, largely because they were tied to production of features, which are being scaled back. Older producers who are leaving are doing so, this person says, because the exit offer is a generous one.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMichaela Coel‘s new series is setting up an all-star cast. \n\n\t“First Day on Earth,” an HBO and BBC co-production originally announced in August 2024, has cast the following actors: Thandiwe Newton (“Anaconda,” “God’s Country”) as Anya, Maxine Peake (“I Swear, Say Nothing”) as Helen, Danny Sapani (“Halo,” “Harlots”) as Ernest, and Ncuti Gatwa (“Doctor Who,” “Sex Education”) as Darren. \n\n\n\tProduction is now underway on the 10-episode series, which marks Coel’s first series writing credit since her smash hit series “I May Destroy” debuted in 2020. \n\t\n\n\tThe official logline states: \n\n\t“British-Ghanaian novelist Henri (Coel) is on the run – from herself, her life, her partner, and that weird guy at her book talk. When she ends up in Ghana, her ancestral homeland, she finds herself submerged in an altogether different world. Amidst new friends, fresh joy, and many different and nuanced relationships, Henri also finds secrets, lies, difficulty, and denial, leading her to question everything about herself, her heritage, and her family.”\n\n\tCoel is an executive producer and director on the show in addition to writing and starring. Additional executive producers are Sam Miller, Jesse Armstrong, Phil Clarke and Roberto Troni for Various Artists Limited, Jo McClellan for the BBC, and A24. Johann Knobel will produce, while Miller will also direct. The series is a Various Artists Limited production, co-produced by HBO and the BBC in association with A24. \n\n\t“I May Destroy You” quickly became one of the most celebrated shows of the year upon its release. Coel won the Emmy Award for outstanding writing for a limited series, with the show also winning the Emmy for outstanding music supervision out of its nine total nominations.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJay Shetty, bestselling author, entrepreneur and host of popular podcast “On Purpose,” is expanding into TV and film with his new production company, Perfect Strangers Media.\n\n\tL.A.-based Perfect Strangers (perfectstrangersmedia.com) will produce film, TV and podcasts devoted to “telling stories that remind us we’re not alone,” according to the company. “Perfect Strangers is the home for stories that show how connected we already are.”\n\t\n\n\tTo date, the company has closed deals on two projects with Netflix: one a scripted series in development and the other one an unscripted series. (Perfect Strangers declined to provide details on the series.) In addition to those, the company is actively developing a broad slate of series and films.\n\n\n\tPerfect Strangers currently has one yet-to-be-released podcast in production with several additional podcast shows in development. Shetty’s “On Purpose” continues to be part of iHeartMedia’s iHeartPodcasts network. His company’s podcast arm brings together musicians, actors, athletes, founders, creators, experts and thinkers for “honest conversations that make you laugh, go deeper, and think, ‘I’ve felt that too,’” according to Perfect Strangers.\n\n\tThe British-born Shetty, a former Hindu monk, uploaded his first video to Facebook and YouTube more than nine years ago before he went viral — and his fanbase exploded.\n\n\t“I didn’t know where it would lead, I just knew I wanted to make ancient wisdom more accessible to a modern audience,” Shetty said in a statement. In 2019, his mission evolved into the podcast “On Purpose With Jay Shetty” with “the vision to make the world healthier, happier and more healed. And now, through Perfect Strangers, I’m expanding that vision to make people feel less alone and show us how connected we all really are.”\n\t\n\n\tShetty added that connectedness is “something that is so needed especially now. It has been incredible to see the real impact of everything we’ve created thus far and I am so excited to see what’s to come. This feels like just the beginning.”\n\n\tPerfect Strangers’ leadership includes Joe Hooten as head of film and TV. In this role, Hooten oversees the development and production of projects. Hooten brings over seven years of experience from John Wells Productions, where he worked on projects including “Untamed,” “Maid,” “Shameless” and “Rescue: Hi Surf.” Nicole Berg, who has worked with Shetty for the last four years, will serve as Perfect Strangers’ creative director, tasked with ensuring creative continuity across ventures and brand storytelling.\n\n\tIn 2020, Shetty released his debut book, “Think Like a Monk,” which topped bestseller lists, followed by his second bestseller in 2023, “8 Rules of Love,” in response to the most common questions he received during the pandemic about love and relationships.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video has released the first trailer for “Spider-Noir,” the live-action series starring Nicolas Cage as the shadowy Spider-Man variant. “Spider-Noir” is set to release May 27.\n\n\tThe trailer follows Cage’s down-on-his-luck detective Ben Reilly, aka the web-slinging Spider-Man Noir, who he voiced in “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” While Cage’s animated performance helped popularize the trench coat–wearing web-slinger, the Prime Video series is inspired by the “Spider-Man Noir” comic books rather than the Sony animated films.\n\t\n\n\tSet in 1930s New York, “Spider-Noir” centers on an aging private investigator who is forced to reckon with his former life as the city’s only superhero. The series will be released in both black-and-white and color, leaning into the genre’s classic noir influences. The trailer shows Cage swinging through the city, jumping from cars, beating up crooks in a bar and getting “plastered” afterwards.\n\n\n\tCage leads an ensemble cast that includes Lamorne Morris, Brendan Gleeson, Abraham Popoola, Li Jun Li, Karen Rodriguez and Jack Huston. Guest stars include Lukas Haas, Cameron Britton, Cary Christopher, Michael Kostroff, Scott MacArthur, Joe Massingill, Whitney Rice, Amanda Schull, Andrew Caldwell, Amy Aquino, Andrew Robinson and Kai Caster.\n\n\t“Spider-Noir” is produced by Sony Pictures Television exclusively for MGM+ and Prime Video. Harry Bradbeer (“Fleabag,” “Killing Eve”) is directing and executive producing the first two episodes, with Oren Uziel (“The Lost City,” “22 Jump Street”) and Steve Lightfoot (“Marvel’s The Punisher,” “Shantaram”) serving as co-showrunners and executive producers. The series was developed with “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” filmmakers Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and Amy Pascal, who also executive produce.\n\t\n\n\tThe series is set to debut domestically on MGM+’s linear channel, followed by a global rollout on Prime Video the next day.\n\n\tWatch the black-and-white and full-color trailers below.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWith his latest anthology series, “Love Story,” executive producer Ryan Murphy is putting his stamp on some of the most enthralling couples across history. Created by Connor Hines and based on Elizabeth Beller’s biography, “Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy,” FX’s “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette” is an enchanting and heartbreaking show about a magnetic young couple whose glittering relationship was shackled amid obligation, history, fame and relentless media attention. A sweeping and sexy 1990s-set tale, “Love Story” showcases the intensity of romance and how it can shatter or reinforce the life you’re trying to live.\n\t\n\n\t“Love Story” opens at the end. It’s July 16, 1999, and Bessette Kennedy (an absolutely enchanting Sarah Pidgeon) is tucked in the back of a Manhattan nail salon as paparazzi swarm the building. Though she is stunning and statuesque, Carolyn seems small, folding in on herself as she walks through the sea of flashing lights to her waiting car. From the moment Carolyn arrives at the airstrip to meet her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr. (Paul Anthony Kelly), and her older sister Lauren (Sydney Lemmon), it’s clear that there is tension between the couple. Despite the friction, their love remains palatable. They kiss before boarding the small passenger plane piloted by John as they take off for Martha’s Vineyard.\n\n\n\tThough John and Carolyn’s story ends tragically, it begins very differently: Dialing back seven years, the audience meets Carolyn in the summer of 1992. Effortlessly cool and stylish, she works as a sales associate for Calvin Klein (Alessandro Nivola). Her self-assurance and eye for fashion are quickly recognized by Calvin and his wife, Kelly Klein (Leila George), who initially bring her on to work with VIP clients and eventually to the company’s executive team as a publicist. Elsewhere in the city, after failing the bar again, the constantly affable John is holding on to his job as an assistant district attorney and his on-again/ off-again relationship with actress Daryl Hannah (Dree Hemingway) by a thread. However, fate intervenes on one summer night in New York City. During one of Calvin’s events, John and Carolyn cross paths. Amid a tantalizing meet-cute, it’s clear something is brewing between them.  \n\t\n\n\tAcross nine episodes (critics received eight for review), with a nostalgic 1990s soundtrack including songs from Peter Gabriel and Sade floating in the background, John and Carolyn are drawn together. At first, they orbit around one another, focused on other romantic relationships, deaths and successes. Ultimately, the twosome succumbs to the passionate, all-consuming chemistry between them, setting off the literal fight to merge their lives. \n\n\t“Love Story” is compelling because it truly grounds viewers in both Carolyn and John’s worlds. A woman who knows exactly who she is and what she wants, Carolyn is endlessly captivating. Contrastingly, though John has a striking presence, he seems to be sleepwalking through his own fishbowl-esque life, unable to live up to his mother, Jackie’s (Naomi Watts) expectations, or to create real boundaries between himself and the limelight, as his sister, Caroline (Grace Gummer), urges him to do. Living in two completely different worlds, the duo appears doomed before they even begin.\n\n\tIn “Love Story,” the direct parallels of Carolyn’s experience with those of the late Princess Diana and, more recently, Meghan Markle are extremely palpable, especially in the penultimate episode, “Exit Strategy.” Examining how Carolyn’s entire existence is swallowed up by the Kennedy machine at the macro level is an important component of the narrative. Still, what’s most compelling is the series’ examination of modern-day marriage from a woman’s perspective. Carolyn begins as a blazing comet, effortlessly shining her light on anyone who encounters her. However, by Episode 7, “Obsession,” she becomes someone else entirely, a shell of a person imprisoned by the relentlessness of the press, misogyny, the weight of legacy and a man who can’t grasp why she isn’t able to bloom in a gilded cage. It is a striking, painful juxtaposition.\n\n\tOverall, “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette” is a thoughtful show that centers on the sacrifice of long-term commitment, chemistry, incompatibility and the thunderous chaos of fame. It paints a beautifully devastating portrait of a couple desperately trying to love each other in a society determined to possess them.\n\n\tThe first three episodes of “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette” stream on Hulu and FX at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET on Feb. 12, with the remaining episodes streaming weekly on Thursdays.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBloomberg enjoys a close relationship with stock-market aficionados and financial stakeholders, particularly during the hours when stocks trade. Now the business-news giant is working to cultivate those ties at times when trading isn’t paramount.\n\n\t“Bloomberg This Weekend,” a three-hour broadcast that airs from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday, will debut February 28. The show, hosted by David Gura, Christina Ruffini, and Lisa Mateo, will simulcast worldwide across Bloomberg’s audio, video and digital platforms, and offer real-time reporting, as well as stories on politics, lifestyle and culture to its audience. Carolyn Cremen, a veteran of CBS News and CNN, will serve as executive producer.\n\t\n\n\t“This is an opportunity to keep people interested in the Bloomberg TV and audio universe seven days a week,” says Anthony Mancini, head of global audio at the company, during a recent interview. “If we do that, that’s a victory.”\n\n\n\tBecause the three hours of programming will be available across all of Bloomberg’s media platforms simultaneously, the show can travel with listeners as they move about their weekend activities, says Mancini. :”When you get up and have your coffee, you can watch it in your living room. And as you make your way out the door, you can catch it on the radio, or depending on where you are, on mobile apps.”\n\n\tBloomberg has for some time used weekends to show a mix of paid programming and repeats of some of its original series, including series such as “Wall Street Week,” “Bloomberg Next Africa,” and “Leaders with Lacqua.” Some more recent episodes of series such as “Mishal Husain Show” and Peer to Peer with David Rubenstein” have also turned up on the weekend schedule.\n\t\n\n\tBut big breaking news stories surfacing on the weekends offered proof to Bloomberg executives that the company’s audience was active during off hours, says Mancini. When Bloomberg broke into weekend programming with live coverage of events taking place in Iran and Venezuela in the recent past, the executive says, audience levels “increased by two to three times from what were normal levels.”\n\n\tThe new weekend program will pull some of its story segments from Bloomberg properties, including some of the company’s various newsletters. But executives also hope to give viewers and listeners information that will help them  in the business week ahead, Mancini says. While the program is meant to keep Bloomberg’s audience engaged over the weekend, he says, it can also serve to assemble crowds for Monday morning.\n\n\tGura has been with Bloomberg TV and Radio since 2024, his second stint with the company after loggign time at NPR and MSNBC.  Ruffini  joins Bloomberg after serving as a contributing host for NBC, MSNBC and The Atlantic Live. She previously served as a White House and State Department correspondent for CBS News. Mateo will serve as a news anchor, and joins the team from Bloomberg Surveillance Radio, Prior to joining Bloomberg, Mateo was a news anchor for the CBS News Radio Network and a television correspondent for CBS Newspath. She will continue hosting global conferences for Bloomberg Live.\n",

    "description": "\n\t“The Simpsons” may have saved Yeardley Smith’s life. As the show reaches a remarkable 800 episodes — with more seasons and a new movie still to come",
    "body": "\n\t“The Simpsons” may have saved Yeardley Smith’s life. As the show reaches a remarkable 800 episodes — with more seasons and a new movie still to come — Smith recently revealed to Variety that her role on the animated staple gave her the ability to survive a nearly devastating accident 10 years ago.\n\n\tSmith, who voices the jazz-loving, vegetarian and intellectual 8-year-old Lisa Simpson, fell down a flight of stairs in 2016 and broke her neck. \n\t\n\n\t“I separated my C5 and C6 [spinal level] like a cigar cutter, and my spinal cord was threaded up through and almost snapped. I almost died,” she says. “Because of this job, I had good health insurance. But mostly, I had time. It took me over a year of full-time dedication to my recovery to get back to a place where you’d never know I broke my neck if I didn’t tell you.”\n\n\n\tAt that point, Smith had already been on “The Simpsons” for 600 episodes, and enjoyed a financial cushion that comes with being on such a long-running smash. That put her in the fortunate place to take the time to heal without worry.\n\n\t“I recognize what a luxury that is, how extraordinarily fortunate I am to have been able to do that,” she says. “My life was disrupted by the injury, but not monetarily. That’s such an extreme example of the many gifts this job has given me — apart from the joy playing a character that I absolutely adore, that I aspire to be more like every day. She’s like the best version of all of us.”\n\n\tAmong other things, “The Simpsons” also allowed Smith to launch her own production company, which makes the long-running true crime podcast “Small Town Dicks.”\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, Nancy Cartwright, the voice of rebellious 10-year-old Bart Simpson, says the show gave her the freedom to raise a family, write books, perform in a few one-woman shows and launch a nonprofit.\n\n\t“Until it really comes to an end, it’s so much a part of the fabric of my life,” Cartwright says. “I don’t feel like I take it for granted. I really love this show. It’s just kind of everything, personally, that I ever dreamed of doing. But it’s so much more than that. There are so many perks to being a part of such an incredible legendary show.”\n\n\tYes, there were several cast renegotiations that got a bit contentious, but as Smith notes, “I feel like it’s just business. I don’t take it personally.”\n\n\tThese days, “The Simpsons” headlines focus much more on the ever-evolving storylines — and misguided Internet memes. In recent years, hot takes (Marge is dead! Homer is no longer strangling Bart! Duffman is fired!) have consumed the Internet, inspiring a mix of amusement and chagrin from executive producer Matt Selman.\n\n\t“We did a throwaway joke about Duffman not being Duffman anymore, and everyone was like, ‘“The Simpsons” retires beloved character,’ and I don’t think we did,” Selman says. “When it’s funny, Homer should still strangle Bart.” And no, Marge Simpson is not dead.\n\n\tAccording to Selman, there’s no way “The Simpsons” can maintain an absolute canon 800 episodes in. Instead, he calls the show’s continuity “elastic.” Just because an episode may end one way, that doesn’t mean Homer and company can’t reset and go an entirely different direction the following week.\n\n\tAfter all, when the show started, Homer and Marge were Baby Boomers. Now, because they’re still in their late 30s, that would make them Millennials. And “The Simpsons” is forever finding ways to comment on current society and contemporary pop culture. This season, that has meant a parody of “Severance,” a skewering of tech billionaires and a brush with K-pop.\n\n\t“We’re all so lucky to have this job,” Selman says. “But if you’re repeating yourself, you’ve wasted the creative opportunity of a lifetime. There is a baked-in sameness to every ‘Simpsons’ episode, because the characters are the same characters. But there is also a new phase of the show’s existence.”\n\t\n\n\tHailing from 20th TV Animation, “The Simpsons” has seen its storytelling revitalized in recent seasons, including under longtime executive producer Al Jean and now under Selman, who recently took over as sole showrunner. Under Selman, “The Simpsons” has been experimenting with different storytelling styles, exploring the backstory of more characters and addressing issues like mental health.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Simpsons” Episode 800, “Irrational Treasure”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20th TV Animation/Matt Groening/Fox\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOn Feb. 15, Fox will air the 800th and 801st episodes, which couldn’t be more different. In Episode 800, “Irrational Treasure,” Marge takes Santa’s Little Helper to Philadelphia to enter him in a dog show. Homer stows away on the trip, and soon they’re embroiled in a “National Treasure”-like conspiracy.\n\n\t“It’s one of our fun travel shows where we use the character of a city and the specifics of the city to tell a story,” Selman says. Guest stars include Philly natives like Quinta Brunson, Kevin Bacon, Boyz II Men and Questlove. There’s even a parody of “The Pitt” with Noah Wyle. (Yes, he knows, that’s actually Pittsburgh — but same state!)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Simpsons” Episode 801, “Homer? A Cracker Bro?”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20th TV Animation/Matt Groening/Fox\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEpisode 801, “Homer? A Cracker Bro?,” is a thoughtful exploration of Milhouse’s dad, Kirk van Houten, as we discover what happens when a bipolar person goes off their meds. R.E.M.’s Michael Stipe guest stars.\n\n\t“It’s still ‘The Simpsons,’ but mental illness is real. How can we do a story about it that’s empathetic, but also funny?” Selman says.\n\n\tSee — two very different stories, yet both very “The Simpsons” under Selman.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMatt Groening, Nancy Cartwright and Matt Selman help “The Simpsons” celebrate its landmark 800th episode at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on Friday, Feb. 6.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’m astonished at the ingenuity of Matt Selman,” creator Matt Groening says. “He brings a real fresh eye to the show. Part of him is driven by the same impulses the rest of us have, which is to try to be funny and emotionally engaging. But he also says he doesn’t want to be the one to run the show into the ground, so he’s running scared a little bit.”\n\n\tSmith credits Selman’s structure giving the show’s writers a sense of ownership and agency with their stories. “They’ve gone so many places we wouldn’t have ordinarily gone,” she says.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, the staying power has solidified in recent years as the series’ entire run became available to stream in one place on Disney+. \n\n\t“One of the great things for me is we’ve done so many episodes that I can watch earlier episodes and not remember a single thing about them,” Groening says. “Every time we do a new episode, it seems another episode goes out of my brain.”\n\n\t“The Simpsons” also continues to find other ways to reinvent itself in pop culture, including a recent month-long event on Fortnite and 2024’s NFL simulcast. And now, a second “The Simpsons” movie is finally in the works, two decades after the first one.\n\n\t“The first movie nearly killed us, because we tried to do the movie without increasing the size of the staff,” Groening says. “I think the reason why we agreed to go ahead with the movie is we finally have recovered from the first movie after 20 years, and we’ve hired a few more people.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“The Simpsons” celebrates its landmark 800th episode at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on Friday, Feb. 6.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney/Frank Micelotta\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA long-running gag at “The Simpsons” anniversary parties is the tagline, “Almost halfway there!” That seemed funny at the show’s 150th episode party, the 200th, the 400th and even the 600th. No one thought the show would go that far. But now that they’ve hit 800 episodes, it’s very conceivable that the show could hit Episode 1,000. (Fox has renewed “The Simpsons” through Season 40).\n\n\t“I think that would be an honorable thing to shoot for,” Groening says. “I would do it for 200 more — or more. Once, in 1995, a reporter asked me, ‘How long can the Simpsons go on?’ And I said, ‘We’re probably closer to the end than the beginning.’ Which I thought was very elegantly vague. But the headlines were that I was saying ‘The Simpsons’ was canceled. I have learned to say, ‘No end in sight!’”\n\n\tAdds Selman: “Episode 1,000 would be 10 years from now. But I would love it if we did. I think we can find a way.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFrom working with directors like Quentin Tarantino, Sergio Corbucci and Luis Buñuel to prominent creative collaborations with his Oscar-winning partner, Vanessa Redgrave, Franco Nero’s career has taken him all around the world.\n\n\tBut his next achievement takes him to Hollywood, where Nero will receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Feb. 12. That same week, Nero will receive a top honor from the Filming Italy — Los Angeles festival, which runs Feb. 10-14, celebrating the veteran actor’s success with retrospective screenings.\n\t\n\n\t“It means that I have planted many seeds over these more than 60 years of artistic career, even though a sower never has the certainty of harvesting the fruits of his labor,” Nero tells Variety. “I am deeply moved, proud and honored. That poor boy from the province of Parma managed to accomplish something in life.”With over 200 credits to his name spanning six decades, Nero has shown no signs of slowing down at the age of 84, starring in both U.S. and Italian productions. But his major breakout was in the 1966 spaghetti Western “Django,” where he played the titular gunslinger.\n\n\n\t“What is incredible is that the film almost never got completed due to lack of funding. It was long and exhausting to shoot, but in the end it became one of the biggest box office successes worldwide,” Nero says. “This was thanks to the genius of Sergio Corbucci, a great visionary who knew how to achieve so much with so little — someone from whom many of today’s directors could still learn a great deal.”\n\n\tNero has had plenty of experience working with Hollywood directors. He had roles in “Die Hard 2,” “John Wick: Chapter 2” and even the horror film “The Pope’s Exorcist.” Perhaps most memorably, he appeared in Tarantino’s 2012 film “Django Unchained” in an homage to the role that made Nero a household name.“Working on a Hollywood blockbuster is like being inside a gigantic machine, where even the smallest gear must function perfectly — everything is rigidly planned and executed,” Nero says. “In our Westerns, on the other hand, there was little money, a great deal of imagination, some improvisation and tons of creativity.”\n\t\n\n\tNero tried his hand at directing with 2005’s “Forever Blues,” an Italian drama about a trumpet player bonding with a young boy. Most recently, he directed the 2022 film “The Man Who Drew God,” which notably starred Kevin Spacey in his first role after the Oscar-winning actor was accused of sexual harassment and misconduct.\n\n\t“I consider Kevin one of the greatest actors of all time, and I believe that everyone deserves a second chance, whether they have made mistakes or not,” Nero says. “That is why I was very happy to give him my screenplay. There was a role suitable for him, even if it was a character role.”\n\n\tNero and Redgrave met and fell in love on the set of the 1967 musical film “Camelot.” They later separated, but the two remarried in 2006 and have starred in a handful of films since, including 2010’s “Letters to Juliet” and “The Estate,” which premiered at Italy’s Torino Film Festival last November.\n\n\t“I am absolutely convinced that the longevity of my career is also due to a profound lesson I learned from Vanessa: determination. She used to repeat it to me often,” Nero says. “Beyond being the woman of my life, she is the most prestigious living actress — Vanessa is determination personified. For this reason, my artistic longevity and my relationship with Vanessa, dating back to the time of ‘Camelot,’ are deeply connected.”\n\n\tTip Sheet\n\n\tWhat Franco Nero receives star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\n\tWhen 11:30 a.m., Feb. 12\n\n\tWhere 1611 Vine St., Hollywood\n\n\tWeb walkoffame.com\n",

    "body": "\n\tBAFTA Breakthrough Fellow Sindhu Sreenivasa Murthy is set to direct “Teacher’s Pet,” a coming-of-age comedy set in an all-girls Catholic boarding school in India. \n\n\tThe project is being presented at the WAVES Film Bazaar, the market component of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI).\n\n\t“Jubilee” (Prime Video) and “Black Warrant” (Netflix) filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane is on board as executive producer with his Andolan Films. Based on a script by Shuchi Dwivedi, the film is being produced by Aishwarya Sonar’s Lambe Log Productions and Dwivedi’s Small Town Gurl Productions.\n\t\n\n\t“Teacher’s Pet” follows Rinky, an overachiever determined to become head girl of her school, until her ambitions are derailed when she finds herself pitted against her former best friend. What begins as a rivalry spirals into a chaotic, heartfelt journey through adolescent identity, friendship, and the universal awkwardness of growing up.\n\n\n\tThe project is driven by a creative team working at the India-U.S. intersection. Having spent their own teenage years searching for themselves in coming-of-age stories centred on white protagonists, the filmmakers are determined to broaden the narrative landscape. \n\n\t“We are committed to telling Indian stories for the world. ‘Teacher’s Pet’ lets us do exactly that, as we explore the chaos of teenage life. We grew up searching for ourselves in coming-of-age stories about white girls. With this, we’re working towards being part of that change, not just for representation’s sake, but also to showcase the vibrant universe of Indian comedies, which are rare on global screens,” says Aishwarya Sonar whose recent work includes short films “Yakshi” (starring Babil Khan and Anna Ben) and “Hema” (starring Rajshri Deshpande) under her production company, Lambe Log Productions.\n\t\n\n\tFinancing is being raised through private equity, international co-production partners, and non-recoupable grants. The team has already secured a commitment of $200,000 and is in active discussions with new investors and production companies.\n\n\tThe script was developed during Dwivedi’s time at AFI and since has been shortlisted for Mubi’s Cannes W Scripted programme, was a semi-finalist at the Emerging Screenwriters Comedy Competition, and won the IFFLA Pitch Competition in 2024. The project has also participated in Tasveer’s Producers Lab and has been showcased at markets including IFFLA, CineV, and now part of the Co-Production Market at WAVES Film Bazaar 2025.\n\n\tCasting is currently underway, with production planned for December 2026 in Madhya Pradesh, India. Murthy has previously directed the Kannada language feature “Aachar & Co.” and the documentary series “Jeevalahari” (Doordarshan). Her latest Kannada-language feature “13 Days,” is currently in post-production.\n\n\t“We’re positioned to deliver: our director sold her debut to Amazon Studios, and our EP is behind many successful Indian titles; we’re now seeking global partners to help bring this story to screens worldwide,” adds Sonar.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGlinda and Elphaba remain “very very popular” at the box office. \n\n\t“Wicked: For Good,” Universal’s rendition of Act Two of the musical sensation, was No. 1 with $150 million from 4,115 North American theaters in its opening weekend. The film set a record for Broadway adaptations, shattering the debut of 2024’s “Wicked” which previously held the benchmark with $112.5 million over the same pre-Thanksgiving frame. These ticket sales also rank as the year’s second-biggest opening behind April’s “A Minecraft Movie” ($162 million) but above May’s “Lilo & Stitch” remake ($146 million).\n\t\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” collected an additional $76 million at the international box office, bringing its global total to $226 million. It marks the biggest overseas and global opening for a stage musical adaptation, also overtaking its predecessor, “Wicked,” which debuted to $50.2 million internationally and $164.2 million globally. The second installment was able to grow its audience overseas, which is important because the first film had overindexed in North America.\n\n\n\t“This is broad-appealing Hollywood filmmaking at its best,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “Strong word-of-mouth is going to drive business through the Thanksgiving Holiday and into December. This is a smash.”\n\n\tAlthough the second half of “Wicked” is much darker than the stage show’s fizzy first act, audiences — 71% of which were female — remained charmed by “For Good.” The film landed an “A” grade on CinemaScore exit polls, the same as the first installment. Directed by Jon M. Chu, “Wicked: For Good” has been billed as the must-see conclusion to Elphaba and Glinda’s epic journey down the Yellow Brick Road. This entry picks up as the Wizard and Madame Morrible attempt to turn all of Oz against the newly branded Wicked Witch of the West (Cynthia Erivo). Meanwhile Elphaba’s perky, pink-loving BFF embraces her public persona as Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande). Like the initial adaptation, goodwill toward the musical property and the catchy soundtrack are likely to drive repeat business through the rest of the year.\n\t\n\n\t“Wicked: For Good” is providing a needed lift to the box office, which has been languishing in recent weeks without a major blockbuster to boost attendance. Although two upcoming releases, Disney’s “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” will help to end the year on a high note, overall domestic grosses are expected to remain just 3% ahead of 2024 by the time the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve. That doesn’t seem so bad, except that grosses last year were nearly 24% behind pre-pandemic times.\n\n\tAs “Wicked: For Good” loomed over the domestic box office, two fellow new releases, Sony’s bloody, R-rated action thriller “Sisu: Road to Revenge” and Searchlight’s dramedy “Rental Family,” fizzled in their respective debuts.\n\n\t“Rental Family,” starring Brendan Fraser as a lonely, struggling actor who lands the not-so-plum job of playing stand-in roles for strangers in Japan, opened in fifth place with $3.3 million from 1,925 cinemas. Reviews and audience scores are strong (an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes and “A” grade on CinemaScore), which could help the film stick around over the holiday season.\n\n\t“Sisu 2” landed at No. 6 with $2.6 million from 2,222 theaters, behind already soft estimates of $3 million. Those ticket sales are behind the prior installment, 2022’s “Sisu,” which ignited to $3.3 million before tapping out with $7 million domestically and $14 million globally. \n\n\tHoldover titles, including “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” “Predator: Badlands” and “The Running Man” rounded out the top five. \n\n\tSecond place went to “Now You See Me 3,” which added $9.1 million in its second weekend of release, a 56% drop from its debut. Lionsgate’s illusionist adventure has amassed $36.8 million domestically. The film, which cost $90 million to produce, has been a much bigger hit overseas with $109 million for a global tally of $146 million. A fourth installment is already in the works.\n\n\t“Predator: Badlands” was No. 3 with $6.5 million in its third weekend, while “The Running Man” wasn’t far behind in fourth place with $6.1 million in its sophomore outing. Both are big-budget tentpoles that will struggle to recoup their budgets since theater owners get to keep half of ticket sales. “Badlands,” which cost $105 million, has earned $76 million domestically and $159.6 million globally. “The Running Man,” which carries a $110 million price tag, has generated just $27 million in North America and $48.3 million worldwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt the International Film Festival of India, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Abhijat Joshi turned their on-stage conversation into a lively mix of performance, memory and craft, as Chopra sang, enacted scenes from his early struggles and unpacked how each phase of his life shaped films from “Parinda” to “1942: A Love Story” and “12th Fail.”\n\n\tCelebrated screenwriter Joshi has worked exclusively with writer-producer-director Chopra for over 30 years, on his films such as “Lage Raho Munnabhai” and “3 Idiots”. During a session titled Unscripted – The Art and Emotion of Filmmaking, the conversation between the two long-time collaborators, on the stage at Kala Academy at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), was freewheeling, peppered with anecdotes and spontaneous performances.\n\t\n\n\t73-year-old Chopra sang on stage and stood up to enact moments from his early days of struggle, including the hustle required to get a visa and passport in order to attend the Oscars when his short documentary film “An Encounter With Faces” received a nomination in 1979.\n\n\n\tChopra has directed a range of films from the gritty “Parinda” (1989) to the musical love story “1942: A Love Story” and the biographical drama “12th Fail” (2023).\n\n\tThe conversation began with Chopra breaking down how his filmmaking style had changed over the last five decades. “Every film reflects who I am at that point,” he said. “I was angry when I made “Parinda”. You can see that violence in the movie. Today I’m calmer.”\n\n\t“12th Fail”, he said, came from witnessing corruption around him. “The film was my way of saying let’s be honest for a change. If I can change even 1% of the bureaucracy, that’s enough.”\n\t\n\n\tThe newly restored 8K version of his 1994 film “1942: A Love Story” screened at IFFI, an emotional experience for the filmmaker. “I saw it for the first time in 8K resolution in the theater here. I became so emotional seeing what they have done with colors, with sound. That’s a movie I can’t make anymore. I made it then because I was in love with a woman I married, and that love shows in the movie. For an artist, if I may use the word loosely, the right thing is to represent what he’s going through in his work. So I reflect what I see and feel,” he said.\n\n\tChopra explained that every film dictates its own process; preparation is not a formula but something that emerges from the content itself. Reflecting on “1942: A Love Story,” he recalled the painstaking effort behind even small visual moments, such as the shot of Manisha Koirala running with birds overhead. With no CGI available then, his team scattered breadcrumbs across a mountaintop at night so that real birds would appear at dawn. He also recounted an incident when actor Jackie Shroff, on his way to see Chopra, accidentally went to the wrong apartment, waking up a startled woman, and handing her flowers he had brought for his director. “The next morning, she told everyone in the neighborhood that she dreamt Jackie Shroff visited her,” Chopra said, leading to laughter and applause from the audience.\n\n\tJoshi further highlighted how Chopra refused to churn out sequels to “Munna Bhai”or “3 Idiots”, even at great financial cost, choosing to wait years for the right script. When Joshi asked Chopra what is that particular emotional truth a filmmaker must not compromise on, the latter said, “This journey is very difficult but… always make a film that you believe in, stand by it and hope the audience also likes it.”\n\n\tThe session closed with “1942: A Love Story” writer Kamna Chandra and producer Yogesh Ishwar joining Chopra and Joshi on stage. Ishwar detailed the 8K restoration journey in Italy, cleaning the film frame by frame, the expanded color grading and sound remastering that finally allowed the film to appear as Chopra and cinematographer Binod Pradhan had envisioned it over 30 years ago.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNima (Tandin Bihda) doesn’t know exactly what she’s looking for at the start of “I, the Song,” which is strange considering that she’s searching for someone who looks exactly like her. The school teacher wants to clear her good name after a racy video has surfaced with a woman who bears a resemblance so strong that the school’s administrator has placed her on leave. However, with all the time in the world to find her doppelganger in Dechen Roder’s intriguing yet intermittently engaging drama, Nima’s search for a stranger she comes to identify as Meto (also played by Bihda) reveals how her own life has seemingly gotten away from her.\n\t\n\n\tBhutan’s selection for the international feature Oscar, “I, the Song” provides a showcase for the natural beauty of the country when Nima’s travels take her from the capital city of Thimpu to the border town of Gelephu. But more provocatively, Roder wanders off the beaten path for a different view of a culture where personal contentment has long been a point of national pride (with surveys used to calculate the Gross National Happiness index). \n\n\n\tEven before Nima is beckoned to the principal’s office to find out she’s lost her job, there’s a feeling of disillusionment. Nima seems adrift when she’s stuck with an overly possessive boyfriend who isn’t entirely convinced it isn’t her in the video despite her insistence. Meanwhile, her mother reminds Nima of more industrious years she spent abroad. As unfortunate as it is to be mistaken for the subject of a viral sex video, the pursuit of the person really in it gives her a renewed sense of purpose.\n\t\n\n\tThat subtle, savvy sense of irony runs throughout “I, the Song” and becomes part of its charm when Nima starts to come alive as it looks increasingly probable that she’s chasing a ghost. Even with the same actress playing them, Nima and Meto aren’t exactly envisioned as two sides of the same coin, but they share a restlessness. The latter, as remembered by others, had a vitality that Nima starts to envy when it’s clear that, in spite of leading a life that was not all that much more interesting, Meto at least had passion. The radiant amber light in which Meto is bathed during scenes of her exploits a few years prior becomes a stark contrast to the cool blue world that Nima inhabits in the present. Roder impressively stages scenes where the two live side-by-side in different timelines, and a slight camera pan shows how close Nima gets to feeling what Meto did while still acknowledging the distance between them.\n\n\tThe sophisticated aesthetics can make the narrative feel a little too basic by comparison when the film primarily hangs on the relationship that forms between Nima and Tandin (Jimmy Wangyal Tshering), a musician who mostly plays to an empty bar that she meets early in retracing Meto’s footsteps. Appearing to know more than he’s willing to let on about his ex’s whereabouts, Tandin becomes a recurring presence in Nima’s investigation, offering some musical interludes if not much else. Not only can he frustrate Nima, but he exemplifies Roder’s occasional tendency to mistake a lack of characterization for mystique when he keeps drawing Nima back despite having little to say. A burgeoning romance isn’t entirely convincing, yet the fact that he takes up as much screen time as he does effectively reflects the real estate that the generally mediocre men in both Nima and Meto’s lives occupy in the women’s minds, preventing them from reaching their full potential, either from suffering their outright condescension or out of concern for how they’ll be perceived if they were to assert themselves in the same way. \n\n\tA vaguely episodic structure that might have otherwise seemed uninspired takes on a certain poignance when Nima is pushed ahead by learning about one situation after another that Meto left behind once they no longer suited her, seemingly giving herself the permission to do the same in her own life. Although that self-realization is timeless, Roder cannily positions it to speak to contemporary times. Nima’s downfall from a viral video could only happen during the digital age. \n\t\n\n\tA visit to a village to see Meto’s grandmother, too blind to recognize the difference between Nima and her own blood, leads to a plea to the young woman before her to reclaim a folk song from the city that stole it from her when she believes she’s been corrupted by modernity. Sometimes “I, The Song” is a bit too quiet to resonate, but it lays bare the echoes of the past in ways that are difficult to shake.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBarbara Broccoli‘s Eon Productions, the former producer of the James Bond franchise, and Qatar’s newly launched Film Committee are jointly producing a film adaptation of William Shakespeare’s “Othello,” directed and starring David Oyelowo, and also featuring Rachel Brosnahan and Cynthia Erivo.\n\n\tThe film, which marks Broccoli’s first project since the sale of Bond rights to Amazon MGM, will be shot in the Qatari capital of Doha. It is an adaptation of the “Othello” play production that first ran at the New York Theatre Workshop in 2016, directed by Sam Gold.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve wanted to produce the cinematic adaptation of ‘Othello’ since we staged the production in New York in 2016,” Broccoli said in a statement.\n\n\n\tOyelowo will be directing and returning as Othello, Brosnahan will be reprising the role of Desdemona and Erivo is playing Emilia. “We thank the Film Committee for their support and look forward to shooting in Qatar in autumn 2026,” Broccoli added. Oyelowo commented: “Our cinematic version of ‘Othello’ is bitingly modern and fearlesslyambitious. To have a real shot at that, you need fearless actors.”\n\n\t“Cynthia is not only a generational talent but a dear friend with whom I am always keen to collaborate, and Rachel was a dream to play opposite in our original stage production and has been an inspiring pillar to build around for our fresh take on this legendary tale,” he added. The “Othello” screenplay reimagines the classic text in a contemporary war-torn desert in the MiddleEast.\n\n\t“When Iago is telling us of battles – as opposed to us seeing battles – you don’t see the camaraderie and the friendship that gets denigrated. That’s the beauty of cinema,” Oyelowo said during a panel in Doha.\n\t\n\n\t“That’s some of what we’re going to be able to do,” noted Broccoli, adding that “Doha will be seen on screen.”\n\n\tOyelowo went on to describe the Qatar and Doha-set “Othello” project as “the most extraordinary combination of the ancient and the modern.”\n\n\tThe film’s producers are Broccoli and Nicky Bentham for Eon Productions and Oyelowo for Yoruba Saxon.\n\n\tThe Qatar Film Committee is a new official body that is part of the Media City Qatar hub tasked with driving growth of the country’s entertainment industry.\n\n\tThe high-profile “Othello” project follows a flurry of pacts with Hollywood studios being unveiled at the inaugural Doha Film Festival‘s Industry Days by Hassan Al Thawadi, the Qatari lawyer who chairs the Qatar Film Committee and oversaw the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament. It follows similar deals with U.S. studios Neon, Miramax and Sony, announced on Friday.\n\n\tThe “Othello” production will tap into Qatar’s new screen production incentive that offers an up to 50% cash rebate on qualifying Qatari production expenditure.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe New Zealand Film Commission is mounting a push into the Indian market, unveiling enhanced incentive packages while seeking to revitalize a largely dormant co-production treaty that has been utilized just once in 15 years.\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety ahead of the WAVES Film Bazaar in Goa, NZFC CEO Annie Murray outlined significant changes to the country’s International New Zealand Screen Production Rebate that take effect Jan. 1, 2026. The modifications, which Murray said were informed by feedback from the Producers Guild of India, aim to position New Zealand as a more competitive destination for Indian productions of varying scales.\n\t\n\n\t“The new incentives really give us a more competitive edge than we had previously,” Murray explained. “We have aligned the threshold for minimum spend for both feature film, television, and streaming content to NZ$4 million [$2.2 million].”\n\n\n\tThe lowered threshold represents a substantial reduction from the previous NZ$15 million ($8.4 million) minimum for feature films, bringing it in line with existing requirements for television and streaming projects. Murray indicated the change will enable small to medium-sized independent films to access the rebate, with particular interest from American and Indian producers.\n\n\tAdditional modifications include the removal of the above-the-line cap on claims for roles such as director, producer, principal cast and screenwriter — which Murray said was a barrier to some productions coming to New Zealand or returning to New Zealand. The threshold for accessing an additional 5% uplift has been reduced from NZ$30 million ($16.8 million) to NZ$20 million ($11.2 million), while the standalone post-production, digital and visual effects rebate now qualifies for a five percent uplift, bringing the total PDV rebate to 25% for qualifying productions.\n\t\n\n\tThe commission is making its third visit to India in 12 months, leading a delegation of 13 New Zealand filmmakers alongside key executives including Philippa Mossman (head of international attraction and marketing), Chris Payne (deputy CEO and head of incentives and co-productions), and Te O Kahurangi Waaka (chief advisor Māori strategy).\n\n\tThe delegation presented at the WAVES Film Bazaar Knowledge Series, emphasizing both co-production opportunities under the New Zealand-India Film Co-Production Treaty and inbound production possibilities. The treaty, signed approximately 15 years ago, has seen limited use beyond Pan Nalin’s “Beyond the Known World,” which was shot roughly a decade ago.\n\n\t“We realize it’s a diverse and fascinating country with multiple languages and regions that we really want to work with,” Murray said, noting interest in projects from Bollywood, Tollywood and other regional Indian cinema sectors.\n\n\tRecent Telugu-language productions “Kannappa” and “Game Changer” filmed in New Zealand locations without utilizing the co-production treaty structure, instead operating as inbound productions. Murray expressed hope that the enhanced incentive packages and sustained outreach will attract more projects of similar scale.\n\n\tSpeaking at the Bazaar presentation, Payne detailed the financial mechanisms available through official co-productions. The structure requires balanced spend, creative contribution and financing between New Zealand and India, with qualifying projects able to access up to NZ$2.5 million ($1.4 million) in NZFC funding plus a 40% cash rebate on New Zealand expenditure.\n\n\tFor productions not structured as official co-productions, the standard inbound production rebate offers 20% on qualifying spend, rising to 25% for projects exceeding NZ$20 million ($11.2 million). The standalone PDV rebate requires a minimum spend of NZ$250,000 ($140,315).\n\n\tTe O Kahurangi Waaka emphasized the importance of cultural protocols and relationship-building in working with Māori communities, which she described as essential to production processes in New Zealand. She cited the integration of Māori dance and cultural elements in “Kannappa,” facilitated by Rotorua-based producer Piripi Curtis.\n\n\t“It’s important that we build those relationships based on can we get on with each other, do we actually like and believe in the kaupapa that you have,” Waaka said.\n\t\n\n\tMossman outlined New Zealand’s production infrastructure, highlighting two major crew bases in Auckland and Wellington, with Wellington serving as home to companies associated with Peter Jackson and James Cameron. Smaller but significant production bases exist in Christchurch and Queenstown.\n\n\t“International producers and filmmakers tell us all the time about the extent to which the New Zealand workforce really wraps around the creative vision of producers and directors at all levels,” Mossman said.\n\n\tThe commission maintains a specialized team providing services including location galleries, budget analysis through line producer consultations, production services coordination and immigration assistance. Murray revealed that direct flights between India and New Zealand are expected to commence by early 2027, eliminating current connection requirements through cities like Singapore.\n\n\tThe NZFC’s India engagement builds on momentum from New Zealand’s largest-ever trade mission to India earlier in 2025. The current visit coincides with Robert Sarkies’ mining disaster drama “Pike River” having its Asian premiere at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) as part of the Cinema of the World program.\n\n\tMurray referenced the enduring impact of the 2000 Hrithik Roshan-starrer “Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai,” which was partially shot in New Zealand and resulted in a significant increase in Indian tourist footfall to the country. Filmmaker and choreographer Farah Khan recently visited Auckland for a screening of the film, which Murray attended.\n\n\t“Films are also our cultural ambassadors,” Murray said. “They do a wonderful job of connecting our countries in the same way that sport does.”\n\n\tPatricia Watson, executive director of Women in Film and Television New Zealand, is developing a co-production summit for 2026, building on similar initiatives previously conducted with Canada and Germany, to facilitate connections between Indian and New Zealand creatives.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAgain and again, teenage Afghan refugee Soraya Akhalaghi refers to herself and her fellow displaced migrants as “playing a game.” Only some way into “A Fox Under a Pink Moon” — a candid and urgent documentary about her years-long struggle to enter Europe — do we learn what she actually means by that phrase. The “game” is chancing an attempt to cross the border, and it’s one that’s largely rigged against them, as Iranian docmaker Mehrdad Oskouei‘s short, gripping film watches Soraya lose several rounds before making some substantial life changes. Her mordantly whimsical euphemism is apt in a film that repeatedly presents imagination as a survival tactic: A gifted young artist, Soraya expresses her struggle through darkly fantastical drawings and sculptures. Put in her own words, she “paints her pains.” \n\t\n\n\tAs a portrait of young womanhood restricted by cultural patriarchy and dire social circumstance, “A Fox Under a Pink Moon” feels a natural follow-up to Oskouei’s last two feature docs: 2016’s “Starless Dreams” and 2019’s “Sunless Shadows,” twin portraits of female inmates at a Tehran juvenile correctional facility that were both celebrated on the festival circuit and distributed Stateside by The Cinema Guild. “A Fox Under a Pink Moon” should perform at least as well, given the profile boost of the top prize in IDFA‘s international competition, plus an eye-catching mixed-media component: a number of strikingly animated sequences based directly on Soraya’s own artwork.\n\n\n\tOskouei’s latest differs from his previous films in the direct nature of its female perspective, as indicated by its subject’s co-directing credit: All the live-action footage here has been shot by Soraya (credited only by her first name) with cellphone cameras over a period of five years, and assembled remotely by the helmer. It’s a point of view we haven’t much seen across the surfeit of recent docs concerned with the migrant crisis, and that first-hand quality would make “A Fox Under a Pink Moon” stand out even if Soraya herself weren’t such a compelling figure: a determinedly stoic and resilient young woman with a gift for articulating both her personal plight and the larger political crisis surrounding her, in alternately visceral and poetic terms. That she’s only 17 years old at the film’s outset is a delayed and startling reveal.\n\t\n\n\tSoraya, we learn, has spent more or less her entire life stranded between where she’s from and where she wants to be — mostly in Tehran, where her Afghan parents moved before she was born, but which has never felt like home to her. That’s in large part because she’s lived there a long time without close family: Her father died when she was a young girl, her mother successfully fled to Austria a few years later, and she was subsequently raised by an abusive uncle. “I am used to being beaten,” she says with heartbreaking sangfroid in one of her many selfie confessionals: She’s now married to Ali, a volatile older man who, as we learn via fraught, wince-inducing footage, has picked up where her uncle left off.\n\n\tWe first encounter Soraya, however, in Istanbul’s Zeytun Burna refugee dormitory in 2019, a spartan shelter from which she, Ali and a number of other Iranian escapees make the first of several documented attempts to cross the Turkish border into Greece. Foiled by the authorities, they’re sent back to Tehran, where she’s forced to wait out the first year of the Covid pandemic — eking out a living as a cleaner for wealthy Iranian households, and channeling her frustration through highly resourceful, creative artistry, whether sculpting pointedly masculine “demons” from sodden household cardboard, or drawing fairytale-style visions in which recurring figures include a beleaguered clown and a companionable fox.\n\n\tBoth characters are woven through the film’s lovely, watercolor-style animated interludes, designed by Mohammad Lotfali, with the clown sometimes Soraya’s own alter ego and sometimes a mournful stand-in for other ailing and persecuted individuals — among them Nazar Mohammad, popularly known as Khasha, an Afghan comedian killed by the Taliban for his subversive artistry. \n\n\tNot merely decorative, the animations serve as an illuminating expansion of the subject’s vivid and distinctive worldview. Soraya is a strong enough presence to announce herself without much external context, though a little more scene-setting wouldn’t go amiss in the film — and while closing title cards bring her story to a rewarding close, we miss those developments first-hand. Perhaps, as she enters a new, more liberated stage of life, Soraya has less need for the camera, and more for the canvas.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRooted in unassuming pastoral rhythms, veteran Kyrgyz writer-director Aktan Arym Kubat’s “Black Red Yellow” gently weaves a placid story of love and tradition around a proud Kyrgyz village that has seen better days. Co-written by Topchugul Shaidullayeva, the delicate drama channels a kind of unfussy and serene clarity that obliquely brings to mind the films of Edward Yang and Yasujiro Ozu. Often erring on the side of excessive stillness and silence, “Black Red Yellow” — this year’s Academy Awards submission from Kyrgyzstan — doesn’t quite find its emotional footing within its compact running time.\n\t\n\n\tStill, there is something worthwhile about the window Kubat opens into the community depicted and all the people who contribute to it in the best way they can. The time period isn’t exactly defined, but there are clear signs that we are sometime in the 1990s, in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union that earned Kyrgyzstan its sovereignty. It’s a transitional period that has proven hard on the villagers. Out-of-work men drink excessively, while women thanklessly try to keep everyone’s lives afloat through cooking, cleaning and raising children.\n\n\n\tBut despite relative scarcity, traditional carpet weaving endures in the village as a lifeline in more ways than one. For the talented Turdugul (an expressive Nargiza Mamatkulova), the film’s central figure and sole weaver, attentively weaving rugs is both a livelihood and a spiritual duty of sorts as she tends to the knots, threads and the colors of the carpets she patiently makes. The key colors of her creations lend the film its title, while also headlining the movie’s obscure chapters. Although a brief synopsis published for the film’s festival run summarizes the colors in the way they symbolize human nature across calmness, intensity and nostalgic melancholy, the film itself doesn’t quite echo this tonal progression — without any distinct ebbs and flows, the whole thing is even-handed almost to a fault.\n\t\n\n\tVia a framing device and flashback remembered by an old woman, we arrive at the village with Turdugul, hired to weave a carpet for the unhappily married couple Shirin (Aigul Busurmankulova) and Kadyr (Mirlan Abdykalykov). The couple’s story isn’t unique, and thus, it represents the region’s hardships in that era — two people in an arranged marriage, increasingly unfulfilled by life’s harsh realities. Concerned more about his horse than his home, Kadyr is often drunk and absent. Feeling left out and trapped, Shirin, on the other hand, goes through various emotional outbursts, worsened by the fact that pregnancy eludes her, despite her intense desire to become a mother.\n\n\tWhile Busurmankulova is deeply committed to the part (and happens to be the most memorable performer in the film), the story’s treatment of Shirin feels unfortunate in some regard. Practical, but rightfully angry and heartbreakingly suicidal, she doesn’t get a lot of sympathy in “Black Red Yellow,” instead represented as a clichéd nagging woman who doesn’t understand the depths of her sensitive husband. An example of this emerges right at the start with Shirin’s first outburst, when Kadyr heroically rescues a goat from drowning and hands it to an old man who claims to be its owner.\n\n\tWhy didn’t Kadyr just keep the goat instead of giving it to someone who’s probably lying? Well, she’s not wrong, not under their circumstances, even though the film goes out of its way to convince us of her shaky moral judgment. It’s almost as if her pesky qualities were conceived only to sell us on the burgeoning romance between Kadyr and Turdugul, who quickly fall for each other without any on-screen chemistry or narrative setup. Forbidden or not, romantic love is the easiest thing to root for in cinema if it’s portrayed with some palpable undercurrent of desire, which is in short supply here.\n\n\tMore convincing in the film is cinematographer Talant Akynbekov’s observant, almost ceremonious lensing of carpet weaving, as well as of the beats of everyday life, sometimes accompanied by the traditional tunes villagers hum. Women’s hands dance across the frame as they embrace the colorful threads in front of them or make fresh bread in wood-burning stone ovens, while men bear heavy-duty labor with the majestic backdrop of mountains and valleys. Elsewhere, a photographer periodically captures idiosyncratic family portraits, with each one telling its own silent story. \n\t\n\n\tThe film’s most powerful scene arrives when Turdugul’s grandmother refuses to sell her property to routine opportunists and laments about a vanishing village that has been slipping through her fingers — an occasion Akynbekov and Kubat approach with an unobtrusive, documentarian aesthetic. Looking for work in big cities, entire families have left the grandma’s neighborhood and the responsibility of maintaining those houses, airing them out when needed, somehow fell onto her. “Who’s going to take this on after I’m gone?” the tired old woman wonders. It’s a scene that underscores the nurturing properties of a sacrificing matriarchal attitude that puts survival and longevity over petty matters that define patriarchal destructiveness. (In fact, this feminine stance makes the story’s questionable treatment of Shirin all the more puzzling.)\n\n\tAfter the principled Turdugul turns down Kadyr, “Black Red Yellow” comes to a satisfying enough close on the heels of a brief third chapter. Sadly, the film leaves a lot of hidden depths unexplored in the lives of both Shirin and Turdugul, as two women burdened by circumstance and a shared sense of duty.\n",

    "body": "\n\tKaizad Gustad has returned to filmmaking after more than a decade with “Lala & Poppy,” a pioneering love story centered on two transgender characters, making its world premiere at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa.\n\n\tThe film marks a significant departure in Indian cinema’s representation of trans narratives, casting actual trans actors Suruj Rajkhowa and Veer Singh in the lead roles. The story follows Lala, a trans woman, and Poppy, a trans man, as they navigate falling in love while undergoing their respective transitions.\n\t\n\n\tGustad, known for his 1998 breakout “Bombay Boys,” found the inspiration for the project after meeting Rajkhowa five years ago. “I met Suruj Rajkhowa accidentally, and I was really taken in by Suruj, their personality and their charisma and their camera friendliness,” Gustad says. “I wanted to tell a story in which gender didn’t play a role after meeting Suruj.”\n\n\n\tThe central conceit emerged from a simple yet unexplored premise. “What would happen if a man who’s transitioning to become a woman meets a woman who’s transitioning to become a man?” Gustad says. “How does the whole gender dynamics play out? How does a love story, if any, blossom from this? To my knowledge, it hadn’t been told anywhere in the world.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker acknowledges his initial reservations approaching the material as a cisgender straight man. “I had no real knowledge of the space at all, so I was extremely nervous about getting it right from the beginning,” he says. The project underwent years of research and community consultation before filming.\n\t\n\n\tProducer Bobby Bedi, who has previously backed groundbreaking films like “Bandit Queen” and “Fire,” sees the project as addressing a crucial gap between legal acceptance and social reality in India. “India has accepted the third gender a while ago. We’ve accepted it constitutionally, we’ve accepted it legally, but there’s still not real acceptance,” Bedi says. “You see people looking for jobs, not getting them.”\n\n\tBedi emphasizes the film aims to reach beyond converted audiences. “The film is not designed for a specific LGBTQ audience – they are already part of the converted. We are preaching to the unconverted, which is the people at large,” he says.\n\n\tFor Rajkhowa, a performance artist who moved from Bhopal to Mumbai, being cast represented a rare opportunity. “I clearly don’t pass for a woman in the classical sense,” Rajkhowa says. “So, for me, to be considered was more than anything, really.”\n\n\tSingh, who is currently transitioning, describes the personal resonance of the role. “This story was really personal to me,” Singh says. “Seeing something like this in India, and for people like us to be played as ourselves on a big screen, it’s really big, because we don’t get this opportunity every now and then.”\n\n\tThe production assembled a notably queer-inclusive crew, with two non-binary costume designers, a non-binary behind-the-scenes photographer, and trans makeup artists. “It was a very safe space for us,” Singh says.\n\n\tBoth actors draw distinctions between their representation and previous portrayals of trans characters in Indian cinema. Rajkhowa references performer Bobby Darling as an earlier figure who was often positioned as an object of ridicule. “She was an object to be laughed at, to make fun of,” Rajkhowa says. The actors hope “Lala & Poppy” will present trans characters as fully realized humans experiencing love, fashion, and everyday emotions.\n\n\tBedi commits to a theatrical release in India. “I don’t believe in this straight to streamer audience,” he says. “I believe in giving an audience the opportunity to make a choice.” He’s already in discussions with distributors and exhibitors.\n\n\tThe film underwent development at the international screenwriters lab Stories That Travel to ensure global resonance, and Bedi plans festival submissions to raise awareness of India’s position on transgender issues. “It is important for the world to know where we are on this. We are one-sixth of the world,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tDespite progress in some territories, both Gustad and Bedi acknowledge the increasingly fractious global political climate around transgender rights. “When I started writing this seven, eight years ago, there was a lot more acceptance,” Gustad says, noting rollbacks particularly in the U.S.\n\n\tHowever, the filmmaker remains focused on the universal themes. “At the end of the day, for me, it’s more of a human story. These two are human beings first and foremost, they’re male or female after that,” Gustad says. “It’s more about whether two human beings have the right to love each other.”\n\n\tGustad has already begun pre-production on his next project with Bedi, “Auto Bhagwan,” described as a real-time thriller set on rickshaws during the last day of Ganpati festival.\n\n\tHimman Dhamija served as director of photography, with Andrew Bellety handling sound design and Ankur Tewari as music supervisor. Art and production design is by Michri Thejaseno, with Anthony Pandey as first assistant director. Zaid Ali Khan is associate producer, with Varsha Bedi and Himman Dhamija as co-producers alongside producer Bobby Bedi.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Bilyarista,” a billiards drama starring Venice Film Festival best actor winner John Arcilla and featuring cameo appearances from legendary pool players Efren “Bata” Reyes and Francisco “Django” Bustamante, is making its world premiere at the 56th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa.\n\n\tThe feature, directed by Phil Giordano, follows Aya (Loisa Andalio), a young girl from Manila’s slums who dreams of becoming a billiards world champion but is manipulated by her hustler uncle Itoy, played by Arcilla, into playing dangerous underground gambling matches after her father’s murder.\n\t\n\n\tGiordano, an Italian-American filmmaker who previously directed Arcilla in the short film “Supot” (2016), was drawn to the project nearly a decade ago after encountering the Philippines’ underground pool culture during street casting for that earlier work.\n\n\n\t“I was doing street casting for the actors, and one of the kids that we cast, he couldn’t read or write, and he was homeless at the time,” Giordano says. “I saw him go into a pool hall, and he’s like 12 years old, but he was fantastic. He beat this like 40-year-old guy, and he had this expensive pool cue. And I was just fascinated by this world that this exists.”\n\n\tThat fascination led Giordano to discover that the Philippines has produced more world champions in pool than any other country, with Reyes widely regarded as the greatest player of all time. “There’s this whole culture where, because of the climate and the tables and the moisture and the air and the pressure, that is not by accident that all the best players in the world are from here,” he says.\n\t\n\n\tArcilla, who won the Volpi Cup for acting at the 2021 Venice Film Festival for “On the Job: The Missing 8,” describes how he approached the morally complex character.\n\n\t“Even until the last minute, he doesn’t have any guilt about it,” Arcilla says of his character. “My interpretation was supposed to be that he’s not so guilty about it. He always thought that he’s helping the niece. Being unfair to that niece for him is my right, because I’m running the business.”\n\n\tThe actor draws on universal experiences to inhabit the role. “We all have experiences as human beings when we’re not always positive about things. Sometimes we get mad with anything, with something that pisses us off,” he explains. \n\n\tGiordano emphasizes his immersive research approach. “I like to meet a lot of people and ask a lot, learn about people’s lives and hear stories,” he says. “When I was doing the research, I started meeting these characters like the manager, and seeing how the ecosystem works, all the details of the gambling and everything, and not judging the characters and learning how the hierarchy and everything truly is done.”\n\n\tThe production brought together an international crew, with New York-based cinematographer Adam McDaid, whose credits include HBO’s “Single Drunk Female” and Netflix’s “Everything’s Trash,” and camera operator Aaron Brown, who worked on “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” “Smile 2” and “Past Lives.” Philippine editor Lawrence Ang, who cut Sundance Special Jury Prize winner “Leonore Will Never Die,” handled post-production.\n\n\tThe film is produced by Gale Osorio and Shreyom Ghosh through Leesan OPC Productions Philippines, in association with Terminal Six Post Philippines and Tasia Films Hong Kong. Ghosh, based in Hong Kong after completing an MFA at NYU Tisch School of the Arts, explains his attraction to the project.\n\n\t“What I really like is an outside point of view in a place from where you are not from,” Ghosh says. “Phil, being an Italian American director, was based in Philippines for almost four years. He’s not unfamiliar with the place, but he still brings an eye which other Philippines directors will not be bringing.”\n\n\tThe appearance of pool legends Reyes and Bustamante adds authenticity to the film’s world. “It was everyone’s dream to be like them,” Giordano says. “When John is there and Loisa is there, there’s so many fans. And then when Efren and Django show up, there’s like a whole other breed of fans. It was really generous of them to join the film, and it meant the world.”\n\t\n\n\tArcilla notes the thematic significance of the cameos. “It underlines that there are other avenues for your prodigies to go to. There are other options rather than just use them to be your pawns,” he says. “You don’t even need to go to what you’re doing. There’s a more respectable way, and it was being underlined by the presence of the two greats.”\n\n\tGhosh emphasizes the film’s grounding in reality. “Because it is as a coming-of-age sports drama, which is about aspiration, having them being in that position and broken free of it, it makes it real,” he says. “When people see, ‘oh look, Efren is there,’ this is what we are talking about. This is what we are going and to give people hope.”\n\n\tThe film features an original song by Filipino-American rapper Alex Bruce, signed to Sony Music Philippines. Partnerships include ABS-CBN Entertainment and Sony Music. Color grading was completed at Company3, the facility behind “The White Lotus,” “Deadpool & Wolverine” and “Paddington in Peru.”\n\n\tFollowing its world premiere at IFFI Goa, the film is set for festival circulation, theatrical release and eventual streaming distribution.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Writers Guild of America came out swinging on Thursday against a merger between Warner Bros. and any other studio, saying such consolidation would be a “disaster” for writers.\n\n\tThe statement comes two days after Warner Bros. said it is considering “multiple offers.” Paramount, freshly acquired by David Ellison’s Skydance, is the most eager suitor. Any deal involving another content producer would shrink the number of buyers in the marketplace.\n\t\n\n\t“Merger after merger in the media industry has harmed workers, diminished competition and free speech, and wasted hundreds of billions of dollars better invested in organic growth,” the WGA East and West said in a statement Thursday. “Combining Warner Bros. with Paramount or another major studio or streamer would be a disaster for writers, for consumers, and for competition. The WGAW and WGAE will work with regulators to block the merger.”\n\n\n\tThe WGA has a long track record of opposition to industry mergers. It opposed the failed Dish-DirecTV merger in 2002.\n\n\tIn 2011, the union sought to block the merger of Comcast and NBCUniversal, warning that the media landscape was already too consolidated. The union also warned that Comcast might use its control of cable distribution to favor its own content.\n\n\tThe WGA also raised “net neutrality” concerns in expressing its opposition to the AT&T merger with Time Warner, which was announced in 2016. \n\n\t“At a time when the country demands, and needs, the broadest possible set of views and stories and voices, we have handed over the keys to the media kingdom to giants whose sole motivation is to maximize their short-term investment return, not to inform or enlighten or entertain,” the WGA East said when the merger was approved in 2018.\n\t\n\n\tThe union also opposed the Disney-Fox merger in 2017 and the Amazon-MGM merger in 2021. It blasted the merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery in 2022, which undid the AT&T merger from a few years earlier, calling it a “clear disaster for the content creators who have lost jobs and a potential employer, as well as for the consumers who are faced with a poorer, less-diverse content landscape.”\n\n\tThe union has also called for more robust antitrust enforcement. In 2023, the union warned that Disney, Netflix and Amazon were poised to become the “new gatekeepers” of the industry.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 36th Singapore International Film Festival has unveiled its full lineup, with international star Shu Qi‘s award-winning directorial debut “Girl” set to open the event, while Oscar-nominated filmmaker Deepa Mehta becomes the first-ever female recipient of the Cinema Honorary Award.\n\n\tThe festival will showcase over 120 films from more than 45 countries as part of the Singapore Media Festival hosted by the Infocomm Media Development Authority. SGIFF marks several historic firsts, including Mehta’s groundbreaking honor and Oscar-winning “Minari” actor Youn Yuh-jung as the first South Korean recipient of the Screen Icon Award.\n\t\n\n\tShu Qi, a regular collaborator of Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien with over 90 acting credits, will attend the opening alongside lead actor Bai Xiao-Ying and actor-singer 9m88. The film premiered in Venice and won Shu Qi the best director award at Busan.\n\n\n\tThe acclaimed actor is also in Chinese filmmaker Bi Gan’s “Resurrection,” which screens in the festival’s Undercurrent section for experimental filmmaking. She’ll participate in an In Conversation session with returning festival ambassador Rebecca Lim. \n\n\tThe festival’s local programming has expanded significantly, with more than 30 feature and short films by Singaporean filmmakers and co-producers. Doubling SGIFF’s local short film selection compared to last year, the festival will present these works across the Southeast Asian Short Film Competition and Singapore Panorama, a section dedicated to features and shorts reflecting the nation’s evolving social and cultural landscape.\n\t\n\n\tSeveral world premieres headline the Singaporean slate. “Sandbox,” directed by James Thoo, is a mockumentary featuring Peps Goh, Benjamin Kheng, Estelle Fly, Nathan Hartono, Fauzi Azzhar and Oon Shu An. Also in Singapore Panorama features are documentary “At Home with Work” directed by Adar Ng and Dave Lim, “The Old Man and His Car” by Michael Kam and “Coda” by Jac Min, a Singapore-Japan co-production. In the extensive selection of Singaporean shorts, veteran actor Qi Yuwu makes his directorial debut with the short film “Cendol,” starring Sharon Au.\n\n\tThe festival’s Asian Feature Film Competition has expanded in a significant evolution beyond emerging directors to include filmmakers at every stage of their careers, with Argentinian filmmaker Lucrecia Martel serving as jury head. The competition lineup presents a vibrant cross-section of regional cinema featuring 10 titles.\n\n\tFrom Japan, Yuriyan Retriever’s “Mag Mag” played at Beyond Fest, Sitges Film Festival and the Festival du Nouveau Cinéma de Montréal. Tan Siyou’s “Amoeba,” a Singapore co-production, played at Toronto, while Thailand’s Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke brings “A Useful Ghost,” which won the Grand Prize at Cannes Critics’ Week. \n\n\tIndia’s Rohan Parashuram Kanawade competes with “Cactus Pears,” which won the World Cinema Grand Jury Prize at Sundance – the first Indian fiction film to achieve this honor. Compatriot Tribeny Rai’s Indo-Korean co-production “Shape of Momo” played at Busan, where it won the Taipei Film Commission Award and Songwon Vision Award, and also played at San Sebastián’s New Directors section. \n\n\tThai filmmaker Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit’s “Human Resource” played at Venice’s Horizons section, Busan, Vancouver and the BFI London Film Festival. \n\n\tJapan’s Sho Miyake presents “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” which won the Golden Leopard at Locarno and played in competition at Busan. Sri Lanka’s Lalith Rathnayake competes with “Riverstone,” which won best script and best cinematography at the Shanghai International Film Festival’s Asian New Talent section.\n\n\tFrom China, Chen Deming’s documentary “Always” played at CPH:DOX, where it won the main prize, and also received the best film award at Jeonju. \n\n\tIranian filmmaker Shahram Mokri’s “Black Rabbit, White Rabbit,” a Tajikistan-UAE co-production, played at Busan and won the inaugural IFFI Vision Asia Award. The film also played at the BFI London Film Festival and Chicago International Film Festival, and has been selected as Tajikistan’s entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 98th Academy Awards.\n\t\n\n\tDeepa Mehta will receive the Cinema Honorary Award, and participate in In Conversation session. The festival will also showcase her acclaimed Elements trilogy – “Fire” (1996), “Earth” (1998) and “Water” (2005) – alongside “Funny Boy” (2020) in the Deepa Mehta in Focus retrospective as part of the festival’s Landmark section dedicated to newly restored classics.\n\n\tIntroduced in 2014, the Cinema Honorary Award celebrates filmmakers who have made exceptional and enduring contributions to Asian cinema. Past recipients include Japan’s Takashi Miike, Indonesia’s Garin Nugroho, and Iran’s Jafar Panahi in 2024.\n\n\t“I am pleased to receive the Cinema Honorary Award from the Singapore International Film Festival,” said Mehta. “Previous recipients of this accolade include filmmakers I really admire, and it is meaningful to be counted among them. We are living in uncertain times, where the general mantra in the geopolitical world, especially in art institutions, reverberates with what is politically correct. This vulnerability of the arts makes those of us involved in the creation and preservation of cinema more alert than ever as to the importance of our unique voices, ensuring they are not diluted by autocratic demands.”\n\n\tYoun Yuh-jung will receive the Screen Icon Award and also take part in an In Conversation session. \n\n\tThe festival’s Foreground section will feature a special presentation of “This City Is A Battlefield (Perang Kota),” welcoming Indonesian filmmaker Mouly Surya and lead actors Chicco Jerikho, Ariel Tatum and Jerome Kurnia. The seven-country co-production includes Singapore. The section opens with “Arco,” a hand-drawn animated feature co-presented with the vOilah! French Film Festival, with animator Adam Sillard in attendance.\n\n\tThe female-driven Landmark section expands from the Deepa Mehta showcase to include restored classics that trace a cinematic lineage of women who transformed Asian cinema. “The Arch” (1968) by T’ang Shushuen, Hong Kong’s first female film director, had its 4K restoration premiere at Cannes Classics earlier this year. “Gehenu Lamai (The Girls)” (1978) by Sumitra Peries, Sri Lanka’s first female filmmaker, also received a 4K restoration that premiered at Cannes Classics. “The Razor’s Edge” (1985) by Jocelyne Saab, Lebanon’s pioneering female filmmaker, rounds out the showcase.\n\t\n\n\t“At its heart, the film offers an intimate, autobiographical perspective, capturing the teenage struggles of living and surviving in a hostile adult world, while examining questions of identity, resilience and self-discovery,” said SGIFF Programme Director Thong Kay Wee about the opening film. “As a powerful gateway into the festival’s wider slate, ‘Girl’ invites audiences to connect personally with films that do not shy away from difficult, challenging topics, while reaffirming the festival’s commitment to programming works that embrace raw, human and authentic storytelling.”\n\n\tSGIFF is in active discussions with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth to include eligible local film programs under the SG Culture Pass, a nation-wide scheme to enhance Singaporeans’ access to local arts and heritage experiences. The festival’s industry platform, SGIFF Industry Days, will also return following its successful inaugural edition in 2024.\n\n\tThe Singapore International Film Festival runs from Nov. 26-Dec. 7.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSinger-songwriter EJAE is about to step into what she calls “unknown territory.” Having spent most of her time behind the scenes as a songwriter, EJAE has just released her first single, “In Another World,” accompanied by a music video. \n\n\tEJAE soared to global success with “KPop Demon Hunters,” where she served as the singing voice of Rumi. Huntr/X, the fictional girl group from the Netflix animated film, scored four Billboard Top 10 songs. \n\t\n\n\tEJAE has also been named one of Variety’s 10 Artisans to Watch in Songwriting. As “Demon Hunters” continues to break records, EJAE is excited for people to discover a new side of her as she flexes this very different creative muscle. The song was co-written by EJAE, Ted Andreville and Breagh Isabel, who also produced alongside Vitals and Daniel Rojas.\n\n\n\tSpeaking with Variety, EJAE says, “I’ve always been a songwriter, and that was always the first thing. I guess the only difference between a songwriter and artist, for me at least, is that I’m having people hear all my demos. But now, it’s not a demo; it’s the final form.”\n\n\tWhile she’s excited, she’s also feeling scared. “Behind the scenes, I’m hiding. But when you’re bringing your whole self to it, you’re allowing people to judge you. So I think that’s the scary part.” \n\n\tHere, EJAE discusses the songwriting process behind “In Another World” and the filming of its music video.\n\t\n\t\t‘In Another World’ has such beautiful lyrics, and we’ve always known about your songwriting skills. But what does it mean to be on this new journey, releasing the single?\t\n\n\tSongwriting is what defines my artistry. The song was personal to me and my fellow co-writers. I personally wish that the song receives more attention than me, and that’s the main goal. As a songwriter, I’m not trying to bring attention to myself or my personal life. I’m trying to bring attention to the lyrics and the melody so people can feel what I felt when I was listening to music. Music helped me get through a hard time. Adele’s “Someone Like You” helped me get through a really difficult period, and I wish that’s what this song brings to other people as well.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWith so much happening due to the success of “KPop Demon Hunters,” can you talk about the timing of the single and what made now feel like the right time?\t\n\n\tI feel like people have already been hearing my lyrics and message. It was just through a different messenger, right? Whether it be “Psycho” for Red Velvet or something else, the difference is that I’m the one now who’s actually singing it. I think the timing of it all is just quite organic. It was more because of “KPop Demon Hunters” that people were finding out about my singing voice, and people were being so nice — they wanted to hear more. I was like, “I’m down if you guys are willing.” As an artist, I don’t want myself to be boxed into being a “K-pop” artist because I don’t really view myself as a K-pop artist or a pop artist. I view myself as a songwriter of every genre.\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about “In Another World.” What’s the meaning behind the lyrics?\t\n\n\tI wrote this two years ago during a songwriting camp in Canada. Every time I hear it, there’s a different meaning, and that’s what I love about this song. But we were all going through something. I was going through this personal relationship thing with my fiancé. It was an important time, and things weren’t working out. We had a break, and it was an important decision-making time for me. I think it inspired this idea of, what if we met at a time when I didn’t have my baggage? What would that be like? And if we decided not to be together, what’s a way for me to be OK with that decision to let it go?\n\n\tThat mindset helped me. Maybe in another world, we would have been perfect, and I’m leaning on that parallel world with no jealousy. I have no insecurity issues that I brought into the relationship, and it would have been perfect. It very much feels like a “Sliding Doors” situation because that’s something we all do — where we wonder, “What if?” The lyrics helped me accept reality in a way, but at the same time, be OK with it by knowing to just be real with yourself. I chose this song because it felt exactly how I felt with Rumi and the movie. Accepting your demons, then accepting that part of yourself — that is when true growth happens.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘In Another World’ artwork\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou wrote this a few years ago. Is there going to be more music in the future?\t\n\n\tYes, absolutely. It’s just about picking and choosing what is right for me, what I want to speak on, and what I feel people can relate to. It doesn’t always have to be a sad song. It could be anything.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou also filmed the music video. What’s the story behind the video?\t\n\n\t“In Another World” can mean so many different things. It was initially about the relationship, but it evolved into this thing where, as a kid, in another world, I chose a different path. I had different paths I could have taken. So, it’s a love letter to my younger self. You see me back and forth playing the piano as a kid and as an adult, and what it means to me now. It’s about those two worlds colliding.\n\n\tListen to the single here.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\tWatch the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tBoxed sets celebrating classic rock albums offer the joy of discovery, in all those abandoned alternate versions being brought into the light as bonus tracks, but usually also some simultaneous historical relief: How interesting these early arrangements sound… and thank God they didn’t ultimately get stuck there. In all those Beatles early takes you can almost always pick out something that didn’t quite work, that they found a way to fix for the better at the last minute. For the most part, though, Bruce Springsteen’s “Nebraska ’82: Expanded Edition” isn’t like that. Hearing all the different versions of songs that appeared on “Nebraska” or his next album, “Born in the U.S.A.,” there’s rarely any sense of “Glad that road was not taken.” Nearly all the alternate takes put on view here are pretty great; it’s easy to start imagining a multiverse with completely different versions of “Nebraska” nearly as wonderful as the one we got 43 years ago.\n\t\n\n\tWhat those theoretical other versions wouldn’t have been, though, is influential — or at least impactful enough that somebody would have been making a feature film about them in 2025. In the run-up to Scott Cooper’s “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” some wild claims have been made for the homemade, rough-hewn “Nebraska,” like: Bruce invented lo-fi! Not quite, but in spirit, close enough. In 1982, there was not yet a four-track cassette demo machine in every garage; “Unplugged” had not yet been invented; synths and garish, gated drum sounds were on the way in … and not many arena rockers were thinking, “How can I make a record that sounds like ‘Folkways meets Sun Studios’ — but with more murder?” Springsteen made a stripped-down aesthetic something that could forever after be defended in a corporate suite (if not always as successfully as in the slightly corny Columbia Records scenes in “Nowhere”). He made a record that didn’t just have edgy lyrics but sounded like someone cut a six-inch valley through the middle of his skull, to borrow a phrase.\n\t\n\n\tUltimately, we wouldn’t have wanted “Nebraska” any other way — but listening to the two discs of outtakes in this new set, you get glimpses of how it could have been executed differently and perhaps turned out just about as good, just not as culture-rattling. The most long-awaited component here is the disc labeled “Electric Nebraska,” which offers band versions of six songs that wound up as solo tracks on “Nebraska,” plus two that would go the opposite way and wind up bigger and slicker when finally heard on “Born in the USA.” The disc titled “Nebraska Outtakes,” meanwhile, includes solo recordings of nine compositions that didn’t make it onto “Nebraska,” making the case it could’ve been a terrific double-LP.\n\n\tBuyers also get two other discs: One is a remastering of the original album (given the aesthetic here, wouldn’t a de-mastering seem more apropos?). The other is a decent enough live performance of the album’s tracks filmed in stark (Starkweather?) B&W for Blu-Ray by longtime collaborator Thom Zimny. Springsteen went into the Count Basie Theatre in New Jersey to do this new rendering, joined in the subtlest possible way by two sidemen whose contributions are so slight, they’re practically sidelined. (Although these extra players are not as ghostly as the audience — there isn’t any.) It’s worth a look and a listen, to hear that material presented with a voice weathered by another 43 years, although the fandom would have found it more intriguing to see that stage overtaken by the E Street Band for an entire set of fresh rearrangements, not a replication of the original album with extra rasp. Anyway, better to hear Springsteen reinhabit these songs in the style to which everyone has become accustomed than not get a contemporary take at all.\n\n\tBut what you are really here for is the soul of the departures … that is, all those ‘82 outtakes. With “Electric Nebraska,” are these E Street Band renditions really the nirvana that fans have hungered to hear for four-plus decades? Yes and no — some of them don’t quite come off, but some are stunning. Although he clearly made the right overall call in not making “Nebraska” a band album after all, if you’re the type of person who can hold opposing thoughts, you may come away thinking that at least a couple of these songs really do feel superior jacked up for the E Street Band, or a few members thereof. \n\t\n\n\tThe real keepers are a trio of songs Springsteen recorded with just two E Streeters as a “rockabilly punk” power trio: “Open All Night,” “Born in the U.S.A.” and “Reason to Believe.” This is where the biggest what if comes into play. What if he’d gotten around to recording all the ”Nebraska” material with that particular tight unit on that particular day? Then the resulting album could well have been a very different masterpiece in its own right. He did not keep going, at least in this wing of the multiverse, so we can be glad for the three we’re getting in that style; to my mind, that trio merits thinking about as its own EP.\n\n\tAs for the remaining five tracks on “Electric Nebraska” that feature the full E Street lineup, perhaps only the version of “Born in the U.S.A.” that was released as this collection’s first teaser track is that galvanizing. But there are no outright clinkers in the bunch, either. The two that comes the closest to just not working on this disc are “Johnny 99” and “Downbound Train.” They’re too fleshed out — and to be specific, they both sporting roadhouse-piano parts that make what we know to be woeful tunes sound altogether too jolly. Roy Bittan is an eternal agent of happiness, of course, but a musical smile is not what those songs require; I think this marks the first time in history when I’ve thought whether a recording would sound better stripped of his piano.\n\n\tBut then, you can feel Springsteen wrestling through a lot of these unreleased takes about whether to accentuate the inherent darkness of the songwriting or to filter that through a brilliant disguise. It’s always been fascinating to do a compare-and-contrast on the “Nebraska” and “Born in the U.S.A.” albums in that regard, with the former LP eager to wallow in depression and the latter a little more inclined to wiggle through it. With the eventual release of the songs “Born in the U.S.A.” and “Working on the Highway,” Springsteen ultimately came down on the side of an ebullience that is in no way suggested by the lyrics. That was a great call on his part — we’re all grown-ups, we can handle irony — but in his earlier attempts, it also feelings valuable to hear him escort these songs to the lesser-lit side of town.\n\n\tOf any of the songs from this period, “Working on the Highway” went through the most fascinating  transformations. It appears twice on the “Nebraska Outtakes” disc, sort of. First it arrives as a substantially but not wholly different composition called “Child Bride,” which is, obviously from the title, an extremely “Nebraska”-ian take on a tune that Springsteen had not yet had the audacity to reimagine as a rockabilly rave-up. To play up that the narrator has run afoul of the law for marrying an underage girl, or to bury the lede there and just emphasize the deep fun of forced prison-gang labor? It’s not exactly surprising Springsteen went the way he did, but you’ve got to admire the brute integrity of the song’s beginnings.\n\t\n\n\t“Child Bride,” if you count it as a separate song apart from “Working on the Highway,” is one of four previously unreleased titles that appear in Springsteen’s solo sessions, included here on the “Nebraska Outtakes” disc. Even if none of them was essential, all four would have been worthy additions to “Nebraska” if it’d been released in the first wave of CDs, where longer albums were suddenly de rigueur, instead of toward the tail end of the original vinyl era. “On the Prowl” would’ve added a nice color just for how primal, even feral, it is. “Losin’ Kind” is probably the weakest of the four, as a somewhat narratively overwrought tale of just how wrong a night with a prostitute can go, although it’s hard to turn down any Springsteen song that ends with a wreck on the highway, isn’t it? \n\n\tProbably the most interesting of the four unheard compositions is “Gun in Every Home,” in which nothing nearly so dramatic happens, but that’s part of why it would’ve offered a slightly different color to the album. Yes, there’s a gun in the first act, but it doesn’t go off in the third; the fact that the threat is violence is placed in an affluent neighborhood gets at how paranoia infiltrates the suburbs, too, and hardly just forsaken small towns.\n\n\tKind of the coolest thing about the “Outtakes” disc, though, is how it includes discarded solo recordings that have more early-Elvis energy than those that made the album. Imagine a “Nebraska” with “Pink Cadillac” on it! That sounds wrong, right? But that and a few other alternate versions of familiar tunes sound like something that could have come out of Memphis, suggesting a possible version of the album that could have balanced out the brooding with some greasy fun.\n\n\tBut no one should regret that the final LP was streamlined to be more of a downer. Arguably, the Reagan years demanded it, to fully consider the power outage in that shining city on a hill — or that mansion on the hill — before Springsteen lit everything up again with “Born in the U.S.A.” After his simpler-sounding one-off, we would never feel so simple again.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGreg Berlanti accepted the inaugural Greg Berlanti Social Impact Award at the UCLA Center for Scholars and Storytellers‘ annual Teens and Screens Summit on Thursday in Los Angeles. The writer, director, producer and showrunner behind movies and shows such as “Love, Simon,” “Dawsons Creek,” “Riverdale,” “You” and multiple series in the CW’s “Arrowverse” delivered a heartfelt acceptance speech reflecting on his journey towards self-acceptance, which led him to create shows that help audiences feel represented, seen, and loved.\n\t\n\n\t“As storytellers in Hollywood, we get to heal our own old stories, crafting new ones that are honest and vulnerable, and those stories, in turn, can change hearts and minds and remind the audience how much more universal human experience is than different,” a dewy-eyed Berlanti explained, “We all still want to connect. We all still want to be seen and understood. We all want love.”\n\n\n\tBerlanti shared some of those “old stories” that he’s had the opportunity to heal and expand upon throughout his illustrious career. He started with his own childhood, reminiscing about his boyish love for television while also realizing  “there was still a great void. I was a closeted gay teenager, and there were only a smattering of LGBTQ characters on TV.”\n\n\tHe reflected on how a haphazard encounter with an AIDS march in New York City gave him his first positive representation of queer people, but when one of the marchers reached out a hand to him, he rejected it. “He waited for me to take it, but I didn’t. I didn’t have the courage. I feared my parents or someone would figure out my secret if I took that hand, so I just looked away,” he said, “I spent much of my youth running from that out-stretched hand, first afraid, but then, over time, finding the strength to come out and ultimately come to love myself.”\n\t\n\n\tThe event came full circle decades later, when Berlanti screened “Love, Simon” in Olathe, Kansas in 2018. After the screening, a 14-year-old boy came out publicly and thanked Berlanti for providing him with shows and movies that allowed him to feel a little less alone. “As he reached out his hand to shake mine,” Berlanti recalled, “It wasn’t lost on me that I was getting a second shot to make up for the hand that I didn’t take so many years before.”\n\n\tBerlanti’s writing partners Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson introduced the award and its namesake. “When you work with Greg, you cry a lot, and that’s not by accident. There’s always big, heartfelt emotion at the center of Greg’s work, because that’s what Greg is,” Williamson said, with Plec adding, “He’s given us some of the most heartfelt, diverse, ambitious storytelling and television, whether it’s a superhero in a cave, a teenager falling in love for the first time, or a family finding its way, his shows don’t just entertain us. They see us.”\n\n\tMolly Ringwald, who starred in “Riverdale,” also sent in a video comparing Berlanti to John Hughes. She said that her iconic YA collaborations with Hughes from the 1980s have “stood the test of time, but they are also of their time,” adding “Greg Berlanti has built upon this legacy, shaping our modern portrayals of adolescence in much the same way, but with more representation of our diverse society.”\n\n\tThe ceremony’s focus on Berlanti’s contributions to the YA space was a fitting emphasis for the Summit, which comes in the wake of the Center for Scholars and Storytellers’ annual Teens and Screens report. The report provides insight into the media tastes and consumption habits of Gen-Z Americans. Among the findings were that young Americans still value traditional movies and television, though it is oftten consumed in small bites on TikTok and YouTube, they have a notable preference for animation, don’t care for over-sexualized love stories and crave content that offers authentic representations of lives like their own.\n\n\tThe summit unpacked these findings across multiple panels and discussions featuring media executives, content creators and academics. The most memorable panel may have been the “Ask The Teens” panel, where four teenagers took the stage for a conversation about their tastes, moderated by Roblox Youth Engagement Program Manager Andres Cuervo. The young panelists affirmed much of what the study suggested, expanding upon teens’ aversion to “trend chasing” media that feels artificial and out of touch in lieu of more earnest storytelling. As 14-year-old Hollyn Alpert said, “Teens, like adults, aren’t monoliths. They all have different opinions. They all have different views, beliefs, races, sexualities, religions. Just explore that and embrace that.” A room full of seasoned Hollywood professionals listened intently.\n\t\n\n\tBerlanti summed up the importance of heeding these young voices, saying, “What a gift it is to make a positive influence on the young lives of audiences by reminding them of these things and to give them a sense of belonging and empathy and self worth. In return, they give us hope. Young people are the ones I get my greatest sense of hope from these days. No matter how dark things seem today or as rocky as the journey to our future may end up being, I believe that the future will be brighter because of our young people.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tRyan Coogler sent his go-to cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw the script for “Sinners” the night before she started shooting Gia Coppola’s “The ",
    "body": "\n\tRyan Coogler sent his go-to cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw the script for “Sinners” the night before she started shooting Gia Coppola’s “The Last Showgirl.”\n\n\t“I read it and I was just blown away, because if you don’t know anything about the storyline and you read something like that, that’s so unique,” Arkapaw says. She responded to Coogler’s script by sending him a long email. “I just unloaded all my thoughts about how it made me feel, the visual stuff that popped out, and what I liked about it.”\n\t\n\n\tSet in the Mississippi Delta during the Jim Crow era, “Sinners” stars Michael B. Jordan as identical twins Smoke and Stack, who return to town after encountering the Chicago mob. The twins rally the local community to help build a juke joint. However, when the sun sets, vampires show up and wreak havoc on the town and the juke’s opening night.\n\n\tArkapaw made history when she became the first cinematographer to shoot 65mm film in IMAX. \n\n\tBut that decision came during the testing process. Coogler had previously used the Super 16 format when filming “Fruitvale Station,” a format he had wanted to return to. Sitting down for Variety’s Inside the Frame, Arkapaw says, “It started to progress as we had more conversations with the visual effects supervisor. Because of the twinning aspect in the film, the 35mm format had a more stable gate and was more friendly for the kind of work we had to do. So, we transitioned to thinking about the movie in 35mm. And then Ryan got a call from the studio asking if we had talked about large format, and that caused him to just open his mind up.”\n\t\n\n\tThe two went out to the desert near Lancaster, Calif., and tested IMAX 35mm and 65mm, with Coogler showing a keen interest in showcasing the landscape — an idea inspired by Quentin Tarantino‘s “The Hateful Eight,” which was shot on 65mm film using Ultra Panavision 70mm. “We screened those tests at FotoKem and the headquarters of IMAX. After you see what you created, you can’t unsee that stuff.”\n\n\tOne of the vampires, Remmick, is played by Jack O’Connell. In the film, he appears almost midway through, dropping into the frame with a farmhouse in the distance as birds circle overhead. Arkapaw says it was one of her favorite scenes, revealing that Coogler’s script actually opened with the sequence. “I remember when I read it, I was blown away, because I’m like, ‘Where did he come up with this stuff?’ He’s very good at just writing things that jump off the page and get people excited. And that comes from his love of cinema and being in the theater. You’re watching ‘Jaws’ or ‘The Dark Knight,’ and you have these scenes that just wrap their arms around you, and you feel like you’re a part of the scene. And that was how he wrote that scene.”\n\n\tArkapaw says that Coogler discussed the scene with editor, Michael Shawver and ended up putting it further down in the timeline. “It was one of my favorite scenes, and it read like a Western. I was very excited to shoot it, and I could see it in my head the moment I read it. It’s about Remmick’s entrance into the film, trying to approach this desolate farmhouse where he meets these two farmers. He is trying to get into the house and take cover because he’s claiming to be chased by some Choctaw Indians.”\n\n\tThe key to the scene was getting that entrance right. Coogler wanted it to be grand. Arkapaw says, “It was important for Ryan that you give a hint at the fact that he can fly. Jack jumped off the box, and we did it a few times to get it right because Ryan wanted it to look a certain way. You’re close to the camera, and it just hints at the fact that maybe he’s flying, that he has supernatural powers. Later, obviously, in the scene, you see that he’s a vampire because you meet him again in the back room in the nursery.”\n\n\tAnother aspect of the scene was setting it against magic hour when the sun is setting. It was important to see the sun break the horizon and understand what that meant for the storytelling. Arkapaw had two days to shoot the sequence. She says, “We shot it for one day, and then we went back to complete some work, which allowed us more time to get it in camera.”\n\t\n\n\tIt wasn’t all smooth sailing. The shots with the Choctaw watching the sun drop were all in camera. “The IMAX camera jammed right before we were about to shoot that one shot of him looking at the sun on the horse. You see over his shoulder the sun dropping. But we were able to fix the jam, and we literally rolled right before it set.”\n\n\tAs for her historic shoot, Arkapaw says she wanted the format to sing, and this was a prime example where it did just that. “We had cameras on cranes, and there are a lot of moving shots like an old Western, being able to track with the horses. It’s a beautiful scene.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Oklahoma City Thunder and the Golden State Warriors weren’t the only winners of this year’s NBA tip-off. Airing its first NBA games since 2002, NBC and Peacock earned a strong audience of 5.6 million average viewers for its broadcast of both games on Tuesday night.\n\n\tThat number, based on linear measurement from Nielsen and digital data from Adobe Analytics, is not only an 87% improvement from last year’s NBA tip-off, which hit 3 million viewers on TNT, but the biggest audience the doubleheader has seen in more than 10 years. No season opener has reached those heights since 2012 — or 2010 if you exclude 2011’s unusual Christmas Day tip-off. And given that the 2010 games included LeBron James’ debut with the Miami Heat, it’s impressive that NBC’s telecast came so close to that record.\n\t\n\n\tThe 5.6 million total represents the average number of people watching at any given moment of the broadcast. When broken down into shorter segments, Tuesday’s doubleheader peaked at 7.1 million viewers between 10:45 and 11 p.m. ET, during which the Thunder beat the Houston Rockets by one point in double overtime. Averaging 5.9 million viewers overall, the Thunder-Rockets game’s viewership was certainly also boosted by the fact that it was Kevin Durant’s debut as a Houston player and marked a face-off with the team he started his career with. The Warriors-Lakers game averaged 5.1 million viewers overall.\n\n\n\tAdditionally, NBC Sports achieved its largest non-NFL and non-Olympics simulstream audience ever with an average minute audience of 1 million viewers from a combination of Peacock and NBC Sports Digital. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThere’s a motorized blade on his face and adolescent hormones coursing through his body, as he fights villainous entities bent on causing humans harm. Sixteen-year-old Denji (voiced by Kikunosuke Toya) has never attended school, but instead works as a Public Safety Devil Hunter (he is part demon, part human). Alongside the protagonists of “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle,” he joins the chorus of animated paladins facing off diabolical adversaries on the big screen this year.\n\t\n\n\tBut before “Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” ever shows him in his monstrous form, Denji’s teenage insecurities and romantic woes come to the foreground. From director Tatsuya Yoshihara, the first film spawned from the popular series, which is in turn based on the manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto, drops us into an already established universe — as movies based on anime shows tend to do. \n\n\n\tContext clues might help those with minimal knowledge of “Chainsaw Man” gather that in this reality, demons with superhuman powers are a constant threat. Otherwise, it’s all mostly recognizable as identical to our world. Designed to satisfy existing fans, not so much to gain new acolytes, “Chainsaw Man” can still entertain because at its barest, the concept and plot don’t seem too intricate.\n\n\tAn awkward boy, Denji nervously agrees to go on a date with his boss, Makima (Tomori Kusunoki). Their rendezvous feels like an homage to cinema, as they spend an entire day hopping from one movie theater to another. She has strong opinions on the quality of the films, he’s concerned that nothing seems to move him. It’s only when watching an art-house film late at night that they both fully bask in the power of the medium. Up to this point, even if one has little information about these characters and their bond, “Chainsaw Man” plays like a teenage dramedy, and it remains that way for a third of its running time.\n\t\n\n\tThat Makima disappears for most of the remaining drama and chaos reiterates the film’s episodic quality. Likely, she’ll simply return in the next chapter on TV, thus her absence is not a cause for alarm. A central love triangle emerges, at least in Denji’s eager mind, when he meets Reze, a server at a local café. Her overt interest in him is enough for him to reciprocate. But she might not be who she says she is. Evocative animation, with subdued blue hues and soft lighting, conveys the flirtatiousness of their rapid connection in a scene where the two swim together in a pool at night. It’s also here that a few glimpses into Denji’s mind show sexually suggestive images of both Makima and Reze, as he struggles to decide whom to be faithful to, making it clear that a mature audience is the target.\n\n\tWhen Reze is revealed as the extremely violent Bomb Devil, a hurt Denji realizes that she doesn’t want to gain his heart, but quite literally carve it out of his chest. The necklace she wears is the safety pin she can pull to detonate herself, just as Denji pulls the starter cord on his chest to become Chainsaw Man, both are clever character design details. “Chainsaw Man” sporadically checks in on a separate storyline with Aki (Shôgo Sakata), Denji’s coworker, and a halo-sporting Angel Devil (Maaya Uchida), offering even fewer details about the pair’s relevance, other than a shocking undercurrent of nihilism. As Reze’s violence escalates, all the “good guys” come together in a unified front against the malevolent Reze.\n\n\tThe corpses of deceased civilians litter the streets as blood pools — beheadings, dismemberments and bodies exploded into liquid flesh — while buildings and other structures collapse. This is a war zone. Fundraisers for the victims of devil attacks, apparently a common occurrence in this reality, acknowledge the death toll that these supernatural clashes leave behind. That’s more than one can say for the “Avengers” movies, where the destruction that results from the many confrontations is not dealt with.\n\n\tA whirling semi-final showdown unfolds inside a sentient devil typhon and gives way to even more frantic editing as Denji in Chainsaw Man form rides his unwanted sidekick, an anthropomorphic shark, to defeat Reze. The action here moves at lightning speed with fiery explosions and relentless chaos taking over the screen via an impressive amalgamation of fluid character animation and high-octane effects. The second half of this epic scrimmage between good and evil feels like an unending sequence of increasingly deadly battles.\n\t\n\n\t“Chainsaw Man” eventually lands on a more emotional resolution, proposing that the attraction between Denji and Reze was perhaps mutual (could a devil fall in love?), only to turn around and end on a gruesome note that delivers swift and brutal justice. For someone steeped in the characters and lore, watching anime films like this must yield the satisfaction of seeing familiar screen friends in a bigger adventure and canvas. For the uninitiated, however, it’s like catching up with a train that left the station a while ago, and that one may not be all that interested in boarding anyway.\n",

The team is sending thoughts to the Vesias during this troubling time.\n      \n    \n        Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n      \n    \n          While the Dodgers didn't say what the personal matter is, we do know Kayla's pregnant with the couple's first child -- with Kayla looking ready to give birth any day in photos taken on the field after the Dodgers advanced to the World Series. It's unclear if that is at all related to his absence from the team.\n      \n\n          Vesia's been a key contributor out of the Dodgers bullpen this postseason. He pitched five times for the club between the National League Division Series and National League Championship Series without allowing a single run. In last year's World Series against the New York Yankees, Vesia pitched 2 2/3 scoreless innings and even picked up a save in Game 2.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Tanner Scott -- another Dodgers lefty reliever -- missed the first three rounds of the playoff run due to abcess excision surgery .... though he said this week he's feeling much better.

She was subsequently banned from the grounds for the act.\n      \n    \n          Perhaps the most problematic inclusion, however, is a visit by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood to the White House in 2012 on the heels of the Arab Spring, which saw a wave of protests in the Middle East in 2011. The Muslim Brotherhood controlled much of the government in Egypt until they were ousted by the military in 2013.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          A photo of President Barack Obama dressed in a turban served as the thumbnail for the event ... but, the picture is actually from 2006 when Obama visited Kenya, not when he was POTUS. In addition, President Obama never met with any members of the Egyptian Brotherhood directly -- so, the image is doubly confusing.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          This seems to be the Trump administration's response to questions about the ballroom he's building ... with Democratic leaders in Congress posting about how he's completely destroying the East Wing of the iconic building. His administration has pointed out the building changes all the time -- doubling down on the point here.\n      \n    \n          We don't imagine this will simmer down tensions between Dems and Republicans ... which probably doesn't bode too well for ending the government shutdown.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Joe Biden\n              \n                          \n                Donald Trump\n              \n                          \n                Bill Clinton\n              \n                          \n                Hunter Biden\n              \n                          \n                Barack Obama\n              \n                          \n                LGBT\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                          \n                White House\n              \n                          \n                Drugs & Alcohol\n              \n                          \n                Politix\n              \n                          \n                Controversial S#!T\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Fights & Feuds\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

'cause TMZ has learned a full reunion isn't in the group's future.\n      \n    \n          Here's the deal ... after Bon Jovi announced their \"Forever\" tour scheduled for next summer, fans flocked to social media, totally convinced the group would bring Richie back for a show or two.\n      \n    \n          However, sources with direct knowledge tell us fans who are trying to \"Never Say Goodbye\" to Sambora are delusional ... because we're told such a reunion isn't going to happen.

Richie left Bon Jovi in 2013 to focus on his family -- straight-up bailing on the tour at the time without a word of warning -- and he only played with the group again in 2018 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction.\n      \n    \n          JBJ recently revealed he and Richie watched \"Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story\" together when it came out on Hulu in 2024. In that doc, Sambora apologized to his fellow Bon Jovi bandmates for the way he left the group, though he stood by his decision to leave.\n      \n    \n          Richie was wanted -- alive, not dead, unlike the song suggests -- but, looks like fans will just have to keep dreaming of a reunion instead.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Richie Sambora\n              \n                          \n                Jon Bon Jovi\n              \n                          \n                Bon Jovi\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Feuds\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

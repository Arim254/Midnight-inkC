    "body": "\n\tJioHotstar has joined forces with OpenAI to bring a ChatGPT-branded discovery experience to what is India’s most widely used streaming service, enabling its nearly half a billion monthly users to search for content through spoken or typed natural language rather than conventional menu navigation.\n\n\tThe partnership sees OpenAI’s technology embedded directly into the JioHotstar app, replacing keyword-driven search with an assistant capable of interpreting contextual and emotionally nuanced requests. Rather than hunting for titles manually, a viewer could describe a family situation or a personal quirk and receive tailored suggestions in response. The tool is also designed to work alongside live sports coverage, giving users a conversational way to access match information, player data, and key moments in real time.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal is designed to work in both directions. JioHotstar’s catalogue – which comprises over 300,000 hours of programming in 19 languages, drawn from a broadcast network of more than 100 channels as well as original and licensed content – will also be surfaced within ChatGPT itself. Users asking the chatbot for viewing suggestions will receive recommendations with direct links to relevant JioHotstar titles.\n\n\n\tJioHotstar’s parent company is JioStar, the Indian media giant formed from the merger of Disney’s Star India and Reliance’s Viacom18. \n\n\t“AI marks a transformative shift for the media and entertainment industry. It fundamentally disrupts every aspect of the value chain, from conceptualisation and production to discovery and monetisation,” said Uday Shankar, vice chair of JioStar. “Our partnership with OpenAI will allow viewers to discover, engage with, and even curate content simply using their voice. This is a fundamental reimagining of the entertainment experience; one that anticipates culture and feels deeply personal to every viewer.”\n\t\n\n\tFidji Simo, CEO of Applications at OpenAI, added: “Traditionally, entertainment is a one-way experience where you passively consume content – AI completely changes that dynamic. Through our partnership with JioHotstar, we’re bringing personalized AI directly into entertainment and live sports, turning every moment into an opportunity for deeper engagement.”\n\n\tThe experience will be introduced gradually, with an initial rollout across a limited set of features before broader deployment across both on-demand and live formats.\n\n\tThe announcement places JioHotstar among the first major streaming platforms in India to embed a named AI assistant at the core of its product, as the country’s increasingly crowded digital entertainment market pushes services to compete on intelligence and personalization rather than library size alone.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMMA fighter Sean Strickland went on a bigoted tirade on Wednesday during the Paramount+ and UFC media day event, during which he called Bad Bunny a “f—-t” and said women have been empowered “too much” to the point where they’ve “ruined society.”\n\n\tStrickland participated in the Paramount+ and UFC Media Day to promote his fight with Anthony Hernandez on Saturday night. The fight marks Strickland’s first bout since he was suspended from the UFC in July 2025 for attacking another fighter while working as a cornerman during an event.\n\t\n\n\tParamount+ did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment. Reps for the UFC did not immediately respond for comment. \n\n\n\tWhen asked about Netflix’s upcoming MMA match between Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano, Strickland called the event an “insane” idea and suggested they should fight “half naked.” He then joked about Rousey’s abusive relationship with her ex-boyfriend.\n\n\t“Ronda Rousey can fight,” Strickland said. “That bitch can fight… I think she lost a few fights to her ex, but bitch can fight.”\n\n\tHe then said of Carano, “I like Gina. She’s like super conservative. She was hot, you know. I was like a kid when she fought. I may have jerked off to her once or twice back in the day.”\n\n\tThe former UFC middleweight champ went on to say that “no one gives a fuck about women’s sports.” He added, “There’s nothing wrong with women. They do great things. They cook, they clean.”\n\n\tIn later comments about the NFL, Strickland called Super Bowl LX halftime performer Bad Bunny a “fucking f—-t” and lamented the days when the National Football League was the “fucking standard of being a fucking man.”\n\t\n\n\t“I think they all get together around a table and say, ‘You know what guys, how do we ruin this sport? How do we gay it up?’” Strickland said, mocking NFL leadership. “’Why don’t we bring in a gay foreigner who doesn’t speak fucking English and have him perform [the halftime show]?’”\n\n\tIn August 2025, Paramount inked a seven-year deal with TKO Group under which Paramount+ became the exclusive home of all UFC events in the U.S. The contract has an average annual value of $1.1 billion, with an overall value of $7.7 billion. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSony Pictures has joined the outcry against Seedance 2.0, the Chinese video platform that has united Hollywood studios in their condemnation of AI-generated copyright infringement.\n\n\tIn a cease and desist letter sent Wednesday, the studio demanded that ByteDance immediately remove its valuable IP — including “Breaking Bad” and the “Spider-Verse” films — from the Seedance AI training data.\n\n\n\t“Given the egregious nature of Seedance 2.0’s outputs and the complete lack of observable copyright guardrails at launch, SPE can only conclude that ByteDance’s infringements are willful,” wrote Jill Ratner, general counsel of Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\t\n\n\tSony is the fifth studio to lodge a protest directly with ByteDance, following similar letters from Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros. and Netflix. ByteDance has sought to reassure copyright holders that it will strengthen its measures to prevent copyright infringement and misuse of actors’ likenesses, but that has not quelled the protest.\n\n\n\t“SPE will not tolerate delayed or half-baked measures,” Ratner wrote. “Please contact us immediately to confirm that effective, robust, and meaningful guardrails are being implemented forthwith.”\n\n\tSeedance 2.0 AI clips have circulated on social media since last week, with users taking the opportunity to stage superhero fight scenes and create alternate endings of TV shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Stranger Things.” \n\n\tThe Motion Picture Association — which represents all five studios, plus Amazon and Universal Studios — was first out of the gate with its condemnation on Feb. 12, when CEO Charles Rivkin called on ByteDance to immediately cease its infringement.\n\t\n\n\tOn Wednesday, Netflix threatened “immediate litigation” if the company did not comply.\n\n\tDisney, Warner Bros. and Universal are also pursuing litigation against Midjourney and MiniMax over their AI video models. Those cases are at the earliest stages. \n\n\tMiniMax, like ByteDance, is headquartered in China, and the plaintiffs have had difficulty serving the defendants. According to a court filing, the studios’ lawyer has been told that it could take 18 to 24 months to serve defendants via the Chinese Ministry of Justice under the Hague Convention — suggesting that any action against ByteDance would face similar delays.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFCC chairman Brendan Carr confirmed Wednesday that the commission has started enforcement proceedings of what he asserted were violations of the equal time rule involving political candidates by ABC’s daytime mainstay “The View.”\n\n\tCarr appeared on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle,” where he also slammed Stephen Colbert and CBS’ “The Late Show” over the flap that emerged Monday and Tuesday over the show’s interview with James Talarico, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Texas.\n\t\n\n\tCarr has made public statements in recent weeks that appear designed to put broadcast networks on notice that the FCC plans to enforce its equal time rules related to political candidates on shows that historically have been seen as exempt from the rule because they are akin to news programs. News programs are not bound by the rule that demands that networks give equal airtime to viable political candidates during the lead-up to an election. “The View” is known for its timely conversations on “hot topics,” in the show’s parlance. It is produced by ABC News.\n\n\n\t“If you are bona fide news, you don’t have to give candidates equal air time,” Carr told Ingraham. “But, Disney and ‘The View’ have not established that that program is, in fact, bona fide news. We’ve started enforcement proceedings, taking a look at that. And, again, we’re going to hold broadcasters accountable.”\n\n\tA rep for “The View” declined to comment. The spark for Carr’s probe appears to be Talarico’s Feb. 2 appearance on the show.\n\n\tCarr, as usual, praised President Donald Trump for what he described as Trump’s leadership in attacking the news media. “The days that these legacy media broadcasters get to decide what we can say, what we can think, who we can vote for are over. I think President Trump played a key role in just smashing the facade that they still get to decide the narrative here,” Carr said. \n\t\n\n\tCarr then turned to the controversy that erupted Monday evening when Stephen Colbert told viewers that CBS had blocked him from airing an interview segment with Talarico because of Carr’s statements about late-night shows and the equal time rule. On Tuesday, CBS denied that it made any such decision and was only advising “The Late Show” producers of the legal guidelines, given Carr’s new interpretation of the equal time rule. \n\n\tCarr seized on CBS’ denial to harshly criticize Colbert and Democrats in general.\n\n\t“President Trump has been so far ahead the curve on so many issues, on the economy, on border security, and perhaps nowhere else when he called out the legacy media for being fake news. And yesterday the American people got to see that on full display. It’s why people have more trust and faith in gas station sushi today than they do in the legacy news media. This was Democrat-on-Democrat violence,” Carr said. \n\n\tCarr pointed to the fact that Talarico’s campaign got a burst of attention from the Colbert flap, which translated to more than $2 million in donations to his campaign. Carr stated without evidence that the dust up was manufactured to benefit Talarico. “This was all about a political candidate trying to get attention and clicks. And the news media ran with it like lemmings. They just ate it up.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFresh from her run on “The Traitors,” Lisa Rinna held court at a backyard luncheon at her Beverly Hills home on Tuesday to celebrate the release of her latest memoir, “You Better Believe I’m Going to Talk About It.”\n\n\tGuests included friends, such as fellow “Housewives” Dorit Kemsley, Teddi Mellencamp and Erika Jayne; her co-stars on “The Traitors,” Monét X Change and Maura Higgins, Carmen Electra and comedian Atsuko Okatsuk. Her family, husband Harry Hamlin and daughter Delilah Belle, were also by Rinna’s side.\n\t\n\n\tRinna, who hosted the lunch with Instyle editor-in-chief Sally Holmes, lived up to her fashionista reputation in a Richard Quinn dress and latex top by Busted.\n\n\n\t“I feel it’s part of my job to show women that you can be so much more than an expiration date that they’ve given us as women,” Rinna, 62, told me. “It really is a mindset. If you don’t feel like you have to be older person, then don’t. Have fun!”\n\n\n\tThe soiree took place just days after Rinna filmed “The Traitors” reunion, where she reportedly had a dust up with her show nemesis Colton Underwood. “It’s silly,” Rinna said. “It’s a game. I never meant any harm…Hopefully, we can all have a kumbaya moment.”\n\n\tWhile a Page Six report alleges Underwood stormed out of the reunion taping because of Rinna, she offered her account of what happened. “I didn’t see it myself,” she said. “I saw him leave, but I saw other people leave too, to go to the bathroom and such, but it took a long time for people to come back. That I can share with you. \n\t\n\n\t“But let’s put it on the record, because they probably won’t air it, right?” Rinna continued. “I said, ‘Colton, I have a question for you: What did you mean when you said, “I’m going to take her hostage?”’ That’s all I said. And that spun him out.” (A source who was at the taping of the reunion tells me that Underwood “did not storm out or spin out at any point.”)\n\n\tUnderwood came under fire when he said during a confessional on the show that he wanted to take a Traitor “hostage.” When Rinna wouldn’t accept his offer to protect each other for the rest of the season, he schemed to get her banished.\n\n\tRinna, in turn, took to social media and called Underwood a “stalker,” a reference to allegations made against him by his ex-girlfriend Cassie Randolph after they met on “The Bachelor.”\n\n\tSadly, some fans took things too far, with Underwood telling Variety’s Emily Longeretta that he received death threats during his time on “The Traitors.” Rinna immediately denounced the toxicity.\n\n\t“It’s just insane, and that is unnecessary,” she told me. “I do think that’s ridiculous. I’m fine with Colton. I think Colton is also fine with me.”\n\n\tHowever, Rinna pointed out, “He did unfollow me on Instagram. So that is the drama. I’m like, ‘Really? somebody unfollowed me like a boyfriend, a girlfriend?’”\n\n\tWhen asked for a comment, a representative for Underwood said, “Lisa has always been privately kind to Colton, which makes some of her public behavior all the more confusing — it doesn’t match their private communications, and it seems like she’s trying to manufacture conflict that doesn’t exist. Colton feels incredibly grateful for the overwhelming support he’s received from the cast.”\n\n\tExpect more tea to be spilled when Rinna is a guest on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” for the first time in four years on Feb. 25. She and Cohen have feuded over the Bravo host sharing their private text messages in his book 2023 book, “The Daddy Diaries: The Year I Grew Up.” \n\n\tShe and Cohen did have a chance to catch up when he hosted the reunion of “The Traitors.” \n\n\t“I sat next to him at the reunion, so we chatted,” Rinna said. “He knows I threw his book in the fireplace and all of that. It’s all out there. It’s all cool.”\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOver half of YouTube’s U.K. audience watches via a television set, according to the latest viewing habits report from U.K. ratings body Barb.\n\n\tAccording to the report, published today, while almost half of YouTube viewing is on smartphones, tablets and laptops, 54% is on a TV set across all demographics. Barb now calls the video platform a “significant part of the U.K.’s AV ecosystem.”\n\n\n\tYouTube is also the fourth most-viewed navigation platform making it, in Barb’s view, as much of a “gateway to content” as EPGs on traditional cable and satellite platforms. According to the report, ITV’s average YouTube reach via a TV set for its content was 4.9 million in 2025. For Sky that figure was 3.4 million and for Channel 4 it was 2.5 million.\n\t\n\n\tWhich means that as well as being a place for content creators to start their careers before crossing over to “traditional” broadcasters or streamers, such as Mr Beast and Mark Rober, TV companies are increasingly looking to the tech company for discovery.\n\n\n\tBBC Studios is among a number of traditional TV companies who have inked a partnership with YouTube. Last year the production company’s digital SVP Jasmine Dawson took part in a joint Mipcom panel with YouTube’s EMEA boss Pedro Pina, in which she extolled the benefits of working with the tech company. “We’re not sacrificing anything,” she said. “Actually it’s incremental. And that is a really powerful conversation to have our distribution partners, whether it’s ‘Bluey’ with Disney or some of our BBC Earth titles with PBS and other distributors, they understand that this is where the fandom grows, and then it drives incrementality.”\n\t\n\n\tHowever YouTube is bested by Netflix when it comes to switch on, meaning where a viewer goes first when they switch on their TV. According to this metric, a third of viewers go to traditional broadcasters, a third to streamers and YouTube combined and a third everywhere else.\n\n\tOf the third who go to the streamers/YouTube, Netflix leads the way with 14% of the audience going to the “Love is Blind” streamer first compared to YouTube’s 10%.\n\n\tFor 16–34-year-olds Netflix is the most popular platform and where 26% of that demographic go upon first switching on the TV. For children aged 4-15 years old 26% head to YouTube first in any viewing session with the TV set the most-used device for watching the platform.\n\n\tOther significant trends show the continued decline of live TV from 60% of all viewing on a TV set in 2022 to 45% in Dec. 2025. Unsurprisingly sport continues to be a big driver of live TV, with the Women’s Euros final, which saw England defeat Spain, draw in a combined average audience of 9.8 million across the BBC and ITV, of which 94% of people watched it live.\n\n\tFamily viewing also continues to pull in large live audiences, who consider it appointment viewing, including the Eurovision Song Contest grand final, “Celebrity Traitors” and even “Gogglebox.”\n\n\tOn-demand streaming continues to account for a large number of views, amounting to 38% of U.K. viewing in 2025. Curiously, a large proportion of viewing on Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and Netflix — the U.K.’s three biggest streamers – was library content that had been available for more than 12 months. According to Barb, “Bluey” accounted for 4.2% of all TV set viewing of Disney+.\n\n\t“Commentary about television is too often based on a binary premise that ignores a more complex reality,” said Barb CEO Justin Sampson. “Barb’s independent evidence points to a world in which viewing is defined more by adaptation than disruption.”\n\n\t“The prognosis is more connected, nuanced and resilient than the clichés and partial viewpoints suggest. Live audiences are healthy, children and young people haven’t deserted linear services, and there’s an increasingly symbiotic relationship between all services and platforms in the TV ecosystem.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tYo, I’ll tell you what I want, what I really, really want. “The Masked Singer” guest panelist Taraji P. Henson — unmasked earlier this season as Scarab — is back on next week’s “Spice Girls Night” episode, dressed as Scary Spice. Zig-a-zig, ah!\n\n\tThere’s no new episode of “The Masked Singer” this week, given the tough Winter Olympics competition. Instead, Fox is repeating its 2024 special “The Real Full Monty,” feauring the late James Van Der Beek, who starred in the event to raise funds and awareness for the Colorectal Cancer Alliance.\n\t\n\n\tBut when “The Masked Singer” returns next week for “Spice Girls Night,” Henson will be there in costume as “Scarab Spice, aka Scary Spice,” and Variety has two first looks:\n\n\tThe episode will feature contestants singing iconic Spice Girls songs, including Crane (singing “Say You’ll Be There”), Snowcone (singing “Wannabe”) and Pugcasso (singing “Too Much”).\n\n\tAnd Henson won’t be the only panelist dressed as a Spice Girl. Here are the others:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJenny McCarthy Wahlberg as Baby Spice on “Spice Girl Night” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRita Ora as Posh Spice on “Spice Girl Night”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRobin Thicke as Ginger Spice on “Spice Girl Night”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrae Patton\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKen Jeong as Old Spice on “Spice Girl Night” \n\t\n\n\n\n\tHigh Voltage, Pangolin, Eggplant, Galaxy Girl, Stingray, Cat Witch, Pugcasso, Snow Cone and Crane remain in the competition as “The Masked Singer” returns next week.\n\n\tBilly Ray Cyrus (Owl), Teddi Mellencamp (Calla Lily), Claudia Oshry (Queen Corgi), Taraji P. Henson (Scarab), Tone Loc (Handyman), Tiffany Haddish (Le Who Who), Todd and Julie Chrisley (Croissants) and David “Big Papi” Ortiz (Googly Eyes) are the celebrities unmasked so far on “The Masked Singer” Season 14.\n\t\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” Season 14 themed episodes include a tribute to “Star Trek,” the ‘90s comedy “Clueless,” the comic franchise “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and the blockbuster “Twilight Saga” films. Also Fox’s new “Fear Factor” reboot will feature host Johnny Knoxville in a “Fear Factor: House of Fear Night,” and an “Ozzfest Night” honors late rocker Ozzy Osbourne, including a special tribute by “Masked Singer” alum Kelly Osbourne (Season 2’s Ladybug) saluting her father’s musical influence.\n\n\tThe 18 Masked contestants in Season 14 include Eggplant, Pugcasso, Queen Corgi, the Croissants, Owl, 14 Karat Carrot, Snow Cone, Galaxy Girl, High Voltage, Googly Eyes, Scarab, Handyman, Crane, Le Who Who, Pangolin, Stingray, Cat Witch and Calla Lily.\n\n\tPer the show, the Season 14 contestants have sold a combined 94 million records, received 47 Teen Choice Award nominations, 12 Emmy nominations, two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one Tony Award win and one Academy Award nomination.\n\n\tPast “The Masked Singer” winners include T-Pain as Monster (Season 1), Wayne Brady as Fox (Season 2), Kandi Burruss as Night Angel (Season 3), LeAnn Rimes as Sun (Season 4), Nick Lachey as Piglet (Season 5), Jewel as Queen of Hearts (Season 6), Teyana Taylor as Firefly (Season 7), Amber Riley as Harp (Season 8), Bishop Briggs as Medusa (Season 9), Ne-Yo as Cow (Season 10), Vanessa Hudgens as Goldfish (Season 11), Boyz II Men as Buffalos (Season 12) and Gretchen Wilson as Pearl (Season 13).\n\n\t“The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment. Rosie Seitchik, Craig Plestis and Cannon are executive producers, while Seitchik serves as showrunner. The series is based on the South Korean format created by Mun Hwa Broadcasting Corp.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFormer “Rehab Addict” host Nicole Curtis claimed on Instagram that “someone personal” tried to extort her for money before leaking a video of her using the N-word while filming her HGTV renovation show. The clip led to Curtis’ show being pulled from the network.\n\n\t“I was not contracted to any network or show. (think free agent in sports),” Curtis wrote on Tuesday. “Any crew hired, paid by me. The footage is mine. My crew didn’t steal my footage. I don’t have ‘sets’. I own all my properties. In other words, no one is my ‘boss’, I’m the boss. I create product & sell the rights of it & my likeness for limited contracted use.”\n\t\n\n\tShe added, “Someone personal (not crew) had access, demanded $, I didn’t pay-here we are.”\n\n\n\tOn Feb. 11, HGTV canceled “Rehab Addict” in response to Curtis’ on camera use of the slur. The network said in a statement at the time, “HGTV was recently made aware of an offensive racial comment made during the filming of ‘Rehab Addict.’ Not only is language like this hurtful and disappointing to our viewers, partners, and employees – it does not align with the values of HGTV. Accordingly, we have removed the series from all HGTV platforms. We remain dedicated to fostering a culture of respect and inclusion across our content and our workplace.”\n\n\tThe first two episodes of “Rehab Addict” Season 9 premiered in July 2025, but the season was cut short after Curtis made an “executive decision” to hold the remaining episodes and recut them for a later release. The rest of the season was supposed to return Feb. 12 before the cancellation.\n\t\n\n\tOn Feb. 13, Curtis took to Instagram and apologized for using the slur. She also claimed that the footage was “stolen then manipulated, edited and sold to a tabloid to coincide with [her] return to television.”\n\n\t“I am sorry. I am filled with remorse and regret, just as much as I was one second after that word was said 4 years ago in 2022,” she wrote. “I show this, I say this and I realize you are getting a limited view as what has been circulating is a clip of MY footage that was stolen then manipulated, edited and sold to a tabloid to coincide with my return to television only to create this chaos of hate, anger, disappointment.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe correspondents and producers who work at CBS News’ “60 Minutes” will soon leave the newsmagazine’s longtime New York offices as part of a consolidation of real estate  occupied by some of Paramount Skydance‘s best-known properties.\n\n\t“60 Minutes,” CBS Sports and “Inside Edition” are among the CBS productions that have long taken up space at 555 West 57th Street. All three will relocate to other offices in New York by early 2027, a CBS spokesperson confirmed Wednesday. The “60 Minutes” staff will move to the CBS Broadcast Center, across the street, a large structure that once served as a dairy depot and now houses the bulk of CBS News, some CBS Sports production facilities, and shows hosted by Drew Barrymore and John Oliver, as well as CNN’s “Have I Got News for You.”\n\t\n\n\tCBS Sports and “Inside Edition” are expected to move to 1515 Broadway, a large office building that has served as New York headquarters for the company once known as Viacom and many of its cable networks, including Nickelodeon and MTV.\n\n\n\tThe office shuffle is the latest in a gradual downsizing of real estate for the company over the years. CBS, once headquartered in the distinctive Black Rock building in midtown Manhattan, opted to get out of that building once it merged with Viacom in 2019. Employees were notified of the current moves as much as two weeks ago.\n\n\tStaffers at “60 Minutes” might feel the real-estate pinch the most. The show has for years enjoyed autonomy from the rest of CBS News, and the separate offices, with individual quarters for each correspondent and top producers, only heightened the feeling that the program operated independently from the rest of the company’s journalism operations.\n\t\n\n\tCBS News and “60 Minutes” will start working in closer proximity as the show has been undermined by two different waves of corporate management. \n\n\tParamount, under its previous owners, the Redstone family, opted to pay a $16 million settlement to President Trump after he alleged a “60 Minutes” interview with former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris affected the course of the 2025 election. Legal experts believed the case was a flimsy one, but noted Paramount was under pressure to find a buyer and feared the suit would be an overhang. More recently, CBS News Editor in Chief Bari Weiss brought new scrutiny to bear on the program after ordering a report on the dire circumstances of migrants deported by the United States held, even though the show had already promoted the segment to viewers. The report, by correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, aired weeks later, left relatively unchanged except for additional remarks before and after it aired on the program.\n",

Haley was an SI Swimsuit model and former Miss Minnesota USA and Matt played 7 seasons in the NFL.\n      \n\n          In his lawsuit, Matt claimed Haley's \"invasive commentary\" ruined his attempt at keeping out of the public eye after retiring from football ... but she says he is very much a public figure and his argument doesn't hold water.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Haley also claims there’s no case law where a woman’s truthful account of her own sexual pain has been found to be an invasion of someone else’s privacy.\n      \n    \n          A judge has yet to rule on Haley's motion to dismiss Matt's lawsuit.\n      \n    \n          Haley's lawyer, Matthew Bialick, tells TMZ ... \"A woman’s right to provide a truthful account of her own relationships and her own past sexual trauma lies at the very core of First Amendment protections. Mr. Kalil’s brief mentioned the First Amendment a grand total of three times and offered no constitutional analysis whatsoever. We are more confident than ever that this case will be dismissed and that Ms. Kalil will be awarded her attorneys’ fees.\"\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Matt Kalil\n              \n                          \n                Haley Kalil\n              \n                          \n                Sports\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Sex\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Models\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          The Oscar winner and Ant were sued by a woman named Tracey Bryn Belland ... Belland claims Renee and Ant were living in a home in Laguna Beach, California, that Ant was renting. Belland says she was injured during a visit to the home on August 14, 2024, when she tripped and fell on the patio.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          According to the suit, filed the first week of February, Belland says a “thin rug had been placed over a hole, which caused her to stumble over the uneven surface, resulting in an injury to her right knee.”\n      \n    \n          Belland said she was forced to undergo treatment for her injuries. She said she will continue to deal with pain from the fall.\n      \n\n          The suit demands unspecified damages and seeks compensation for medical and other expenses.\n      \n    \n          Renee and Ant denied all allegations they're responsible for any injuries, asserting Belland caused her own injuries due to her own negligence.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          The owner of the home -- who Tracey Belland added as a defendant -- filed a cross-complaint against Renee and Ant. He claimed they were responsible for exposing Belland to any risk of harm in the place and not warning her, and any damages that may be awarded to Belland should be covered by the actress and her man.\n      \n    \n          A source familiar with the situation tells TMZ ... Renee never lived at the property but did live nearby at her own separate property. We're told she wasn't on the lease and isn't liable.\n      \n    \n          The cases remain ongoing, according to online court records.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Renee Zellweger\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Relationships\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Homes\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "description": "\n\tSwedish-born Hollywood star Alexander Skarsgård who hasn’t played in a Scandinavian feature in more than a decade is toplining the gothic horror pic",
    "body": "\n\tSwedish-born Hollywood star Alexander Skarsgård who hasn’t played in a Scandinavian feature in more than a decade is toplining the gothic horror pic “The Wolf Will Tear Your Immaculate Hands,” the English-language debut of Swedish-Costa-Rican writer-director Nathalie Álvarez Mesén, to be delivered in May 2026.\n\n\tCurrently in production, “The Wolf…” is Mesén’s sophomore feature after the multi-awarded “Clara Sola” which debuted at the 2021 Cannes Directors’ Fortnight and bowed in the U.S. via Oscilloscope.Co-penned by Mesén with acclaimed Icelandic novelist, poet and screenwriter Sjón, credited for Skarsgård’s vehicle “The Northman” and the Cannes Un Certain Regard “Lamb,” “The Wolf…” deepens Mesén’s “signature blend of intimate character work and magic realism, expanding it into a darker, more haunting period world,” said an official statement.\n\t\n\n\tIn a challenging new role for Skarsgård, currently making a splash on screens in Harry Lighton’s “Pillion,” the Golden Globe winning actor plays a British widower in the 1880s Pacific Northwest, who hires a Native American governess, educated in a Christian mission school, to teach his two daughters. “While preparing the eldest for an arranged marriage, a force within her begins to awaken, threatening everything she has been taught,” runs the logline.\n\n\n\tIndigenous Canadian actress Darla Contois, winner of a Canadian Screen Award for the drama series “Little Bird,” has landed the role of the governess, while the two daughters are played by British actress Bronte Carmichael (“Star Wars: Andor,” “Christopher Robin”) and the young Australian Lily La Torre (“Run Rabbit Run”). Rounded out the cast are Native American actor Forrest Goodluck (“The Revenant,” “How to Blow Up a Pipeline”) and Swedish star actress Pernilla August (“Star Wars”, “The Best Intentions”).\n\t\n\n\t“I feel incredibly lucky to work with a cast who dive into their roles with such generosity, playfulness, and openness. Collaborating with such a talented group of people from all around the world has been a privilege,” said Mesén. “Darla embodies Isabel with visceral emotional depth, and Alexander portrays the father with a truth and volatility that ground the story. I can’t wait for the film to reach audiences!”\n\n\tSpeaking earlier to Variety about the long-gestated project and digging deeper into its core, the 37-year-old director said the story discusses “how to break free from patriarchal structures and if you can decolonize your own body, if not for yourself, for the sake of future generations.”\n\n\t“As someone who’s worked with myth and folk stories in novels, songs and screenplays, I was immediately fascinated by Nathalie’s command of bringing to the screen something as difficult as the shifting borders between the inner and outer reality of her film’s protagonist” offered Sjón, who added “some dark Northern lyricism to Nathalie’s warm Latin American poetry.”\n\n\tCompleting the stellar creative team are some of Europe’s biggest heads of department: French cinematographer Hélène Louvart (“La Chimera,” “Pina”), Belgian editor and regular Dardenne brothers collaborator Marie-Hélène Dozo (“Young Ahmed,” “Six Days in Spring”), Swedish production designer Lina Nordqvist (“Holy Spider,” “Borg Vs McEnroe”) and Icelandic costume designer Margrét Einarsdóttir (“Lamb,” “King & Conqueror”).\n\n\t“The Wolf…” marks a major milestone for producer Nima Yousefi, CEO of Sweden’s prestige boutique outfit Hobab, credited for the Venice Horizons winner “Paradise Burning” and co-producer of the 2025 Oscar nominated “The Apprentice”. The seasoned executive, who’s been shepherding Mesén for a decade, said her “distinctive voice” displayed in “Clara Sola,” billed by Variety reviewer Jessica Kiang as a ‘spellbinding debut,” is why he was able to assemble such a prestigious creative team and complex multi-territory financing.\n\n\tIndeed, on “The Wolf,” international partners on board include Resolve Media in the U.S., European co-producers Quiddity Films in the U.K., Need Productions in Belgium and Still Vivid in Iceland. The mix of soft and private-sector finance was raised via Film i Väst, SVT, VOO, OBE & Be tv, Proximus, Shelter Prod, Tint, Finite Films, Northern Ireland Screen, the British Film Institute’s UK Global Screen Fund, Eurimages, Creative Europe, the Swedish Film Institute, the Film and Audiovisual Center of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, Screen Brussels, Taxshelter.be & ING, the Tax Shelter of the Belgian Federal government, the Icelandic Film Centre, the Icelandic Tax Credit, and Nordisk Film & TV Fond.\n\t\n\n\tThe non-disclosed-substantial budget allowed him to give Mesén the means to her filmic ambition. Location scouting before development spanned 15 countries before Belfast in Northern Ireland was picked for the bulk of principal photography. “Nature in Belfast is actually quite similar to Pacific Northwest with tempered rainforest,” Yousefi told Variety. \n\n\tOne of the main challenges, he said, was building the British widower’s house – both the exteriors and interiors on location. “That has given the film a true authenticity where you go in and out of the house seamlessly,” added the producer who praised the collaborative work of Mesén with the HOD from an early stage.\n\n\t“What was key for us, was to protect Nathalie’s vision and give her full creative freedom. This is what we can achieve within the European funding model,” said the producer, as the team prepares in Sweden for the last two-day-shoot in the Göteborg area and post-production work including VFX.\n\n\tThe Swedish release will be handled by leading arthouse banner TriArt, while international distribution will soon be unveiled, said Yousefi .\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” stayed on top of China’s weekend box office with RMB818.5 million ($115.3 million), driving its cumulative to RMB3.05 billion ($429 million), according to Artisan Gateway.\n\n\tDaylight Entertainment’s “Gezhi Town,” released Dec. 6, opened in second place with $23.8 million. Directed by Kong Sheng and written by Lan Xiaolong, the film tells the story of displaced civilians who, after the fall of Nanjing during wartime, resettle in a remote mountain town near Yichang only to find peace shattered when Japanese forces arrive. The lead cast includes Xiao Zhan, Zhou Yi Ran and Peng Yu Chang among others. \n\t\n\n\tAniplex’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle” placed third with $3.3 million, bringing its China gross to $93.4 million nearly a month into release. Directed by Sotozaki Haruo and produced by ufotable, the film adapts the climactic final arc of Gotouge Koyoharu’s blockbuster manga. Returning voice cast members include Hanae Natsuki, Kitō Akari, Shimono Hiro, and Matsuoka Yoshitsugu. The film follows the Demon Slayer Corps’ all-out assault on Kibutsuji Muzan’s stronghold in a bid to end the war between humans and demons.\n\n\n\t“Under Current,” a Hong Kong crime-thriller from Emperor Motion Pictures, opened in fourth with $1 million. Directed by Alan Mak and starring Aaron Kwok, Simon Yam and Francis Ng, the film centres on a barrister and a police officer who team up to investigate the suspicious death of a charity organisation’s finance chief — exposing corruption and money-laundering at the heart of the group. \n\t\n\n\tParamount’s “The Running Man” rounded out the top five with $600,000. \n\n\tWeekend box office totalled $147.5 million, bringing China’s 2025 year-to-date gross to $6.97 billion, up 22% from 2024.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHow would Matt Remick react to the industry-jolting news that Netflix is buying Warner Bros. and HBO Max?\n\n\tSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, executive producers of the Emmy-winning Apple TV comedy “The Studio,” told Variety that they believe their fictional studio executive, played by Rogen in the series, would react with his gut instinct of dread fear.\n\n\t“He’d be scared of it,” Rogen told Variety. “He would be terrified of it. I think he assumes that if you do well, they’re not going to sell off your company, your studio, to a tech company. But I guess he’d be proven wrong in this instance.”\n\t\n\n\tRogen and Goldberg were at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday evening for the 18th annual National Arts and Entertainment Awards handed out by the Los Angeles Press Club. Rogen and his wife, Lauren Miller Rogen, are receiving the club’s Visionary Award for their charitable work.\n\n\n\tWhen pressed by Variety as to their personal reactions to the $82.7 billion deal that will marry the world’s dominant streamer with Hollywood’s single-largest studio and the HBO Max platform, Rogen said with sincerity: “Absolutely not.” \n\n\tBut Goldberg was game. “I don’t know. Who knows if it even happens,” he told Variety. “I think AMC should buy it,” he said, referring to the world’s largest exhibition chain and the fear in the film business that Netflix will significantly shrink the exhibition windows for Warner Bros. film releases. \n\n\t“That’s my personal opinion. AMC should buy it all. I don’t know how, but they should. No one will see that coming,” Goldberg said. “That would be antithetical to Netflix.”\n\t\n\n\tGoldberg later presented the club’s Visonary Award to the Rogens. He noted his long friendship and partnership with Seth Rogen runs so deep that the two have compared notes and shared their most intimate secrets. They’ve even sized up each other’s penises, Goldberg noted. “Twin penises,” Goldberg assured. Rogen confirmed the same when he and Miller Rogen took the stage.\n\n\t“We appreciate your very generous and flexible definition of visionary,” Rogen told the crowd. In all seriousness, the pair discussed the origins of Hilarity for Charity after they were overwhelmed when Miller Rogen’s mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease at the age of 55. \n\n\tThe couple thanked the journalists in the audience for their efforts to amplify the work of Hilarity for Charity and awareness of Alzheimer’s disease in general. “You’ve helped us reach millions who now understand that brain health is as fundamental as heart health,” Rogen said.\n\n\tLater in the evening, honoree Paul Anka, one-upped Rogen and Goldberg with some vintage penis talk. Anka recalled how he started out as a kid at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas during the heyday of the Rat Pack. He recalled being brought into a Sin City steam room where he encountered Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. — all sitting on a marble slab, buck naked. \n\n\tAnka recalled struggling with where to “make eye contact.” And then he added, “Frank Sinatra at the time weighed 120 pounds — and 20 pounds of it was his dick.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDisney’s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” continued its commanding run at the Korean box office, earning $8.3 million from 1.2 million admissions over Dec. 5–7. According to KOBIS, the tracking service operated by the Korean Film Council, the film has now reached $25.7 million after 12 days in release, maintaining a 68.8% market share across 2,282 screens.\n\n\tTwo new releases battled for second and third place, finishing within a razor-thin margin.\n\t\n\n\tSouth Korean comedy-drama “The People Upstairs” opened in second place – with 129,650 admissions – with $860,207, accumulating $1.2 million across its first five days. Directed by Ha Jung-woo and starring Gong Hyo-jin, Kim Dong-wook, Lee Ha-nee and Ha Jung-woo himself, the film follows a downstairs couple driven to exhaustion by constant noise from their upstairs neighbours. A tense dinner meant to resolve the issue quickly unravels into an evening of sharp confessions and shifting dynamics.\n\n\n\tClose behind – with 121,699 admissions – Japanese action-fantasy “Jujutsu Kaisen: Shibuya Incident / Culling Game – The Movie” opened in third with $868,564, totaling $1.4 million to date. Directed by Shōta Goshozono, the film condenses the anime’s Shibuya Incident arc as Yuji Itadori and his allies face a coordinated curse attack on Halloween. The aftermath sets up the looming Culling Game and Yuta Okkotsu’s mission that puts Yuji’s fate in jeopardy.\n\n\tUniversal’s horror sequel “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” debuted in fourth with $443,394, reaching $579,771 including previews.\n\n\tRounding out the top five, South Korean crime-comedy “The Informant” added $340,783 for a $643,031 cumulative gross. Directed by Kim Seok, the film stars Heo Sung-tae and Jo Bok-rae as a compromised smuggling informant and a hapless detective who blunders into the operation. Forced into an uneasy alliance after both take substantial losses, the pair attempt to claw their way back while dismantling the criminal ring.\n\t\n\n\tSixth place went to “Wicked: For Good,” which earned $339,250, pushing its running total to $6 million.\n\n\tLionsgate’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” ranked seventh with $190,676, lifting its cume to $8.5 million.\n\n\tLong-running anime hit “Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc” followed in eighth with $167,599, for a robust $24.26 million total.\n\n\tJapanese Oscar contender “Kokuho” placed ninth with $85,558, reaching $924,882 overall.\n\n\tAt No. 10, South Korean drama “Concrete Market” earned $74,874 from 11,149 admissions, lifting its total to $113,711 after five days on release. Directed by Hong Ki-Won, the film stars Lee Jae-In, Hong Kyung, Jeong Man-Sik, Yoo Su-Bin and Kim Guk-Hee. Set in the aftermath of a massive earthquake, the film centers on the only apartment complex left standing — repurposed as a makeshift barter market. Residents and survivors trade goods to survive, but as supplies dwindle, a struggle for control spirals into desperate conflict. \n\n\tThe top 10 titles collectively generated $12.1 million for the weekend, compared with $13.4 million the previous frame.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndia’s Kerala Film Market has unveiled its selections for the Project Market 2025, along with the inaugural Curator’s Pick from its newly launched Video Library segment, set to take place Dec. 13-16 in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n\tFormerly known as the International Film Market of Kerala, the initiative received submissions from around the world, ultimately selecting 12 projects representing 11 countries for its Project Market. The lineup features films in 13 languages, including Hindi, English, Spanish, Bengali, Marathi, Maithili, Nepali, Assamese, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Bangla and Bhojpuri.\n\t\n\n\tSelected producers and filmmakers will pitch their projects to international and Indian producers, distributors and financiers during the four-day event.\n\n\n\tAmong the Project Market selections is “Apodartho” (A Foolish Man), a Bangladesh-Taiwan co-production in Bangla directed by Abu Shahed Emon, whose debut feature “Jalal’s Story” became the first Bangladeshi film to premiere in Busan’s New Currents Competition in 2014.

Makhija won an Indian National Film Award for “Bhonsle” in 2021, while “Joram” earned two Filmfare Awards in 2024.\n\t\n\n\tOther notable selections include “Error#404,” directed by two-time Indian National Film Award winner Farha Khatun and produced by Bauddhayan Mukherji and Monalisa Mukherji; and “Kathakali Diva: A Ritual of Transformation,” directed by Indian National Film Award-winning editor Bina Paul, who has previously served as director of the International Film Festival of Kerala. \n\n\tSanju Surendran’s “Kothiyan” (Fishers of Men) marks another Malayalam-language project in the lineup. Surendran’s recent feature “If on a Winter’s Night” premiered at the Busan International Film Festival, winning the HyLife Vision Award.\n\n\tThe Australia-India co-production “Mongoose,” directed by Indian National Award winner Nikhil Mahajan and produced by Suhrud Godbole, joins the roster alongside “Sukoon” (Solace), directed by Film and Television Institute of India graduate Gul Dharmani, who recently directed episodes of Netflix’s “Class.”\n\n\tAdditional selections include “Calf-Umir Ladikaiyan” in Bhojpuri and Hindi, directed by Balaka Ghosh; Kenny Deori Basumatary’s “Local Bhoot” (Local Ghost) in Assamese and Hindi; Armenia-India co-production “The Day of the Feast” in Telugu, directed by Di Sica Ray; and “Vilai: The Price Paid” in Malayalam and Tamil, directed by Menon Krishnadev.\n\n\tThe market has also unveiled 13 films selected for the inaugural Video Library Curator’s Pick. These projects, spanning various stages of production and post-production, are seeking distributors, gap financing and festival visibility.\n\n\tThe Curator’s Pick selection represents India, Bangladesh and the U.S. The complete lineup includes Anuradha Bansal’s documentary “A Good Wife” in English, Hindi and Marwari; Abhay P’s Malayalam short film “Aadhunika Mithyabhasam” (Burning Roots, Blooming Fire); Gridaran MKP’s Tamil documentary “Dalit Subbaiah – Voice of the Rebels,” produced by Manoj Jahson; and Sandeep Paul’s “Ekanto Byaktigoto Bishoy” (About an Intimate Matter), an India-U.S. co-production in Bengali produced by Apoorva Bakshi.\n\n\tAlso selected are Rahul Pawar’s “Golu Gappi Aur Charkhi Chor” (Golu Gappi And Charkhi Thief) in Bhojpuri and Hindi, produced by Anurag Kumar Mourya; Thanvir Chowdhury’s Bengali feature “Kaffarah” from Bangladesh, produced by Barkat Hossain Polash; Aayushman Pandey’s Hindi short film “Kamathipura,” produced by Wasim Khan and Priya Sreedharan; and Chahat Mansingka’s “Like A Feather In The Wind” in Chinese and Hakka, produced by Sanjay Mansingka.\n\t\n\n\tRounding out the selection are Vignesh Kumulai’s Tamil feature “Neela Aththi Kili” (Blue Fig Parrot), produced by Jeyachandran Karthikadevi; Sanchay Bose’s Hindi feature “Phas Gayi Jal Machri” (The Golden Catch), produced by Wafa Refai; Shreekara Bhat’s Kannada feature “Purushaavathara” (Shades of Men), produced by Prakash Raj; Sreekanth EG’s Malayalam feature “The Judgement,” produced by Adith US; and Siddharth Kalkal’s “The Writer’s Inn” in English and Hindi.\n\n\t“The Kerala Film Market has become a dynamic ecosystem that brings together creators, investors, and industry professionals,” said Priyadarsanan P.S., managing director of Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC). “This year’s curated selection reflects our commitment to nurturing diverse cinematic voices and positioning Kerala Film Market as a significant hub for global film business and creative collaboration.”\n\n\tK. Madhu, chairman of KSFDC, added: “In just three years, the Kerala Film Market has grown into a credible, forward-looking industry forum. The selected projects and films demonstrate the tremendous creative potential and we are proud to host a platform that enables meaningful engagements and opportunities for filmmakers.”\n\n\tThe Kerala Film Market is designed as an integral component of the International Film Festival of Kerala, one of India’s most artistically respected festivals. While IFFK celebrates cinema as a cultural force, Kerala Film Market adds a business dimension focused on co-production infrastructure, financing and market access.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPresident Donald Trump on Sunday confirmed he recently met with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos at the White House to discuss the Warner Bros. Discovery deal — and said the market share of a combined Netflix with WB and HBO Max “could be a problem.”\n\n\tTrump, speaking with reporters on the red carpet of the Kennedy Center Honors event in Washington, D.C., said Netflix’s deal to acquire Warner Bros. studios and streaming business will require a review, and said, “I’ll be involved in that decision.” \n\t\n\n\tTrump is upending decades of tradition with his decision to host Sunday’s 48th Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, where the honorees are Sylvester Stallone, KISS members Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss, singer-actor Michael Crawford, country superstar George Strait and disco diva Gloria Gaynor. He told the crowd gathered for the most prestigious event on Washington’s arts calendar that he didn’t know why he decided to host.\n\n\n\t“I’m acting like Johnny Carson,” Trump quipped as he spoke from behind a podium with the Presidential seal — a first for the ceremony. Highlights of the event will be telecast Dec. 23 as a primetime special on CBS.\n\n\tIn typical fashion, befitting his roots as a real estate developer, Trump also declared, “We’re bringing this building back to life.” Trump was quick to execute a top-to-bottom makeover of Kennedy Center staff this past spring, after his odds-defying return to the White House.\n\n\tTrump was upbeat as he opened the event and steered clear of slinging barbs at political foes. However, he did nod to the shift in the wind for Washington, D.C.’s social elite: “Many of you are miserable, horrible people,” he asserted.\n\t\n\n\tTrump was on stage to introduce the first award presentation to Stallone, a Hollywood legend and MAGA-friendly celebrity. Trump then took his seat in the Kennedy Center auditorium box typically reserved for the Commander in Chief. The award introduction for Crawford was done via video in a pre-recorded segment with Trump speaking from the Oval Office.\n\n\tThe Kennedy Center kudo has long been one of the most prestigious laurel for entertainment figures to receive. The traditional KenCen ceremony includes lengthy clip packages and retrospectives that put the honorees influence and culture impact into context.\n\n\tThis time around, there was no such video tribute to Stallone. Longtime Kennedy Center Honors producers Done + Dusted bowed out of producing this years’ ceremony after Trump unceremoniously dismissed KenCen’s board chairman, Carlyle Group chairman David Rubenstein, and KenCen president Deborah Rutter.\n\n\tStallone was saluted through testimonials delivered by Kurt Russell, Neal McDonough, Garrett Hedlund and his brother, Frank Stallone.\n\n\tIn his remarks on the red carpet, Trump said that the government review of Netflix’s proposed $83 billion deal for Warner Bros., which was announced Friday, must “go through a process, and we’ll see what happens.”\n\n\tAccording to Trump, Sarandos visited the Oval Office last week. The Netflix exec is “a fantastic man,” the president said. “I have a lot of respect for him, but it’s a lot of market share.”\n\n\tTrump also said of Sarandos, “He’s a great person… He’s got a lot of interesting things happening aside from what you’re talking about, but it is a big market share. There’s no question about it. It could be a problem.”\n\n\tThe blockbuster pact would add HBO Max to Netflix’s already massive customer base of more than 300 million. As of the end of Q3, Warner Bros. Discovery reported 128.0 million streaming subscribers, which includes HBO Max as well as Discovery+ and its sports-streaming services.\n\n\tThe Netflix deal for Warner Bros. is both a horizontal merger between rival streaming services and a vertical merger, adding a massive distribution pipeline for Warner Bros. content. It could also shrink the marketplace for content producers. \n\n\tThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are expected to review the Netflix-WB deal. The FCC is not expected to play a role in reviewing the transaction because of the nature of assets involved; WBD does not own broadcast TV stations or cable systems.\n\t\n\n\tSarandos, speaking on a call with Wall Street analysts Friday, expressed optimism that the deal will clear regulatory approval. Netflix and WBD projected the deal will close in 12-18 months. \n\n\t“[We are] really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,” Sarandos told analysts. “This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it’s pro-creator, it’s pro-growth.”\n\n\tExecs routinely point out on Netflix earnings calls that even in its most mature markets, including the U.S., Netflix represents less than 10% of total TV viewing. Sarandos, in his meeting with Trump, conveyed to the president that even combined with Warner Bros. and HBO Max, Netflix would grow to be about as big as Google’s YouTube in the U.S. — and would still have less TV market share than other media conglomerates, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\n\tThe Safer Bet: Why David Zaslav and the WBD Board Favored Netflix in a Turbulent Time for Legacy Hollywood\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming assets would build a $6.6 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) across Asia Pacific and reshape global entertainment economics, according to new analysis from Media Partners Asia.\n\n\tMPA says Netflix’s standalone ARR in APAC is close to $5.5 billion, while WBD adds roughly $1.1 billion through a mix of profitable licensing and theatrical businesses. The takeover, valued at an enterprise figure of $82.7 billion, marks the streamer’s biggest strategic pivot yet — from organic builder to acquisitive consolidator — and would deliver control of deep franchise IP including DC, Harry Potter and HBO.\n\t\n\n\tBut the firm flags a looming “Licensing Cliff.” WBD currently underpins the subscription value proposition of major local platforms in India, Japan, Korea and other markets through exclusive licensing and long-running strategic partnerships. Those deals remain locked through 2027, yet MPA notes Netflix may reclaim the content post-close to reinforce its own services — a shift that would force regional streamers to rethink their programming pipelines.\n\n\n\tMPA expects local players to accelerate partnerships with NBCUniversal, Sony and Disney, while also pushing deeper bundling with Disney+ as WBD content and HBO Max transition under Netflix’s control. WBD’s business in APAC has operated as a “regional arms dealer,” relying on licensing and theatrical distribution as primary revenue engines, with direct-to-consumer still nascent outside Australia, per MPA.\n\n\tGlobally, the combined Netflix–WBD entity would generate roughly $70 billion in ARR, surpassing YouTube’s estimated $61 billion and Disney’s entertainment divisions at $58 billion, according to MPA. The deal would also merge Netflix’s 302 million global subscribers with HBO Max’s 128 million.\n\t\n\n\tStructurally, the acquisition hinges on what MPA calls the “Clean Break Mechanism,” a debt-for-debt exchange ensuring WBD retires or restructures select legacy obligations before spinning off its linear networks. The premium HBO linear pay-TV channel, however, remains with the studio assets — a high-margin cash generator Netflix would retain during the transition.\n\n\tThe report also verifies management’s projected $2–3 billion in cost synergies: an intellectual property matters agreement details Netflix’s plan to physically clone WBD’s shared software and Bolt production platform before consolidating overlapping infrastructure.\n\n\tRegulatory timing remains lengthy. While executives cite a 12–18 month horizon, the merger agreement sets an end date of March 4, 2027, extendable to Sept. 4, 2027. Netflix has committed to a $5.8 billion reverse termination fee — more than double WBD’s $2.8 billion — signalling high conviction in clearing antitrust review. MPA notes the companies’ defense will hinge on market definition: according to Nielsen’s The Gauge (October 2025), the combined entity holds under 10% of total U.S. big-screen watch time and under 30% of premium VOD usage even when excluding YouTube and linear TV.\n\n\tRisks include culture integration between Netflix’s algorithmic “Freedom and Responsibility” ethos and Warner Bros.’ relationship-driven legacy, potential distraction from a multi-year regulatory process, and capital trade-offs that could slow Netflix’s push into live sports — leaving space for Amazon and Disney to advance.\n\n\tThe merger also triggers downstream consolidation limits. A tax matters agreement imposes a two-year restriction preventing the spun-off linear networks from engaging in major M&A transactions exceeding 45% of stock, effectively sidelining those assets from further consolidation until 2028 and pressuring Paramount to pursue other strategic paths, including a potential move toward Comcast’s NBCUniversal.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from Season 1, Episode 7 of “It: Welcome to Derry,” now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\tIf there was ever any speculation that the horrors explored in HBO’s “It: Welcome to Derry” were purely supernatural, Episode 7 put those questions to rest. After a flashback cold open that shows the origins of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård), the episode picks up where the previous one left off, with a gun-wielding, mask-wearing mob of the eponymous town’s white citizens infiltrating the Black Spot: a hangout for the Black soldiers on Derry’s military base, and a hideout for the town’s falsely accused fugitive, Hank Grogan (Stephen Rider).\n\t\n\n\tThe white mob breaks into the Black Spot looking for Grogan, and a standoff ensues when the club’s patrons draw their own guns. The tension is briefly broken when the mob lowers their weapons and retreats, but the relief is temporary, as they lock the doors from the outside, throw Molotov cocktails into the building and riddle its walls with bullets.\n\n\n\tThe shoot-off continues as the Black Spot burns down with dozens of people inside — many of them central characters in the series, including most of the main ensemble of children. It is a raw and violent sequence, expanded upon from a brief chapter in Stephen King’s original “It” novel.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs it is in the novel, the scene showcases the grounded horrors taking place in Derry, but they are made even more eerie by the ghostly apparitions that soon crowd the massacre. Because Pennywise feeds on the town’s fear, he obviously shows up amid the terrifying event. Meanwhile, because the telekinetic Dick Hallorann (Chris Chalk) is present in the fire, he witnesses hordes of spirits appear as ill-fated souls enter the afterlife all around him.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s a fusion of real and metaphorical terrors that come together in a harrowingly powerful scene that elevates “Welcome to Derry” to new heights. Variety caught up with the series’ executive producer and Episode 7 director Andy Muschietti over email to talk about his artistic and thematic approach to the show’s most impactful scene yet.\n\t\n\t\tThe massacre at the Black Spot is a small, but memorable part of Stephen King’s “It” novel. Did you always anticipate adapting and expanding upon it as a pivotal part of “Welcome to Derry”?\t\n\n\tIn the big ocean that is the book, the Black Spot seems small, but it’s actually a very substantial event in the interludes. Since we’re basing the show on the interludes, we really wanted to show the events of the Black Spot and use it as a guideline. Apart from a dramatic low point, it is a guideline that leads our characters towards a catastrophic conclusion, or, if not a conclusion, a big pivotal point in the story.\n\t\n\t\tHow did you decide on the suspenseful pacing of the scene, having the stand-off followed by brief relief before the horrors begin?\t\n\n\tI wanted to do justice to the book in terms of the horror and the atrocities that are experienced. I wanted to not only create tension and suspense on the build up, but also when the whole thing goes off. We wanted to create the impression that we are locked inside with the rest of the people. That’s why the perspective doesn’t leave the room. There is a bit of a oner that basically follows several characters as the panic spreads with the fire. It’s a really tough scene to watch and was a very tough scene to shoot, but I really wanted to stay true to the intensity of that part of the book.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow much of the set design was practical and how much was digital? Of course, people weren’t actually getting burned, but did you use any real fire? Did you actually destroy the Black Spot set?\t\n\n\tThe burning of the Black Spot happened mainly on two big sets. One of them is the set of the Black Spot where we shot several scenes before. The second one is a more open place used for the part where chaos prevails and everything is on fire. I wanted to create confusion. I wanted to put the audience in the driver’s seat of that catastrophe and give the impression that you are lost and you don’t know where the door is. \n\t\n\n\tThat second part was shot in a place that didn’t have walls. For all the running, all the confusion, all the mayhem that you see, I wanted to create a place where you couldn’t recognize anything. It’s curious, because set No. 1 and set No. 2 are sort of fused in one of the shots. You can actually see it if you pay attention; you can see how we go from the set to a place that is engulfed in flames. There was practical fire, but we could not put actors in harm’s way, so a lot of it is not practical. Following the safety regulations, we used practical fire for stuff in the foreground and in the distance. The rest is made in post-production. Regarding the general performance, we had our actors perform as if they are struggling in these conditions, but also we had a bunch of background performers that were stunt-trained special performers.\n\t\n\t\tHow do you approach directing a kinetic scene like this, where there are lots of people reacting chaotically? Do you allow people to improvise, or are you choreographing every individual?\t\n\n\tIt was a challenging sequence to film, because you’re trying to convey chaos and panic and a lack of control. But of course, you had to choreograph every single second of it, and that’s what we did. The choreography took us probably two days of designing the whole sequence. The oner was a very challenging shot to achieve, because it basically starts with the first Molotov cocktail that sets the fire. Then people panic. They start running in all directions and the camera has to follow certain characters and then transition towards the action of other characters and then pan out to the ceiling, where it’s on fire before we fall back and someone takes us to another corner. It was an interesting challenge to execute. Everybody had to be on point. We had the camera department, the cast, special effects and stunt teams all working to make this incredibly complex scene. It’s very choreographed, but it had to look real and chaotic. I think the chaos was achieved. And I’m very proud of all of what we did there. Everything that needed to be choreographed was choreographed. Even in the background, people knew what they had to do. \n\n\tOf course, there are moments of improvisation. Because it’s a scene with heightened emotion, people do things that were not planned. There were things that didn’t happen as expected, but then everything fell back in line. It’s a great thing about making movies: accidents happen. I don’t mean accidents like something bad happens, but something unexpected. There was a lot of that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow long did the sequence take to film?\t\n\n\tIt took us like four or five days to shoot. It wasn’t easy.\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you think audiences will take away from this scene within the broader series?\t\n\n\tWe shot this in a very visceral way. It’s a very first person experience. We wanted to get the audience to feel what being trapped in this place would be like. Dramatically, that was the intent. Thematically, we wanted to convey the idea that the worst things that happen in this world are often caused by us humans and that we are capable of inflicting pain and hate and horror in each other, just as much or more than the monster is.\n\n\tThis interview has been lightly edited for Variety’s style\n",

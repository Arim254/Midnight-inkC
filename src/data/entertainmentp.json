The episodes, shot across multiple circuits, will capture “the pressure, sacrifice, and ambition that fueled these talented stars, part of the next generation poised to help carry NASCAR into the future.”\n\t\n\n\t“’Rising’ explores the ups and downs of trying to make it at the highest levels of our sport,” says John Dahl, NASCAR svp of content. “We’re providing an inside look at the vulnerability and hunger of these young drivers to prove themselves. It’s a series for anyone who can relate to that daily struggle of striving to reach your dreams, and premiering the series on our NASCAR YouTube Channel allows us to meet fans exactly where they are, offering free, global access and bingeable storytelling on a platform that’s already home to one of the most engaged communities in the world.”\n\n\tIn December, FOX Sports will air “Rising” on FS1 with a five-week programming special leading up to the 2026 Daytona 500 on Feb. 15.\n\n\t“We wanted to do more than just portray these drivers as young racing stars,” says Aaron Cohen, chief creative officer, Words + Pictures. “Yes, they devote their lives to a sport, but they’re also still young men in their early 20s finding their way as human beings. ‘Rising’ gives an authentic, and sometimes raw and unfiltered look at how that all collides in their stories.”\n\t\n\n\t“Rising” is executive produced by Tim Clark, John Dahl and Tally Hair from NASCAR Studios, and Connor Schell, Libby Geist and Aaron Cohen from Words + Pictures.

    "body": "\n\tWhat offer from Paramount?\n\n\tThe new TV-focused spin-off of Warner Bros. Discovery, to be called Discovery Global, said it planned to make its first upfront presentation on Wednesday, May 13, 2026, suggesting that Warner Bros. Discovery remains committed to a split of the company even though it has engaged in a strategic review that could end up with its assets being sold to various bidders. Paramount Skydance has made no secret of its interest in buying Warner Bros. Discovery outright.\n\t\n\n\tDiscovery Global, comprised of the company’s traditional TV assets, is expected to continue to represent the U.S. ad inventory tied to Warner Bros. assets, including the HBO Max streaming service.\n\n\n\t“At Discovery Global, we will seek to inspire and empower audiences through bold storytelling and engaging stories,” said Gunnar Wiedenfels, the Warner Bros. Discovery CFO who will be CEO of the new Discovery Global, in a statement. “We are committed to deepening connections between people and the world around them — while delivering innovative, data-driven solutions that help brands engage meaningfully with our passionate global audience. By uniting creativity with intelligence, we aim to build lasting partnerships and deliver measurable results.”\n\n\tThe presentation will put a spotlight on popular TV brands including Adult Swim, Bleacher Report, CNN, Discovery, Food Network, HBO, HGTV, Investigation Discovery, Magnolia, OWN, TBS, TLC, and TNT Sports. Still, assets including HBO Max and discovery+. Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group and DC Studios will also be featured.\n\t\n\n\t“While the structure of our company is transforming, our shared commitment to creating meaningful connections between audiences and brands remains stronger than ever,” said Ryan Gould, president of U.S. ad sales, go to market, Warner Bros. Discovery,  in a statement. “We’re looking forward to showcasing how the world-class portfolios of both Discovery Global and Warner Bros. can connect advertisers with high-impact consumer engagement and drive unmatched value.”\n\n\t“The 2026 Upfront will mark a bold new chapter for Discovery Global and Warner Bros. —where strategic vision meets brand leadership across Sports, News, Entertainment, and Streaming,” said Bobby Voltaggio, president of U.S. ad sales, platform monetization, Warner Bros. Discovery, in a statement. “Through cutting-edge innovation in ad tech, data, and product development, we’re not just shaping the future—we’re inviting our partners to build it with us.”\n\n\tThe company faced headwinds in its 2025 upfront sales session, owing to the loss of NBA rights, which moved this season to NBCUniversal and Amazon. With that now past, there may be some hope of a more normalized negotation that is focused on the assets the company has under its umbrella.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMartial arts icon Iko Uwais (“The Raid,” “Mile 22,” “Expend4bles”) will headline hospital siege thriller “MRI,” with Liam O’Donnell (“Alphas”) set to direct. Daniel Baur’s K5 Intl. has acquired the international sales rights to the picture, which it will launch at the American Film Market next month.\n\n\tO’Donnell will reunite with Uwais for their third feature together after helming 2017’s “Beyond Skyline” and the anticipated “Skyline: Warpath.” The producers are Strong Island and Uwais Pictures.\n\t\n\n\t“Iko’s sheer charisma, soulful depth and insane work ethic makes him every director’s dream,” O’Donnell said. “After such a great experience with Strong Island on ‘Alphas,’ I felt ‘MRI’ would be the perfect project for us all to take things to the next level.”\n\n\n\tThe plot centers on a broken-down hitman (Uwais) with a shattered family and a busted knee, who undergoes a routine MRI when the entire hospital is taken over by ruthless gangsters. Now, he’s the only man who can rescue their target, the daughter of a powerful crime boss, and somehow save the day, one agonizing step at a time. The script was written by Russell Hainline (Netflix’s “Hot Frosty”).\n\n\tStrong Island’s Christopher Tuffin (“Freelance,” “Canary Black,” “Alphas”) will produce alongside Ryan Santoso for Uwais Pictures. Baur for K5 Intl., Amanda Delaplaine and Chris Ochs will executive produce.\n\n\t“With the dominance of Asian-themed content in the marketplace, we feel ‘MRI’ is an ardent throwback to the classic martial arts films of the 1970s made for audiences born in the 2000s,” added Tuffin, whose recent credits include a string of box office and streaming hits including “Peppermint,” “Canary Black,” “Freelance” and “Sound of Freedom,” as well as such upcoming releases as the high seas actioner “Alphas” and the period action/thriller “The Butler,” starring Jean Reno and Tom Hollander.\n\t\n\n\tUpcoming productions include “Last Meals,” starring Mads Mikkelson and Boyd Holbrook for director Ramin Bahrani (“99 Homes”).\n\n\tPrincipal photography is anticipated to start in Jakarta early next year.\n\n\tBest known for his martial arts prowess in the action movies “The Raid,” “The Raid 2” and “The Night Comes for Us,” Uwais has recently expanded his reach, from creating action choreography outfit Uwais Team, to building his own production company Uwais Pictures with Santoso. Their first picture “Ikatan Darah” premiered the opening night of Fantastic Fest to strong reviews with Uwais’ directorial debut “Timur” set to premiere Dec. 18 in Indonesia.\n\n\tUwais is repped by Gersh and Vault Entertainment. O’Donnell is repped by Strong Island, Sentient Entertainment, Innovative Artists Entertainment and Miloknay Weiner. Hainline is repped Game Plan Media.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDemi Moore said during an interview at The New Yorker Festival (via People) that she felt Tom Cruise was “quite embarrassed” by her pregnancy when they were rehearsing together for 1992’s “A Few Good Men,” Rob Reiner’s film adaptation of Aaron Sorkin’s play about two U.S. Marines charged with the murder of another soldier. Moore was eight months pregnant with her second child, Scout Willis, when she started rehearsing lines with Cruise and Reiner ahead of production.\n\t\n\n\t“I think Tom was quite embarrassed,” Moore said. “I actually felt okay about it. I was moving around, though, right? But I could tell he felt that it was a bit awkward.”\n\n\n\tAs reported by People: “Moore explained that she thinks Cruise may have potentially been uncomfortable given that not many of their Hollywood peers were having children at the time, due to what she said was the pressure to choose between pursuing a career and being a mother.”\n\n\t“It’s one of the many things, for me, that I just felt didn’t make sense,” Moore said about the stigma around moms in Hollywood. “And so I challenged that to say, you know, ‘Why not? Why can’t you have both?’ But with that, I think, came a lot of pressure I put on myself to, in a sense, prove that it was possible.”\n\n\tMoore said she became “a bit of an overachiever” in this regard, adding: “I look back at that time now, and I go, ‘What the fuck was I thinking?’ And what was I even trying to prove? But it wasn’t as supported as it is today. You know, to be breastfeeding and then blocking and rehearsing a scene.”\n\n\tAfter giving birth to her daughter, Moore then applied additional pressure on herself to get in shape for the movie. She explained: “I was going to be in a military uniform, and probably overly anticipated and started working out and trying to get in shape even before she was born. I did a two-and-a-half-hour hike the day my water broke. I did a 24-mile bike ride, and then was dancing at a reggae club — hence why she came two-and-a-half weeks early.”\n\t\n\n\tMoore noted that mothers are much more “supported” on Hollywood film sets nowadays — a needed course correction for the industry. Variety has reached out to Cruise’s representative for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohn Dickerson will leave CBS News at the end of the year, a move that will inevitably raise questions about the future direction of “CBS Evening News,” which he has been co-anchoring with Maurice DuBois as part of a format revamp since earlier this year.\n\n\t“I am extremely grateful for all that CBS gave me — the work, the audience’s attention and the honor of being part of the network’s history — and I am grateful for my dear colleagues who’ve made me a better journalist and a better human,” the anchor said in a social-media post on Monday. “I will miss you.”\n\t\n\n\tDickerson, who also anchors a streaming-only half hour following “Evening News,” has been moved all over the CBS News portfolio over the years. Recognized for his writing skills and commentary as well as his acumen around politics, he was shifted out of a successful run as moderator of “Face the Nation” to a stint on “CBS This Morning.” He has appeared as a political analyst and a contributor to “60 Minutes” as well. His mother, Nancy Dickerson, was CBS News’ first female correspondent.\n\n\n\tCBS News President Tom Cibrowski said in a statement that Dickerson “had decided” to step away from his role at the Paramount Skydance news operation. At the same time, it’s no secret that “Evening News” has suffered in the ratings since executives at CBS News tried to focus less heavily on breaking headlines. Dickerson and DuBois made for an unorthodox pairing, with the latter offering smooth delivery and the former serving as more of a kinetic on-screen presence. CBS News has in recent weeks reached out to talent agencies to seek talks with new prospects, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\t\n\n\tDickerson unveils plans to depart as CBS News is shifting under the aegis of its new editor in chief, Bari Weiss. The digital entrepreneur, who launched the conservative leaning The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance recently purchased for $150 million, arrived at the news division with a mandate to shake its operations. Claudia Milne, the head of standards for CBS News, opted to leave the company at the end of her most recent contract, and there are signs that others may want to do the same, uncertain about working for a news division with a top editorial executive who has already staked out positions on many big issues of the day.\n\n\tCBS News is also facing layoffs under Paramount Skydance, which has vowed to cut costs at the media conglomerate since the Ellison family bought the company from Shari Redstone, its previoius controlling shareholder.\n\n\tBefore joining CBS News in 2011 as a political director, Dickerson logged stints at Slate and Time. He is the author of three books, a contributor to The Atlantic and a podcaster for Slate, where “Political Gabfest” has been around for two decades.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn March 2024, David Michôd was considering his options for the role of trailblazing boxer Christy Martin. It was a limited pool — the part, which involves both fighting in the ring and brutal physical abuse at the hands of Christy’s Svengali husband and trainer, James Martin, would be punishing. Sydney Sweeney wasn’t high on the list. She wasn’t on the list at all.\n\n\t“I think people have preconceived ideas about Sydney because she is such a contemporary 21st-century creature of the internet,” the Australian director notes. Her stardom precedes her, and Michôd had to see Sweeney in a role in which she shed it. A friend suggested he check out Tina Satter’s 2023 Berlin Film Festival sensation “Reality,” about convicted intelligence leaker Reality Winner. Around the same time, an associate casually mentioned that Sweeney had trained and competed as an MMA fighter from the age of 12 until she booked the pilot for “Euphoria” at 19.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSami Drasin for Variety Magazine\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I already thought there was something interesting about Sydney, but ‘Reality’ made me know in my bones that she had some real acting chops. That movie is written from FBI transcripts,” Michôd says. “That isn’t easy to act, and I thought her performance was astonishing.”\n\n\tAs he conducted a deep dive on Sweeney’s grappling and kickboxing exploits, Michôd began to feel goose bumps. He had worked with great-fit A-listers like Brad Pitt (“War Machine”) and Robert Pattinson (“The Rover”). “But I’ve had this experience only once before, with Timmy Chalamet on ‘The King,’” he says. “I’ve found someone who would be perfect.” Michôd sent Sweeney the script he’d co-written with Mirrah Foulkes. She read it while flying to Barcelona to shoot an Armani campaign. Within 24 hours, they jumped on a Zoom.\n\t\n\n\tEighteen months later — and one week before her 28th birthday — Sweeney rolls into a private dining room at Toronto’s Ritz-Carlton a minute early. She might have arrived even earlier, had she not just run into Martin in the hotel lobby. After our interview, she and the woman she plays will take the stage following their Toronto Film Festival screening; Sweeney will sob amid a rapturous (and rare for TIFF) standing ovation. As we speak, though, Sweeney has no idea that the outsize response she’s about to receive will catapult her into the heart of Oscar speculation.\n\n\tWearing beige linen shorts, an oversize tan sweater and cowboy boots, Sweeney looks fresh and alert despite the 9 a.m. meet time. A pair of round brilliant-cut diamond earrings offers the only clue that she’s one of the highest-paid stars of Hollywood’s under-30 set, with four producing credits already under her belt. As she sinks into a chair, Sweeney considers the parallels between Martin’s fight in the ring and her own battle for control in the industry.\n\n\t“For Christy, the ring was her escape. It’s almost like you’re a caged animal inside this ring, but it’s a place where she feels the most free,” Sweeney notes.\n\n\tDoes she feel like a caged animal in Hollywood?\n\n\t“I am definitely a caged animal in a sense,” she says. “Acting is my ring. It’s where I feel freedom. The set is where everything else goes quiet.”\n\n\tOff set, the noise is deafening for Sweeney, who became a household name over the past two years thanks to a red-hot acting career as well as an American Eagle jeans ad that launched a thousand hot takes. The ad’s declaration that Sweeney has “good jeans” (read: “genes”) got slammed by, for instance, a Columbia University professor as “imbued with eugenic messaging.” President Trump praised the ad. Amid the cacophony, the company’s stock price soared.\n\n\tOver the next seven weeks, she has two movies hitting theaters. On Nov. 7, prestige producer and first-time distributor Black Bear will launch “Christy,” which saw Sweeney transform beyond recognition, packing on some 30 pounds of muscle and sustaining at least one concussion. That’s followed on Dec. 19 by Lionsgate’s “The Housemaid,” a psychological thriller in the vein of “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle” that is “testing through the roof,” according to the film’s director, Paul Feig, and appears poised for Christmas counterprogramming breakout status. Sweeney produced both films through her Fifty-Fifty banner.\n\t\n\n\tAll the while, the conversation surrounding Sweeney often overshadows her credentials, like two Emmy nominations — for her respective teen-ennui turns on HBO’s “Euphoria” and “The White Lotus” — as well as a $220 million box office hit with Sony’s “Anyone but You,” which cost a mere $25 million.\n\n\tHere at the festival, one sees just what kind of cage constrains Sweeney. At a Black Bear party, gotcha reporters and leering industry types jockey to meet her. She’s exceedingly polite as one after another whips out their phone to take a selfie with her. All the while, she deflects every question about the jeans ad with a warm smile and a firm “I’m so excited for everybody to see Christy Martin.”\n\n\t“It took me years to learn what Sydney knows, which is ‘Just don’t react,’” says Feig, who calls the ad controversy “manufactured” by “a certain segment of the media [who] blew it up” to serve an anti-woke agenda. (To wit: Megyn Kelly deemed the ad a success, declaring on her show, “We miss attractive people. We are sick of trying to pretend that these objectively unattractive people are the new beauty standard.”)\n\n\tFeig continues: “She’s probably one of the most confident people I’ve ever met in my life — in a good way. She’s very savvy. ‘Savvy’ sounds calculated. With her, she’s just very smart about publicity, about social media, about what people are looking for on social media. As we’re getting ready to promote, we’re always like, ‘Oh, let’s do this. This is the hot trend on TikTok right now.’ And she’s like, ‘No, that was last month. Here’s the hot trend.’”\n\n\n\tGood genes notwithstanding, Sweeney never skated through an audition back when she was a rural Idaho teen trying to break into Hollywood.\n\n\t“I have very strong eyebrow muscles,” she says as she demonstrates an impressive brow furrow. “And I had someone tell me to fix my face or else I’m not going to make it. I should get Botox. I was 16! Or I’m in a casting and I’m reading my scene and the casting director is eating a bag of chips, and I’m like, ‘You’re not paying attention at all.’”\n\n\tBut the smart ones were noticing.\n\n\tMike White remembers auditioning actresses for Season 1 of “White Lotus.” He wrote the part of Olivia Mossbacher as an intellectually pretentious bully. Some hopefuls delivered the lines as zingers, with a comedic precision. Sweeney took a more diffident approach, diverging from how he pictured the part.\n\n\t“There was just something very unaffected by her,” White says. “She was very likable. And I thought that that would be helpful because the part is so unlikable on the page. Then in editing, you realize she just pops on-screen. She’s obviously lovely in person and photogenic. But my eyes kept going to her, no matter who’s in the scene with her. That’s natural screen magnetism that is hard to quantify. She just has that. I don’t know what makes somebody a star, but there is something about her that just is.”\n\t\n\n\tBy her own admission, Sweeney prefers flawed archetypes, which actresses rarely tackle — with notable exceptions like Cate Blanchett in “Tár.”\n\n\t“I tend to gravitate towards characters that are stereotypically unlikable, and I like to challenge an audience to have empathy for that person,” she says. “Olivia was that — a very hard-hitting, Gen Z, in-your-face kind of girl.”\n\n\tStill, likable has its advantages, as evidenced by the success of “Anyone but You,” which sent the internet aflutter over her chemistry with co-star Glen Powell. She and Powell seemed to lean into the mystery of their coupledom — a throwback strategy perfected during the Golden Age of cinema.\n\n\t“Honestly, the press did it themselves. There was no leaning in, per se,” she insists. “Truly the tabloids and journalists just created it and kept going. Even if we were just standing next to each other, it was ‘They’re standing two inches apart!’ Glen and I genuinely care for each other and have a love and respect for one another. I love being with him. And I think people just truly saw a really beautiful pairing.”\n\n\tAs far as Sweeney is concerned, that pairing could be revived at any given moment via a sequel.\n\n\t“We are always open to it,” she says. “I think that when the right concept and script come to Glen and I, we will jump in hand in hand.”\n\n\tPerhaps it’s a testament to Sweeney’s acting prowess that audiences can’t separate her from the characters she plays, fueling the incessant conversation about her.\n\n\t“I play a lot of very divisive characters, and I think that a lot of people think they know me, but they don’t. So when people think, ‘Ah, she’s a sex symbol,’ or ‘She’s leaning into that,’ I’m like, ‘No, I just feel good and I’m doing it for myself and I feel strong.’ And I hope that I can inspire other women to be confident and just flaunt what they got and feel good because you shouldn’t have to apologize or hide or cover up in any room,” says Sweeney, hinting at the jeans uproar.\n\n\t“Christy” co-star Ben Foster, who plays Christy’s homicidal husband, warns against allowing the circus to define the performer.\n\t\n\n\t“There always seems to be a bit of hoopla around her. Positive or negative, she seems to provoke a reaction. But that is not the person I first met,” Foster says. “I only know Syd as a sensitive human, utterly professional, kind to the crew, prepared, looked everybody in the eye, remembered their names. To me that’s an old-school value system that I don’t see in a lot of people in her position.”\n\n\n\tThe festival offers a brief respite from production on the third and final season of “Euphoria,” though Sweeney’s co-stars are also making their presence known: The previous night, Sweeney hit the premiere of “Mile End Kicks,” which stars friend and former castmate Barbie Ferreira, and the following night, she’ll attend the premiere of Maude Apatow’s directorial debut, “Poetic License.”\n\n\tThe heavy “Euphoria” representation on the TIFF red carpet testifies to just how fully the series has conquered culture. Season 3 promises to “blow a lot of people away,” Sweeney teases.\n\n\tThe bonds formed on the show run deep. One relationship was cut short prematurely when star Angus Cloud died of a drug overdose at 25. “It was definitely a very emotional experience to go back to a set and not have him be there with you. He was such a special person, and he was taken way too young,” says Sweeney. She was in Idaho when she learned of Cloud’s death. “I’m glad I was home because I was surrounded by my family. I think my first call was Maude, and then Jacob [Elordi], and we were all just crying on the phone together. It’s not something you want to bring people back together over, but I’m thankful to have my castmates to be able to process all of that together.”\n\n\tIn early November, she will wrap production, closing the book on the approval-starved Cassie Howard. White would love to have her reprise Olivia on Season 4 of “White Lotus.” “I don’t know if we could afford her now,” he says. “As of now, it doesn’t look like that’s gonna happen.” Sweeney, whose off-set pleasures include kitesurfing and cliff diving, says she wants to run “The Amazing Race” with White: “Honestly, Mike and I would be a killer team.”\n\n\tWhite, who competed in Seasons 14 and 18 of the show with his father, is thrilled by the prospect, noting Sweeney’s physicality but also her ability to play the social game. “I would definitely win with her. She’s the master at getting what she wants. And I mean that in an absolutely good way,” he says.\n\n\tThen again, she could hit similar far-flung locations by playing a Bond girl, something Amazon founder Jeff Bezos reportedly wants very much to happen. She did attend his wedding to Lauren Sánchez in June, and the trio are tangentially in business together on Sweeney’s new lingerie line. When I ask if there’s any truth to the Bond rumors, Sweeney unravels for the first and only time.\n\t\n\n\t“I can’t. [Seven-second pause.] I don’t know. [Ten-second pause.] To be honest, I don’t know all the Bond rumors, but I’ve always been a huge fan of the franchise, and I’m excited and curious to see what they do with it,” she says.\n\n\tBut would she be interested? As she mulls the possibility, she regains her composure and answers assuredly.\n\n\t“Depends on the script,” she says. “I think I’d have more fun as James Bond.”\n\n\tThe internet will obsess about the possibility. Or move on to another Sweeney subplot. Lately, the haters scrutinize pictures of the actress for signs of cosmetic work.\n\n\t“I’ve never gotten anything done. I’m absolutely terrified of needles. No tattoos. Nothing. I’m going to age gracefully,” she says. “It’s really funny. I’ll see things online like ‘comparison pictures.’ I’m like, ‘I’m 12 in that photo. Of course I’m going to look different. I have makeup on now and I’m 15 years older.’”\n\n\tBut Sweeney drives attention. And though the opportunists will try to attract eyeballs by mentioning her name, she’s firmly in control.\n\n\t“Being an actress, it’s a lot harder to stand in the room and demand your worth and for people to look at you and value you,” she says. “I have to remind myself like, ‘Hey, Syd, you’re actually powerful. Stand up a little taller.’”\n\n\t\n\t\tCharity Spotlight: The National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence\t\n\n\tIn the film “Christy,” the domestic abuse red flags emerge early before reaching a third-act crescendo. It was not just a literary device for screenwriters David Michôd and Mirrah Foulkes. Their script follows the real-life tragic arc of boxing legend Christy Martin, who suffered horrific acts of violence at the hands of her husband and trainer, the late James Martin.\n\n\tFor Sydney Sweeney, who gives a mesmerizing performance as the knockout queen of the ’90s, Martin’s story is common but also familiar.\n\n\t“It’s a very personal issue that’s important to me, and I hope that through Christy and her story, it can raise more awareness,” Sweeney says without elaborating on how the legacy of domestic violence has touched her.\n\n\t“It’s personal,” she repeats, her blue eyes flashing pain.\n\t\n\n\tSweeney has selected the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence as her charity. Founded in 1998, the Texas-based nonprofit “provides and customizes training and consultation, influences policy, promotes collaboration, and enhances diversity with the goal of ending” the scourge.\n\n\tWhile film critics typically lead with the physical transformation that Sweeney pulled off, equally impressive is her ability to delve into the psyche of a woman who was fearless in the ring but rightfully terrified of the man closest to her.\n\n\tBen Foster, who plays James, says the abuse scenes tested their limits as performers, but Michôd “created a safe space for us to explore” the power dynamics of an abusive home.\n\n\t“As we got deeper into the material and closer to shooting, all I could see is this sensitive human,” he says of his co-star. “And I could feel that she felt a great responsibility to represent Christy’s resilience the best she could and bring her own lantern to it. And Syd’s lantern is bright.”\n\n\t\n\t\tStyling: Molly Dickson/With Falcon; Hair: Glen Oropeza/The Partners; Makeup: Melissa Hernandez/A-Frame/Armani Beauty; Manicure: Zola Ganzorigt/The Wall Group/OPI; Dress: Victoria Beckham; Shoes: Andrea Wazen; Jewelry: Anita Ko\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter more than decade since her last studio album, Hilary Duff is getting ready to put out new music.\n\n\t“We’re getting something really soon,” she teased when I caught up with her at Vogue World: Hollywood 2025 on Sunday night in Los Angeles. “I have been hard at work in the studio with my husband [Matthew Koma] and a few other amazingly talented people. “[My fans] are going to hear something so soon, like in the blink of an eye.”\n\t\n\n\tDuff, who released her fifth studio album “Breathe In. Breathe Out.” in June 2015, said she had always planned on getting back into the studio. “I always knew I was going to return to music. I needed to feel safe and I needed to have the right people in my corner and be absolutely 100% ready. Honestly, I needed to have 10 years of life under my belt. I needed a lot to say. This album feels like the inner workings of my brain and I really am so excited to connect with people again on that level, that very forward-facing level.”\n\n\n\tIn September, it was announced that Duff had signed with Atlantic Records. At the same time, she revealed that she was filming a docuseries about her return to music and her personal life. The docuseries will be directed and executive-produced by Sam Wrench, who has done the same for “A Nonsense Christmas With Sabrina Carpenter” and “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” through Next of Kin Content. \n\n\tDuff, who was spotted chatting with Atlantic Music Group Elliot Grainge and his wife Sofia Richie at Vogue World, was tightlipped about performance plans in support of the new album, but said: “All of the things are happening. I can’t give up too much information or everyone’s gonna kill me, but I am dancing and… everything’s in motion. It’s exciting.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen I mentioned her gay fans can’t wait to hear what she’s put together, Duff smiled: “You know it’s all for them. It’s just to impress them.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHilary Duff at the fifth annual Academy Museum Gala at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on Oct. 18 in Los Angeles. (Photo by Gilbert Flores/Variety)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariety via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA little over a week ago, Duff stunned at the Academy Museum Gala in a purple Alberta Ferretti gown. “That morning, I was at my daughter’s 7th birthday party on a farm, like in a dusty field,” she recalled, laughing. “Everybody who worked on me were miracle workers. I basically took a bird bath in a hotel room and put that gorgeous gown on.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a bid to leverage Spain’s generous tax and logistical incentives, Hollywood producers Mark Vahradian (“Transformers“), Andrew Lazar (“American Sniper“), Craig Flores (“Crawl”) and Ben Everard (“Yes Day”) led a cohort of top-tier producers to attend “Elite” producers Zeta Studios’ inaugural creative summit and meet with key players in the local industry.\n\n\tConceived and organized by manager Jon Kanak, Zeta Studios’ rep in Hollywood, the summit aimed to serve as a strategic “bridge” to Hollywood, highlighting both Zeta’s creative expertise and Spain’s coveted incentives.\n\t\n\n\tAside from holding meetings with various institutions in Madrid, the delegation visited some of Spain’s major production hubs, including the Canary Islands and the Ciudad de la Luz studios in Alicante.\n\n\n\tStressing Zeta Studio’s position as “one of the most dynamic companies in Europe,” behind such hits as “Elite” and “Olympo” on Netflix and “When No One Sees Us” (“Cuando nadie nos ve”) on HBO Max, Kanak pointed out that the “summit aims to channel that momentum into partnerships with leading U.S. producers and to demonstrate how Spain’s crews, facilities and incentives make it one of the most attractive production hubs in the world.”\n\n\tSaid Vahradian: “Zeta is proof that Spain has a powerful production hub creating content that competes on an international level. With strong leadership, the company leverages Spain’s diverse locations and tax incentives to develop a constantly expanding slate. This approach establishes Zeta as a production company with true global reach.”\n\t\n\n\tMarking a bold new phase in its international expansion plans, Zeta Studios revealed that multiple projects and partnerships have already emerged from this event and will be announced shortly.\n\n\tAntonio Asensio, CEO of Zeta Studios, underscored the company’s international commitment: “With this first Creative Summit, we reaffirm our dedication to positioning Zeta Studios as a natural bridge between the U.S.  and Europe. Spain offers exceptional creative talent, unique locations and competitive incentives that place us in a privileged position. As a company, we’ve proven we can compete on a global scale – and now, by partnering with Hollywood, we’re establishing ourselves as one of the leading players in international production.”\n\n\tZeta has already been establishing a foothold in Latin America, striking deals with Wattpad Webtoon Studios to develop Latin American Spanish-language web novellas, starting with the adaptation of Ariana Godoy’s “Follow My Voice,” and partnering with Brazil’s Conspiração to create “Bajo presión,” a Spanish-language remake of the popular Globo drama “Under Pressure.”\n\n\tThe studio has been producing a slew of originals for platforms including HBO Max (“García!”), Netflix (“Olympo”), Prime Video (“Días mejores”), Movistar Plus+ (“La vida breve”) and Atresplayer (“Red Flags”).\n\n\tIn 2023, Zeta Studios appointed veteran TV exec Marcelo Tamburri in Mexico City as its head of international content.\n\n\tUpcoming releases or projects currently in production include “Leo & Lou,” the debut feature by director Carlos Solano; “La maleta,” an action comedy directed by Carlos Therón and co-produced with Telecinco Cinema and “The Secrets of the Courtesan” (“Los Secretos de la Cortesana”), a new period series set in 18th century Spain, for Netflix.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhat’s in a name? On November 15, MSNBC will quickly find out.\n\n\tThe cable-news outlet, slated to be spun out of NBCUniversal in the next few months and become part of a new publicly traded company called Versant, will change its name to MS NOW in mid-November. The maneuver comes because NBCUniversal felt a news operation that was about to become a rival should not carry the “NBC” markings. MSNBC has for years shared newsgathering resources with NBC News, but will no longer do so.\n\t\n\n\tThe name change comes “after months of meticulous planning and thoughtful collaboration across every corner of our organization” said Rebecca Kutler, president of the network, in a memo to staff. “We are facing it head-on, and our success in the months and years ahead will depend on our innovation and entrepreneurial approach.”\n\n\n\tTo make sure viewers understand, the network is launching a marketing campaign that tells its audience the overall news brand and channel will not change. “Same Mission. New Name,” will serve as a slogan of sorts for the switch, more pragmatic, perhaps, than others used by MSNBC over the years, including “This Is Who We Are,” “Lean Forward” or”The Place for Politics.” In one promo released for preview, Rachel Maddow tells viewers the network may be changing its title, but not what it does for its audience.\n\n\tTo be sure, MS NOW may seem a little different than MSNBC. The network has built up its own newsgathering staff, recruiting reporters and producers from places such as The Washington Post, NBC News, Politico and Bloomberg, among others. Viewers in recent weeks may have noticed a heavier focus on snaring newsmakers for interviews early on in a story’s news cycle. MSNBC has also been working to cultivate Republican guests, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and U.S. Senator John Thune, the Majority Leader. \n\t\n\n\tIn addition to staffing its own Washington Bureau, MSNBC struck a pact with Sky News that will make the latter organization’s coverage of international affairs available to MSNBC’s audiences in the United States.\n\n\tChanging names of long-running media institutions can be risky. Warner Bros. Discovery recently found that dubbing a streaming service long associated with HBO with the name “Max” left it at a disadvantage when it came to brand recognition, particularly because many of Max’s most popular offerings are HBO programs. Paramount over the years changed the name and mission of the cable outlet now known as Paramount Network — it was known in different iterations as The Nashville Network, The National Network and Spike TV — and each overhaul undermined its brand in the overall media marketplace.\n\n\tExecutives hope viewers will adopt the new MS NOW nomenclature and remember the letters stand for “My Source for News, Opinion and the World.”\n",

Peterson was booked in a Fort Bend County, Texas jail on Sunday on one count of unlawful carrying of a weapon and one count of DWI.\n      \n\n          A jail official said as of early Monday morning, he remained behind bars.\n      \n    \n          The specific allegations against Peterson have not yet been made available ... we've reached out to authorities for comment on it all, but have yet to hear back.\n      \n    \n          Peterson was arrested on suspicion of DWI once previously this year ... when he was popped in Minnesota back in April shortly after the Vikings' draft day party.\n      \n    \n          The former running back -- a seven-time Pro Bowler and future Hall of Famer -- had been slated to fight in a celebrity boxing match in the upcoming months ... though it's now unclear if that will go down following Sunday's arrest.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Adrian Peterson\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Mug Shot\n              \n                          \n                Athlete Arrest\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Football\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

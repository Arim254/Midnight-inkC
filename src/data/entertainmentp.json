    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tA recent photo book celebrating the legacy of designer Valentino Garavani (more often referred to as as the mononymous Mr. Valentino) now serves as a fitting tribute following the iconic designer’s death last week.\n\n\tPublished by Taschen and spanning hundreds of archival images, sketches, editorial shoots and personal portraits, “Una Grande Storia Italiana” (translated roughly as “A Grand Italian Epic”) reads like Valentino’s own visual memoir — a sprawling narrative of his ascendancy from Rome’s cobblestone boutiques to the world’s most exclusive red carpets.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOriginally released as a limited collector’s edition — each copy bound in bespoke Valentino red silk and numbered out of just 2,000 — the tome now functions as a monumental documentation of a designer who shaped the language of femininity for nearly half a century. The book collects not just dresses but his sensibilities as a designer: the folds of chiffon that draped Elizabeth Taylor at a premiere, the velvet and lace that defined Princess Madeleine of Sweden’s wedding gown and, of course, the countless iterations of “Valentino red.”\n\n\tAfter founding his company in 1960, Valentino quickly caught the eye of several high-profile women — including Elizabeth Taylor, who donned a Valentino gown at the premiere of 1960’s “Spartacus,” and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who ordered six of his couture dresses to wear in mourning following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. Garavani then designed Kennedy’s wedding look when she married Aristotle Onassis in 1968, with the two-piece’s high neck, lace top and bold above-the-knee cut solidifying both her and Garavani as style icons. Photos, sketches and writings about each of these looks, among many others, are explored in the Taschen release.\n\n\n\tThe book is fittingly written by the celebrated documentary filmmaker Matt Tyrnauer, who chronicled the designer’s opulent lifestyle in the 2008 movie “Valentino: The Last Emperor.” The project premiered at the Venice Film Festival that year.\n\n\tPurchase “Una Grande Storia Italiana” on Amazon here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSince last fall, an errant comment Alexander Skarsgård made has fueled wild speculation about his sexuality — and, speaking to Variety in a new cover story, the actor is clearing it up.\n\n\tAt last year’s Zurich Film Festival, Skarsgård, known for “Big Little Lies” and “Succession,” among other projects, was speaking about his new film “Pillion.” That movie (opening Feb. 6) stars Skarsgård as the top in a gay BDSM relationship; Skarsgård spoke about what, if anything, from his own life he brought to the story. \n\t\n\n\t“I found that in this case, it’s not really relevant what my background is. I mean, I do have a kid, but what I’ve done in the past, who I’ve been with, men, women…,” he said at the time. “To me, what was important was that this felt like an opportunity to tell a story about a subculture I hadn’t seen portrayed this way – with so much authenticity.”\n\n\n\tIn this week’s Variety cover story, the actor explains that he was simply trying to de-center his own personal experience when describing the movie and was not, as social media widely speculated, coming out as bisexual. \n\n\t“Oh,” he says when asked about the comments. “That it resonated with my past? It was definitely not an intended statement. I don’t know what I was talking about. Maybe it has to do with — there’s a lot of focus sometimes on me as an actor. Maybe it was trying to shift the focus more to the story and these characters. And the importance of telling the story like this.”\n\n\tElsewhere in Skarsgård’s Variety interview, he discussed his gender-bending and bondage-themed fashion ensembles on red carpets promoting “Pillion.” \n\t\n\n\t“Um,” he says hesitantly, “I never buy clothes. If you saw my closet, my wardrobe is very limited. I’m not a big consumer of fashion. I don’t spend money on expensive brands. I really enjoy the creativity of it, but it’s not like I’m out shopping for these outfits. I guess it’s something I’ve leaned into a bit more of late.” Indeed — and his many fans are taking notice.\n\n\tRead Skarsgård’s full  Variety cover story here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen her manager first told Rachel McAdams she was suggesting her for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the actor didn’t think much of it. “I said, ‘Well, I think this is a futile exercise,’” McAdams recalls. “But it sounds nice, and I’ll just take it on the chin and hope I’m not too disappointed when it doesn’t come through.”\n\n\tSo imagine McAdams’ shock when “things went in a different direction.” Now, on Jan. 20, she’ll find herself unveiling her star on Hollywood Boulevard, fittingly mere blocks from the Pantages Theatre, which is currently hosting “The Notebook,” the musical adaptation of one of her most beloved films. \n\t\n\n\tMention this connection to McAdams and she literally gasps: “Ooh, that gave me goosebumps,” she says. Though she has yet to see the show ­— she was making her Broadway debut in “Mary Jane” when it opened in New York — she loves the music by Ingrid Michaelson and met several of the people involved when they came to her show.\n\n\n\tMcAdams is likely the only one surprised by the honor, considering the impressive and varied career she has built since hitting the big screen in 2002 with “The Hot Chick.” Always personable and relatable, McAdams is also a comedy assassin, as demonstrated in films like “Mean Girls” and “Game Night.” She can bring deep complexity to Everywoman roles, as in 2023’s “Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret.” \n\n\tAnd she can’t be predicted — after her Oscar-nominated turn in 2015’s “Spotlight,” she joined the Marvel Universe with “Doctor Strange” and went all-out for the musical epic “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.” Though pure silliness, that film also demonstrates the actor’s commitment – you believe her as an Icelandic singer in love with Will Ferrell. When she delivers the line: “The elves! They went too far!” you laugh, but you also completely buy that her character believes in magical creatures.\n\t\n\n\tMcAdams never intended to work in Hollywood. “I was not even considering that as part of my world,” she recalls. Her love for performing came early. Growing up in Ontario, Canada, she did children’s theater and studied the craft at York University. Though she dabbled in local films like “Perfect Pie,” her aspirations were mainly onstage. “I was very happy to explore the theater scene in Toronto, which is rich and robust,” she says. “When anybody would say anything about New York or L.A., I laughed it off, either out of insecurity or lack of imagination.”\n\n\tShe recalls often telling people she would only go to L.A. if invited. “Which sounds so arrogant,” she notes. “But it was probably subconsciously self-preservation. It just felt so far away and impossible.” But when a network wanted to fly her out to test for a “Nancy Drew” pilot, she says, “I had to say yes and show up.” She didn’t book that role, but while in town, she was sent on a few other auditions, one being for the Rob Schneider body swap comedy “The Hot Chick.” Once again, she had no expectations. “I was so relaxed because I didn’t think I had any chance at getting it,” she reveals.\n\n\tIn that film, McAdams is bawdily hilarious yet shockingly believable as a high school girl who finds her body being embodied by Schneider’s boorish thief. She credits Schneider with his patience and guidance on her first American movie, stating, “I was both petrified and exhilarated by it.” She has a vivid memory of one moment in particular, when her character begins to morph back into Schneider. “I was standing backstage in greasy overalls with a hot pink bikini, knowing I was going to go out there and strip as a man in front of all of my new peers in my first Hollywood movie,” she says. “I will never forget hearing the beat of the music starting and thinking it was a great acting challenge. I just took a deep breath and told myself: Life is short, just go for it.”\n\n\tSince then, McAdams has been guided to her roles by the story, the people involved and what’s new. “I try not to repeat myself,” she says. “I try to do something that feels slightly out of reach, something I’m not sure I’ll be good at because I think the most interesting work comes from that sweet spot.” That applies to her latest film, “Send Help,” opening Jan. 30, which reunites her with her “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” director Sam Raimi.\n\t\n\n\tIn the film, McAdams plays Linda, a timid employee who is stranded on a desert island with her sleazy boss (Dylan O’Brien) and begins to resort to a more primal personality. A fan of “Survivor,” her bookish wallflower is soon building shelter, hunting animals and generally living her best life. It’s one of her most physically demanding parts, but also shows her darker side. “It’s a real ride,” she says with a laugh. “The role was so rich and juicy and complex and I could see it going so many ways — I hadn’t done anything like it before.” Indeed, Linda requires all of McAdams’ range as it veers from horror to drama to what sometimes feels like a burgeoning rom-com. (Fans of “Red Eye” will remember how the start of the film is played like a meet-cute between McAdams and Cillian Murphy.)\n\n\tBut McAdams admits she still struggles with imposter syndrome. “I have great moments of self-doubt in every job,” she notes. “I remember Diane Keaton saying to me during ‘The Family Stone’ that she still felt like acting didn’t come easily to her. I was so surprised by that because she’s so effortless and she gives so much to it. But I still don’t feel like I have the art of acting figured out.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMusiCares has announced a lineup of artists set to perform the music of Mariah Carey at the org’s Person of the Year gala benefit this month, with a diverse cast that runs from fellow pop-R&B veterans John Legend and Jennifer Hudson to the possibly most surprising choice, Foo Fighters.\n\n\tOther luminaries announced Tuesday to be on the all-star bill for the Jan. 30 benefit include Teddy Swims, Adam Lambert, Laufey, Maggie Rogers, Charlie Puth, Kesha, Taylor Momsen and Billy Porter. \n\t\n\n\tJermaine Dupri will also add to the night’s music with a special DJ set. Additional artists will be announced in the run-up to the event. Daniel Moore II will serve as musical director. Lewis & Clark, aka broadcast veterans Joe Lewis and R.A. Clark, will produce.\n\n\n\t“I’m deeply honored to have these extraordinary artists come together for this evening,” Carey said in a statement. “Their generosity, their presence, and their commitment to this moment mean more to me than I can express. Being part of this celebration in benefit of MusiCares and the support they provide to those in the music community makes this night even more special. I’ve always believed that music heals, and it’s meant to be shared.”\n\n\tThe event takes place at the L.A. Convention Center two nights before the Grammy Awards, as almost always, and consists of a live auction and cocktail reception preceding a dinner, running up to an extravagant musical salute on two different stages within the grand ballroom. \n\n\tTables and tickets are available here.\n\n\t“Mariah Carey’s music has touched the hearts of millions and inspired countless artists,” said Theresa Wolters, executive director of MusiCares, in a statement. “It will be thrilling to hear these performers bring their own voices to her landmark songs, offering fresh interpretations that celebrate her artistry in new ways — a reminder of the power of music to connect us all. Person of the Year is more than a tribute: it’s a moment for our community to come together and give back to the humans behind the music. The support raised through this gala allows us to stand with music professionals in ways that truly matter, caring for their mental and physical health, addressing unexpected challenges, and helping them build the foundation for sustainable, fulfilling careers.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tMia Tomlinson, who emerged as the breakout star of last year’s supernatural hit “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” has signed with UTA. \n\n\tNew Line’s record-setting ninth installment of the hit global horror franchise marked the feature film debut for the fast-rising Brit, who has experience across film, TV and theater.

    "body": "\n\tThe Sundance Film Festival doesn’t kick off until Thursday, but Independent Film Company and Shudder wasted no time in striking first by acquiring Natalie Erika James’ supernatural body horror “Saccharine” from XYZ Films ahead of its world premiere. \n\n\tThe film tells the story of a lovelorn medical student who is terrorized by a sinister force after taking part in an obscure weight-loss craze: eating human ashes. It stars Midori Francis (“Grey’s Anatomy”), Danielle Macdonald (“Patti Cake$”) and Madeleine Madden (“The Wheel of Time”). “Saccharine” was written and directed by James. It’s her third feature following her psychological horror debut “Relic,” which was distributed by IFC Midnight, and “Apartment 7A,” a prequel to “Rosemary’s Baby” starring Julia Garner.\n\t\n\n\t“I’m absolutely thrilled to be working with IFC and Shudder again after our experience releasing ‘Relic’ together in 2020,” James said. “They’re an incredible team with a deep understanding of genre and a real commitment to filmmakers.”\n\n\n\tThe deal includes rights in North America and the U.K. “Saccharine” will open in theaters ahead of its Shudder debut at some point in 2026. It will screen at this year’s Sundance, which is the last edition of the festival to be held in Park City, Utah. In 2027, Sundance will relocate to Boulder, Colo.\n\n\t“Natalie announced herself as a singular force with her haunting debut ‘Relic,’ a film that we were privileged to bring to audiences in 2020 via IFC Midnight,” said Emily Gotto, senior vice president of acquisitions and productions at Shudder. “With ‘Saccharine,’ she returns with a chilling, utterly original vision that pierces our deepest obsessions with body image, reaffirming her work as a leading voice in genre cinema”.\n\t\n\n\t“Saccharine” is a Carver Films and Thrum Films Production. It was financed by Screen Australia in conjunction with XYZ Films, IPR.VC and Stan, in association with VicScreen. The film is produced by James, Anna McLeish and Sarah Shaw. The deal was negotiated by Gotto for Shudder with XYZ Films on behalf of the filmmakers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFlight of the Conchords will spread its wings once more, as Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie are set to reunite at Netflix Is a Joke Festival in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe performance, which will take place in early May, marks the New Zealand musical comedy duo’s first live show since 2018, when Flight of the Conchords filmed the “Live in London” HBO special.\n\n\tTickets will go on sale on Jan. 23 at 10 a.m. PT at netflixisajokefest.com.\n\n\n\tAs of now, it’s unclear whether the Netflix Is a Joke show signals a forthcoming reunion tour or if it will be a one-off performance. Venue details and the date are yet to be announced, but the festival is taking place May 4 to 10 in Los Angeles. The fest also includes performances from Conan O’Brien, Nikki Glaser, Jon Stewart, Kevin Hart, Bill Burr, Shane Gillis, Nate Bargatze, Katt Williams, Sarah Silverman, John Mulaney and more heavy hitters in comedy.\n\t\n\n\tFlight of the Conchords formed in 1998 in New Zealand and became known for their live comedy act that featured acoustic guitars and impressive genre pastiche. Clement and McKenzie became a mainstay at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and in 2005 they landed a BBC radio series. From 2007 to 2009, the duo starred as fictional versions of themselves on the HBO sitcom “Flight of the Conchords,” which earned an Emmy nomination for best comedy series. The show lasted only two seasons but cemented itself as a cult comedy favorite on HBO.\n\n\tFlight of the Conchords also released two studio albums and an EP, which won the Grammy Award for best comedy album. The duo embarked on a small reunion tour in 2012 and played at festivals in the years following. Their most recent show, in 2018, was recorded for an HBO special. Flight of the Conchords’ most recent show in Los Angeles was 10 years ago.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlexander Skarsgård doesn’t know why you’re so obsessed with what he wears. As we speak in November at the Chateau Marmont, he’s splayed his 6-foot-4 frame into a chair, and wears a billowing white shirt unbuttoned to mid-chest and ’70s-style aviators. But — especially when promoting the gay BDSM drama “Pillion,” out Feb. 6 — his fashion choices tend to make waves. \n\n\tAt the Governors Awards, Skarsgård rocked a vermilion manicure, and his “Pillion” press tour attire has featured a halter top, leather pants, thigh-high boots and a button-down shirt depicting sex toys. (Given the film’s subject matter, this may be what’s called “Method dressing.”) Suffice it to say that whenever he leaves the house, Skarsgård catalyzes plenty of conversation, and plenty of thirst too. So what goes into his sartorial choices?\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Um,” he says, and pauses. “I never buy clothes. If you saw my closet, my wardrobe is very limited. I’m not a big consumer of fashion. I don’t spend money on expensive brands. I really enjoy the creativity of it, but it’s not like I’m out shopping for these outfits.” (Of course not! He works with the stylist Harry Lambert.) “I guess it’s something I’ve leaned into a bit more of late,” Skarsgård says, bringing the subject to a close. \n\n\tAt 49 — so ageless that he recalls his breakout role as a vampire on HBO’s “True Blood” — Skarsgård has been leaning in, all right. His sly sensibility and his careerlong interest in subverting the leading-man looks come to the fore in “Pillion” and in two Sundance movies: A24’s “The Moment,” to be released Jan. 30, and the sales title “Wicker.” In the first, he plays a creative director whose alluring unknowability convinces Charli xcx (playing a fictionalized version of herself) to toss aside everything that had made her successful; in the second, he’s a creature conjured from grasses and reeds to provide Olivia Colman’s little-loved fishmonger character companionship and solace.\n\t\n\n\tThe role of a wicker man came with some occupational hazards, and Skarsgård cites his famous father, Stellan, as a benchmark. “It wasn’t like when Dad did ‘Pirates of the Caribbean,’ and they had to glue on each barnacle,” Skarsgård says. (Stellan played the decaying seafarer Bootstrap Bill Turner in that franchise.) “He spent seven or eight hours in the chair in the morning. On this, they got it down to just over an hour.” But the days were punishing. The wicker “was glued to my face, and then they glued the eyelids and the lips — my eyes dried up, and I couldn’t eat or drink, and I couldn’t sweat.”\n\n\tSkarsgård shot for two weeks, and was allowed a week off to let his skin recover from the glue. The process, though arduous, opened up a new style of acting. “You have to work in a very different way,” he says. To make himself known underneath the effects, “I had to exaggerate everything. Which feels weird when you’re trying to stay present in a scene with someone as incredible as Olivia, who’s so subtle in everything she does.” Skarsgård tends toward the tactical, the shift in feeling conveyed through a micro-expression. This time, he had to go big. “I couldn’t listen to my natural instinct. I had to be my own puppeteer.” \n\n\tAs Sundance and the impending release of “Pillion” will soon prove, Skarsgård is adept at transformation. It’s a slate of projects that may catapult him to a new level of a career that has stopped inches short of stardom — not that Skarsgård seems to have been seeking it. It’s strange to call a certified hunk who’s been on multiple HBO hits a “cult actor,” but Skarsgård’s admirers speak of him as something of a well-kept secret: He’s an actor who’s shown a taste for provocation in projects large and small. Now, he’s digging deeper into idiosyncrasy, and daring longtime fans to go along for the ride. \n\n\tThe three performances share almost nothing: In “Pillion,” he’s ruthlessly insensitive, concealing everything about himself from the man with whom he’s in a relationship (played by Harry Melling). In “The Moment,” he’s all volatility and excess, outdoing even the music industry’s top party girl when it comes to riotous energy. And in “Wicker,” he’s viewing humanity from the outside. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThat last trait can indicate what it feels like to speak to Skarsgård. He seems at times to be operating on a slightly different plane from the one an interviewer occupies, as when discussing recent speculation around his sexuality. Addressing his role in “Pillion” at the Zurich Film Festival in October, Skarsgård said, “I found that in this case, it’s not really relevant what my background is. I mean, I do have a kid, but what I’ve done in the past, who I’ve been with, men, women …” The same internet that obsesses over Skarsgård’s sartorial play lit up at the idea he was coming out as bisexual.\n\n\t“Oh,” Skarsgård says after being asked to elaborate, taken aback. “That it resonated with my past? It was definitely not an intended statement,” he says. “I don’t know what I was talking about. \n\n\t“Maybe it has to do with — there’s a lot of focus sometimes on me as an actor. Maybe it was trying to shift the focus more to the story and these characters. And the importance of telling the story like this.” After all, “Pillion” is a sexually frank exploration of human dynamics; Skarsgård doesn’t want himself, even as its star, to become the story.\n\n\n\tThankfully for him’ “Pillion” provides plenty of grist for conversation. In a climate that suddenly seems primed for same-sex romance post-“Heated Rivalry,” “Pillion” might well explode, becoming for gay men what “Babygirl” was to straight women. \n\n\tIn “Pillion,” the two main characters meet in a bar and, within moments, strike up a relationship in which each gives the other what they seem to want: Skarsgård’s Ray denies an emotional connection, telling Melling’s Colin to sleep on the floor and to cook for him, all of which Colin, an awkward and shy barbershop-quartet singer, enjoys as a sex game, up to a point. The production kicked off just as rapidly: Melling tells me that he met Skarsgård for the first time mid-shoot, and they immediately started rehearsing a scene they’d be filming the next day, in which the two lovers wrestle in singlets. The subject matter made intimacy easy: “From the first second I met him, when we started rehearsing the scene, he was clutching my prosthetic erection,” Melling says. \n\n\tSkarsgård came up with a backstory for Ray, an explanation for what drove him. And he kept it entirely to himself. “It wasn’t like I had a Word document,” he says. The story evolved; certain aspects of the character dynamic came into conflict with Skarsgård’s ideas, and he adjusted without telling anyone he was doing so. \n\t\n\n\tSkarsgård keeping Ray’s motivations in reserve was productive for Melling. “The whole relationship between Colin and Ray is Colin second-guessing Ray,” he says. “If I knew what Alex was thinking all the time, I don’t think I would have had access to this befuddled confusion Colin lives in.”  \n\n\tFor Harry Lighton, a first-time director, the dynamic in “Pillion” is applicable beyond the world of BDSM — the more Colin craves affection, the less Ray gives him. “If someone is a bit of a dick or a bit cold to you, you find yourself trying harder to get that person’s attention,” Lighton says. When I speak to the director, Team “Pillion” are in the midst of promotional obligations. “We’re off the back of three nights consecutively partying,” he says, “and we’re probably feeling a bit worse for wear.” \n\n\tIt’s hard to imagine another actor at Skarsgård’s level of fame taking on a film as risqué as “Pillion,” which Skarsgård has been promoting through a festival run that began last year at Cannes. It exists, now, in a world where fans swoon over Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams’ on-screen romance, but its explicitness may make “Heated Rivalry” look like “The Dating Game,” with degradation — literal boot-licking and all — at the center of the story.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSkarsgård was Lighton’s first choice. “We might as well take one big swing,” he recalls thinking, having been inspired by watching Skarsgård’s arc on “Succession.” There, he played a capricious and unreadable tech zillionaire whose appetite for conquest, and whose ability to play the Roy family for fools, allowed him to “win” the series’ game of thrones as the show wrapped up.\n\n\t“What he was doing as Lukas Matsson was so interesting — yes, playing with his obvious physical ridiculousness, but simultaneously domming the Roy children,” Lighton says. “That’s a bit of what I want from Ray: someone who has this caricaturish physical beauty, but psychologically is hard to read and feels like the cleverest person in the room.” \n\n\tIs “Pillion,” with its couple unable to speak openly or to do much beyond play out a sexual dynamic, a love story? “I don’t want to answer that,” Skarsgård says, more assertive than he’s been to this point. “I have thoughts on it. But I think it’s a very relatable relationship story, with different beats of a relationship, except in a very specific subculture that’s foreign to most people.” \n\t\n\n\n\t“Succession” was one of several turning points for Skarsgård, whose ca­­r­e­er began in earnest with a cameo in 2001’s “Zoolander” as one of the “orange mocha Frappuccino”-drinking male models in Zoolander’s orbit. Skarsgård had auditioned on a larky trip to America from his home in Sweden. (After living in the U.S. for decades, Skarsgård has returned to Sweden, where he lives with his family.) \n\n\tIn childhood, Skarsgård was embarrassed by his dad’s unconventional lifestyle as an itinerant actor; he’s said that all he wanted was a father who carried a briefcase. Instead, he found himself the eldest in a family of eight children, including his actor brothers Bill (“Nosferatu”), Gustaf (“Westworld”) and Valter (horror films “Funhouse” and “Lords of Chaos”). \n\n\tAlex emerged as a child actor in Sweden, hardly expecting his career to go anywhere; he enlisted in the Swedish Navy at 19, and didn’t expect anything from “Zoolander” either. After moving to the U.S. in 2004, Skarsgård found roles in the wake of his brush with Zoolanderian notoriety sparse — with David Simon and Ed Burns’ 2008 Iraq War miniseries “Generation Kill,” on HBO, representing a step forward. Later that year, HBO gave Skarsgård the experience of fame for the first time, with “True Blood.”\n\n\tOne might expect that the son of a well-known actor might spend his own years waiting for a break with some measure of resentment. Des-pite his father’s fame, Skarsgård was patient. “In some ways I compared myself to my dad, but I wasn’t jealous. My first job was a soap opera. So I didn’t expect to go play the lead in a Lukas Moodysson film,” he says, referring to the acclaimed Swedish director of “Together” and other films. “It wasn’t like, Why am I not getting …?! Of course I’m not. I’m 22, and I’m a soap actor.”  \n\n\t“True Blood” was a soap of a different sort — blood-drenched, unabashedly sexual and a smash hit. Its plot revolved around the love story between telepath Sookie and vamp Bill (Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer), but Skarsgård’s Eric Northman, a Viking turned immortal, became the fan favorite thanks to his penchant for flamboyant violence and a gradually revealed sensitive side. After “True Blood” went off the air in 2014, Skarsgård was the lead in Warner Bros.’ 2016 IP play “The Legend of Tarzan,” which, at a worldwide $356.7 million take, did not justify a sequel. Just as well — it was not the right path for Skarsgård.\n\n\tThe next year, playing Nicole Kidman’s alluring but abusive husband — a man whose impulses toward violence seem to arise from nowhere — on “Big Little Lies,” Skarsgård increasingly turned toward complexity. “Thank you for making this boy feel like one of the girls,” Skarsgård said in his Emmy acceptance speech; the award illustrated a growing sense that Skarsgård could do more than what he’d been offered. The team behind “Succession” may have had a similar realization; Skarsgård says he wasn’t expecting to return for the final season, in which his character took on a prominent role: “I was only supposed to do a couple episodes of Season 3. It was obviously very exciting, but I didn’t go into it signing a multiyear deal.” He’s now back in series-regular life with the Apple TV series “Murderbot.” There, he plays a robot who develops intelligence, finding himself newly aware of the fallibility of the humans around him.\n\t\n\n\tTo act, though, is to leave his family behind in Sweden. (Skarsgard, firmly private about his personal life, shares a child with Swedish actress Tuva Novotny, which he confirmed for the first time at a “Succession” premiere in March 2023.) Before parenthood, “I lived on the road,” he says. “I love that aspect of the industry — you’re a traveling circus. But now, I need to balance that with family life and making sure I can be present for my kid. I can’t be as selfish and narcissistic as I was before.”\n\n\tThe day before our interview, I’d watched Skarsgård and his father sit down for an Actors on Actors conversation. “Pillion” had a short qualifying run in 2025, and is awards-eligible this year; Stellan’s movie is “Sentimental Value” (he’s now won a Golden Globe for the role), and the Skarsgårds were nominated in the same category at the Gotham Awards. Alex told his father how much he’d yearned for a conventional life growing up, but sitting there in teal bloomers with socks pulled toward his knees, he’d apparently outgrown that desire. The pair spoke to a CNN reporter after the taping, and deflected, together, a question about what father thought of son’s nude scenes in “Pillion.” “I’ve seen him naked for 49 years, ” Stellan began. \n\n\t“Daily! I send him nudes every day,” Alex said.\n\n\tIt was something of a perfect Alexander Skarsgård moment — with wry wit (and in attention-grabbing clothing), he didn’t allow things to get too deep. But his father and conversational sparring partner clearly is a soft spot; the most vulnerable he gets is when I ask about Stellan’s celebrated performance, and about seeing him again and again on the campaign trail.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexi Lubomirski for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I’ve never had that before with my dad, nor any of my brothers,” Skarsgård says. “When we’re home, we spend time together, but it’s usually a household filled with chaos. So it’s been nice to go out for a pint somewhere and have a conversation that lasts more than a few minutes.” \n\n\tI wondered how seeing Stellan play a father — one whose chaos has harmed his two grown children — felt. “It was a very emotional experience,” he says, “knowing how much the movie means to my father, and how nervous he was going into it.” Stellan suffered a stroke in 2022, and Alex describes his father’s feelings as “Am I never going to be able to act again? Am I now being put out to pasture? \n\n\t“Knowing where he came from a few years ago — Will I ever work again? to Fuck, yeah, I like to work… It’s the most heartfelt, beautiful thing he’s ever done.” \n\n\n\tStellan Skarsgård, who’s moved between working with auteurs like Lars von Trier and Joachim Trier to franchises like “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Dune,” might provide a template for his oldest son. Alex has the audience in mind, even on his quirkier films. “In more intimate projects, it’s tricky,” Skarsgård says. “I want the movies I make to be seen by people. I’m not making them only for myself.” He sounds uncertain, but hopeful too. “You imagine,” he concludes, “that people will connect to it in some way.”\n\n\tOf Skarsgård’s three new projects, “The Moment” may split the difference between mainstream fare and independent spirit most cleanly. It’s an audacious cinematic statement that is based on a Grammy-winning pop album — a record Skarsgård loves. “Secretly, quietly, on my little island in Sweden, I had a ‘brat summer,’” he says.\n\n\t“People always say, Oh, I’m genuinely a fan,” he continues, casting his near-monotone up an octave sarcastically. But he’d been listening to “Brat” even before Aidan Zamiri and Bertie Brandes wrote the screenplay for “The Moment.” “I told Charli after we shot the movie that when they sum up the year on Spotify, she was my No. 2 most-played artist of the year.”\n\n\tThe admiration was mutual: Working with renowned casting director Jennifer Venditti (“Uncut Gems,” “Marty Supreme,” “Euphoria”) and with director Zamiri, Charli had asked for Skarsgård to play her outlandish creative director, Johannes. “I had seen him in ‘The Northman,’ in ‘Infinity Pool’ and obviously in Lady Gaga’s ‘Paparazzi’ video,” Charli writes via email, “and it just seemed clear to me that he was a pretty fearless person who also had an understanding of pop culture and a great sense of humor — and I was totally right!”\n\n\tThe idea of working with Charli was enough to bring Skarsgård on board. “What I love about Charli as an artist is that she is not afraid to show her own flaws and insecurities. That’s what makes her very brave,” Skarsgård says. The film doesn’t go easy on the fictional Charli, who is willing to sell out her entire career to keep chasing success. \n\n\tThe pair largely improvised their scenes together, including one where Johannes walks through a stage show he’s planned for Charli. (The tour, as cheesily earnest as the real Charli is louche and irreverent, calls to mind footage of Katy Perry’s last world tour.) “The entire thing is improvised,” she says. “We shot it over and over again just because we had the time and we had so many ideas.”\n\t\n\n\t“A version of this movie,” Skarsgård says, “could be her trying desperately to stay true to who she is as an artist. But so much of the movie’s about her being insecure and leaning into I’m kind of addicted to this in a way.” \n\n\tJohannes exploits that, just as Skarsgård’s characters in the past have exploited a wife’s need to keep her family together on “Big Little Lies” or squabbling siblings’ resentments on “Succession” — or a young man’s eagerness to get pushed around in “Pillion.” \n\n\tCharli’s real-life success with “Brat” lay in her willingness to stop trying to deliver what the industry wanted and make work that pulsed with its own oddity and magic. “Charli was playing with the performance of doing the expected record” prior to “Brat,” says Zamiri. “‘Brat’ was the complete antithesis: Let me be extremely specific. Let me make something which is entirely for me.” \n\n\tSkarsgård’s doing something similar — perhaps like Charli with “Brat,” he’s now making choices entirely for him. Over the past year, he has played a dom top, a music industry villain, a robot and a wicker man. We’re a long way from Tarzan.  \n\n\tBut we’ve been here for a while. Before our meeting, I looked up when Skarsgård had been at Sundance before; one such time was to promote 2023’s “Infinity Pool,” the boundary-pushing horror movie that helped convince Charli that Skarsgård was the right man to torment her on-screen. Skarsgård walked the red carpet in a dog collar: It was a nod to the film’s content, and a way for him to put his sensibility out front while promoting the movie. \n\n\t“Our screening started at midnight, so we did it in the reverse order,” Skarsgård recalls. “We went out, had dinner, went to a couple of parties — and had to do a Q&A at 2:30 in the morning. I was slightly inebriated.” \n\t\n\n\tI put the Charli comparison — call it “Skarsgård is ‘Brat’” — forward to him. “I wouldn’t flatter myself that much,” he says. “What she’s doing is extraordinary.” He mentions his admiration for “Chains of Love,” her single that came out three days earlier: “It’s not about, OK, what am I expected to do now to make a commercial hit?” He lets a silence fall, seeming to turn my comparison over in his head, and then bursts into nervous laughter. “But yes, there are definitely other paths I could have taken after ‘True Blood.’ And I followed my curiosity, to see where that takes me.”\n\n\t\n\t\tStyling: Erica Cloud/The Wall Group; Grooming: Kim Verbeck/The Wall Group; Look 1 (Dot jacket look): Full look: Tom Ford; Look 2 (Sofa and wine glass look): Full look: Thom Browne; Look 3 (Jean look): Jacket and jeans: Gabriela Hearst; Boots: Saint Laurent:  Look 4 (Sweater look): Sweater: Gabriela Hearst\t\n",

Breathe Out.\" and a handful of tracks from her upcoming album, \"Luck... or Something.\" She closed out the show with the fan-fave \"What Dreams Are Made Of\" ... which she previously hinted would be on her setlist.\n      \n\n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                                  \n      \n    \n          Fans were thrilled about the varied list of tracks and took to social media to celebrate Hilary's return to the stage. As you know, the \"Lizzie McGuire\" alum released her first single in nearly a decade, \"Mature,\" in November 2025 ... and announced her upcoming album shortly after. She dropped \"Roommates\" -- a steamy song about fighting for the fiery beginnings of a relationship -- last week.\n      \n    \n          Hilary debuted 3 tracks from her upcoming album on stage last night -- \"Weather for Tennis,\" \"Future Trippin’\" and \"We Don’t Talk\" ... the latter of which is rumored to be about her sister, Haylie. The pair grew up in the spotlight together, but haven't been seen together in years.\n      \n    \n          Hilary heads to Canada next to bring her \"Small Rooms, Big Nerves\" tour to Toronto before hitting the States for more concerts in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, where she is scheduled for a 6-show residency.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Hilary Duff\n              \n                          \n                Social Media\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Rowling’s Twitter takedown of Emma Watson, as well as the former’s frequent social media posts against trans people.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Master Rowling has done so much for Dobby, and inclusion in general,” Yang as Dobby said. “Remember when Dumbledore was gay <em>after</em> the books came out?

Dobby can’t remember if the character named Cho Chang was Asian or not…”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Weekend Update duo also broke down Diddy’s sentencing this week, with co-anchor Michael Che saying, “Sean Combs was sentenced on Friday to four years in prison, and I’ll be honest, it’s hard for me to enjoy watching someone I love get punished. But that’s what Diddy would do!”</p>\n<p>\n\t“During Sean Combs’ sentencing, he pleaded for mercy, saying the things he did were disgusting, shameful and sick,” Che continued. “In fact, just thinking about it makes him harder than grandma’s candy!”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch Weekend Update below.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tIt’s no secret that director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/martin-scorsese/\">Martin Scorsese</a> is fascinated by religion. Almost all of his movies include some Biblical allusion, theological meditation, or, in the case of “The Last Temptation of Christ” and “Silence,” center-stage depictions of the church and its sacred texts. Despite the filmmaker’s interest with the subject, though, it may come as a surprise that he actually studied to become a priest, but reveals in a new documentary that he was kicked out of his Catholic seminary for bad behavior.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mr-scorsese/\">Mr. Scorsese</a>,” a new docuseries from Rebecca Miller chronicling the life of the legendary director, premiered at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/new-york-film-festival/\">New York Film Festival</a> on Oct. 4. In the first episode, which explores the director’s early life, Scorsese reflects on the impact that religion had on him as a child and young adult.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt age seven, Scorsese attended his first Catholic mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City, which inspired him to pursue a religious education for many years afterwards.  “There was a preparatory seminary, and that was on 85th Street somewhere. I did okay for the first few months, but something happened,” Scorsese reflects in the series.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tWhat seemed to happen was that Scorsese became fascinated with a world beyond the church. “I began to realize the world is changing,” he says, “It was early rock and roll and the old world was dying out. I became aware of life around me. Falling in love or being attracted to girls, not that you’re acting out on it, but there were these feelings, and I suddenly realized it’s much more complicated than this. You can’t shut yourself off.”</p><p>The director recollects that he eventually realized that the priesthood was not for him. “The idea of priesthood, to devote yourself to others, really, that’s what it’s about. I realized I don’t belong there,” he remembers, “And I tried to stay, but they got my father in there, and they told him, ‘Get him out of here.’ Because I behaved badly.”\n\t</p></div>\n<p>\n\tThe documentary doesn’t explain what specific bad behavior the young Scorsese partook in, but considering the amount of sex, drugs and violence embedded in his filmography, it seems evident that his curiosities were manifold.</p>\n<div><p>\n\tScorsese instead ended up earning a B.A. in English from New York University’s Washington Square College and later an M.A. from the University’s School of Education. He made his directorial debut in 1967 with “Who’s That Knocking at My Door,” which began a nearly six-decade career making influential and iconic films such as “Taxi Driver,” “Raging Bull,” “Goodfellas,” “Casino,” “Gangs of New York,” “The Irishman” and many more. He has been nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards ten times, winning in 2006 for “The Departed.”</p><p>“Mr. Scorsese” will release on Apple TV+ on Oct. 17. The full series is five episodes and includes interviews with Scorsese along with his family members, contemporaries and creative collaborators such as Robert De Niro, Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Robbie Robertson, Thelma Schoonmaker, Steven Spielberg, Sharon Stone, Jodie Foster, Paul Schrader, Margot Robbie, Cate Blanchett, Jay Cocks, Rodrigo Prieto and more.</p></div>\n</div>"

Our film industry is something we must nurture, and so far its development has been very positive.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added: “Through JWC, we are also very pleased to see that several young filmmakers now have the opportunity to make their first feature films funded by KlikFilm. We hope there will be more platforms like this.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tExecutive director Frederica called the edition “a turning point for us,” noting the overwhelming audience response. “We are especially proud to provide opportunities for young Indonesian filmmakers to transition from shorts to feature films,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tFestival director Shandy Gasella echoed the sentiment: “The audience response to JWC 2025 has been extraordinary. From sold-out screenings to the excitement around the short film competition, this shows that spaces for appreciating both world and local cinema are growing.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tFounded in 2022, Jakarta World Cinema is powered by KlikFilm and supported by CGV Cinemas. </p></div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bad-bunny/\">Bad Bunny</a> kicked off Season 51 of “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/saturday-night-live/\">Saturday Night Live</a>” with a bilingual monologue that referenced his upcoming gig as the Super Bowl halftime show headliner — and the right-wing backlash to the announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m very happy,” he said of the opportunity. “And I think everyone is happy about it. Even Fox News.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“SNL” then played a supercut of clips from the conservative news channel, which has criticized the NFL for booking a Spanish-language artist, calling special attention to Bad Bunny’s recent comments about not playing the United States on his latest tour because of fears relating to his fans encountering ICE. But instead of airing news clips of Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, “SNL” chopped up the conservative anchors’ comments to make them say, collectively: “Bad Bunny is my favorite musician, and he should be the next president.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBad Bunny then delivered some heartfelt remarks in his native tongue, offering thanks to those who are genuinely excited for his upcoming Super Bowl performance. “Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors,” Bad Bunny said in Spanish. “It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen, back to English, Bad Bunny said cheekily: “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe monologue also featured a special guest, “SNL” favorite Jon Hamm — or, in Bad Bunny’s words, “Juan Jamón.” Bad Bunny introduced a clip of Hamm dancing at one of his recent concerts before the camera cut to Hamm in the Studio 8H audience, clad in a button-up shirt, sunglasses and bucket hat.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter a landmark 50th season, “SNL” returned on Oct. 4 with Bad Bunny and musical guest Doja Cat. On Oct. 11, Amy Poehler comes back to Studio 8H to host alongside music act Role Model, and on Oct. 18, Sabrina Carpenter will pull double-duty as host and musical guest.</p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of the new season, “SNL” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/lists/snl-season-51-cast\">added a handful of new cast members</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/snl-adds-7-new-writers-season-51-1236535056/\">writers</a> as a slew of familiar faces departed from the show. Heidi Gardner exited the series after eight seasons, while Ego Nwodim announced her exit after seven. Also absent are Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, Emil Wakim and Please Don’t Destroy’s John Higgins, as Martin Herlihy moves to the writing staff and Ben Marshall joins the main cast. New to the cast are Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson, Veronika Slowikowska and Tommy Brennan.</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch Bad Bunny’s monologue below. </p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tColin Jost portrayed  “secretary of war” Pete Hegseth during the first cold open of the 51st season, lamenting that “Our military is gay as hell,” but also mourning that, “It’s also never been fatter!”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis mirrored his real life meeting with the military’s top generals this week, during which the meeting was strangely similar. Jost’s version just got rid of any subtext, demanding that the military be filled with “hot, shredded, hairless men who are definitely not gay.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThen James Austin Johnson’s Trump interrupted to say he was “Just here keeping my eye on ‘<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/snl/\">SNL</a>‘ making sure they don’t do anything too mean about me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump then got meta, saying, “SNL 51 off to a rough start: 17 new cast members and they got the ‘Update’ guy doing the open,” a nod to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/lists/snl-season-51-cast/\">hirings and firings</a> from over the summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also got in a jab at Jost, saying, “I thought he’d be with his friends at the Riyadh Comedy Festival,” with Jost saying he didn’t get an offer.</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump then reminded the audience that if the late night show got out of control, they’d answer to my attack dog at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fcc/\">FCC</a>, Brandon Carr.” Mikey Day then tiptoed into the scene as Carr via a music cue of Rockwell’s “Somebody’s Watching Me,” correcting Trump for the mispronunciation of his first name (it’s actually Brendan).

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT: </strong><em>This story discusses plot developments from “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/monster-the-ed-gein-story/\">Monster: The Ed Gein Story</a>,” currently streaming on Netflix.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAfter seasons profiling Jeffrey Dahmer and Lyle and Erik Menendez, fans of Netflix’s anthology series “Monster” are now binge-watching the just-released third season profiling serial killer Ed Gein. Played by Charlie Hunnam, Gein is haunted by his mother Augusta (Laurie Metcalf), egged on by a dark love interest, Adeline (Suzanna Son) and interacts with victims like Bernice (Lesley Manville) and Evelyn (Addison Rae). Meanwhile, he daydreams about the work of Nazi Ilse Koch (Vicky Krieps), who was rumored to flay Jewish victims and turn their skin into objects like lampshades. Interspersed with these stories is the development of horror hits like “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/psycho/\">Psycho</a>” and “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,” which were inspired by Gein.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of this could fall apart in less capable hands, but Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan were showrunners on the season, which was entirely written by Brennan. Max Winkler is an executive producer this season and directed six of the eight episodes. A veteran of the Murphy-verse, Winkler also worked on “The Watcher,” “American Horror Story,” “American Horror Stories,” “Feud: Capote vs. The Swans” and more. In fact, 48 hours after he spoke to <em>Variety</em>, he was headed off to work on the next season of “Monster,” starring Ella Beatty as Lizzie Borden.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWinkler broke down many burning questions about “Monster: The Ed Gein Story,” including going in-depth about that fourth-wall-breaking moment, nailing the emotional final scene and, of course, the “All That Jazz”-inspired musical number.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThere are so many storylines in this series, between Ed’s murders, Hollywood’s interpretations of him, Ed’s fantasies and more. How did you work with your DP and team to make sure that everything looked appropriate but also blended together as a cohesive whole?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe whole thing started with Ryan taking Charlie and me through the entire vision of what he wanted the show to be and feel like, and really asking the question, “Who is the monster?” Is it the American healthcare system? Is it his mother, Augusta Gein? Is it Ed Gein? Is it Ilse Koch? Is it the filmmakers who then got inspired by this? Is it the artists who made the comic books fetishizing Ilse Koch? Is it the filmmakers who then took what Ed Gein did, and then Hitchcock who put it into pop culture and changed movies and entertainment forever? We’re still trying to put it back in the box now, as you see people online sharing videos of Charlie Kirk getting shot, just that being sent to you on Twitter without any warning. It’s so big and heady, but it was all in Ryan and Ian’s heads from the very get-go. </p>\n<p>\n\tSo [cinematographer] Michael Bauman and I were able to really chart out the murders exactly, especially the murders that are pop-culture inspired; they were always supposed to feel larger than life and always fetishized and real. When we redid the “Psycho” shower scene, it was always supposed to be Hollywood’s version of what it actually is. Seeing Janet Leigh get killed is one thing, but actually what it felt like to put a brutally murdered woman on film screens and how people reacted to that, and how deeply upsetting it was, and how shocking it was then, and how desensitized we are now … we tried to give everything a visual language. </p>\n<p>\n\t[Cinematographer] Carolina Costa, with whom I’d done my movie “Flower,” and Ian did the “Texas Chain Saw” stuff. They had a very specific independent 16 mm film inspiration for all the Texas stuff. And Bauman and I were really inspired by, weirdly, “Capote,” the movie. In that, the isolation is a monster. This poor man, who had undiagnosed schizophrenia in these giant sweeping landscapes with just the wind and frozen corn, and no one to talk to, an abusive mother, a brother who’s out on the lam. Those landscapes from “Days of Heaven” and “Capote” were really important to us, just feeling the vastness of how small he is, and yet when you’re in his head, how loud his brain is.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tThere are so many just dark moments for the actors. What is the best way you, as a director, are able to help them on the days when they have their most intense scenes?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tFor example, with Charlie’s scene where he finally gets his diagnosis in Episode 7, he was really worried about that scene. We were coming towards the end of our production, and Charlie lost maybe 40 pounds for this part, and he wasn’t eating. He was really in his head, and he was starting to not sleep a lot. I think we were all having a lump in our throat, feeling like this was going to be over, and wondering if we got it. When that part came, my instinct was to start on Charlie’s coverage, and that we would never need a wide — let’s just play it all on Charlie’s face. I asked him if he was ready for that, and he said, “Yes.” He did the take that’s in the show, and I said, “I saw what he went through to get there right before we started shooting, and while it happened, I was in the room there just watching, holding my knees with a tiny monitor, and I had chills.” And I said, “Cut,” and he was still really feeling emotional. And I came over and I just pat him on the back and said, “We don’t need to go again if it’s okay with you.” And he said, “Okay.” So that was it. Anyone would know that you had gotten it in that moment, no matter who you are, and not having to say, “We have to go again,” just because in my head, “We have to go again” is the best thing I could have done, and just trust the actor.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tAre there any certain scenes or parts of the show that struck you as especially difficult to shoot?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tEverything that happened in the snow in Chicago in the coldest few days of the year. I cannot believe the actors’ faces even moved. It was -16 degrees. We needed snow. It didn’t look like it was going to snow, and we couldn’t afford to cover everything in snow with visual effects or with a snow machine. That Sunday it snowed, and we started shooting that Monday at 6:30 in the morning, and it gave us everything we needed.</p>\n<p>\n\tI was really happy with what we got to with the emotions in the finale, the sort of “All That Jazz” moment where he’s confronted with what he’s wrought. All Ed Gein ever wanted was for his mother to be proud of him, and to get there was difficult. We shot that all in one day. That was like a 17- or an 18-hour day. By the end of it, when we said cut, everyone just broke because it was our second-to-last day of shooting in Chicago.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tDo you think about empathy differently after working on this project?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI think about a guy like Ed Gein, who has just always been a weirdo, a monster, a freak. And what Ryan is interested in, which is fascinating, is, “Well, how did they get to be that way? Are people born evil?” Since the beginning of time, humans have killed people, and humans have done evil shit. We’re looking at it today in the news all the time. We look at the images of bodies in the newspaper, in the pilot — just bodies stacked upon bodies stacked upon bodies. He says, “They look like wood.” </p>\n<p>\n\tThe dehumanization of human beings is where we get into real trouble, and we stop forgetting that every single life is important. Now, I have a harder time having empathy for Vicky’s character. I have a harder time having empathy for Laurie Metcalf’s character. But I did have empathy for Ed Gein when I did research and understood the kind of abuse he had endured, the generational trauma he had endured, and how lonely it must feel to have these voices in your head and not know where they’re coming from or who to talk to about it.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat was it like reimagining some of Hollywood’s most iconic moments, like the shower scene from “Psycho”?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe never tried to paint them by numbers. We tried to put our own spin on it. The shower scene is significantly more brutal because our perspective of it is via Hitchcock, the monster for bringing this into movies that were not like that before. So I loved those sets. I loved the young actor playing Anthony Perkins, Joey Pollari, who I think is incredible. He himself felt like a monster because he had these feelings of being a homosexual and didn’t know who to talk to about it, and his own therapist told him that he should get a lobotomy. I have a very big affinity for old backlot movies, so getting to shoot those … anytime you get to shoot a bunch of guys in gladiator costumes, with them walking around taking a lunch break and smoking a cigarette, is a great day of work.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tCould you break down Ed’s breaking the fourth wall moment when he talks to the audience?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tWith the invention of the television, it’s when Charlie looks in the camera at the Anthony Perkins scene and says, “You’re the one who can’t look away.” He’s turning it on the viewer and saying, “Are we the monsters because we’re watching this?” I know <em>we</em> are because we’re making it. But our point of view is it’s the monetization and fetishization of these really fucked up people, and it’s really heady.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow did you develop the very end of the series?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe very last shot of the whole show, with them on the porch, was the very last thing we shot, and I had no idea we were going to do it. We were doing little bits and bobs back in L.A. because we missed some things when we went off to Chicago. I don’t know where it came from, but I just said, “Let’s go onto the porch.” And I just knew that “Only a mother could love you” should be the last line of the series, because it’s just a whole “Rosebud” for why Ed did what he did in our version. And we didn’t know we were going to do it. Michael Bauman, who’s a literal genius and the DP who just shot “One Battle After Another,” made that morning light that was all on a stage. I just said, “I want that line and I’ll tell you when to say it, Laurie.” Props weren’t prepared, but we made them some lemonade, gave her something to knit — I think that was actually something she knitted that she had brought from home.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs far as our “All That Jazz” moment, it’s one of my favorite movies of all time. What the finale asks is, “All right, so maybe Ed was troubled, and he’s not purely evil. But here’s what it brought.” By introducing Ted Bundy, he was somebody that all killers could agree was pure evil: No motive, no dark backstory, literally horrible. We really wanted to show what pure evil looked like. We shot that in a totally different way with no music, really dark. I just always laughed when he’s having that dream sequence and he’s seeing all those people and Charles Manson’s like, “We got Bundy, fucker!” These guys are so fucked up, but Ted Bundy is <em>so</em> fucked up that he’s not chill with them. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe end was that we had one choreographer from Chicago. We knew what the song was going to be, and everyone was very tired. It was the very end of our shoot. It was Charlie’s birthday, just by circumstance. It was just a wild, wild day that was probably the longest day of shooting I’ve ever had. And credit to our line producer, Louise Shore, whose head looked like it was about to explode, but she knew that we needed to get it right. We just kept going and made sure we got hotels for everybody next to the set so people could just sleep there, and we just kept shooting until we got it right. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n</div>"

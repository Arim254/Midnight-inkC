It’s incredible that I get to co-create with such an iconic brand that I treasured so much as a child, yet is still so relevant today,” Liang said in a statement, adding that the video illustrates how wearing Gap “made me feel growing up as I imagined being an adult one day and who I could be.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wanted to take the pieces that meant something to me as a kid,” she added, “and reimagine them through my lens today — celebrating girlhood in all its forms, while honoring the iconic styles that make Gap so timeless.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe collection will be available October 10 on <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/c/256585/383244/5553?subId1=VR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gap.com%2F%23\" target=\"_blank\">Gap.com,</a> in select Gap stores, and at Sandy Liang’s New York flagship, with prices ranging from $15 to $268. </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/food-network/\">Food Network</a> is setting its holiday table with more than 50 hours of season programming, including a Christmas-themed spinoff of Guy Fieri’s “Tournament of Champions,” the second season of “Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking,” and a new sweets competition hosted by Wells Adams.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther yuletide content will include fresh seasons of Food Network staples “Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown” and “Holiday Baking Championship,” as well as Chip and Joanna Gaines’ new gingerbread-house-making competition series, a “World’s Sweetest Candy Shops” special, and holiday episodes of daytime series “The Kitchen.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPer Food Network’s description for the new Christmas-themed “Tournament of Champions,” “Guy Fieri will make the most wonderful time of the year even more wonderful, with a high-stakes holiday incarnation of the ultimate sudden-death culinary showdown, ‘Tournament of Champions: All-Star Christmas.’ And because the holidays are a time for cooking with the ones you love, chefs will be invited to pair up in teams of two to compete for glory and goodwill. In every battle, teams will serve up a savory and a sweet dish based on the spin of the Randomizer. The chef teams will need to be in sync and on their game to earn the title, the belt, a $100,000 cash prize furnished by Carnival Cruise Lines and their split of an additional $50,000 prize to give to a cause close to their hearts.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCompeting teams for “Tournament of Champions: All-Star Christmas” will include Antonia Lofaso and Alex Guarnaschelli; Maneet Chauhan and Stephanie Izard; Mei Lin and Nini Nguyen; Jet Tila and Ashley Holt; Lee Anne Wong and Zac Young; Sara Bradley and Damaris Phillips; Britt Rescigno and Jonathon Sawyer; Michael Voltaggio and Bryan Voltaggio; Marcus Samuelsson and Rachel Sherriffe; Shirley Chung and Sherry Yard; Kevin Lee and Dale Talde; Aarón Sánchez and Amanda Freitag; Tobias Dorzon and Marcel Vigneron; Adam Sobel and Christian Petroni; Aarti Sequeira and Crista Luedtke; Graham Elliot and Giuseppe Tentori. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJudges across the Christmas-themed season are Michelle Bernstein, Scott Conant, Cat Cora, Susan Feniger, Gale Gand, Lorena Garcia, Judy Joo, Nancy Silverton, Curtis Stone, Jacques Torres, Christina Tosi, Ming Tsai, and Geoffrey Zakarian. Floor reporters Tiffani Faison and Justin Warner will be joined by Hunter Fieri for commentary. The series is produced by Knuckle Sandwich and Lando Entertainment. </p>\n<p>\n\tFrom Alfred Street Studios, the Wells Adams-hosted “Sweet Empire” will see fourteen of the most competitive and talented sweets makers invited to the Yuletide Lodge for a competition unlike any other. While the competitors enter as individuals, their goal will be to get on– and stay on– the strongest team by any means necessary, because in this game the bakers must create incredible edible works of art to grow their teams and avoid elimination. In the end, teams will crumble until only the strongest will be left standing to become the Sweet Empire. Wells Adams will host with Jacques Torres and Yolanda Gampp serving as judges in this holiday baking competition with an edge.</p>\n<p>\n\tSee below for the premiere dates of the Food Network holiday series, all of which will also stream next day on HBO Max and Discovery+.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking” Season 2 — Nov. 2 8 p.m. ET</p>\n<p>\n\t“World’s Sweetest Candy Shops” — Nov. 2 at 10 p.m. ET</p>\n<p>\n\t“Holiday Baking Championship” — Nov. 3 at 8 p.m. ET</p>\n<p>\n\t“Tournament of Champions: All-Star Christmas” — Nov. 5 at 8 p.m. ET</p>\n<p>\n\t“Sweet Empire” — Nov. 9 at 9 p.m. ET</p>\n<p>\n\t“Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown” — Nov. 11 at 8 p.m. ET </p>\n<p>\n\t“Gingerbread Land: The Biggest Little Holiday Competition” (Magnolia Network original) — Nov. 17 at 9 p.m. ET</p>\n<p>\n\t“This year we have upped the ante on Food Network’s must-see, seasonal family-friendly programming with new series, new twists and new takes on this fan-favorite lineup,” Warner Bros. Discovery’s head of food content Betsy Ayala said. “Along with returning favorites, fans will be dazzled by the holiday spin on ‘Tournament of Champions: All-Star Christmas’ and the unique take on the dessert competition format with ‘Sweet Empire.’ With more than 50 hours of holiday programming Food Network is truly the ultimate destination this holiday season.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSee below for Food Network’s descriptions of more its new and returning 2025 holiday programming.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking” Season 2</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFeaturing even more spellbinding creations, enchanted elements and baking wizardry as a new field of competitors embark on the experience of a lifetime.

The It’Sugar flagship store in New Jersey’s American Dream mall will battle their rival store in Times Square, to see who will make the most sales during the holiday rush. Across the pond, Cadbury World in the United Kingdom will unveil an elaborate chocolate sculpture to celebrate their grand reopening following a massive renovation. In Sweden, Gottebiten, the world’s largest candy store by floor area, will struggle to keep up with demand for its 700 varieties of pick ‘n’ mix sweets in a nation of candy-loving Swedes.</p>\n<p>\n\t“World’s Sweetest Candy Shops” is produced by ScreenDog Productions. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown” Season 4</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tLast holiday season, Bobby Flay didn’t play nice and ended up with a clean sweep.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe L.A.-based, Philadelphia-reared quintet <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mt-joy/\">Mt. Joy</a> are probably no one’s idea of millionaire rock stars, yet they’ve been using their platform as one of the rare breakthrough rock bands of the past decade to donate considerable amounts of money to causes that are important to them — including nearly half a million dollars on their recent tour in support of their fourth and latest album “Hope We Have Fun.”</p>\n<p>\n\tA concert last month in Boston raised nearly $400,000 for <a href=\"https://familyreach.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Family Reach</a>, a national nonprofit that provides financial resources for families facing cancer. After performing at the Newport Folk Festival in July, they drove to Boston and played an acoustic set at Mass General Brigham Hospital for young patients, and in May did the same at a North Carolina studio for patients from the Atrium Health Levine Children’s Hospital. And in August, in their hometown of Philadelphia, the band hosted a second <a href=\"https://metrophiladelphia.com/mt-joy-upcoming-show-food-drive-at-the-mann/\" target=\"_blank\">hosted a non-perishable food drive</a> during its two shows in town.\n\t</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"422\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBettxJlFts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\tThey’ve also donated $40,000 to rebuilding efforts in Asheville, North Carolina, after their concert in that city, donated $35,000 to the <a href=\"https://www.aclu-tn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee ACLU</a> when their Bonnaroo show was canceled due to weather, donated just under $23,500 to the <a href=\"https://www.abta.org/\" target=\"_blank\">American Brain Tumor Association</a>, which was raised around awareness from their song “Lucy,” and have donated 100,000 meals through <a href=\"https://www.sharingexcess.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sharing Excess</a> food drives. Last November, they shot a video with Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce (yes, Travis’ brother) to help raise money for charities in the city, and performed with him before an Eagles game.\n\t</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"422\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cENOVU5HUUE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>\n\tFrontman Matt Quinn says, “We think the best way to find good opportunities to help is to make an effort to connect with people in the communities where we are giving. In Asheville, we spoke with friends there to determine where locals think they still need funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. While traveling on tour, we get the chance to hear from people from all over the world and learn about local charities. In Boston, we met Carla Tardif who runs an amazing charity, Family Reach, that works directly with MGH Hospital in the city to make sure families going through cancer have the funds they need to survive.”</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tAlso on this tour, the band played Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry for the first time, and sold out such venues as Colorado’s legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre, New York’s Forest Hills Stadium and Boston’s TD Garden. Yet Quinn says it all pales in comparison to the feeling they get from their charitable work.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Ultimately, we just want to be a force for good,” he concludes. “Music has given us every opportunity to do so, and there’s nothing more rewarding than hearing from someone’s heart how you’ve helped them. No ticket counts or awards or other measures of ‘success’ will ever compare to feeling like this community we’ve built is helping people.”</p>\n</div>",

The series, produced under license from Fremantle’s global “Idol” franchise, showcases emerging musical talent from across Pakistan.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe show features a star-studded judging panel including actor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fawad-khan/\">Fawad Khan</a>, singer Zeb Bangash, qawwali artist Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, and Strings musician Bilal Maqsood. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Pakistan Idol” currently airs Saturdays and Sundays across seven Pakistani television channels: Geo TV, PTV, Green Entertainment TV, Express Entertainment, APlus Entertainment, Aur Life, and Aan TV. While the series has been available for streaming within Pakistan, Begin’s deal marks its first global digital distribution.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe show will stream on the Begin app in the U.S., Canada, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E. Viewers in the U.K., Germany, India, Australia, South Africa, and Nigeria can access the series directly via begin.watch.</p>\n<p>\n\t“The international distribution of ‘Pakistan Idol’ demonstrates how far South Asian entertainment has come in reaching global audiences,” said Zoya Merchant, director at production company MHL. “We are proud to see a format rooted in local culture and talent become accessible to viewers worldwide. This collaboration with Begin represents an important step toward integrating Pakistani creativity into the broader entertainment ecosystem.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJonathan Mark, co-founding CEO of Begin, said the acquisition aligns with the platform’s content strategy. “At Begin, our focus is on curating content that connects communities through shared cultural experiences,” Mark said. “‘Pakistan Idol’ embodies the kind of storytelling and talent that transcend geography. Making it available worldwide aligns with our vision of bringing authentic South Asian voices to a truly global stage.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tActress and singer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ashley-park/\">Ashley Park</a> has been appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the UN World Food Programme.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe “Emily in Paris” star has a track record of championing food security around the world. She spearheaded a fundraising appeal for Sudan when the country faced famine, raising over $500,000 and over a million meals. </p>\n<p>\n\tOn World Food Day 2024, she joined WFP Goodwill Ambassador Michael Kors in a video informing people about the organization’s homegrown school feeding program and its impact on women farmers, children and communities. Most recently, she issued another fundraising appeal, this time to provide food to mothers and children facing malnutrition.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am truly honored and humbled to become a World Food Programme Goodwill Ambassador,” Park said in statement on Wednesday. “I’m eager to help elevate the voices of the women, children and communities facing hunger and to inspire others to take action alongside me. While ending hunger can seem overwhelming or hopeless, I know it’s possible after seeing firsthand the expertise, scale and impact of WFP’s work. I urge everyone to learn more about WFP and to support its vital mission. Everyone deserves access to food and without it, the hopes, dreams and human potential of millions hangs in the balance.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tWFP executive director Cindy McCain said, “I am thrilled to welcome Ashley to our WFP family at a time when humanitarian needs continue to grow and famine is once again a reality in our world.

Lucie Braverman joins as head of marketing and publicity, leading the global marketing, publicity, and festival strategies for the company’s diverse portfolio of film and TV projects.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThese appointments reflect WestEnd’s ambition for the future, the company said, with a specific focus on enhancing the company’s position in the international television market and expanding its presence in North America, with Braverman based in New York City. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tBraverman’s hire “underscores the company’s commitment to amplifying its footprint in the United States, fostering deeper ties with U.S. distributors, filmmakers, and media, while continuing to broaden its global reach.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMor’s appointment is part of WestEnd’s strategic drive to “build a robust and diversified TV business, positioning the company for long-term success in a rapidly evolving global market.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMor began her career at WestEnd Films as sales and acquisitions executive, working on acclaimed titles including “Una” by Benedict Andrews, starring Rooney Mara, “Green Room” by Jeremy Saulnier, and the Academy Award-nominated “The Breadwinner.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom 2018 to 2025, she served as senior manager of international co-production and distribution at HOT, leading broadcaster internationally known for “In Treatment” and “Euphoria” (both adapted by HBO). In this role, she spearheaded global partnerships and brought local storytelling to worldwide platforms.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tMor oversaw co-productions and acquisitions such as “Borders” (Netflix/ZDF), “Losing Alice” (Apple TV+), “The Dreamers” (Sundance Now), and “Bad Boy” (Netflix). She is also an executive producer on the Netflix original “French Lover,” starring Omar Sy.</p>\n<p>\n\tBraverman began her career at Studiocanal in Paris before joining WestEnd in 2014. During her tenure, she rose to head of marketing and contributed to global campaigns for acclaimed films including Academy Award nominees “The Breadwinner” and “Song of the Sea,” “Green Room,” “Close” (Netflix), “Mr. Jones” and HBO Max series “Valley of Tears.” </p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2021, Braverman joined Universal Pictures Content Group as senior global product manager, where she oversaw global distribution releases and 360° marketing campaigns for a wide range of titles, from Amblin Partners’ horror “Come Play” to Ley Line Entertainment’s “Brian Wilson: Long Promised Road” and Ridley Scott Creative Group’s “Kipchoge: The Last Milestone.” Most recently, she served as director of marketing, brand and creative for Hudson Yards Experiences.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We are delighted to welcome Neta and Lucie back to the WestEnd team,” said Maya Amsellem, managing director of WestEnd Films. “Neta’s sales expertise and strong industry relationships, combined with Lucie’s creative vision and global marketing experience, bring a fantastic combination of skills to our team. We are excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to deliver exceptional films and TV series to audiences worldwide.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m thrilled to rejoin WestEnd, whose vision and creativity I’ve respected for years,” said Neta Rena Mor. “I look forward to developing new collaborations and driving the growth of our exceptional TV lineup.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBraverman added, “I’m excited to reunite with Maya and the WestEnd team.

The Oscar winner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/film/news/george-clooney-oceans-14-sequel-great-script-exists-1235836403/\">first teased</a> there was a “great” script for “Ocean’s 14” in 2023. <em>Variety </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/oceans-14-david-leitch-warner-bros-1236282548/\">reported</a> at the start of this year that “The Fall Guy” and “Bullet Train” filmmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/david-leitch/\">David Leitch</a> was boarding the crime caper sequel to direct.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“We just got the budget approved at Warner Bros. and we’re trying to set up,” Clooney now confirmed. “It’s just scheduling, so it’s just setting a start date for us. Probably start in about nine or 10 months, shooting.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen asked if he is excited to reunite with Brad Pitt once again on the big screen, Clooney answered: “Yeah, Brad [Pitt], Matt [Damon] and Don [Cheadle] and Julia [Roberts]. I had dinner last night with Julia. They’re all still really dear friends. And so, the chance to work together would be fun.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe original “Ocean’s” trilogy, directed by Steven Soderbergh, launched in 2001 with “Ocean’s Eleven,” a critical favorite and a commercial hit with just over $450 million at the worldwide box office. The franchise continued with 2004’s “Ocean’s Twelve” ($362 million) and 2007’s “Ocean’s Thirteen” ($311 million). A spinoff, 2018’s “Ocean’s 8,” starred Sandra Bullock as the sister of George Clooney’s Danny Ocean opposite Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, Sarah Paulson, Awkwafina, Mindy Kaling and Anne Hathaway. The movie hit the $297 million mark worldwide.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tClooney told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/george-clooney-the-boys-in-the-boat/\">Uproxx</a> in 2023 that “we have a really good script for another ‘Ocean’s’ now, so we may end up doing another one. It’s actually a great script.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen asked if the script was for a potential “Ocean’s 14,” Clooney responded: “Well… I don’t want to call it that… I mean, the idea is kind of like ‘Going in Style.’”</p>\n<p>\n\tClooney was referring to Martin Brest’s 1979 heist comedy, which famously starred George Burns, Art Carney, Lee Strasberg and Charles Hallahan. Zach Braff remade the film in 2017 with a cast that featured Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin. The plot centers on a three senior citizens who team up to pull off a heist.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhatever “Ocean’s 14” turns out to be, this entry is separate from the previously reported franchise prequel that is expected to star “Barbie” favorites Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Filmmaker Jay Roach and written by Carrie Solomon are attached to the prequel, which is expected to take place in 1960s Europe.<br /></p>\n<figure></figure>\n</div>",

Elhum Shakerifar serves as executive producer.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“Punctuated by the rhythms of war, this collaborative film presents a poignant first-person documentation of the daily reality in Gaza in the early days of the genocide, as lived and chronicled by Rima and Ibrahim Jabaly,” the festival said. “These scenes are continually entwined with conversations with their older brother, exiled filmmaker Mohamed Jabaly.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexandru Solomon, whose multiple films have enjoyed screenings at IDFA (“Cold Waves” in 2007, “Kapitalism: Our Improved Formula” in 2010, and more recently, “Arsenie. An Amazing Afterlife” in 2023), heads back to pitch “Small Expectations,” alongside executive producer Ada Solomon of microFILM.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfurling during Romania’s presidential race, the documentary follows former civic activist Nicușor Dan who takes the helm of the troubled office.</p>\n<p>\n\tA roster of emerging directors also bolsters the lineup. In “Four Comrades, One Echo,” Kiva Liu focuses on four sisters in China’s Sichuan, each of whom mothered her through different episodes in life.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Leaning into the imagination spaces of shared story-writing, the sisters conjure up alternative selves, maintaining the sole bond that has sustained them in the politicized society,” IDFA said.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Video-Guy.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Video-Guy.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Video-Guy.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Video-Guy.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Video-Guy.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Video-Guy.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Video-Guy.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Video-Guy.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“The Video Guy”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of IDFA\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tSam Howard (Roisin Agnew’s “The Ban,” IDFA 2024) and Alexander Dickerson-Watson debut their feature “The Video Guy.” From a humble hustle shooting music videos for local rappers, the project morphed into a sprawling decade-long endeavor that follows five African-American youths set to become the next Kendrick, all the while unpacking the hyperreal fantasies, projected onto—and in part perpetuated by the men—and the few paths open to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong further notable standouts is Alison O’Daniel’s viscerally experiential and experimental “Inframince” (“The Tuba Thieves,” the IDFA Forum Award 2022 for best rough cut, IDFA 2023) on the Havana Syndrome, the alleged “sonic attacks” on U.S. diplomats, initially reported in Cuba.</p>\n<p>\n\tStretching the possibilities of film, O’Daniel turns the subject into form, articulated “ecstatically and expansively” through a sensorial cinematic language.

Anchored in intimate, unobtrusive observational footage, the film takes a playful yet thoughtful approach to form, crafting cinematically stylized sequences that immerse the viewer in the world of crickets, which the boy retreats into for companionship.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong other standout projects is Nolwenn Hervé’s “The Cord” (a production of Estelle Robin You of Grande Ourse Films), set in Venezuela where giving birth is often a life-endangering act.</p>\n<p>\n\tExploring the themes of womanhood and coming of age, “Dreams of the Wild Oaks” by Bakhtiari director Marjan Khosravi and producer Milad Khosravi embraces elements of a fictionalized narrative and magical realism to subtly approach the sensitive topics of child marriage and environmental destruction in rural Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>IDFA DocLab Forum<br /></strong>The market’s new media strand IDFA DocLab Forum presents 12 projects in various stages of development and production. The selection spans diverse formats, including interactive narrative VR 360°, multi-user VR game installation, AR, AI, multimedia installation, live performance, AR multi-user VR room scale, and multimedia multi-user installation, among others.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe lineup showcases a range of projects that engage with such themes as gender and sexual identities, war trauma, mobility, cultural heritage in the context of displacement and digital obsolescence, and perspectives on ecosystems.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fear-City-Paradise.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fear-City-Paradise.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fear-City-Paradise.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fear-City-Paradise.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fear-City-Paradise.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fear-City-Paradise.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fear-City-Paradise.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fear-City-Paradise.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Fear City Paradise”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of IDFA\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tHighlights include a multi-person, collective documentary VR experience, “Fear City Paradise” by Darren Emerson, the creator behind “In Pursuit of Repetitive Beats” (IDFA 2022). “Fear City Paradise” takes us on a nocturnal journey, this time to the New York of the 1970s to meet the real people of disco: the city’s queer, Black and Latino communities.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother highlight comes from Marcel van Brakel’s “Amasonic,” which presents a living sound archive of the Amazon, gathered over the span of five years with data and tales from scientists and local communities. In the XR installation, the sound archive may be accessed from the perspective of a human or non-human lifeform inhabiting the river.</p>\n<p>\n\tCutting the distance between self and the other, Yimit Ramírez and Tony Alonso’s “The Eyes of Mila Kaos” burrows into the mind of Mila Kaos, a drag queen in Havana’s underground shows and an empowering alter ego of a young actor, Tony Alonso, who formed her to cope with trauma from sexual assault.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reframing-Queer-Exile.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reframing-Queer-Exile.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reframing-Queer-Exile.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reframing-Queer-Exile.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reframing-Queer-Exile.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reframing-Queer-Exile.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reframing-Queer-Exile.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reframing-Queer-Exile.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>“Reframing Queer Exile”</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of IDFA\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t<strong>IDFA Forum<br /></strong>This year’s IDFA Forum will welcome film teams, industry representatives, and observers from Nov. 16 to 19.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAffirming the crucial role of international co-productions as a key financing model for artistic documentaries, this year the Producers Connection Presentations will take place alongside the Forum Pitches as part of the same program on Nov. 17 and 18 at ITA. This integrated setup allows all IDFA Forum accredited guests to attend the Forum Pitches and Producers Connection Presentations. Meanwhile, the Rough Cut projects will be presented on Nov. 16 in the Pathé City cinema. The DocLab Forum Presentations are set for Nov. 17 at @droog.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this year’s edition, the IDFA Forum also launches new thematic “Informative Panels” that will offer filmmakers practical insights on navigating the documentary financing landscape. The sessions will take place as the IDFA Forum discontinues the conventional post-pitch feedback format. One-on-one meetings will remain integral to the Forum, allowing for in-depth discussions on creative intent, financing strategies, and potential collaborations.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlongside the Forum events, IDFA’s premier market and distribution incubator for creative documentary films, Docs for Sale, runs concurrently from Nov. 15 to 19.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWhen Sunny Vohra acquired <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/twickenham-film-studios/\">Twickenham Film Studios</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2013/film/features/twickenham-studios-100-years-1200476877/\">in 2012</a>, he inherited more than just soundstages and post-production facilities. He became the custodian of a 113-year-old institution where cinema history was written, from “The Italian Job” through to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Now, 13 years into his tenure, Vohra is making what he calls “a leap of faith” — one that could position the venerable British studio at the forefront of virtual production technology.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe centrepiece of this transformation is a massive <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/samsung/\">Samsung</a>-powered LED installation in Stage 3, featuring a 24 x 4.5 metre back wall, 105 square metre LED ceiling, mobile LED totem walls and a permanent turntable and motion control crane. It represents Samsung’s first major LED screen build in the U.K. and only its third globally, following installations in Paju, Korea, and Paris, France.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe facility <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/samsung-twickenham-uk-virtual-production-hub-1236369565/\">soft-launched over the summer</a> with a popular British series being shot there, ahead of a full launch this fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Vohra, the apparent tension between tradition and innovation is a false dichotomy. “This industry is actually all about storytelling, and stories have been told for centuries,” he explains. “When we made movies 100 years ago, the technology then was very simple — silent films, then sound came in, then color came in from black and white. The traditional filmmaking model is still there, but all you do is you embrace technology as time goes on.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSuperna Sethi, managing director of Twickenham Film Studios, sees the virtual production stage as a strategic necessity. “When I came here [Twickenham] in 2022, the whole industry globally was affected because of COVID. We had a good six months period whereby business was picking up, and then bang, during Cannes 2023 we had the [Hollywood] strikes. It took 18 months for business to come back.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe installation arrives at a pivotal moment when studios worldwide are reassessing their offerings. “There’s a lot of competition out there. You need to have an edge,” Sethi says. </p>\n<p>\n\tFor Samsung Electronics, the Twickenham installation represents more than a single project — it’s a statement of intent in the virtual production market.</p>\n<p>\n\tGraeme Little, head of display for Samsung Electronics U.K. and Ireland, is candid about the company’s objectives. “Samsung will enter a market with the aspiration of being number one. When we look at the virtual production space, we have absolutely taken our time to get this right. Samsung’s aspiration is that we will want to be a recognizable global leader in the virtual production market over the next five years.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe journey from consumer display to virtual production tool began with feedback from filmmakers. Little traces the evolution: “With the introduction of micro LED back in 2018, Samsung created the wall, which was a huge step change for the traditional LED business. CJ Entertainment, the production company for “Parasite,” were looking to get early entry into that VP space. They questioned Samsung – ‘Look, we have this wall product, we’re not entirely sure that the SMD LED [Surface Mount Device and Light Emitting Diode] is the right long term path for us.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThat conversation led to focused development. “Samsung looked to understand, how can we adopt the wall technology into a virtual production environment? Our movement into virtual production came as we were given an opportunity by a big production company in Korea. We launched that at IBC [International Broadcasting Convention] in 2023.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSteve Robertson, head of signage for Samsung Electronics U.K., emphasizes the experiential impact. “We talk a lot in our business about ‘wow’ moments. Over the course of the next 12 months, there’s going to be so many ‘wow’ moments when people walk into that studio for the first time, because Twickenham and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/quite-brilliant/\">Quite Brilliant</a> are allowing us to do something that has not been done in the U.K. at all.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRobertson sees potential beyond traditional film production. “We found some pockets within corporate and within retail, within education as well. Does virtual production accelerate the ability for smaller scale projects to actually be achievable? Something maybe couldn’t come to market for another couple of years whilst they’re waiting for funding — virtual production makes that attainable.”\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF1.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF1.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF1.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF1.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF1.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF1.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwickenham Film Studios/Quite Brilliant\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tThe choice of Samsung as technology partner and Quite Brilliant as integrator was deliberate. Russ Shaw, technical director and founder of Quite Brilliant, brings five years and over 150 virtual production projects to the collaboration.</p>\n<p>\n\tShaw’s company started exploring virtual production in 2014 using back projection, but “The Mandalorian” changed everything. “In 2020 we made the decision to dive more heavily into virtual production. It was the infancy — during lockdown people were looking at this tech, but it didn’t really exist as a turnkey solution.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHis approach to building the Twickenham stage was informed by hard-won experience. “We started to investigate options. We talked to Sony, Samsung, [China’s] the Absen people. It boiled down to going with a Samsung product, not only because of the technology involved — it’s cutting edge technology — but it was about the relationship.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom a technical standpoint, Shaw highlights specific advances: “The biggest factor is the black levels and the contrast ratios. When we compare them to products currently on the market from competitors, they’re looking at contrast ratios about seven to 8,000 to one. This screen has got a contrast ratio of 35,000 to one.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat does this mean in practical terms? “When you come to light a scene, it’s a lot easier to achieve. When you see a foreground asset and it doesn’t blend in with the background, it looks milky, like traditional screens do — that’s when you go, that’s looking a bit dodgy, looks a bit fake. This just makes that process a lot quicker and a lot easier.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShaw has incorporated numerous innovations into the stage design. “We’ve got a screen that sits below the floor of the studio, which means technically no join when we put art department up to it. We’ve integrated a six meter turntable in front of the screen, which is controllable from our desk and automated.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe turntable solves a persistent continuity challenge. “If you’re shooting a scene of a living room, someone sat on a sofa, and you wanted to do a reverse view, it’s very easy to change the content on the screen in seconds. But changing the art department, spinning everything around 180 degrees traditionally involves a props person running in, turning everything around and checking continuity. Having a turntable means you can just press a button — 20 seconds, you completely reverse the view.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother innovation addresses lighting limitations through Image Based Lighting. “LED screens are good for ambient lighting, and the scale of our ceiling and wall is covering now about 80 to 90% of the lighting for a scene, which is phenomenal. What we can do is texture map physical lights to the screen. Anything that changes on the screen, something flashes, that light can map the same image as well. It’s a full wraparound environment.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe conversation around virtual production often centers on cost savings, but the reality is more nuanced.</p>\n<p>\n\tRobertson articulates the multi-faceted value proposition. “There’s the traditional stuff around location, travel, construction, set construction costs, and the disposal of those sets. It’s time and speed to market. You’re removing the one critical factor that we don’t have enough of in our personal lives, let alone in a professional sense. Being first to market with something can be the difference between something being a success or not.”</p>\n<p>\n\tVohra provides concrete examples from his years shepherding productions. “If you want to shoot in one of the London squares, and you go to the council and you want that square cordoned off for one day shoot, they can charge you £20,000 [$26,800] just for one day. Then you got to get the production team there, vans, catering, everything. So a day shoot could cost you £60,000 [$80,500] to £70,000 [$93,900].”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe contrasts this with virtual production: “Create a scene on the screen, you get a screen on London, you get the people in, you get the shoot. Everybody’s on one stage, everything is in one place. That day shoot probably costs £25,000 [$33,540] all in. Had they done that in the streets of London, you’d be spending about £75,000 [$100,625] to £100,000 [$134,150]. That saving alone adds to the ROI — for the production making the movie or TV show, for the virtual production people running the screen like Quite Brilliant, for the studio that has a facility like Twickenham, and ultimately Samsung.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cost savings extend to post-production as well. Vohra shares a striking example: “In 13 years here, we’ve had three movies — big budget productions — they went back and shot certain scenes. One production, it was a multi-million pound project, but just to reshoot one scene, they went and spent half a million.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn contrast, he notes, “Had that to be done on the VP screen, it’s a question of a switch — button on, button off. You can probably do it either the same day or maybe the next day. The challenge of making alterations is going to be reduced drastically.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLittle from Samsung emphasizes that ROI isn’t purely financial. “When you work in an environment such as filmmaking and production, it’s about quality. That’s something that can never be undervalued. The outcome is way more important than anything else. Our wall product absolutely sits at the top end of our solution stack. That ability to build and deliver high end quality with the security of a brand like Samsung behind that gives a huge amount of confidence to our partners.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShaw makes the stage accessible to productions of all sizes. “We’re making this wall available to people that don’t need all of it. When we’re talking to clients, if they only need to shoot on a third of it because their framing is so small, then that’s obviously going to be more cost effective.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSethi sees this flexibility as democratizing. “Give the smaller British filmmakers the opportunity — we support all.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn sustainability, the environmental benefits prove substantial. Shaw reports surprising efficiency gains. “Interestingly, on this new screen, which is technically six, seven times the size of our previous screen, the usage of electricity shows that it’s a similar amount of power usage. That’s quite incredible. The technology is getting greener all of the time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe provides real-world data: “When we’re doing commercials, we have bodies like Ad Green where we monitor what our usage is for that particular project. We’ve seen examples of this being 70 to 80% saving on the carbon footprint.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSethi cites industry research: “Virtual production can actually lower emissions by 75% to 90% compared to traditional shooting methods.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe role of artificial intelligence in virtual production is evolving rapidly, and it’s already influencing workflows at Twickenham.</p>\n<p>\n\tVohra takes a pragmatic view. “AI — those two letters are at the forefront of every discussion today. We’ve got to embrace it. AI has to be embraced in this industry. We have acknowledged and agreed that AI has to be taken into every decision we make because it is going to be the future.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShaw is already implementing AI-generated content in real-time production. “We just did a job for a major UK bank, and we were generating content literally on the fly as they were shooting on the day. We built an airport baggage area — much more easy to do in AI than going to an actual location. When we shot it, the director suddenly decided they wanted to look at a different direction. We were instantly able to do some AI generation, some repositioning of cameras using various different tools to reproduce that angle.”</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking ahead, Shaw sees transformative potential. “What is possible in the future, two, three years down the line, is you’ll be able to create an asset that will be rendered in the cloud in real time, such that as the camera moves, that data has been sent up to the cloud or to some big server that is generating that AI and redrawing it and sending it back to you in real time.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRobertson from Samsung sees the company’s role as enabling rather than creating. “AI is a catalyst for change and efficiencies. Our role is ultimately we provide the canvas. There are technical reasons for why we will enhance what AI content gives. We’re able to handle fast moving content. We feel like we’re AI-ready already — we’re waiting for AI to catch up with the technology that we have embedded into our screens.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWith emerging technology comes a learning curve, and Shaw has observed recurring mistakes from crews new to virtual production.</p>\n<p>\n\t“What we have to try and educate people is take some of that time that you were allocating to post to fix things, and actually put it into the pre area and plan it and map it all out. We have models, we do what’s called previsualization. We will have models of the screen, models of some of the assets and the content, and we can physically show people on Zoom calls exactly what they’re going to get.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShaw shares a specific example of how previsualization saved both money and creative vision. “We did a job for a bed company in January. The director was adamant we’d need a particular size virtual production screen — 30 metres big and curved because he’d shot on one before in Sofia. The producer said, we don’t want to build it this big, it’s going to cost too much money.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThrough careful planning, Shaw found a solution. “We basically previsualized the whole setup and spent a lot of time online with the guy, showed some of the angles. Then I pressed this button and turned on this green box, which is a screen that I’d actually put in there which is not 30 metres, it’s 16 metres. He was slightly deflated, but that planning beforehand helped cement that actually what people want, because the vision is not always the same as what it might be from the outset.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tShaw maintains a philosophy of honest consultation. “I had a director call me about a job. He said, could it work for virtual production? I said, no, that is a mad idea. Do it all in green screen. I’ll tell it like it is because I want the best results for people.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF2.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF2.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF2.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF2.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF2.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Samsung-Twickenham-VPF2.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwickenham Film Studios/Quite Brilliant\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWhile feature films and high-end television remain the core market, Samsung and Twickenham see virtual production expanding into unexpected territories.</p>\n<p>\n\tLittle identifies several emerging sectors. “More and more organizations are looking to say we have broadcast capabilities across our organization, particularly multinationals. How do we bring virtual production in-house to be able to deliver content that would have been outsourced traditionally? Corporate presents a big opportunity.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRetail has proven surprisingly receptive. “Ikea on Regent Street has a virtual production environment, which is a Samsung environment. They use that for production, also live production and how they interact on their social platforms with customers coming in.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSports organizations are also exploring applications. “We have a number of Premier League football [soccer] clubs looking to understand how they can adopt virtual production. The big thing for them is how do they adopt global marketing? That ability to do a campaign on a social level with one of their corporate sponsors around Asia — they can deliver it with a certain corporate background in the U.K., a very different one.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the installation enters full operation this fall, all partners express confidence about the future while remaining realistic about challenges ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tLittle articulates Samsung’s long-term vision. “Samsung’s aspiration is that we will want to be a recognizable global leader in the virtual production market over the next five years. We have to utilize our huge brand legacy in the display space and work in the spaces where we can recognize our growth opportunity and be disruptive.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Vohra, the investment represents both continuation and evolution. “This new venture marks the next phase of our multi-year strategy to invest in Twickenham’s future. Samsung is our ideal partner. They see the value of our world-class award-winning team and appreciate our approach in balancing investment in technology with investment in our people.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSethi frames the moment in competitive terms. “At a time when the industry was really on its feet, we were thinking outside of the box. We got together with QB, who then chose Samsung as our partner to do the installation. For us, it’s a game changer. Oldest film studio, newest technology. There’s no looking back. We’re only looking forward.”</p>\n<p>\n\tShaw emphasizes competitive positioning through quality. “A lot of stages are built in commercial units. This is a true soundstage because it’s in a proper film studio. If you add all these bits together, it’s a compelling reason that someone will look somewhere else, come look at ours and feel confident — I’m getting the best bang for buck here.”</p>\n<div><p>\n\tThe collaboration between a historic British studio, a global technology leader, and specialist virtual production experts represents more than just an installation of LED screens. It’s a bet on the future of filmmaking that honors the past while embracing radical change.</p></div>\n</div>",

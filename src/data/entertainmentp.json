    "body": "\n\tDish Network is firing back at Disney and EPSN in a legal dispute over its launch of limited-time passes for Sling TV — with Dish alleging that the media giant is violating antitrust laws to squelch competition and has breached the terms of its contract with Dish.\n\n\tDish filed federal antitrust and breach of contract counterclaims against the Walt Disney Co. and ESPN on Friday, Jan. 2, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\t\n\n\tThat came in response to Disney’s lawsuit against Dish over Sling TV’s Sling Passes (which include day, weekend and one-week plans), alleging they violated the terms of the companies’ carriage deal. In November, a federal judge ruled in Dish’s favor, denying Disney’s request to block the short-term streaming plans. The judge found that Disney had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits in its breach-of-contract claims against Dish/Sling, nor did Disney demonstrate that it would suffer irreparable harm.\n\n\n\tIn its counterclaim, Dish said it “avers that it had no contractual obligation to consult” with Disney or ESPN prior to launching Sling Passes, which have been marketed as a flexible way for consumers to watch live sports without the purchase of an extended subscription. In addition, per the filing, Dish “admits that a limited number of promotional materials for Sling Passes included the phrase ‘with no subscription,’ which was inaccurate.”\n\n\tThe Dish lawsuit alleges Disney is leveraging its dominant market power to “destroy competition” and stifle innovation. Disn’s countersuit also alleges that Disney has “flagrantly” breached its own contracts. The suit claims Disney gave competitors favorable terms but refused to extend those same terms to Dish and Sling, despite “most favored nation” (MFN) clauses in its carriage agreement that legally require Disney to do so.\n\t\n\n\tReps for Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\tDish’s legal filings allege that Disney violates the Sherman Act by conditioning access to “must-have” sports programming — i.e., ESPN networks — on the purchase of certain low-value channels. According to Dish, that illegal trying forces Sling TV “to carry content customers don’t want, inflating costs and blocking affordable packaging.”\n\n\tIn addition, Dish asserts that Disney’s acquisition of Fubo (which it has merged with Hulu’s live TV business) and the introduction of the ESPN-Fox One bundle violate antitrust laws by “eliminating competition.” By buying Fubo, Disney “effectively hoards consumer-friendly sports options for itself and blocks alternative skinny bundles,” according to a Dish rep.\n\n\tFurthermore, Dish alleges that Disney is attempting to corner the “skinny sports bundle market” through the launch of the ESPN Unlimited stand-alone streaming service, as well as by acquiring Fubo and enforcing “restrictive contracts.” Through those actions, Dish’s legal filings claim, Disney is attempting to ensure it is the only provider of “flexible” sports packages, which artificially inflate consumer prices.\n\n\tDish’s countersuit is seeking unspecific monetary damages; a judgment that Disney and ESPN’s actions violate U.S. antitrust laws; and an injunction to force the “unwinding” of Disney’s acquisition of Fubo and the ESPN-Fox One bundle.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tThe actors are perched on red stools at the dark mahogany bar in a 1920s-themed restaurant in Cardiff, Wales. Marisa Abela and Myha’la — who star in HBO’s steamy, propulsive finance drama “Industry” — are filming a key scene for the show’s upcoming season in which their characters, Yasmin Kara-Hanani and Harper Stern, are having an uncharacteristic heart-to-heart. While barely touching the Negronis in front of them (it’s actually watery tea, so it’s understandable), the frenemies are almost competing to reveal their own deep, painful vulnerabilities. At one point, after telling Harper how “fucking jealous” she is of her — and for the first time in five or six takes of this scene — Yasmin starts to cry.\n\n\tThe tears are not in the script, but for creators, writers, showrunners and, now, directors Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, sitting behind monitors about 10 feet away, it’s just the emotional ad-lib they were looking for. Kay vigorously fist-pumps the air while Down, sporting a blue “Industry Writers Room” cap, jabs enthusiastically at the screen. “That’s it — that’s the shot,” he eagerly whispers to Down, his close friend since they met at Oxford University almost 20 years ago. “Cut! Beautiful!”\n\n\tFor all the sex, drugs, widespread debauchery and unintelligible financial jargon that has defined “Industry” since it launched in late 2020, it’s the twisty-turny, sometimes-supportive, sometimes-backstabbing dynamic between damaged British heiress Yasmin and ruthless American overachiever Harper that has become the show’s central axis. The two — who Abela likens to “siblings in how they get away with saying so much to one another” — are the sole survivors from the five fresh-faced would-be traders who arrived at fictitious bank Pierpoint & Co. in Season 1. Their diverging journeys since have effectively reflected the growing ambition and confidence of “Industry” itself.\n\n\tIn the explosive Season 3 finale, which aired in September 2024, Yasmin opted for supposed stability, choosing a privileged life of grouse hunts and tweed jodhpurs on the vast country estate of aristocratic posho and failed entrepreneur Henry Muck (Kit Harington). Harper, meanwhile, agreed to become the Gen Z successor to a shadowy old money head of a bearish investment fund. Their arcs would appear to have been completed, as had Pierpoint’s. Its trading floor — the setting for most of the hostile financial bedlam — was last seen smothered in tarpaulin while awaiting closure after the bank was acquired by an Egyptian sovereign wealth fund. It looked like the perfect series closure for “Industry.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“I could think of five different reasons why Yasmin and Harper should never speak to each other again — I would never talk to this bitch if it was me in real life!,” says Myha’la.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“Writing yourself out of a corner is a great creative challenge,” Down says with a smile, speaking earlier in the day over coffee at a Cardiff restaurant. Adds Kay: “But there’s no corner you can’t write yourself out of, especially in our world, because it’s mine and his brainchild.”\n\n\n\tFor Myha’la, even though the last episode of Season 3 was “written as though it was the end,” she always thought they’d be coming back. “I’m sure the second they finished that finale, they were like, ‘What else can I write?,” she says. “Just for the sheer joy of competing with themselves, and because they love to make art — they love the challenge.”\n\t\n\n\tAs brazenly highlighted by Season 4 (which premieres on Jan. 11 in HBO’s vaunted Sunday, 9 p.m., time slot), Down and Kay’s solution to cornering themselves so exquisitely has been to blow everything up and throw the pieces back together again. But this time without the constraints of Pierpoint’s walls.\n\n\n\t“In a way, that creative freedom has been amazing,” Kay says. “We were writing about one world, and at the edges of that world were other worlds, like media and politics. With Season 4, we were like, now we don’t have a trading floor, we can actually just go into those spaces.”\n\t\n\n\tFrom those spaces have emerged new characters (Max Minghella, Kiernan Shipka and Charlie Heaton are among the additions), all very “Industry” in being deeply troubled, unlikable and compelling. There’s a new company at the show’s center in Tender, a fintech startup looking to buy and bully its way into monopolistic dominance. Opportunistic politicians and investigative reporters swing by, as do fascist dynasties and some sinister Jeffrey Epstein undertones. Even the sex and drugs have been turned up a notch, this time with a bleaker, more manipulative edge (but not always: Henry snorting a line off a harpsichord in his manor as a group of kids on a school trip walks by is one of many comedic moments).\n\n\tSeason 4 also throws wholly new genres into the mix, with one particularly dark episode Kay describes as a “neo-Gothic period drama in a big house.”\n\n\tIn a show all about risk-taking and its (mostly destructive) consequences, both admit that making such a detour from its origins is itself a high-stakes gamble.\n\n\t“But I honestly think there’s no point in doing anything if you’re not going to take a risk,” says Down. “I’m sure some people will be like, ‘What the fuck are they doing? It’s supposed to be set in a bank!’ But this show is whatever the fuck we want it to be.”\n\n\n\t“Industry” was always destined to be the “little engine that could,” says Jane Tranter, an executive producer and co-founder of Bad Wolf, the production company and physical studio in South Wales where the show has mostly shot (as have, among other things, “His Dark Materials” and “Doctor Who”). A former senior BBC exec, Tranter was already thinking about a drama set in the world of finance when, in late 2015, just after she returned to the U.K. from a stint in L.A., HBO’s Casey Bloys, now the company’s CEO, approached her about doing a series.\n\n\t“I was absolutely fascinated as to why, after the crash of 2008, when the banks and everything they’d been doing were exposed, young people — who were meant to be the generation thinking differently about the world — were still going in their droves to work in the city,” she says. Struck by the real-life tragedy of an intern who died of exhaustion (a story that wound up being in the very first episode), Tranter realized the way in would be these entry-level recruits. As it happened, a colleague had just met budding scribes Down and Kay about a different project, and they’d mentioned they’d both previously worked in banks. Tranter persuaded them to start writing. But there was one minor hitch: They’d never written for a network.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“HBO originally promoted this as ‘Two ex-bankers have written a show about finance and it’s going to blow the lid off the industry,’ not knowing that we’d spent our time sat behind desks with no power for a year,” says Konrad Kay (left). \n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe first script they based on their own miserable experiences on banking’s lowest rungs. It was, as Kay freely says now, “really dour” and “glacially slow,” prompting Bloys to ask whether they’d actually “had any fun when you were in this job?” They started again, this time trying to bottle some of the “anticipatory energy” they had going into the workplace for the first time. There was still a lengthy process of endless rewrites — that first episode would go through roughly 60 iterations — and what Down describes as “three years of development hell.” As it happens, “Industry” getting the eventual green light was one of the final acts of HBO boss Richard Plepler before he exited in February 2019.\n\n\tWith the BBC on board as a co-producer, the first season started shooting that summer, boasting a lead cast of first-timers practically as new to TV as the show’s creators.\n\n\tAlongside Abela and the now mononymic Myha’la were Harry Lawtey, David Jonsson and Nabhaan Rizwan (all now names very much in the ascendancy — and in the case of Jonsson, a BAFTA rising star winner). The only recognizable actor was “Lost” alumni Ken Leung, playing the fiery baseball bat-swinging Pierpoint vet Eric Tao. Lena Dunham directed the pilot episode and warned Leung that he’d probably have to play mentor. “She was like, they’re just out of drama school — they might be looking at you in a certain way, so be prepared,” Leung says. They didn’t need any help. “They are incredible actors, as you can see from the get-go.”\n\n\tBut Season 1 was not a hit. Despite solid reviews praising its fast pace style and the performances and numerous column inches dedicated to the raucous levels of nihilistic behavior on display (“Millennium Mad Men,” claimed one headline), ratings were fractional. While the show developed a passionate, if tiny, audience, “we had to really push to get a second season and had to really push again to get a third,” says Tranter. (She also notes that, at around $2 million an episode, “Industry” was cheap to make, at least by HBO standards.)\n\n\tIt was Season 3, the one that wrapped the story up in a bow (almost), that would become “Industry”’s breakout. Sensing it might be their last, Down and Kay went for it. “We said to each other, let’s just swing as hard as we can for the fences and if it blows up, who cares?” recalls Kay. But audiences and critics alike loved the swing (which included, amid a kaleidoscope of depraved mayhem, disastrous IPOs, a brawl in a kids’ soft play area, abusive billionaire parents and two sudden deaths — one shockingly violent). \n\n\tOne of the show’s side characters, the foulmouthed and near-comically amoral Pierpoint VP Rishi Ramdani (Sagar Radia), was even given his own episode, a high-intensity coke-addled descent into chaos as he tries to recoup spiraling gambling debts. The Safdie brothers — and Down and Kay’s love for “Uncut Gems” — can take credit for inspiring that one.\n\n\tThankfully, with HBO having promoted “Industry” from a Monday slot to Sunday, more people watched Season 3 than ever. The premiere debuted with a live audience of 300,000 and would surpass 1.6 million with delayed viewing. Season 4 was by far the quickest green light in the show’s history. HBO’s VP of drama programming, Cela Sutton, says the network realized it now “had a hit on our hands” and knew the drill. “We were excited to renew it as quickly as possible.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“I love the way they get away with those names,” says Kit Harington, who joined “Industry” in Season 3 as spoiled aristocrat and entrepreneur Henry Muck alongside fellow show newcomer Miriam Petche, playing Pierpoint intern Sweetpea Golightly. Both have much bigger roles in Season 4.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhile the scope of “Industry” has grown with each renewal, the confidence of the team putting it together has evolved with it. Down and Kay, showrunners since the start, marked their directorial debuts with the final two episodes of Season 3, but have helmed four of eight episodes in Season 4 (including the one they admit is the “most out there”).\n\n\tWhen cinematographer Federico Cesca joined “Industry” in Season 2, he was almost entirely shooting on shoulders, the camera effectively behaving as it was were a character in itself. “It was unpredictable and with plenty of agency to look away from people and find something else,” he says. But alongside Down and Kay, the Europe-based Argentine has broadened the show’s cinematic language, often with inspiration from their favorite directors and films. In Season 3, there’s a flashback sequence during an ayahuasca trip that Cesca describes as “almost Kubrickian,” and another (perhaps actually Kubrickian) scene he bills as “‘Barry Lyndon’ meets ‘A Clockwork Orange.’” In Season 4, he says there are notes of “Magnolia” and “The Brutalist,” plus — in keeping with the financial-thriller themes — “Michael Clayton” and “Margin Call.”\n\n\tCasting, too, has graduated. Landing “Game of Thrones” star Harington for Season 3 was a serious statement of intent — the show’s first major signing. But it was helped by the fact that he was already a fan. “Mickey and Konrad are quite disparaging about their first season, but I don’t feel that at all,” says the actor. “For me, it stood out as a piece of TV that was unlike any any other and they’d written characters that were fully realized and rich.” \n\n\tAnother Season 3 arrival was newcomer Miriam Petche, playing Pierpoint intern Sweetpea Golightly, a name she admits thinking was “insane” at first — “I thought it was a ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s” reference” — but is now its “fiercest defender.” \n\n\tBut the “Industry” additions last time around are nothing compared to the latest offering. Alongside Minghella (“The Handmaid’s Tale”), Shipka (“Mad Men”) and Heaton (“Stranger Things”), “Ted Lasso” breakout Toheeb Jimoh joins the ensemble in a sizable role, while Kal Penn appears early on.\n\t\n\n\tCasting director Julie Harkin had worked with Minghella on his 2018 directorial debut, “Teen Spirit,” and says she “chuckled to myself” when she read the role of Whitney Halberstram, the self-assured co-founder of Tender and a man whose snake-oil-salesman qualities — and some considerably shadier elements — slowly rise to the surface. “Max is playful and subtle and has all the dexterity to go to the different places Whitney needs to go — and he’s kind of fearless as well,” she says. Unlike Harington, Minghella hadn’t watch much “Industry” when he signed up, but says it was “massively, massively popular” in his social circle — “my friends are sort of religious about the show, which was terrifying to me.”\n\n\tFor the character Haley Clay, a doting assistant with more than a provocative edge (and a backstory that emerges later in the season), Harkin says she turned to Shipka because there was “something so incredibly interesting in bringing her a role that goes completely against what audiences have seen her in.” Indeed, anyone who last watched her play Don Draper’s little daughter may well be shocked by where “Industry” takes her (the most recent trailer gives much away). \n\n\tThanks to the show’s growing status, Harkin says they not only landed all the top casting choices, but she’s now fielding regular pitches from agents eager to get their clients on board.\n\n\t“You get the U.K. agents ringing you all day, and then as soon as teatime hits, it’s the U.S. It’s hard to keep up with it,” she says. “But yeah, we’ve had a lot of incoming for the show.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t“Whitney is an enigma to everybody, including myself,” says Max Minghella of fintech startup CEO and Season 4 addition Whitney Halberstram. “We continue to figure him out, even after we finished shooting, and figure out where the truth lies, what’s authentic and what’s manipulation. I feel like the lines are so blurred with this character — so much of his desire is tied to some kind of business or strategic warfare.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEven the music — credited by many to be a core element of the “Industry” DNA — has benefited from the rising popularity. Music supervisor Oliver White, a friend of Down and Kay’s for years, says that in Season 4 they’ve been able to license tracks from top artists that were previously unavailable. “A lot of them have seen the show and have been fans,” he says. Among them is Daft Punk, whose baroque-inspired disco track “Veridis Quo” plays over a nightclub scene with Harper and Yasmin. (White also recalls how the Donna Summer estate was so enthused by how the show deployed “State of Independence” in a Season 2 episode that they sent a note saying it was “one of the best uses they’d seen for the song.”)\n\n\tBut licensed tracks play second fiddle to the “Industry” score, which is littered with the show’s now near-iconic euphoric and floaty electro, composed by the Berlin-based Canadian Nathan Micay (hired largely because so many of his tracks found their way onto an early Spotify playlist White put together with Down and Kay). Micay’s ability to, as White says, “make the trading floor sound like a dance floor,” meant there were few notes from the showrunners at first, but now he says they’re coming through with suggestions.\n\n\t“On the last season, the common note I’d get would be ‘Make this sick,’ and on Season 4 it’s been ‘Make me touch God,’” he says. And how does one touch God with the score? “With them at this point I know it just means: Channel the movie ‘Heat.’ Just channel all of ‘Heat’ into a 30-second TV cue.”\n\n\tWith a three-year exclusive TV deal Down and Kay signed with HBO only 12 months old, it feels like a safe investment — even in the volatile entertainment market — to bet on them coming back for “Industry” Season 5. Kay admits they have an “ending in sight,” and are “starting to write towards the bull’s-eye.”But where in the upper echelons of wealth and power they take their hedonistic adventure to reach this conclusion is anyone’s guess — even theirs.\n\n\t“We don’t know what the fuck is going to happen. We’re constantly making it up as we go along,” says Down. “We never had a big thesis statement about the world or capitalism; we just write what we think is interesting at the time. And that sometimes manifests in weird fucking things.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Marty Supreme” and “Bugonia” are among the nominees for the 2026 Set Decorators Society of America Awards.\n\n\tThe awards celebrate excellence in the art of set decoration for film with the decor and design categories.\n\n\t“One Battle After Another,” “Sinners,” “Wicked: For Good” and “Frankenstein” are also among those nominated. \n\n\n\tWith “Marty Supreme,” production designer Jack Fisk, who has yet to win an Academy Award, worked closely with director Josh Safdie to envision some of the film’s biggest set pieces, including the table tennis parlor Marty Mauser frequents that is based on Lawrence’s Broadway Table Tennis Club.\n\t\n\n\t“Bugonia’s” James Price knew he had to create contrasting spaces: Michelle’s corporate world, her ultra-modern home, and Teddy and Don’s time-trapped house that felt old and rancid. At the same time, in creating those spaces, he knew he could hide all the clues that spoke to the characters and their respective storylines in plain sight.\n\n\tWith “Sinners,” Hannah Beachler ended up building a deeply researched, meticulously crafted the world, filled with cultural references and Easter eggs. But the film is more than a vampire movie — it spoke to folklore, spirituality, history and culture.\n\n\tLast year’s oscar winner Nathan Crowley (“Wicked”) found ways to expand the world in its conclusion, “For Good.” Among those new sets were Glinda’s apartment, the floating castle Kiamo Ko and Elphaba’s forest hideaway.\n\n\tWhen Guillermo del Toro called on production designer Tamara Deverell to work on “Frankenstein,” one thing was clear: there would be no green screen; everything would be handmade from scratch. “We had 20 sculptors at any given moment working,” Deverell says.\n\t\n\n\tThe SDSA awards will be handed out on Feb. 21 in Los Angeles.\n\n\tThe full list of nominations are below.\n\n\tBest Achievement in Décor/Design of a Contemporary Feature Film“BUGONIA”Set Decoration by Prue HowardProduction Design by James Price“F1”Set Decoration by Andrew McCarthy SDSA & Véronique MeleryProduction Design by Mark Tildesley & Ben Munro“JAY KELLY”Set Decoration by Véronique Melery & Meg EveristProduction Design by Mark Tildesley“ONE BATTLE AFTER ANOTHER”Set Decoration by Anthony Carlino SDSAProduction Design by Florencia Martin“WAKE UP DEAD MAN: A KNIVES OUT MYSTERY”Set Decoration by Kathryn PyleProduction Design by Rick Heinrichs\n\n\tBest Achievement in Décor/Design of a Period Feature Film“DOWNTON ABBEY: THE GRAND FINALE”Set Decoration by Linda WilsonProduction Design by Donal Woods“HAMNET”Set Decoration by Alice Felton SDSAProduction Design by Fiona Crombie“MARTY SUPREME”Set Decoration by Adam WillisProduction Design by Jack Fisk“SINNERS”Set Decoration by Monique Champagne SDSAProduction Design by Hannah Beachler“SPRINGSTEEN: DELIVER ME FROM NOWHERE”Set Decoration by Kris MoranProduction Design by Stefania Cella\n\n\tBest Achievement in Décor/Design of a Fantasy or Science Fiction Feature Film“AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH”Set Decoration by Vanessa ColeProduction Design by Dylan Cole & Ben Procter“THE FANTASTIC FOUR: FIRST STEPS”Set Decoration by Jille AzisProduction Design by Kasra Farahani“FRANKENSTEIN”Set Decoration by Shane Vieau SDSAProduction Design by Tamara Deverell“HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON”Set Decoration by Daniel Birt SDSAProduction Design by Dominic Watkins“SUPERMAN”Set Decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg SDSAProduction Design by Beth MickleBest Achievement in Décor/Design of a Comedy or Musical Feature Film“FREAKIER FRIDAY”Set Decoration by Brandi Kalish SDSAProduction Design by Kay Anna Lee“KISS OF THE SPIDERWOMAN”Set Decoration by Andrew Baseman SDSAProduction Design by Scott Chambliss“THE PHOENICIAN SCHEME”Set Decoration by Anna PinnockProduction Design by Adam Stockhausen“ROOFMAN”Set Decoration by Kendall Anderson SDSAProduction Design by Inbal Weinberg“WICKED: FOR GOOD”Set Decoration by Lee SandalesProduction Design by Nathan Crowley\n",

    "body": "\n\tEvangeline Lilly revealed on social media that she has brain damage after suffering a concussion last year when she fell into a boulder. The “Lost” and “Ant-Man” star said that “almost every area in my brain is functioning at a decreased capacity.”\n\n\t“I’m entering into this new year, the Year of the Horse, with some bad news about my concussion,” the Marvel actor said in an Instagram video. “A lot of you asked how I’m doing. A lot of you have inquired about the brain scans that you heard I got. And the results came back from the scans [and] showed that almost every area in my brain is functioning at a decreased capacity.”\n\t\n\n\t“But now my job is to get to the bottom of that with doctors and then embark on the hard work of fixing it, which I don’t look forward to because I feel like hard work is all I do,” Lilly added. “But that’s okay. My cognitive decline since I smashed my face open has helped me to slow down and helped me to have a more restful finish to my 2025.”\n\n\n\tLilly wrote in the caption to her post: “Verdict’s in… I do have brain damage from my [traumatic brain injury]. Comforting to know my cognitive decline isn’t just peri-menopause, discomforting to know what an uphill battle it will be to try to reverse the deficiencies. Thank you all for always asking, for always caring, and for your continued prayers.”\n\n\tLilly starred as Kate Bishop on all six seasons of “Lost,” which ran from 2004 to 2010. Her performance earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for best actress in a drama series. She’s also well known for playing Hope van Dyne/Wasp in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, debuting as the character in 2015’s “Ant-Man” and reprising her in 2018’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame,” and 2023’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Lilly also played Tauriel in Peter Jackson’s “The Hobbit” trilogy, appearing in the latter two films “The Desolation of Smaug” and “The Battle of the Five Armies.”\n\t\n\n\tIn a social media post last June, Lilly revealed she was stepping away from acting for the foreseeable future and wrote: “Stepping away from what seems like the obvious choice (wealth and fame) can feel scary at times, but stepping into your dharma replaces the fear with fulfillment. I might return to Hollywood one day, but, for now, this is where I belong.”\n\n\tLilly added in a statement to Variety at the time: “I have actually been on a hiatus from acting for the past three years already (since finishing work on ‘Quantumania’). This time outside of the business has brought me a grounding sense of fulfillment and joy. I could return tomorrow, two years from now or never, but at the moment I am not actively pursuing any work in the industry and am not under any contractual obligations to anybody. I am devoting my time to my humanitarian work and my writing.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen “The Pitt” premiered on HBO Max almost exactly a year ago, it was an unflashy medical drama without the boost of preexisting IP (though the Michael Crichton estate, which claims the project is an unauthorized reboot of “ER,” would disagree) or major stars. The show returns for Season 2 a conquering hero, the incumbent winner of the Emmy for outstanding drama series along with a quartet of additional trophies. The awards only cemented a rapturous celebration of “The Pitt” as a return to TV classicism amid the streaming revolution’s upheavals: a 15-episode season, a weekly release and a cast of largely unknowns catapulted to fame by sheer collective chemistry. Katherine LaNasa, Shawn Hatosy and Isa Briones — to name just three standouts from a massive and uniformly excellent cast, with LaNasa and Hatosy Emmy winners alongside star and executive producer Noah Wyle — may not be household names, but they’re now beloved by millions for bringing their characters to beleaguered, adrenalized life over a single shift in a fictionalized emergency room.\n\t\n\n\tYou wouldn’t know any of this from Season 2, though not because the show takes some steep decline in quality. Quite the opposite, in fact: Under the steady leadership of Wyle, creator R. Scott Gemmill and producing director John Wells, “The Pitt” drops us right back into the fray of Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center, where each season unfolds hour by hour in close to real time. For the doctors, nurses, social workers and EMTs who make up the staff, it’s just another day at work, which means “The Pitt” doesn’t need to generate new storylines from whole cloth to explain its continued existence. Nor do the unglamorous environs of an overcrowded hospital facilitate a “Stranger Things”-like boost in production value that might wink at the show’s real-world acclaim.\n\t\n\n\tChanges to the status quo of “The Pitt” are subtle, but they’re apparent to an audience deeply attuned to its workplace dynamics. Wyle’s attending physician Michael “Robby” Rabinovich comes into work on the Fourth of July via motorcycle, a new hobby his colleagues roundly mock him for with good-natured ribbing about midlife crisis. They’d be more harsh if they knew he was lying to them about wearing a helmet, a perfect and passing detail that tells us all we need to know about Robby’s mental state almost a year after the mass shooting at a music festival that spurred the climax of Season 1. (There’s now a memorial plaque in the lobby.) The Fourth is set to be Robby’s final shift before a three-month sabbatical, and the laws of television dictate it can’t be an easy one.\n\n\tRobby isn’t the only ER staffer at a crossroads. Dr. Frank Langdon (Patrick Ball) is back after a forced hiatus to treat a prescription-pill addiction that emerged in highly dramatic fashion last season, and you could cut the tension between him and now-estranged mentor Robby with a scalpel. Dr. Samira Mohan (Supriya Ganesh) is contemplating her personal and professional future at the end of her residency. Once a neophyte student doctor, Dennis Whitaker (Gerran Howell) is now training new pupils himself. Those med students, cocky know-it-all Ogilvy (Lucas Iverson) and acerbic, perceptive Joy (Irene Choi), are drops in a flood of new faces that mark one of the few ways a show set in a single place can meaningfully scale up. Robby clashes with his soon-to-be-replacement, tech evangelist Dr. Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi); case manager Noelle (Meta Golding) consults on how to navigate the labyrinth of Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance; psychiatrist Caleb (Christopher Thornton) sees to patients’ mental health as best he can in an emergency context.\n\n\tThis being “The Pitt,” however, health care providers and the relationships among them exist only in the context of the people they treat. Just as Noelle and Caleb act as windows into facets of a dysfunctional, patchwork system “The Pitt” didn’t address as directly in Season 1, the cases in Season 2 continue to highlight social issues that inevitably arise from a cross-section of humanity at their lowest moments. A proudly progressive show that serves as a counterpoint to our archconservative political moment, “The Pitt” addresses ICE deportations, fatphobia in medicine, palliative care for terminal cancer, homelessness, the pitfalls of generative AI and the need for ASL interpreters to assist unhearing patients in its new episodes. (Both seasons of “The Pitt” will be available to stream in ASL.) Comic relief is interspersed via drunken injuries and Viagra mishaps, but “The Pitt” remains unabashed in its earnest social consciousness. There’s also a palpable push to up the Pittsburgh-specific material that honors the real place outside the hospital doors, from somber reminders of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting to lighthearted traditions like an annual furry convention.\n\t\n\n\tSuch a wellspring of material is seemingly inexhaustible, though the show strains a bit when working to match the festival shooting as a crucible that pushes its cast to the breaking point. (All the old “24” jokes about how many terrible days Jack Bauer can have still apply.) “The Pitt” instead thrives in quieter moments, especially as the actors ever so slightly modulate their performances to reflect the evolution of their characters. Typically calm Robby is notably snippier and in need of his impending break; veteran charge nurse Dana (LaNasa) is less tolerant of disruption after she was assaulted by a patient in Season 1. Trinity Santos (Briones) hasn’t lost her abrasive edge, but a year of residency has given her real confidence instead of forced bravado. “The Pitt” doesn’t need to show us the months of grind that produced these changes, only their cumulative effect — an act of trust in both the performers and the audience that makes reciprocating easy. It feels good to put oneself back in “The Pitt”’s capable hands.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmazon is rolling out the biggest update to its Fire TV user interface in years — designed to help you find something to watch even faster.\n\n\tThe new UI will start rolling out in February, initially in the U.S. on the most recent Fire TV devices, and Amazon will be demo’ing it at 2026 CES in Las Vegas this week. Along with the UI redesign, the company is prepping the release of a new Fire TV mobile app that adds content discovery and management tools, and it’s introducing our first-ever lifestyle TV, the Amazon Ember Artline.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to Joshua Danovitz, Amazon’s VP of Fire TV, the new UI is overall more “modern” — cleaner, faster and better organized. The interface displays movies, TV shows, sports, news and live content across all your subscriptions, so that when you browse the UI you will see titles and programming from all the apps you use.\n\n\n\tThe new Fire TV UI features rounded corners, redesigned color gradients, updated typography and more optimized spacing. Beyond the aesthetics, the underlying code was rebuilt to make the experience faster: Danovitz said in some cases the new UI is up to 30% faster.\n\n\tThe redesign also increases the number of apps users can pin to the Fire TV home screen, from six to 20. The Menu button on the Fire TV remote lets you access Games, Art & Photos, and the Ambient Experience with a few clicks. There’s also a shortcut panel on the right rail you can access by long-pressing the Home button on the remote, to let you add shortcuts the controls including audio and display settings and smart-home device management.\n\t\n\n\tFire TV will continue to include Alexa+, Amazon’s generative AI-powered agent, to let you ask to watch something based on the mood you’re in, who you’re with, or actors or directors you like. Alexa on Fire TV also recently added to ability for you to ask to jump straight to a specific movie scene.\n\n\tThe new Fire TV UI will launch starting in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd generation), and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series in the U.S. Later this spring, Amazon plans to expand the new UI design to more countries and more devices, including the latest-generation Fire TV 4K streaming media players and TVs including the Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV Omni QLED Series as well as TVs from partners like Hisense, Insignia, Panasonic and TCL.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUpdated Fire TV mobile app\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAlso launching in February is a redesigned Fire TV mobile app — which until now has essentially functioned as a backup remote control.\n\n\tThe redesigned Fire TV mobile app (which will be available as a free download) adds the ability to browse content, manage your watchlist, and play titles on your TV, with a look and feel that matches the new Fire TV design, according to Danovitz. Now Fire TV customers can use their phone as a second screen to discover what to watch next or add a friend’s show recommendation to your watchlist when you’re away from home.\n\n\tAlso at CES, Amazon will show off its first lifestyle TV, under the new brand name Amazon Ember. The Amazon Ember Artline is a 4K QLED TV designed to be hung on the wall like a piece of artwork.\n\n\tThe Amazon Ember Artline is the company’s thinnest TV to date, measuring just 1.5 inches deep, and will be available 10 different frame colors (walnut, ash, teak, black oak, matte white, midnight blue, fig, pale gold, graphite and silver). The TVs have a matte screen (to reduce glare) and will be available in 55- or 65-inch screen sizes, priced starting at $899. It’s scheduled to go on sale this spring in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and the U.K. \n\n\tAs with its previous-generation TVs, the Amazon Ember Artline comes with far-field microphones to support Alexa+ and includes its Omnisense technology that automatically turns the ambient experience on and off when people enter or leave the room. The Ember Artline is integrated with Amazon Photos and offers more than 2,000 pieces of free art. It also has an AI-powered feature that lets you take up to four photos of the room where you plan to hang the TV and get personalized recommendations on the best artworks to show on-screen to match the décor.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Amazon Ember Artline QLED TV\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters” and Pixar’s “Elio” lead the 53rd Annie Awards for animation with 10 nominations each. \n\n\tBoth are nominated for best feature, alongside “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain,” “The Bad Guys 2” and “Zootopia 2.” All of the above were also nominated in the Best Character Animation – Feature category.\n\n\tThe writers behind “Elio,” “KPop Demon Hunters” (editorial team), “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain,” “Scarlet” and “Zootopia 2” were also recognized.\n\t\n\n\tOn the TV side, Pixar’s “Win or Lose” scored six nominations, including Best TV/Media – Limited Series, and Nickelodeon’s “Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” landed three noms.\n\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” has become a massive phenomenon on Netflix. Co-director Maggie Kang was committed to grounding the story in authenticity and presenting Korean culture in a bold, fresh way. Creating Korean female lead characters was particularly meaningful for Kang, who worked to make them “both appealing and aspirational and unique, but most importantly, Korean.”\n\n\tDisney Pixar’s “Elio” centers on a young orphan boy who is desperate to be abducted by aliens. Directors Domee Shi (“Turning Red”) and Madeline Sharafian (“Burrow”) used classic sci-fi movies, including 1977’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” as inspiration. “We reference that movie a lot because it’s also about a guy who’s in love with space,” says Shi.\n\n\tDreamWorks Animation’s “The Bad Guys 2” scored five nominations. Director Pierre Perifel wanted to go bigger with the film’s sequel, embracing and expanding on the heist genre. So, he crafted a globetrotting adventure and fun action comedy. For the cold open, Perifel was inspired by the likes of James Bond and “Mission Impossible” films, he told Variety. “It also sets up that we are an international movie now, and it’s a big adventure that ends up in space. It was really about playing with the tropes as much as we could, exploiting them, and giving it our own little twist.”\n\t\n\n\tAs far as being a precursor for the Oscars animated feature race, last year’s best independent feature winner, “Flow,” went on to win best animated feature.\n\n\tThe 53rd Annual Annie Awards are set for Saturday, Feb. 21.

    "body": "\n\tDionne Warwick, Saweetie and Mya have joined forces to record a new version of the Diane Warren-penned song “One Heart (Can Change The World)” as title song from the forthcoming film, “OZi: Voice of the Forest,” both of which are intended to raise awareness of the dangers of climate change, focusing on last year’s Los Angeles wildfires. The song was produced by Grammy-winner Damon Elliott and the film by Mike Medavoy, in conjunction with Leonard DiCaprio’s Appian Way Productions and GCI Film. Elliott and Warren both lost their homes in the fires last January. This music will be released in the spring.\n\t\n\n\t“OZi: Voice of the Forest” is a family film that focuses on the story of an orangutan who is separated from her parents. OZi grows up in an animal sanctuary and uses her influencer skills to save her parents and forest home from deforestation. The film aims to raise awareness around the issues faced by rainforests due to the growing levels of deforestation, and how this affects ecosystems and climate change.\n\n\n\tThe film features the voices of Laura Dern, Amandla Stenberg, Donald Sutherland, Djimon Hounsou, RuPaul Charles, Dean Charles Chapman and Urzila Carlson.\n\n\t“I am honored to have produced this song, and have it support this cause, as I was personally affected by these tragic fires a year ago,” Elliott says. “I lost my home and literally everything in it. ‘Ozi’ definitely tugs at my heartstring as it deals with fires caused by climate change.”\n\n\t“Warren says, “I was inspired to write the song by watching the movie which so beautifully illustrates that Ozi and all of us, with our one heart, can truly change the world.”\n\t\n\n\tMedavoy adds, “We are proud to support this initiative. The story of Ozi has such strong links with the LA fires, homes being lost due to fire all driven by climate change.”\n\n\tThe proceeds from the sales of the music and film will be donated to the charities International Animal Rescue and Sumatran Orangutan.\n",

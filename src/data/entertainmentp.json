    "body": "\n\tFormer “Grey’s Anatomy” star Eric Dane died on Feb. 19, one week ago — and in Thurday’s episode of the long-running ABC drama, the show paid tribute to him and to his character, Dr. Mark Sloan, in a video at the end of the episode. The 65-second-long McSteamy montage was set to Tommee Profitt & Fleuries’ cover of Snow Patrol’s “Chasing Cars,” a song that was made iconic after being used in the show’s Season 2 finale when Denny (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) died and Izzie (Katherine Heigl) wouldn’t let go of him. Different versions of “Chasing Cars” have been used on “Grey’s” and in its promos ever since to great effect, always to underscore an emotional event. (The full video is below.)\n\t\n\n\tDane joined the cast of “Grey’s Anatomy” in Season 2, playing a plastic surgeon and a ladies’ man — Mark, nicknamed McSteamy, was the best friend of Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) whose affair with Derek’s wife Addison (Kate Walsh) had broken up that marriage. Mark Sloan proved to be a popular character, and Dane became a series regular in Season 3. He died during Season 8, after a bunch of the hospital’s doctors were in a plane crash. Nevertheless, Dane appeared in a few more times on the show, including with Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) in Season 19 when she was in a hallucinatory state from COVID, and characters who had died on the show visited her.\n\n\tDane was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2025; despite his terminal illness, he played an ALS patient on NBC’s “Brilliant Minds” in the fall, and completed filming Season 3 of “Euphoria,” on which he played Cal Jacobs. “Euphoria” will premiere on HBO on April 12.\n\t\n\n\tDane’s death prompted an outpouring of grief from his colleagues at “Grey’s Anatomy,” from creator Shonda Rhimes to Heigl to Walsh and beyond, all of whom wrote loving tributes to him on social media.\n\n\tThe video, with “Chasing Cars” playing, begins with Mark’s earliest appearances, when he referred to himself and Meredith as the “dirty mistresses” through his becoming a father. Mark’s advice to Jackson (Jesse Williams) from his deathbed plays over a montage: “If you love someone, you tell ’em, even if you’re scared that it’s not the right thing. Even if you’re scared that it will burn your life to the ground, you say it. You say it loud.”\n\n\tWatch the “Grey’s Anatomy” tribute to Eric Dane below.\n",

    "body": "\n\tRob Bonta, California’s Attorney General, is promising to conduct a “vigorous” review of Paramount Skydance’s acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery as he warned the companies not to get ahead of the regulatory process in their celebrations.\n\n\t“Paramount/Warner Bros is not a done deal. These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,” Bonta said in a statement issued Thursday evening. \n\t\n\n\tBonta’s missive came at the end of a day of extraordinary twists and turns that have put Paramount Skydance in position to buy up Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. After raising its bid price by $1 a share, WBD board members had little choice but to accept that offer. Netflix, which had previousy sealed a sale agreement with WBD in December, had the right to match. But Netflix cut bait early, issuing a statement saying that the deal was “no longer financially attractive” with the price tag growing.\n\n\n\tBonta had already put Netflix and WBD on notice that the Golden State would take a hard look at the consolidation of a legacy Hollywood studio with the industry’s dominant subscription streaming platform.  Bonta’s move from the deep-blue state of California adds to the political backdrop swirling around big business, particularly Big Media at a time when President Trump himself regularly bashes mainstream entertainment and news outlets.\n\n\tOn Tuesday, before Netflix pulled out of the hunt for WBD, a coalition of 11 state attorneys general — all Republicans — urged the Department of Justice to carefully scrutinize the Netflix-Warners deal. In a letter, the attorneys general warned that the deal “will likely result in undue market concentration that stifles competition and therefore creates higher prices, lower reliability, and less innovation.”\n\t\n\n\tThey also expressed concerns that streaming subscribers will face higher prices, and that the merger will be bad for the theater business. Noting that the U.S. remains the “world leader in movies,” the letter closed with a premonition: “Netflix’s quest to become ‘the one platform to rule them all’ through its acquisition of Warner Brothers threatens this dominance.”\n\n\tThe 11 attorneys general represent the following states: Alabama, Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains major plot details for Thursday’s episode of ABC’s ”9-1-1: Nashville.”\n\n\tIt’s the moment all “9-1-1: Nashville” fans have been waiting for: the origin story of Don Hart (Chris O’Donnell), his old flame Dixie Bennings (LeAnn Rimes) and his wife Blythe Hart (Jessica Capshaw).\n\n\tTitled “Don Begins,” the episode flashes between the present day in Nashville with the 113 back to when Don was a young boy who suffered through the trauma of his parents and baby sister dying during an arson at their family home. That same night, little Don meets little Dixie, who happened to live down the street from him with her grandmother. Dixie and her grandmother comfort Don and stay with him at the hospital as he waits for CPS to come and his whole life to change. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDon and Dixie as young children in “9-1-1: Nashville” Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTime then skips ahead to when Don was a young adult (played by Ben Winchell) and crossed paths with Dixie (Noa Bess Solomon) once again — this time when they’re both stuck in a jail cell overnight. Once they were out and able to reconnect, their love story properly began. They moved in to a tiny apartment together, he supported her in her music career, she supported him in his firefighter training, and their life together was lovely until it started to unravel due to stress and time.\n\n\n\tDon eventually meets and falls in love with Blythe (younger version played by Hunter King) when Dixie takes off to go on tour as a backup dancer for Faith Hill and he figures out what he wants to do with the rest of his life. When Dixie returns and wants to pick things back up, it’s too late. Don and Blythe are so close that Blythe has gotten the Nashville Police Department to reopen his family’s arson case, leading to the arrest of the killer. \n\t\n\n\tThe episode ends with one more flashback, this time to the night Dixie and Don slept together — conceiving their son Blue — when he was separated from his wife Blythe.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLeAnn Rimes as Dixe in “9-1-1: Nashville” Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“It was so cool to know that this was coming and that people really got a glimpse into the origin story of Dixie and Don,” Rimes told Variety. “I think it gives you a different point of view on these characters from here on out. It changes the dynamic between Don and Dixie. I think people have seen Dixie in all of her manipulative ways. But I think that now, seeing young Dixie and the heart of her through Noa, who is just, she’s so brilliant. In this episode seeing her portray Dixie, this wild heart and just the heart of her before life got a hold of her and turned her into a more bitter kind of manipulative flair. It is so fun for me as an actress to play all these different layers of her.”\n\n\tRimes added: “I’ve seen so many people conflicted, ‘We love her, we hate her.’ It’s back and forth depending on the episode. And now I think they’re really going to be conflicted, because you really see the connection that Don and Dixie had.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBen Winchell as Young Don and Noa Bess Solomon as Young Dixie on “9-1-1: Nashville” — Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnother reason why the episode was a special one for Rimes, though she was only playing Dixie in the current timeline, was she wrote and performed a song as young Dixie called “Wild Things Run.” Solomon originally sang the song while shooting, but Rimes recorded the vocals two weeks ago to be used on top of the scene. And in order to do that, Rimes had to make some adjustments to the way she sings these days.\n\n\t“Her voice is my voice, and I had to make myself sound 20 years younger,” Rimes said. “I took all the bottom end out of my voice, and kind of just did the whole resonating through like my nasal area. And it took me back to the ‘Coyote Ugly’ days when I had to do that for Piper Perabo’s voice.”\n\n\tRimes pitched the idea of her writing a song for the show when “9-1-1: Nashville” showrunner Rashad Raisani first told her he was plotting this origin story episode for Dixie and Don.\n\n\t“I know they have so many great writers for the show, but when I heard that they were looking for a song that kicked off Dixie’s career, I was like, this is what I do,” Rimes, who co-wrote “Wild Things Run” with collaborator Darrell Brown, said. “I do write music and sing for a living. So utilize me. And I went to Rashad and said, ‘Hey, I want to take a stab at this, because I think it would be so powerful for someone who’s lived in this character to write for her.’ And he said absolutely. So he sent me the first draft of the montage scene, just to give me an idea where to jump off from. And I was laying on a massage table in Hawaii and the title ‘Wild Things Run’ came to me. And I was saying, oh, man, it’s perfect, because it felt like that was kind of these two wild hearts as youngsters running towards each other and then running away.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBen Winchell as Young Don and Hunter King as Young Blythe on “9-1-1: Nashville” — Disney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBy the end of the present-day timeline in the episode, Don is making a testimonial on behalf of the man who killed his family, offering forgiveness but not to forget. Blythe thanks Dixie for helping Don reach that moment of peace through an earlier conversation when they shared their memories of the night of the fire. But when Blythe and Dixie part, it’s with Dixie declaring once more that the “universe” will always bring her and Don back together.\n\n\tAnd Rimes says Dixie isn’t just antagonizing Blythe — she means it.\n\n\t“Oh, I think she knows that that’s very true,” Rimes said. “She thinks it’s really, constantly, from the very beginning they can’t seem to get away from each other. And she’s clearly always going to be in love with this man. And I mean, it’s her baby daddy. But it’s not just that. I think there is a real connection and a real pull and history that Blythe and Don don’t have. And I think maybe it’s the universe, and maybe it’s also Dixie always putting herself in the line of fire that, she always somewhat makes herself available to that, too. But I think there is this real connection; that she truly believes, no matter what, they’re going to be connected in some way.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBobby J. Brown, a character actor best known for his portrayal of Officer Bobby Brown on the HBO drama “The Wire,” died Tuesday after a barn fire in Maryland. He was 62.\n\n\tThe Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner told TMZ Brown died from diffuse thermal injury and smoke inhalation. His death was ruled an accident.\n\n\tAccording to family members, Brown entered a barn to jump-start a vehicle when a fire broke out. He later called a relative seeking a fire extinguisher, but by the time help arrived, the barn was already engulfed in flames. Brown’s wife suffered severe burns while attempting to rescue him.\n\t\n\n\tBrown was part of the ensemble cast of “The Wire,” the critically acclaimed series that examined policing, politics and street life in Baltimore. He later appeared in “Law & Order: SVU” and portrayed Sgt. Thomas Allers in the HBO miniseries “We Own This City.” His additional television credits included appearances on “Homicide: Life on the Street,” “The Corner” and “Veep.”\n\n\tHis screen credits extend to feature films including “Love the Hard Way,” “My One and Only” and “From Within.” He also directed documentaries about pit bulls and about Parliament Funkadelic.\n\n\tBorn in Washington, D.C., he started out as professional boxer, then turned to acting after watching Mickey Rourke film “Homeboy.”\n\n\tHis agent, Albert Bramante, told TMZ, “I am upset and saddened. He was such a good actor and person. He was totally dedicated to the craft of acting and was a joy to work with.” Family members added that Brown was a devout Jehovah’s Witness. Funeral arrangements are pending.\n\t\n\n\tBrown is survived by his wife and children.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCNN‘s Jake Tapper wound up having to break some news on Thursday’s “The Lead” that affects his own network. After a commercial break, the anchor came back on air and announced to viewers – and the crew – that Paramount Skydance had, just a few moments before, moved into position to become the presumptive new owner of CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\tTapper went on the air with a “Breaking News” banner, saying, “We have some breaking news in our national lead that affects everybody I’m looking at right now in the studio. Moments ago, Netflix said it is declining to raise its offer for the purchase of Warner Bros. Studios and HBO, following the Warner Bros. Discovery board’s determination that Paramount — which is not just going for Warner Bros. Studios and HBO, but also the whole enchilada, including us here at CNN. Paramount has submitted a ‘superior offer,’ according to Warner Bros. Discovery’s board. As I’ve noted, Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix said Thursday it would not match Paramount’s increased bid of $111 million for Warner Bros. Discovery, paving the way for Paramount Skydance to acquire the studio pending regulatory approval.\n\n\n\tTapper then asked CNN media analyst Brian Stelter to weigh in: “Ted Sarandos was at the White House for meetings today and I’m told he left the White House in a not very happy mood,” Stelter said. “But it is possible that Netflix has been given signals from the White House that the regulatory roadblocks were going to be too severe for the Netflix deal to go through.”\n\n\tParamount CEO David Ellison, who has frequently visited the White House in recent months, is said to have told the Trump administration that if his company were to acquire CNN, he would make “sweeping changes.” Meanwhile Trump said it is “imperative that CNN be sold,” as he maintains the network doesn’t treat him fairly.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the segment below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJim Carrey got the creme de la creme of French cinema on their feet at the 51st edition of France’s Cesar Awards, where he received this year’s honorary award and delivered an emotional speech entirely in French.\n\n\tCarrey, star of “The Mask” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” was honored with the award that is traditionally given to an international star, such as last year’s Julia Roberts.\n\n\n\tHe was introduced on stage by Michel Gondry, who directed him in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” 22 years ago. Carrey said in French, with a thick American accent, “As an actor, each character you play is like clay in the sculptor’s hands, which you shape to your heart’s desire. How fortunate I have been to share this art with so many people who have truly opened their hearts to me.” He then revealed that “about 300 years ago, (his) great, great, great, great, great, great-grandfather, Marc-François Carré, yes, Carré, was born in France, in Saint Malo” and emigrated to Canada. “Tonight with this magnificent honor, this square (carré in French) has come full circle,” said the actor, who attended the event with his daughter Jane, grandson Jackson and girlfriend Mina.\n\t\n\n\t“Thank you to my wonderful family, my daughter Jane, and my grandson Jackson. I love you now and forever. Thank you to my sublime companion, Mina. I love you, Mina. And finally, thank you to the funniest man I have ever known: my father. Percy Joseph Carrey who taught me the value of love, generosity, and laughter.”\n\n\n\tAt the end of his speech, he asked the audience, “So, how was my French? Almost mediocre, right? Forgive me, I didn’t speak French, but I’m just learning it. My tongue is tired.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the video below:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Writers Guild of America issued its opening salvo the 2026 studio negotiations on Thursday, even as its own staff continues to walk a picket line outside union headquarters.\n\n\tThe union is preparing to sit down with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers on March 16. In a bulletin to members on Thursday, WGA leadership offered an update on the “state of the industry,” arguing that profits are rebounding and studios can afford to make a “fair deal.”\n\t\n\n\t“Every three years during MBA negotiations, the companies will point to some part of their business that is not performing well to claim they couldn’t possibly meet writers’ needs,” the union told its members. “This cycle is no different.”\n\n\n\tThe WGA has said that negotiations will go on as usual, even if the staff remains on strike. The Writers Guild Staff Union, which represents about two-thirds of all WGA West employees, walked out on Feb. 17, alleging that WGA West leadership had failed to bargain in good faith on issues like wage scales and just cause for discipline. The union has warned that the Writers Guild Awards, scheduled for March 8, could be canceled if a deal is not reached soon.\n\n\tThe WGA has long issued state-of-the-industry reports at the beginning of an AMPTP negotiating cycle. The 2017 report touted “unprecedented prosperity”; the 2023 report argued that the fundamentals of the business remained strong despite a decline in profits.\n\n\tThe primary concern in this round of negotiations is the WGA health plan, which lost $122 million in the just two years according to its tax returns. The plan is suffering both due to a decline in contributions — owing to a downturn in employment — and an increase in health care costs.\n\t\n\n\tThe AMPTP issued a report in December highlighting the high costs of the health plans of the WGA, SAG-AFTRA and the Directors Guild of America, compared to other multi-employer plans.\n\n\t“These health plans offer top-tier benefits, including zero or low participant premiums, minimal cost-sharing, low dependent costs, comprehensive prescription coverage, and early retiree eligibility,” the studio group stated. “AMPTP Member Companies remain committed to partnering with the Guilds to ensure their health plans are properly structured and funded.”\n\n\tThe WGA contract is set to expire on May 1. The studios are expected to make a significant contribution toward the health fund as part of any deal. A key question is whether the WGA would be open to any curtailment of benefits, potentially in the form of higher premiums and deductibles.\n\n\tThe WGA report did not touch on health care.\n\n\t“As streaming continues its upward ascent, the media companies can afford to negotiate a fair deal with writers,” the union stated.\n",

    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “Bridgerton” Season 4, Part 2, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\t“Bridgerton” Season 4 ended with a wedding — as long as you didn’t stop it before that post-credits scene rolled. If you did, we will wait here for you, gentle viewer, while you go see the happily ever after ending to Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson) and Sophie Baek (Yerin Ha), who marry at their cottage estate following a season of forbidden upstairs/downstairs love.\n\n\tShonda Rhimes’ Netflix period romance has skipped a wedding before — Kate and Anthony’s in Season 2 — to focus on a different intimate moment, but in this case, “Bridgerton” Season 4 showrunner Jess Brownell explained the fairytale twist of Sophie and Benedict kissing in the gazebo where they first met at the masquerade ball, now unmasked and engaged, deserved to be the official end of their love story.\n\n\t“So the wedding was not initially a post-credits scene,” Brownell told Variety. “Well, that’s not true. In past seasons, we’ve done this thing where we fade to black and then we very quickly come up for a tag of the season. And that’s how we initially had it. But when Shonda and I got into post, we both felt like the ending of the season pre-tag was so magical and full of so much romance that it felt like we just wanted a moment to breathe and let it settle before one more romantic gift. It almost felt like a hat on a hat. But we really wanted to keep in this beautiful wedding that we shot. We also thought it would be fun for the die-hard fans who really stick around and talk about the show to get that Easter egg, and then to tell their friends who maybe didn’t stick around, and that it could create some some fun chatter.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton, Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton, Yerin Ha as Sophie Baek\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSophie and Benedict will be able to live out their lives in society together because Araminta (facing embezzlement accusations, and played by Katie Leung) has agreed to keep her mouth shut about Sophie’s illegitimate status and go along with the story that she is an extended member of her father’s noble family.\n\n\n\tElsewhere in the Season 4 finale, Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) has been allowed to retire from her role as Lady Whistledown (though someone else has mysteriously taken up the task), Alice Mondrich (Emma Naomi) is the new lady-in-waiting to the Queen (Golda Rosheuvel) and Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) is headed on a much needed vacation, Francesca (Hannah Dodd) is mourning John (Victor Alli) alone now that Michaela (Masali Baduza) has abandoned her, Violet (Ruth Gemmell)has decided to be single over marrying Marcus (Daniel Francis), Cressida (Jessica Madsen) returned to the ton and arrived at some peace with Eloise (Claudia Jessie), Kate (Simone Ashley) and Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) returned from India with their baby boy Edmund to straight everyone out, and it’s still made completely clear who will be the lead of Season 5.\n\n\tBelow, Brownell breaks down Variety‘s biggest burning questions from “Bridgerton” Season 4 and tease the next chapter of the drama based on Julia Quinn’s novels.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSimone Ashley as Kate Sharma\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWe’re gonna start where I love to start, which is with the babies. Have you see the reaction to the casting of Baby Edmund and the comparisons between that baby’s expression and Kate and Anthony’s iconic shared eyebrow scrunch?\t\n\n\tI saw the side by side of Kate’s beautiful eyes looking at Anthony with love compared to the baby. And, yeah, it’s a genius casting. They really nailed it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe honoring of Edmund, how did you all decide that’s what you were going to go with for Kate and Anthony’s first child’s name?\t\n\n\tYes, Edmund is Violet’s deceased husband. So obviously, Anthony, the firstborn boy, honoring his father makes a lot of sense.\n\t\n\t\tIt’s interesting to see so far Daphne has been the only Bridgerton sibling to honor the ABC naming convention her parents picked.\t\n\n\tYes, yes. Her story, it was the first season we were introducing that conceit — and following what Julia Quinn laid out as well.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek, Ruth Gemmell as Lady Violet Bridgerton, Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWith the closing of this chapter, how much will Benedict and Sophie be in the next season? Sophie’s just finally gotten a taste for this life and been able to come into the light and be part of all of this. Are they just going to go live in the country?\t\n\n\tThe book does this really clever thing, which is Julia Quinn puts Araminta in this position where if she doesn’t want to basically go to jail for embezzlement of Sophie’s dowry, she’s forced to agree to this lie or slight fudging of the truth that Sophie is a noble cousin. And that allows Sophie and Benedict to live in society.\n\n\tI think it was really important for us that Benedict chose Sophie before she was allowed in society. But letting Sophie save herself and give herself that win at the end was also really fun for us. So Benedict and Sophie are in society next season. I think they’re probably spending time at My Cottage when they want to, but they have the choice now to spend time in society when they’d like to, as well.\n\t\n\t\tSpeaking of Benedict making that choice before he knew Sophie could find a way to live in society — Violet made it too. She gave her blessing for him to be with Sophie despite all of the conditions of the family having to let him. How did you decide on that for Violet as well?\t\n\n\tI think Violet is a woman of the time period, but she’s always on the side of true love, and I think it was important for us to get her to that place, especially after the death of John. That’s a moment that for all of our characters, they stop thinking about the mundane rules, banal rules of society, and start thinking about what really matters. And in real life, when you go through a loss in your family, or you see someone you love lose their love, it really puts things in perspective. So I think that was really helpful for us to get Violet to the place where she could embrace Sophie and Benedict being together.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichelle Mao as Rosamund Li, Katie Leung as Lady Araminta Gun, Isabella Wei as Posy Li\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow believably mean did you want to make the TV version of Araminta in her evil stepmother role by hiding Sophie’s father’s will and getting her arrested versus how far she goes in the book?\t\n\n\tIt was important for us not to shy away from Araminta being a villain. But at the same time, I think on our show, you have to understand why people do the things they do. I don’t need for people to be rooting for Araminta, or to feel like, “Oh yeah, a great decision,” but I want them to see how she got to the place she got, so that she feels more human and more three dimensional.\n\n\tI really just adore the way Katie Leung plays that very last look at the end in her last scene with Sophie in Episode 408. It’s a look that is both like self-righteous and apologetic at the same time, which I think speaks to the fact that she knows she’s done wrong, but she also feels, perhaps rightly, that she was put in a really terrible situation by Sophie’s dad. So I hope that people see the gray in Araminta, rather than seeing her in black and white.\n\t\n\t\tIs Araminta still going to live next door?\t\n\n\tI think it would be too difficult for Araminta to live next door as she watches Sophie live the best life ever. So I think it’s safe to say that Araminta is probably leaving London next season.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHugh Sachs as Brimsley, Golda Rosheuvel as Queen Charlotte, Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSophie and Benedict get Queen Charlotte’s blessing to marry at the end, first because her new lady in waiting Alice Mondrich makes a compelling speech to the Queen about the case for a maid loving a lord being like the Queen’s outsider marriage to the king — and then because of the Bridgertons’ lie that Sophie is a noble extended family member of Sophie’s father’s family. How much of the Queen’s choice to bless the union was because she believed this version of events, and how much was done for Alice and respect for Lady Danbury, who put Alice forward as her replacement? And with Lady Danbury having the Queen’s permission to go on a journey to her homeland, will she be back next season or still away on her travels?\t\n\n\tDanbury is absolutely a part of the story moving forward. She’s quite a big part of Season 5, in fact. But I think we wanted to shake up the dynamic. She had been the Queen’s side, at her beck and call for four seasons and I think going forward, the Queen is seeing Danbury more as her peer, going forward — in many ways, as her true friend. And now the two of them are able to be true friends, and Alice can be in more of the service role that Lady Danbury sometimes had to fulfill. So that’s the answer to that.\n\n\tIn terms of the way everything goes down with Sophie and Alice and Araminta, it’s not in the books that the Queen is involved in sanctioning the lie, but I think it’s part of the language of our show that the Queen is somehow involved in blessing the union every season. And it felt like a nice cap on the Lady Danbury story, after the Queen has spent a season requiring Danbury to be in service to her, for the Queen to honor the personhood and humanity of a maid within a love match. That felt like a beautiful button on that story and like a gift to Danbury, in a way. And she’s giving her girl, the girl Danbury put forward, meaning Alice, a win. It’s really more about the Queen doing it for Danbury than anything.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLuke Newton as Colin Bridgerton, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Queen has also allowed Penelope to step down as Whistledown. We know how much Whistledown has damaged things, and also what she’s given the Ton. So how did you and the writers arrive at Penelope giving it all up, and then also choose to replace her with a mysterious new character who has decided to take over Whistledown?\t\n\n\tWe knew from the moment we started talking about Season 3. It’s in the books that Penelope comes out as Whistledown and then eventually gives it up. And we knew once Penelope came out as Whistledown, we were losing some of the tension and stakes from that storyline, because she didn’t have a secret to keep anymore. And we got to have a little fun with her being a public Whistledown this season, but we didn’t want to drag it out for too long. And it also just felt really fun in our world for someone new to take it over, because it allows us to create a real mystery about who is Whistledown. Whereas everyone kind of knew it was Penelope from Season 1, even before we revealed it — it’s from the books — now we get to really build a secret that hopefully will keep fans guessing for seasons to come.\n\t\n\t\tAm I crazy, or was Julie Andrews narrating with a slightly different Whistledown voice at the end there?\t\n\n\tYes! Good catch. Tom Verica, who’s our producing director, worked with Julie on finding just like a slightly different inflection for this new version of Whistledown. And we have some ideas about what the new voice of Whistledown is that you’ll hear a lot more about in Season 5. And the hope was that Julie’s performance kind of tips the hand a little bit about this Whistledown being slightly different than the last one. It’s not just going to be a rehash of the way Penelope did the column.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Francis as Lord Anderson, Ruth Gemmell as Lady Violet Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI really thought Violet and Marcus were going to get married. How much you can say about where you want to take her from here now that she’s decided she’s not ready for a second marriage?\t\n\n\tSo we all love the chemistry between Marcus and Violet, and it was a tough decision to make. But a lot of us felt like this is the first person Violet has ever dated since her husband died, and it felt a little too early for her to settle back down. It’s that thing of, sometimes you meet the right person at the wrong time and there’s tragedy and pathos and beauty in that. I think that we do really want to see Violet start putting herself first a little bit more before she ties herself down in a marriage — if she does ever decide to get into another marriage. I think in many ways, because Edmund was such a great love for her, maybe what she’s realizing is, in fact, a second marriage isn’t the right path for her. So that’s something we’ll continue exploring in future seasons.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton, Masali Baduza as Michaela \n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAmong the other big shocks we get at the very end of the season is that Michaela has left after promising Francesca she would stay. What are you trying to signal with that after everything that they’ve been through this season?\t\n\n\tI think fans will read into it if they know the book. But I think that the way we’ve tried to portray it is a little bit of a mystery. You may notice that we’ve mostly stayed out of Michaela’s POV. We get to know her a bit through John and a bit through Francesca, but we haven’t really allowed ourselves to go into her POV all the way, and I think we are saving that for when we eventually get to her season. And so why she left is something that will be explored more fully in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton, Victor Alli as John Stirling, Masali Baduza as Michaela \n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tExploring the loss of John, how did you decide this was the right time for the character to die at this point in the show, as opposed to happening in Julia Quinn’s fifth out of the eight “Bridgerton” books?\t\n\n\tI think we knew that it was going to be later in this season. We wanted to focus as much as we could on Benedict and Sophie before we got the loss of John, because we knew it was going to be really important to actually spend some time with his loss. And I do think Episode 7 really becomes about Francesca, in a way, and it enormously impacts Benedict and Sophie’s story. We wouldn’t have had John die this season if we didn’t feel like it was thematically and narratively really interesting — in a very heartbreaking way — for Sophie and Benedict’s story.\n\n\tAs I talked about, I think loss like that really puts everything in perspective. And that felt like an important push in a season in which there’s such a giant obstacle to the romance, meaning Sophie and Benedict coming from a different class. But we also didn’t want to end the season with the death, because we want to get to a place of joy and of happily ever after by the end of every season. So Episode 7 kind of felt like the sweet spot.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFrancesca’s book dives into her desires for motherhood and her fertility issues. I know one of the things that’s been discussed throughout the book fandom following the reveal of a gender switch for Francesca’s post-John love interest, Michael, now Michaela, was how that could continue as a storyline. This season introduced a lot of that already with John’s death and Francesca having thought that she was pregnant and going through a traumatizing examination where she finds out she is not. For fans who are wondering how this would be incorporated, is there more to come on the fertility storyline, or is this how you wanted to position it at the end of John’s time with her?\t\n\n\tThere’s more to come. I think we’re absolutely interested in telling — and we have told — a story of Francesca dealing with infertility this season. But if anyone thinks that women who end up with women don’t deal with infertility, I think they have a lot to learn.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRuth Gemmell as Lady Violet Bridgerton, Luke Newton as Colin Bridgerton, Hannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton, Masali Baduza as Michaela Stirling, Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAsking more about Francesca’s storyline, how did you decide how dark and deep to go with it, given that it is still balanced with Benedict and Sophie’s love story and this joyfulness in Season 4? And how much are you also reserving for whatever will eventually be Francesca’s season?\t\n\n\tIt was a tricky balance. We talked a lot in the room about the fact that, other than Penelope’s dad — who we didn’t really know that well, or frankly, care about that deeply — this was the first time we were losing a character, watching a character die. \n\n\tIt was really important the way we treated the death. We tried to be thoughtful — like, we’re not interested in seeing John’s dead body, for example. We wanted to give a lot of space to the reaction, to the grief and the way it lands on, not only Francesca, but the entire family, and give John his due. He’s a beloved character, has become a beloved character in the series. He’s a character we all love a lot, and he will continue to mean a lot in Francesca’s life going forward.\n\t\n\n\tIn terms of balancing the darkness, those who know the book will remember that Francesca has a miscarriage soon after John dies. And it was something we talked about in the room, and obviously it does play into her fertility storyline. But ultimately we decided that it was too dark and that we felt we had given service to the fertility storyline, and we will continue to give service to Francesca’s desire for children. But ultimately we felt like losing a husband and a baby on screen has a weight that would be too devastating,\n\t\n\t\tBased on the signals we get from John in his conversations with Francesca, is it safe to assume that he knew Michaela’s sexuality before he died?\t\n\n\tThat’s something to be explored in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek, Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBack to Sophie and Benedict, I wanted to ask about crafting their two sex scenes in Part 2. In the first one they have penetrative sex and in the second, a bathtub scene from the book, they do not. What was the difference between the two scenes and what you wanted to show with both of them?\t\n\n\tIn the Episode 5 scene, which was brilliantly, I think, choreographed by our intimacy coordinator Lizzy Talbot and our director, Rayne Harris, that scene was all about urgency and about two people being really, really caught up in the moment. Because in order for Sophie to give herself sexually to Benedict, knowing she has this hang up about being an illegitimate child, understandably, she had to be really swept up in the moment. So that’s all about urgency, whereas the bathtub scene is more about intimacy, and it’s about two people being in a place where they understand each other much more deeply. Chiefly, Benedict understanding Sophie more deeply; understanding what her boundaries are and why.  So his thoughtfulness about not having penetrative sex with her there is because he’s finally at a place where he really understands what Sophie deserves, and how she deserves to be treated, and how she doesn’t deserve to be treated. But it’s also a moment in which the roles are flipped, and Benedict is caretaking for Sophie. He’s washing her hair, he’s pleasuring her and focusing on her, and hopefully it shows like a nice growth arc for Benedict, within the intimacy.\n\t\n\t\tAs they become more intimate and they start to have real conversations about what their future could be, Benedict discloses to Sophie not only that he’s had sex before, but that he’s had sex with men and he’s had sex with women. How did you craft that conversation? Obviously, that’s a deviation from the book, because Benedict’s bisexuality is a deviation from the book. So how did you want to approach that him telling her at all, and how she would respond to it?\t\n\n\tIt felt very important to us that Benedict is owning every part of himself and that he’s being accepted for every part of himself. When we talked about that conversation, it wasn’t from a perspective of this needing to be something that he disclosed so much as him wanting to disclose it because it’s a part of who he is. And in the same way that Sophie is reaching a place where she’s brave enough to be fully honest about her backstory and what she’s been through. It felt like the right time for Benedict to say, “OK, I see your vulnerability and I offer you mine.” And it’s going to allow these two to move forward in a way where they’re fully loved and accepted for every piece of themselves.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPart 2 sees the big return of Kate and Anthony. Anthony believes what is going on between Benedict and Sophie is the same as Anthony’s relationship with the opera singer Sienna in Season 1, but by Benedict’s wedding is admitting Benedict should never have listened to him. How did you decide what role Anthony would take in this, and why he would at first believe his brother’s feelings for Sophie weren’t the same as his own for Kate? \t\n\n\tObviously, Anthony went through a giant journey in his season where he went from being the guy who was maybe overly controlling with Daphne on the marriage mart to finding true love even in a tricky situation. So he’s chilled out, but he’s still the head of the household, and he still has to keep in mind that his younger sisters are unmarried, and that everything that Benedict does potentially reflects on them. He’s been away at Aubrey Hall and previously India with Kate and the baby, so I think he wasn’t around to really know the depth of feeling between Benedict and Sophie, but it was important to bring in someone who could be the voice of society in that time period, and he really is speaking to very valid society concerns. But it was also quite nice to see him coming around in the end.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGemmell, Dodd, Ashley, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Bridgerton, Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton, Will Tilston as Gregory Bridgerton \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBy the end of the season, my personal belief is that more has been set up to make Francesca the lead of Season 5 than Eloise. What would you say to that?\t\n\n\tCan you just put “laughs”? \n\t\n\t\tI can do that.\t\n\n\tNo, no! Interesting theory. It’s always interesting seeing the way people react to the end of the season. We felt like at the end of Season 3 we set up Benedict really, really clearly and there was still some uncertainty. This season, there are reasons to believe it could be either Eloise or Francesca. And so I’m curious.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJessica Madsen as Cressida Cowper \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCressida returns this season as the new Lady Penwood. Why bring her back after what she did to the Bridgertons, and have her share a scene of some reconciliation with Eloise?\t\n\n\tIn the book, the Penwood heir after Sophie’s father dies is a distant male relative. It felt like fertile territory to imagine who the new Araminta would be. We knew we wanted to give Cressida a proper ending, and it felt perfect for Araminta who always wears black to be replaced by the Queen of Pink. I love seeing the ways in which Cressida has grown after going through her trials in life, and more importantly seeing the way her reappearance gives Eloise a growth moment. This feels like a close to Cressida’s chapter for now, but I wouldn’t rule out seeing more of her in the world in the future. \n\t\n\t\tI know we talk every time about characters who leave and characters who come back, but I’ve seen more people asking this time around — and I feel like it’ll come up even more with John’s funeral — that it seems weird Daphne and Simon aren’t involved. So in a case like that, have you talked at all about recasting Daphne and Simon for future seasons? For Daphne to not be there for Francesca, while we understand from a logistical standpoint, is hard from a narrative standpoint.\t\n\n\tWe are not interested in recasting the characters. I think it would feel like a disservice to everything Regé and Phoebe set up in Season 1, and all the beautiful work they put into those characters. We would love to potentially have them back at some point, but I think, logistically, we want to make sure we bring them back when we have something really meaty for them. And to have them come back to say a line at a funeral and just prove that they were there, it wouldn’t feel right for many reasons. So I think in my mind, the camera doesn’t capture everything.

    "body": "\n\tThe surprise news Thursday that Netflix was ending its pursuit of Warner Bros. caught nearly everyone in Hollywood off guard, including staffers inside Warner Bros., Paramount and Netflix. The reaction, of course, varied — depending on which side of the Hollywood Hills you sat, what division you’re a part of and even your political persuasion.\n\n\t“It’s obviously very upsetting to employees,” said one exec inside Warner Bros., who described the news as a “gut punch.” Employees at the studio were said to be holding out hope that Netflix would come up with a new bid to out-maneuver Paramount Skydance‘s “superior proposal,” and thought they’d at least have four days to keep their fingers crossed. But then came Thursday afternoon’s swift announcement that the streamer had bowed out.\n\t\n\n\tSeveral miles away from Burbank on Melrose Avenue, the champagne was literally being popped open as execs there celebrated their turn of fortune, and also breathed a sigh of relief that their long campaign to nab Warner Bros. had won a decisive battle.\n\n\n\t“There were tears of exhaustion and happiness,” said one exec, who said it had been hard to focus on the business at hand inside Paramount Skydance when there was so much work to be done in trying to win the derby for Warner Bros.\n\n\tAnd at Netflix, when the streamer announced at 3 p.m. sharp that it was giving up on its Warner Bros. bid, there was a lot of instant rumbling in the halls of Netflix’s Hollywood offices. There were audible sounds of “Whoa” and other surprised noises emanating from offices and cubicles.\n\n\tQuestion number one inside Warner Bros. is now what becomes of the company — its staff, its culture, its storied Burbank lot. \n\t\n\n\tThe fate of many jobs on the studio production side is a big question mark, both in film and TV. There’s a general sense that 1+1 will still equal 1, as a combined Paramount/Warner Bros. will need to shed some of its production infrastructure, particularly in TV — where the company will now own Warner Bros. TV Group (which includes Warner Bros. TV, Warner Bros. Unscripted & Alternative TV, Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios), CBS Studios and Paramount Television Studios. \n\n\t“Think about the bloodletting of thousands of employees at CBS and Paramount, and now it will be more. Just awful,” says an insider. “It’s really going to be a shakeup for the whole community, the losses of jobs and content. Places to sell, places to buy.”\n\n\tAnother Warner Bros. exec, weary of what the company has been through over the past decade (including four owners between Time Warner, AT&T, Warner Bros. Discovery and now Paramount Skydance), just sighed. “Another day, another merger. I just make shows. That’s all I do. Head down, make the show,” she said.\n\n\tAt Paramount Skydance, there was some relief because departments had been at a bit of a standstill while waiting to see how the challenge for Warner Bros. played out. In particular, some lean departments inside Paramount Skydance had been holding off on staffing up, specifically because they wanted to wait and see if they’d be merging with Warner Bros. (which would then create redundancies). After last year’s massive layoffs, several divisions inside Paramount Skydance (such as the cable outlets and the last vestiges of Showtime) have been cut to the bone.\n\n\tThat might give some Warner Bros. staffers hope that, depending on the division, there will be room for them in the combined company. \n\n\tBut there are so many more questions than answers. Will HBO Max and Paramount+ continue as separate entities, or eventually merge? Will Paramount Skydance sell the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank? And what happens to CNN, particularly given Donald Trump’s desire to mute his critics?\n\n\t“Look at what they’ve done to CBS News,” said a Warner Bros. Discovery insider. \n\n\tAs for whether the Paramount-Warner Bros. merger will create a culture clash between the two historic companies, one Par insider pointed out that their studio didn’t really have much of a cohesive culture anymore, given its recent mergers with CBS and Skydance, then coupled with all of its layoffs. Contrast that with Warner Bros., where staffers still boast a solidarity that the company has managed to maintain despite a decade of management shifts.\n\t\n\n\tThere’s less angst inside Netflix, as one insider there said sentiments among staffers about losing the WBD deal seemed to range widely from relief to disappointment. Without any prompting from leadership, there was much discussion in the hallways that Netflix made the right call to exert financial discipline and not get caught up in the hunt.\n\n\tThat said, some did express frustration at missing out on content development opportunities from the Warner Bros vault. There had been excitement about bringing WBD’s considerable capabilities to produce TV shows and movies into the company that still does not have a large studio arm. Calling the deal off also squashes a host of questions Netflix insiders had about how HBO and Netflix would realistically co-exist in the same company, another staffer said. “I guess doesn’t matter any more who Casey Bloys will or won’t report to,” the staffer quipped, referring to industry chatter about the HBO chief.\n\n\tOutside of Warner Bros., Netflix and Paramount Skydance, there was plenty of cynicism in a town already scarred from a decrease in production and tremendous job losses. “The new company will be saddled with $87 billion in debt,” said one observer. “To put that in context, in four years, Warner Bros. Discovery took more than $50 billion in debt and was only able to reduce it to $30 billion. So this has double that debt load, and all you’re doing is adding Paramount to it.”\n\n\tElsewhere, the reaction was also one of concern: California attorney general Rob Bonta wrote that “Paramount/Warner Bros is not a done deal. These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review.”\n\n\tWatchdog groups also shared their alarm, focusing on Paramount Skydance’s impending control of both CBS News and CNN: “The Ellisons have already promised the Trump administration that they’ll make sweeping changes to CNN given the chance, and we know what the means: firing journalists, spiking important stories, and replacing the news with empty propaganda,” said Free Press co-CEO Craig Aaron. “This deal endangers our democracy by giving a family of pliant billionaires even more control of vast swaths of our news coverage, TV stations and movie studios. Allowing more mergers in the already highly concentrated movie business will harm filmmakers and industry workers when Paramount delivers on its promise to make deep cuts to please its Wall Street backers. While a few Hollywood execs and sovereign-wealth fund managers in the Middle East might get rich from this deal, thousands and thousands of American workers will lose their jobs.”\n\t\n\n\tSaid Freedom of the Press Foundation chief of advocacy Seth Stern: “Ellison will readily throw the First Amendment, CNN’s reporters and HBO’s filmmakers under the bus if they stand in the way of expanding his corporate empire and fattening his pockets. But censorship is bad for business.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tPeter Shaffer’s “Amadeus” is, at heart, a great love triangle. At one vortex, there’s 18th century composer Antonio Salieri, wavering between piety and murderous peevishness. At another corner, there’s the God whose favor Salieri craves, quite unrequitedly. And then, standing between them, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, God’s true love, or at least it seems to Salieri for a while. It’s a pleasure to report that all three of these roles are exceptionally well-played in a splendid new production at the Pasadena Playhouse, here to remind us that genius and the lack of it can both be hell.\n\t\n\n\tGod does not have a speaking role in “Amadeus,” being an absentee kind of guy, but he does occasionally loom over the proceedings, projected onto the stage house’s back wall as a spooky, painted projection seen just long enough to be established as the apparently disinterested foil for Salieri’s entitled prayers. As far as the actual casting goes, anyone who’s seen the 1979 Broadway play (oft-revised by Shaffer) or the hit 1984 movie comes in knowing this is really going to be a two-hander… bordering at times on a one-hander. As Mozart, Sam Clemmett is wonderful, carefully navigating the silliness and sullenness of a character who’s been drawn as part boy, part man. But it’s no slight to what Clemmett is doing to be reminded that the title of “Amadeus’” is an act of misdirection, and that Salieri sucks up all the main character energy in the drawing room. This ingratiating villain spends so much of the final monolog going on about being the “patron saint of mediocrity,” he’s pretty much daring any actor who plays him to show up with anything short of greatness.\n\t\n\n\tJefferson Mays is the man for that job. Nothing against more evenly proportioned ensemble dramas, but 22 years after he won the Tony for the one-actor show “I Am My Own Wife,” Mays is giving the kind of singular performance that we all go to the theater for and remember in years to come. It’s a portrayal that sits right at the intersection of ridiculously flamboyant, allowing us to stew, at leisure, in someone else’s juices for a bitter yet delicious two hours and 45 minutes. The most recently revised version of the play is bookended by long stretches of an apparently dying Salieri — decrepit but more poisonous than ever — alone on stage, to the point where even Shakespeare might look at the script and go, “Too many soliloquies.” But who’s to mind, when you’ve got an actor as great as Mays treating the audience as his gossip-hungry confidante, when he’s not bugging the Almighty with a longer list of grievances than Job’s? Bring it all on; we could listen to Mays deliver these death rattles if they went on till dawn.\n\n\tNot to suggest that “Amadeus” is truly a one-man show, and even positioning it as just an actor’s showcase would be doing this production a disservice. Because even if its Salieri were actually mediocre, the show would still be worth a visit just for every other element firing on all cylinders — most obviously Alexander Dodge’s striking and clever scenic design, followed by costuming by Linda Cho that looks as if every bit was handmade to complement Dodge’s color schemes. (The Playhouse has its own rare on-site scene shop, while Cho’s costumes were made by the folks at downtown’s L.A. Opera.) Under the direction of Darko Tresnjak — who won his Tony directing Mays 12 years ago in “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder” — this overdue revitalization of “Amadeus” is among the most thrilling recent examples of the Pasadena Playhouse consistently punching above its weight.\n\n\tPablo Santiago’s lighting design is top-notch, too, in pulling all these other visual threads together. But there’s nothing to dimly light up a room quite like Salieri’s gaslighting. In his many scenes with Clemmett’s Mozart, Mays comes off as so genuinely attentive and supportive that you might find yourself wishing, against all sense, that the earnestness was genuine, and that the genius might be recognized and the arts fully supported. But this is Vienna, not Pasadena, so…\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEnsemble in ‘Amadeus’ at the Pasadena Playhouse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe first sight that greets a Playhouse upon lights going down is enough to elicit a very slight gasp from an audience. Behind a scrim painted with the notes of Mozart’s “Phantasie für eine Orgelwalze,” there’s the first glimpse of the magically elongated room that will remain the show’s sole set, a sight that’s intriguing and eye-tickling enough to leave you feeling just fine about the prospect of no major scenic changeovers for the next three hours. It’s a forced-perspective rendering of a hall that seems to extend halfway to Pasadena’s Old Town. (Later on, that will make for a pretty good visual gag when the actor who’s by far the tallest in the show, Matthew Patrick Davis as Emperor Joseph II, climbs through one of the small doors on the far end.) Part of the ensemble stands supernaturally perched over this crimson room, elevated, like a biblical cloud of witnesses gathered to watch the beginning of this slightly demonic fable.\n\n\tAnd then, for most of the introductory stretch, it is Mays’ scenery to chew — and we say that lovingly, because he is a bit like a fleshier version of the Crypt Keeper, when we meet him in his most rickety capacity, not so much raging against the dying of the light as against the memory of the frenemy, Mozart, who died 33 years earlier. Mays is wheelchair-bound for this wheezing prelude, so there’s a bit of a magic act that seems to happen when he is transformed into a young Salieri for most of what follows. Fellow cast members turn the chair around and perform some ministrations, and when we suddenly see him turned back around, transformed, we’re convinced they must have done some kind of makeup job while Mays’ back was turned. But then it happens again, later in the play, with the actor facing the audience, and we realize that really all that happened in either transformation is the addition or removal of a wig that covers up a bald pate and age spots. The second instance is kind of an “illusionist reveals the trick” moment, and the trick is… maybe not so surprisingly… acting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJefferson Mays in ‘Amadeus’ at the Pasadena Playhouse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOnce we’ve gotten quite a good dose of that opening spittle, the action moves on to scenes from decades earlier being recalled by Salieri — a character that has been called an unreliable narrator over the years, but actually seems a lot more reliable than he’s been given credit for. Having been warned that a former child prodigy is coming to town, Salieri first happens to spy Mozart playing a naughty game of hide-and-seek with his wife-to-be, Constanze Weber (Lauren Worsham), in and out of her skirt. Maybe it’s meant to be suggested that Salieri is remembering Mozart as more childish than he really was. But beyond some introductory goofiness, the composer that many consider the greatest of all time is not portrayed as being as much of an idiot savant as he was in the Milos Forman movie. Then, Tom Hulce gave us certainly the most vivid Mozart we could ever get, with that unforgettable giggle. That was a fine choice, in drawing sharp contrasts for a fable about how unchoosy the Almighty can be in picking his prime vessels. But to the extent that audiences may want to believe that the character really could have composed all those masterpieces — with or without channeling the divine — it may be helpful to have him feel more grounded, as in the portrayal here by Clemmett (known for “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story” and playing Albus Potter on Broadway in “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”). He veers more toward adult than child in the man/boy equation, but we see just enough of him as a sweetly arrogant Li’l Rascal to understand why a humorless rival might devote his life to ruining him. He’s Goofus, to Salieri’s Gallant, but also touched by God, a mixture that never gets old, or at least hasn’t since 1979.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSam Clemmett and Lauren Worsham in ‘Amadeus’ at the Pasadena Playhouse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Lorch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf you really started to internalize the themes in “Amadeus,” you might start to develop a mid-show ulcer to rival whatever maladies there are that begin to sap Mozart of his strength. Every time Salieri starts to fool Mozart again, you may have the impulse to shout at the stage the way someone might at a horror movie screening. The idea that some of the greatest artists of all time were treated poorly or forgotten during their lifetimes? That’s about as upsetting to dwell on as anything in the news right now. So it’s a good thing that Mays is able to make Salieri actually feel like a good hang, unlike most of our real-life villains. The framing device for the play makes it pretty clear how things are going to turn out, so there’s only so much creeping dread to deal with, as we see Mozart be dealt the bad cards of poverty, illness and those notes about “too many notes.” There’s plenty of satisfying comic justice to come when Salieri is left alone to his own devices — and to spend a lot of climactic alone time with the audience — long after his bete noire is gone. He suffers a fate worse than death: living too long. And boy, does Mays wring some laughs out of that, even as he appears increasingly corpselike.\n\n\tThere are so many pleasures along the way, even if that tiny knot is developing in your stomach. Like: some great tunes. The instrumentation is pre-recorded, naturally. (If you do want to hear a full orchestra play this stuff, there will be a live-to-picture performance at the Hollywood Bowl on Sept. 3, with the L.A. Phil delivering every cue.) But there are some real operatic voices on stage for the performance scenes, principally Michelle Allie Drever and Alaysha Fox, and it’s like taking a wonderful vacation from all the seriocomic anxiety any time real singers pop in to show us what all the verbal jousting and jealousy has been about. Rock me, “Amadeus,” indeed.\n\n\tIs there an appetite to revive “Amadeus” on Broadway? There ought to be. (Right now there’s a five-part Sky series that adapts this same material that has been just picked up by Starz for the U.S., which may offer an indication of how much hunger Americans have to see a variation on this particular cat-and-mouse game right now.) It’s hard not to believe that if producers were to keep building a house for Mays to do his thing, they will come. Certainly all of us who’ve suffered from imposter syndrome at one point or another deserve a chance to come identify with, if not bow to, the ultimate embodiment of a guy tortured with the secret knowledge that he really is overrated. No one will ever play just-good-enough greater than Mays does.\n\t\n\n\t“Amadeus” runs at the Pasadena Playhouse through March 15. For tickets, call 626-356-7529 or visit Pasadena Playhouse.\n",

Brown's cause of death was ruled diffuse thermal injury and smoke inhalation. We're told the manner of death was determined to be an accident.\n      \n\n          The tragic fire started after Brown entered the barn to jump-start a vehicle. A little while later, Brown called a family member for a fire extinguisher, but by the time the family got to the barn to put the fire out, the barn was already engulfed in flames. His wife suffered severe burns trying to save him.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Brown's daughter tells us he was a devout Jehovah's Witness, and a funeral service is being planned.\n      \n    \n          In addition to \"The Wire,\" Brown also had prominent roles in \"Law & Order: SVU\" and \"We Own This City.\"\n      \n    \n          His agent, Albert Bramante, tells TMZ ... \"I am upset and saddened.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tWhile <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-grills-aziz-ansari-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236543742/\">defending his decision</a> to perform at the controversial, state-sponsored Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/aziz-ansari/\">Aziz Ansari</a> said he planned to donate “part of the fee” to “causes that support free press and human rights,” listing Reporters Without Borders and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/human-rights-watch/\">Human Rights Watch</a>, which has long been critical of the comedy festival and the Saudi regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in a statement to <em>Variety</em>, a spokesperson for Human Rights Watch said the organization “cannot accept” donations from Ansari and other comedians who have “generously offered to donate part of their performance fees.” (Jessica Kirson said “I deeply regret” performing at Riyadh Comedy Festival and committed to donating the entirety of her fee to an undisclosed human rights organization.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“But while we cannot accept, it is not too late for them to call for the release of detained Saudi activists,” said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch. She added: “Human Rights Watch didn’t call for comedians to boycott the Riyadh Comedy Festival, but simply asked them to express their support for free speech by urging the release of Saudi activists unjustly imprisoned.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn September, Shea put out a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/politics/global/marc-maron-human-rights-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236530044/\">similar statement</a> calling attention to the Saudi Arabian government’s murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. “Comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn’t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech,” Shea said. “Everyone performing in Riyadh should use this high-profile opportunity to call for the release of detained Saudi activists.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOn his late-night show on Tuesday, Jimmy Kimmel grilled Ansari for his decision to perform at Riyadh Comedy Festival. “It’s a pretty brutal regime,” Kimmel said of the Islamic kingdom led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “They’ve done a lot of horrible, horrible things.” Ansari said he “put a lot of thought” into the decision and concluded: “A comedy festival felt like something that’s pushing things to be more open and to push a dialogue. You kind of have to make a choice of whether you’re going to isolate or engage. For me, especially being me and looking the way I do and being from a Muslim background, it felt like something I should be a part of.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Riyadh Comedy Festival ran from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9 and drew a sharp divide between the A-list comedians accepting large sums of money to perform — including Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Louis C.K. and Pete Davidson — and those who said they turned down offers, like Shane Gillis and Atsuko Okatsuka. (Sources told <em>Variety</em> that comedian paydays ranged from mid-six-figures up to $1.6 million for one show.)</p>\n<p>\n\tOkatsuka revealed on X that she declined to perform at Riyadh Comedy Festival because “the money is coming straight from the Crown Prince, who actively executes journalists, [people with non-lethal] drug offenses, bloggers, etc w/out due process.” She included screenshots of an offer letter including an alleged <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/AtsukoComedy/status/1971705973288153310\">“content restrictions” section</a> meant to prohibit comedians from joking about the Saudi government, legal system or religious customs.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid Cross <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/david-cross-slams-bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival-1236534601/\">penned a statement</a> slamming fellow comedians who participated in the festival, writing: “How can any of us take any of you seriously ever again? All of your bitching about ‘cancel culture’ and ‘freedom of speech’ and all that shit? Done. You don’t get to talk about it ever again. By now we’ve all seen the contract you had to sign.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, many high-profile comedians have defended their decision to play the festival. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/bill-burr-defends-riyadh-comedy-festival-backlash-1236536805/\">Burr called it</a> “one of the top three experiences I’ve had,” saying “the royals loved the show.” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/louis-ck-riyadh-comedy-festival-positive-thing-backlash-1236540316/\">C.K. said it was a “good opportunity”</a> and “comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/dave-chappelle-saudi-arabia-riyadh-festival-free-speech-1236537335/\">Chappelle quipped</a> onstage in Saudi Arabia that “It’s easier to talk here than it is in America.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Human Rights Watch pointed out in a press release on Wednesday, “Chappelle has not publicly commented on Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuses.”</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tA week after its heralded and highly-rated return to late night, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel-live-2/\">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>” headed to Brooklyn for a week’s worth of shows — and continued to lead late night in total viewers and adult 18-49.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to ABC, “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” averaged 2.2 million viewers and a 0.22 rating with adults 18-49 for the week of Sept. 29. That put it ahead of time period competitors “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” (1.96 million viewers, 0.13 adults 18-49) and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” (1.09 million viewers, 0.09 adults 18-49).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, that’s down from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-live-ratings-viewers-abc-1236528577/\">previous week’s unusually huge numbers </a>due to interest in how Kimmel would mark his return after being suspended by Disney/ABC. On Sept. 23, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live” returned to the air after several days off with 6.3 million viewers on Tuesday — its most-watched regularly scheduled episode ever. That episode also hit a 0.87 rating with adults 18-49, the best demo rating for a regularly scheduled episode since 2015.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis marked the seventh time that “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” has broadcast from Brooklyn since the talker’s launch in 2003. The live shows once again took place at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Howard Gilman Opera House. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” last broadcast from Brooklyn during the week of Sept. 26, 2022. Compared to that visit, this year’s Brooklyn shows were up 35% with total viewers (vs. 1.63 million in 2022). </p>\n<p>\n\tThe show’s 2025 Brooklyn week was also up vs. the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” 2024-2025 season average by 42% in total viewers (vs. 1.55 million) and 57% in adults 18-49 (vs. 0.14 rating).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe highest rated episode of the week came Monday (Sept. 29) with guests Ryan Reynolds, Josh Johnson and musical guest Public Enemy, averaging 2.86 million viewers and a 0.47 rating with adults 18-49.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther guests throughout the week included Stephen Colbert, Kumail Nanjiani and musical guest Reneé Rapp on Tuesday; Emily Blunt, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, musical guest Geese and Big Daddy Kane sitting in with Cleto and the Cletones (Wednesday); Jeremy Allen White, Bruce Springsteen, musical guest Living Colour and Ivan Neville sitting in with Cleto and the Cletones (Thursday); and Tom Hanks and Spike Lee on Friday.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the network, Brooklyn Week content has so far garnered more 34.1 million views on the show’s YouTube channel. <br /></p>\n</div>",

The rapper accused his own record company of defamation over its distribution and promotion of Kendrick Lamar’s infamous “Not Like Us” diss track.</p>\n<p>\n\tDistrict Judge Jeannette Vargas dismissed the suit on Thursday citing Lamar’s track as a “nonactionable opinion” that is not considered defamatory. \n</p>\n<p>\n\t“The fact that the Recording was made in the midst of a rap battle is essential to assessing its impact on a reasonable listener,” wrote Judge Vargas. “Even apparent statements of fact may assume the character of statements of opinion… when made in public debate, heated labor dispute, or other circumstances in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tA spokesperson for UMG tells <em>Variety</em>, “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. We’re pleased with the court’s dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake’s music and investing in his career.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRepresentatives for Drake did not immediately return<em> Variety</em>‘s request for comment. </p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/drake/\">Drake</a> filed his initial suit against UMG in January over<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/kendrick-lamar/\"> Lamar</a>‘s “Not Like Us,” claiming that the label intentionally engaged in defamation by promoting the song. “Not Like Us” arrived in May 2024 as the hardest strike in an intense rap battle that saw the pair throwing wild accusations at each other, including Lamar branding Drake as a “certified pedophile.” \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Although the accusation that Plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us’ imparts verifiable facts about Plaintiff,” writes the judge.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn March, UMG filed their motion to dismiss. Drake’s legal counsel refiled an amended complaint to focus on events that took place since the initial filing. Most notably, the filing called out for UMG knowingly negotiated and promoted “Not Like Us” via Lamar’s Super Bowl performance and consented to the track being played at the 2025 Grammy Awards (where it took home five Grammys).</p>\n<p>\n\tCounsel for the company retaliated by saying Drake’s amended complaint “removed obviously false factual allegations,” adding that the “new allegations are astonishing.” </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tBecause even music has turned into team sports, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/turning-point-usa/\">Turning Point USA</a> has announced that it will be hosting its own Super Bowl halftime show in protest of the NFL’s official headliner, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/bad-bunny/\">Bad Bunny</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe right-wing organization, which was founded by the late Charlie Kirk, posted about its “All American Halftime Show” on social media, writing, “Performers and event details coming soon.” The post links to a survey that allows people to select which music genres they would like to be featured at the big game, including “Anything in English,” “Americana” and “Worship.” (It also lists “Hip Hop,” despite Kirk once advocating for people to “stop listening to rap music and this degenerate hip-hop stuff.”)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s unclear how and where Turning Point’s counterprogramming will be aired, but viewers would have to turn off the Super Bowl broadcast and switch to the “All American Halftime Show,” which will celebrate “faith, family and freedom,” according to the website.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe announcement that Bad Bunny, one of the most famous music stars in the world, will perform at the 2026 Super Bowl sparked an immediate right-wing backlash. Government officials began weighing in on the Puerto Rican artist’s Spanish-language music catalog and his recent comments about skipping the United States on his last tour due to fears about his fans encountering ICE agents.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, said immigration enforcement agents would be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/kristi-noem-ice-bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-1236540306/\">“all over” the Super Bowl</a> because, in her belief, the only people who should be attending the game are “law-abiding Americans who love this country.” House Speaker Mike Johnson said booking Bad Bunny was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/house-speaker-johnson-bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-1236542862/\">“a terrible decision,”</a> suggesting that Lee Greenwood would attract a “broader audience,” despite the 1980s country icon boasting fewer than 500,000 Spotify listeners compared with Bad Bunny’s 80 million. Even Donald Trump called the Bad Bunny selection <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/donald-trump-bad-bunny-super-bowl-ridiculous-1236542215/\">“absolutely ridiculous”</a> despite admitting “I’ve never heard of him.” The hosts of “The Charlie Kirk Show” also slammed Bad Bunny on a recent episode of the conservative talk program, which continued after Kirk’s death. (After he was assassinated in September while debating college students in Utah, Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, assumed the role of CEO of Turning Point USA.)\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/bad-bunny-snl-monologue-fox-news-super-bowl-1236540427/\">“Saturday Night Live” monologue</a> on Oct. 4, Bad Bunny mocked conservative pundits for the backlash surrounding his Super Bowl performance. He delivered some heartfelt remarks in Spanish, thanking his fans and acknowledging Latinos’ contributions in the U.S. Then, in English, he quipped: “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Super Bowl will take place on Feb. 8, 2026.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNew updates have been revealed about Skybound Entertainment’s upcoming video game “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/invincible/\">Invincible</a> VS,” including the addition of Cecil Stedman, a fan-favorite character from Robert Kirkman’s comics and “Invincible” TV series at Amazon, to the 3v3 tag fighting game.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo date, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/invincible-vs/\">Invincible VS</a>” has now revealed eight characters that will be included in the fighter: Mark Grayson (Invincible), Atom Eve, Bulletproof, Thula, Rex Splode, Battle Beast, Omni-Man and Cecil.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPer the description from Skybound Entertainment and Quarter Up, “A fan-favorite from the ‘Invincible’ TV series and comic books, Cecil has been one of the most requested playable characters. Most often heard as a voice in Mark’s earpiece, Cecil enters the fight in Invincible VS with specialized weapons, including plasma pistols, projectile launchers and grenades to keep opponents at a distance. His ranged gameplay style is paired with tactical combat, allowing him to play cat and mouse with enemies. Want more? Cecil can also summon a limitless supply of Reanimen for backup; with access to The Hammer – a massive orbital laser – he is a devastating force on the battlefield.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, the “Invincible VS” devs and Kirkman revealed new details about the game’s story mode Thursday, which “plays like a special extended episode of the show, featuring every announced playable character so far – and teases the arrival of a brand-new character who hasn’t yet appeared anywhere in the Invincible Universe.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m very involved in the game, but one of the great things about this team is that they are constantly impressing me with the little factoids that they’re working into the game and the details and the balance and everything makes sense,” Kirkman told <em>Variety</em> in a Sept. 30 interview tied to the Cecil news. “This game is being made by fans of the ‘Invincible’ series and fans of the ‘Invincible’ comic books to the point where they’re sometimes reminding me of things that I have forgotten, which is not something I’m proud of, but it does happen.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Invincible VS” is set to launch in 2026 on Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>\n<p>\n\tWatch the new trailer for “Invincible VS” in the video below.</p>\n<p>\n\tyoutube.com/watch?v=nKYAyVmdqkM&feature=youtu.be</p>\n<p>\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.</p>\n\t<h2>\n\t\tNEWLY ANNOUNCED GAMES\t</h2>\n<p>\n\tNetflix has unveiled a new slate of party games to be played on TV screens — with your phone as your controller — that will be coming to the service this holiday season.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We’re creating a completely new way to play games — one that’s as easy as streaming a show on a Friday night,” per Netflix’s announcement. “All you’ll need is Netflix and your phone to experience a whole new level of fun on Netflix with instantly recognizable games like ‘LEGO Party!,’ ‘Pictionary: Game Night,’ ‘Boggle Party,’ ‘Tetris Time Warp,’ and a fresh take on the social deduction genre ‘Party Crashers: Fool Your Friends.'”</p>\n<p>\n\tSee full descriptions for the upcoming titles below.</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>LEGO® Party!</em></strong> – Square off against your friends in the ultimate LEGO party game.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tThe Parents Television and Media Council has filed for bankruptcy, ending a three-decade run as a media watchdog that fought to rid the airwaves of sex, violence and profanity.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe organization <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.199460/gov.uscourts.deb.199460.1.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">filed for liquidation</a> under Chapter 7 on Oct. 3, listing assets of $92,000 and liabilities of $285,000. In its heyday in the early 2000s, the group brought in as much as $6.6 million in donations a year — that figure had dwindled to $1.6 million by 2023.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tJon Yasuda, the group’s president, responded to an email inquiry with an autoreply: “Thank you for your email. I am no longer employed by the Parents Television and Media Council.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSFGate first <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/parents-television-council-went-bankrupt-21091238.php\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> the bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>\n\tFounded by conservative commentator L. Brent Bozell III in 1995, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/parents-television-council/\">Parents Television Council</a> was best known for flooding the Federal Communications Commission with indecency complaints. In 2003, it was responsible for 99.8% of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt one time, the group claimed 1.4 million members. When Janet Jackson’s nipple was briefly exposed during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004, members filed more than 65,000 complaints with the FCC, leading to a record $550,000 fine. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe group also lodged thousands of complaints over fleeting expletives, as when Bono used the “f-word” during the 2003 Golden Globes. In 2004, the group targeted the short-lived ABC show “Life As We Know It,” calling it “drenched in sex.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe PTC took a prim view of promiscuity, drug use and violence on prime-time TV. The group lamented the decline of the broadcast “family hour,” noting that the 8 p.m.-9 p.m. time slot had been taken over by risqué shows like “Melrose Place” and “Friends.” Researchers tallied up vulgarities like “ass,” “bastard,” and “son of a bitch,” as well as instances of premarital and extramarital sex.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1998, the organization took out newspaper ads seeking to pressure advertisers to drop support for televised “filth.” Featuring Steve Allen, the former “Tonight Show” host and the group’s “honorary chairman,” the ads warned: “TV Is Leading Children Down a Moral Sewer.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOver the years, the organization expanded its mandate to cable TV — blasting adult-themed cartoons like “Family Guy” and “American Dad” — and streaming, issuing warnings about “Stranger Things” on Netflix and HBO’s “Euphoria,” which it called “child-themed pornography.” The group regularly criticized TV’s self-imposed content rating system as being too lenient to racy programming.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe group added “media” to its title in 2021, recognizing the proliferation of distribution channels for illicit influence, and later weighed in on TikTok, artificial intelligence and smartphone bans in public schools.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll in all, the PTC found itself in a losing battle. The group recently lamented that Hollywood sex scenes were more explicit than ever and warned parents that this year’s best picture Oscar winner, “Anora,” contains graphic sex and glamorizes prostitution.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I keep saying to myself, it can’t get worse, but it does,” Bozell said in 2001. “It is just now commonplace to use cuss words in a gratuitous fashion.”</p>\n</div>",

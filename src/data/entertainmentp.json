    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tStreaming service Philo is hoping to win over new customers this month with a new deal that knocks $8 off the regular price of a subscription to their Philo Core plan.\n\n\tPhilo is already a relative bargain at its regular $33 a month price point, which gets subscribers more than 70 live TV channels that they can watch online without cable. Philo recently added access to HBO Max, Discovery+ and AMC+ to its packages as well. Now, the company’s latest deal drops the price of a Philo Core subscription to just $25 for the first month, offering new users a chance to get into the streamer for its lowest price yet.\n\n\n\tThe $25/month promo includes access to 70+ live television channels that you can stream on your computer, tablet, phone or smart TV (via the Philo app). Philo’s current channel lineup includes AMC, BET, Food Network, HGTV, ID, MTV, TLC, VH1 and more. Philo also offers a live feed of Hallmark Channel and Lifetime, just in time for the networks’ popular holiday programming.\n\n\tIn addition to the live TV channels, Philo subscribers get unlimited streaming on HBO Max (with ads), plus access to Discovery+ apps and the entire AMC+ library, giving them the ability to stream new hits like “Heated Rivalry” and “Welcome to Derry” on HBO, and catch up on thousands of on-demand titles like “The Walking Dead,” “Killing Eve,” “The White Lotus” and more. Philo says users can access more than 80,000 movies and TV shows in total across its live, on-demand and FAST (free ad-supported streaming TV) offerings.\n\n\tThe Philo deal also includes unlimited DVR with one-year of storage and the ability to fast-forward ads on recorded content. You can create up to ten profiles on Philo, and stream on up to three devices at a time.\n\n\n\tNormally $33/month, get access to Philo’s Core plan for just $25 here and save 24% off the regular price. Your subscription auto-renews at $33, after the first discounted month. See more details at Philo.com.\n\n\tPhilo launched its OTT streaming television service in 2017, and the company announced in February that it has now hit more than 1.3 million subscribers, and expects to turn its first profit this year.\n",

    "description": "\n\tA core argument of Paramount Skydance‘s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery is this: WBD’s cable networks like CNN and TBS are not worth",
    "body": "\n\tA core argument of Paramount Skydance‘s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery is this: WBD’s cable networks like CNN and TBS are not worth as much as the David Zaslav-led company’s deal with Netflix implies, Paramount claims.\n\n\tIt’s hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison of the two proposals. But here’s how the math works out, according to Paramount. The most recent $30/share offer from Paramount Skydance (all cash) is for the full company, including its TV biz (equity value: $77.9 billion). Netflix’s $27.75/share agreement with WBD (84% cash) covers the Warner Bros. TV and film studios arms, plus HBO, HBO Max and the games division (equity value: $72 billion) — excluding the non-HBO TV networks.\n\t\n\n\tSince Warner Bros. Discovery accepted Netflix’s deal terms and rejected Paramount’s proposal, the assumption is that WBD’s board concluded the Netflix offer was in the best interests of Warner Bros. and its stockholders — i.e., Netflix’s offer was worth more than Paramount’s.\n\n\n\tThat would imply WBD is ascribing a value of at least $2.25/share to the TV networks group, slated to be named Discovery Global and spun off in Q3 2026 ahead of the proposed Netflix transaction. But Paramount argues that the value of WBD’s networks group is in fact much lower: roughly $1/share, working out to an equity valuation of about $2.6 billion.\n\n\t“Even after assigning value to the global network stub, total value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal does not exceed $30 per share, and ours is in 100% cash,” Ellison told investors on a call Monday. “The Netflix deal leaves [Warner Bros. Discovery] shareholders with a highly levered declining global network stub, creating value uncertainty.” \n\t\n\n\t“The Netflix proposal leaves shareholders with stock in WBD’s Global Networks business, which is saddled with debt,” Ellison added. “How is WBD attributing value to this equity?” \n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\tWBD has not disclosed how it’s valuing the proposed Discovery Global spin-off “despite its significance to the economics of the Netflix proposal,” Andy Gordon, Paramount’s chief strategy officer and COO, said on Monday’s call. \n\n\tHere’s additional math, as outlined by Gordon: For Netflix’s proposal to exceed Paramount’s $30 all-cash offer, WBD’s Global Networks group would need to trade at more than five times forward EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) — higher than Wall Street analysts’ consensus estimates for Global Networks to be worth 4.5 times forward EBITDA. Financial analysts value WBD Global Networks’ closes competitor, Versant — the entity that Comcast is spinning off from NBCUniversal — at 4x-5x forward EBITDA.\n\n\tUnder WBD’s deal with Netflix, Netflix would assume $10.7 billion of Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt. So the implication is that Discovery Global entity would take on more than $23 billion of WBD’s debt load (which stood at $34.5 billion of gross debt as of the end of Q3).\n\n\tBecause WBD’s Global Networks is expected to have 3.5x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a 4.5x enterprise value multiple, according to Gordon, “one can imply there is less than 1x EBITDA of value in the business for equity holders, or roughly $1 a share.” He said Versant is expected to have a lower leverage ratio than WBD’s networks; Versant, with an anticipated 1.25x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, would be expected to carry a 3x EBITDA value.\n\n\tBut if WBD’s TV assets are a “declining” business, why does Paramount want them? Ellison addressed this on the call: “One of the reasons why we are so interested in [the Warner Bros. Discovery television business] and want to acquire it is because when you put together with our linear business, there are significant synergies.”\n\n\tGordon added that Paramount execs believe “that we can actually do a really good job on the synergy potential that we talked about and helping with that customer constituency and have confidence now that we’ve owned [Paramount’s TV business] for a bit and understanding what we can do with those brands. And let’s be clear, [Warner Bros. Discovery] Global Networks has some really great brands.”\n\t\n\n\tIn June 2025, WBD announced plans to separate its streaming and studios business (under the Warner Bros. banner, led by Zaslav) and its TV networks group (as Discovery Global, headed by current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels) into two separate publicly traded companies. Discovery Global will comprise properties including cable networks CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, OWN, TLC, Magnolia Network and Travel Channel; TNT Sports in the U.S.; free-to-air channels in Europe; and digital products including Discovery+ and Bleacher Report.\n\n\tThe separation of Discovery Global is now expected to be completed in third quarter 2026, prior to the closing of the Netflix transaction — unless, of course, Paramount Skydance’s rival bid prevails.\n\n\tRELATED: David Ellison Courted Warner Bros.

    "body": "\n\t“Lupin,” Netflix’s French mystery thriller starring Omar Sy, will return with its fourth season in fall 2026.\n\n\tOne of the most popular non-English-language series on Netflix, “Lupin” follows a master thief named Assane Diop navigating Paris and seeking revenge on a powerful crime family. The character is inspired by the fictional master of disguise Arsène Lupin.\n\n\tThe eight-episode fourth season will arrive around three years after the conclusion of Part 3 in October 2023.\n\t\n\n\t“Lupin” is created by George Kay in collaboration with François Uzan with the participation of Marie Roussin, Florent Meyer and Tigran Rosine. Sy, a French actor best known for co-hosting the French sketch comedy show “Service après-vente des émissions” with Fred Testot, serves as co-showrunner of “Lupin” with Louis Leterrier.\n\n\n\tThe series is loosely inspired by Maurice Leblanc’s Lupin character and is written by Mathilde Arnaud, Jean-Yves Arnaud, Florent Meyer, Tigran Rosine and Pennda Ba.

    "body": "\n\tKevin Lewis first made a name for himself in the horror community by helming the 2021 film “Willy’s Wonderland,” in which a mute Nicolas Cage plays a janitor fighting Chuck E. Cheese-esque animatronics that are possessed by the souls of cannibal serial killers. It’s quite the hook, but just as his biggest indie movie yet was taking off, his life nearly came to an end.\n\n\t“I had COVID at the time and was very close to death,” Lewis says. “I was saying goodbye to my family, and that was pretty intense. So when I got through that, it was carpe diem, seize the day.”\n\t\n\n\tIndeed, Lewis is all smiles while discussing his latest dark vision, “Pig Hill,” available Tuesday on VOD via Cineverse. Based off of a local legend out of Meadville, Pennsylvania, “Pig Hill” is about Carrie (Rainey Qualley), a woman investigating missing people in the area and is introduced to the legend of mutant inbred pig people. Things get seriously dark and surreal from there.\n\n\n\tLewis was inspired to helm this out-there vision after he read the book that Jarrod Burris’ script adapts, Nancy Williams’ novel “Pig: A Supernatural Thriller.”\n\n\t“It’s based on true folklore for decades and decades that these people have grown up with about the pig people,” Lewis says. “I just thought it was such a fascinating story. It’s a horror movie, but it’s more like psychological horror, and there’s a lot of drama to it. To me, good horror is drama. So the idea of it being grounded in something … There’s a real Pig Hill, and what’s crazy is you go to these bars and restaurants, and they’ve got pictures of missing women, like milk carton pictures, like it’s true. It’s a small town, and you go in, and they have a Pig People Beer. So the legend is really big out there.”\n\t\n\n\tAppropriately, “Pig Hill” was shot on location in Meadville, which helped Lewis achieve the spooky aesthetic he was aiming for with the material.\n\n\t“I love horror and the fact that it’s good drama,” he says. “But you can build an interesting, creative world with colors and mood and still get the truth of Meadville, and the fact that these people would exist and live in this town. So that was the balancing act.”\n\n\tWhen it comes to indie film shoots, directors are usually working against the clock with a shoestring budget. But Lewis says his brush with death changed his filmmaking philosophy, and he now embraces such challenges.\n\n\t“Going forward and making these movies, it’s very freeing,” he says. “Hollywood will beat you down, man, it’s hardcore. And I’m a hardcore boss in my head as well. So coupled with that, it’s very difficult. But ain’t nothing hardcore as what I faced in the hospital with COVID. I don’t want to say it’s a breeze, but I’m just enjoying the moment. Even when it’s tough — sometimes money falls out, or schedules shift around, can’t get the talent or whatever. I just try to enjoy the moment.”\n\n\tWith that sunny disposition, Lewis has an ever-growing list of projects he’s working on: There’s “Oak,” an urban myth about an oak tree that comes to life; a noir thriller called “Misdirection”; and a Jeremy Piven-starring horror comedy called “Driver.” He has a voracious desire to create, to try new genres, take new risks. And he’s considering his legacy as an indie filmmaker.\n\n\t“I’m just committing myself to a body of work,” Lewis says. “Some people get hung up on ‘This movie’s got to be perfect’ or ‘This, that and da, da, da.’ And I get that. I’m a little older now. I’m reflecting back on things. I just want to create and work with good people and make cool projects. Not every one is going to be A+. I’m working in the indie space, with budgets and time and all that. But I just like creating and committing to a body of work, and looking back at making a legacy, my little minuscule cinematic footprint in this world.”\n\n\tAnd when one of his movies hits the right audience, Lewis says there’s nothing like it.\n\n\t“A couple of months ago, I met a kid, and he loved ‘Willy’s Wonderland,'” he says. “It inspired him to start making movies with his iPhone. I thought, ‘That is the coolest thing.’ If someone saw my work and it inspires them, that’s what it’s all about. It’s all about paying it forward.”\n\t\n\n\tWatch the trailer for “Pig Hill” below.\n\n\n\n",

Previously, Segura served as Vice President of Membership & Industry Relations for the Recording Academy.\n\n\tAlicia Keys, artist, producer and co-founder of She Is The Music, said, “I’m so proud to welcome Laura into this role. She has spent her career lifting people up, building support systems that work, and making sure no one is left behind — and that spirit is at the heart of She Is the Music. Laura understands the challenges women face in this industry and brings the strength, clarity, and compassion needed to create real, lasting change.

Her dedication to driving meaningful change reflects the mission we set out to champion from day one. Laura brings a rare combination of vision, experience, and genuine care for the people who make this industry what it is.

Last summer, Toliver wrapped the second leg of the “Psycho Tour” with a summer run in the UK and Europe. The headline tour also saw sold-out arena shows across the U.S., including New York’s Barclays Center and Los Angeles’ Cypto.com Arena. He has landed four consecutive Top 10 debuts on the Billboard 200 with records “Heaven or Hell,” “Life of a Don,” “Love Sick,” and “Hardstone Psycho,” the latter of which landed at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart.\n\n\tHe is managed by David Stromberg, Randall “Sickamore” Medford and Erin Duran, and is represented by Wasserman Music outside of North America.\n\n\t+ Atlantic Music Group has elevated Dave Rocco to the newly created position of chief creative officer at the company. In this new role, Rocco will guide the creative strategy for the label group globally and will continue to lead the team that collaborates with the label’s roster of artists on all visual creative elements, including creative strategy, video, artwork, advertising and more.\n\n\tHe was previously president of creative, joining the label in 2024. He held prior senior roles at Spotify, Universal Music Group and the advertising agencies Deutsch LA and BBDO New York. He will continue to report to AMG Chairman and CEO Elliot Grainge.\n\n\t“For the last year, Dave has played a crucial role in reenergizing and reimagining Atlantic Music Group,” said Grainge. “His creative contributions to our organization and to our artists have been immeasurable. I’m happy to be able to promote him to this important new leadership role.”\n\t\n\n\t+ Sony Music Publishing has announced the promotion of  Jeff Smarr to senior vice president, global copyright, effective immediately. Based out of SMP’s Nashville office, Smarr — a 31-year company veteran — will continue to report to EVP of worldwide administration Dale Esworthy. In his elevated position, Jeff will take on a greater role across strategic initiatives and high-profile deal and acquisition integrations, and continue to oversee SMP’s Global and North American Copyright Administration teams.\n\n\tEsworthy said, “Jeff is our go-to expert for any copyright question or concern and is unwavering in his commitment to our songwriters and team.

    "body": "\n\tVicente Amorim, director of “Senna,” is attached to direct “The Pilgrimage,” an adaptation of Paulo Coelho’s semi-autobiographical early novel, which reunites Amorim, Netflix and Gullane after “Senna,” the biggest Brazilian TV series ever, which Amorim also directed. \n\n\tAt a Tuesday industry gathering, the first edition of Made Here – Born in Brazil, Travels the World, in other banner news, Amorim drilled down on his boarding “The Pilgrimage” in a video, saying he had met with Coelho in Geneva, Switzerland to talk about the film adaptation, originally announced last year.  \n\t\n\n\tNetflix  also unveiled a new film written by crime writer Raphael Montes, surely one of the most sought-after talents on Brazil’s TV scene, here adapting his own upcoming novel, “A Estranha na Cama.”   \n\n\n\tIn all, Netflix Brazil announced five new titles on Tuesday, including new series from Carolina Durão (“Doce Familia”) and Claudio Pavia and Maurício Farias (“Slaps & Kisses”) and a scripted reality, entitled “Sua Mãe Te Conhece,” to be hosted by actor-comedian Cláudia Raia. \n\n\tSome Born in Brazil Highlights: ‘Rauls’ and ‘Habeas Corpus’\n\n\tPart hosted by Netflix’s Elisabetta Zenatti, Netflix’s VP of content in Brazil, Haná Vaisman, head of fiction series, Elisa Chalfon, head of non-fiction, and Higia Ikeda, head of films, the Born in Brazil presentation had other highlights. \n\n\t“Rauls,” Netflix’s second project with YouTube urban rap channel phenomenon Kondzilla and LB Entertainment, was presented by its creator-producers Konrad Dantas, Kaique Alves and Felipe Braga who shared first images from the shoot.  \n\t\n\n\tFirst announced in mid-October, “Rauls” is not to be confused with the movie spin-off of “Sintonia,” Netflix’s most successful Brazilian series franchise ever, which was created by Kondzilla and LB Entertainment. \n\n\tA series, “Rauls” is set on the same poor big city outskirts but has a different story focused with a distinct lens: Cyber scams among the young, its creators said Tuesday. \n\n\tThe series has overall direction of Alves, a Konzdzilla-based creator and director of International Emmy-nominated “Escola de Quebrada” for Paramount+. “Rauls” is developed by KondZilla and LB Entertainment and produced by Manas Filmes.  The screenplay is by Thiago Dottori, Raul Perez, Donna Oliveira and Teodoro Poppovic. Executive producers are Konrad Dantas, Rita Moraes, Felipe Braga, Kaique Alves, Bel Berlinck and Joana Cooper. \n\n\tNetflix also sneak peeked “Habeas Corpus,” which also went into production in November, a courtroom drama headed by Marjorie Estiano, star of “Under Pressure,” and actor-singer-dancer Any Gabrielly, the voice of Moana in the Brazilian dub of the Disney franchise. The series is inspired by the work of the Innocence Project Brasil, a Brazilian organization dedicated to overturning wrongful convictions. Directed by Luiz Villaça, who co-created the series alongside Leonardo Moreira and Donna Oliveira, “Habeas Corpus” is produced by Café Royal. Adriana Tavares serves as executive producer.\n\n\tNetflix’s showcase was far more than a new title unveil, however, weighing in as a celebration of where it’s at with Brazil’s creative community, its maturing as a company in Brazil and a reminder of its part in Brazil’s border-busting wave of hits which takes Brazilian culture to the world. \n\n\tFive salient points and the a closer look at the five new titles: \n\n\tIt’s Not Just Oscar and Big-Fest Movies That Are Taking Brazilian Talent to the World\n\n\tThe showcase came a day after Kleber Mendonça Filho’s Cannes winner “The Secret Agent” broke historical records for a Brazilia film, scoring Golden Globe nominations for best drama, best motion picture – non-English-language  and male actor, motion picture – drama for Wagner Moura. \n\n\tNetflix is taking Brazilian titles to the world, however, with at least 17 by Variety’s count scoring berths in the U.S. streaming giant’s Global Top 10 from June of this year. Netflix execs drilled down on some big highlights during the second half of 2025, such as movie “Caramelo,” Netflix No. 1 non-English film in the world over Oct.6-19, and “Rulers of Fortune” (“Os Donos do Jogo”) Global No. 1 over Nov. 3-9. 2025 has seen a step-up in Netflix’s Brazilian global hits, Zanetti recognized to Variety. It’s been “an incredible year for Brazilian content on Netflix,” she added.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix Drives Into Movies\n\n\tWhen Walter Salles’ “I’m Still Here” won this year’s Oscar for International Feature Film, Brazilians at Carnival celebrated as if Brazil had won the World Cup. In 2025, Netflix licensed 55 Brazilian movies. “We believe that licensing is a way to honor our culture, to allow more people to access what we create and to help preserve the memory of our audiovisual industry. When we pre-license, the goal is to help make projects viable and open the door for additional funders to come on board,” Zanetti told Variety. The policy is also paying dividends. Of the 17 Netflix Global Top 10 Brazilian hits second half of 2025, 13 have been features. Upcoming titles include Gabriel Mascaro’s “The Blue Trail,” a Berlin 2025 Grand Jury Prize winner, and Mendonça Filho’s Cannes competition contender “Bacurau,” released Dec. 13, three days before the International Feature Oscar shortlist is announced. \n\n\tProgram Diversity\n\n\tThe Netflix revolution began by launching cinematographic-quality premium TV series around the world, such as Brazil’s “3%,” its second totally non-English-language series anywhere in the world. Diversifying in programming, Netflix is ever more much more. Its May announcement of 10 new titles included three documentaries and a reality show. It is now announcing a new reality show, “Sua Mãe Te Conhece.” This broadening of scope is also seen in its programming types. “Habeas Corpus” weighs in as Netflix’s first Brazilian legal drama; “Fazenda Colonial,” announced in May, is Netflix’s first horror film from Brazil. “What you’re seeing now is the result of a more mature market and a more confident creative ecosystem, which allows us to invest across genres and formats with the same ambition,” Zanetti told Variety.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(L-R) Marjorie Estiano as Inez, Any Gabrielly as Marina in Habeas Corpus. Cr. Julia Mataruna/Netflix © 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJulia Mataruna/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNetflix’s ‘New Original Melodrama’   \n\n\tIn 2024, Netflix scored one of its biggest hits of the year with what it hailed as its first Brazilian melodrama, “Desperate Lies,” in which a woman leaves her husband and is raped on a night out, only to discover she’s is carrying two babies with DNA from two different men. Comprising 17 episodes, “Desperate Lies” ran six weeks in Netflix’s Global Top 10 over July 1-Aug. 11, 2024, hitting No. 1 over July 8-21. Hardly surprisingly, Netflix has now announced a second melodrama, produced by Amaia and top production house Conspiraçao. “A blend between series and novelas, not only in episode count but also in its pacing. It’s more agile and dynamic,” Zanetti told Variety. \n\t\n\n\tA closer look at the five new titles announced on Tuesday:\n\n\t“Os 12 Signos de Valentina,” (Carolina Durão, Boutique Filmes) \n\n\tShowrun by Durão, who helmed Globoplay’s “Rensga Hits!” and Netflix Global Top 10 movie “Doce Familia,” and created and co-written by Ray Tavares, a scripted romcom YA demo play: Valentina’s boy-friend cheats on her, and she’s told their problem was astronomical incompatibility. So she determines to date men of every zodiac sign and share her experiences in a videocast. From “3%” backer Boutique Filmes.\n\n\t“As Crianças Estão de Volta,” (Claudio Pavia, Maurício Farias, A Fábrica)\n\n\tA scripted family drama series for all ages, plumbing the complexities of multi-generational life. A couple move to seaside Paraty to enjoy life as empty nesters until their adult children return home, forcing them to back-burner personal dreams and priorities. Claudio Pavia (“Cine Holliúdy”) writes, reuniting with director Maurício Farias after “Slaps & Kisses.”  “As Crianças” will be produced by A Fábrica, behind “Vai Que Cola,”Brazil’s biggest pay TV comedy, and “Desperate Lies.”\n\n\t“A Estranha na Cama,” (Raphael Montes, Esmir Filho, A Fabrica,  \n\n\tThe third title this year from the in-demand Montes, after HBO hit “Scars of Beauty” and Globoplay hit “Perfect Days,” this time Montes adapting his own novel. It looks like a typically dark psychological thriller for Montes: When a young couple invites a third woman via a sex app and she dies during the encounter, they must cover up the incident, while a mysterious blackmailer emerges. \n\n\t“The Pilgrimage,” (Vicente Amorim, Gullane)\n\n\tPaulo, a young writer is challenged by a mystic order to walk the St. James Way across Northern Spain to Santiago de Compostela. “On this path, filled with mysteries and trials, Paulo must confront his deepest fears and battle his inner demons. The film is a story of courage, resilience, and the quest for the true meaning of life,” Netflix said Tuesday, also announcing that Amorim will direct.\n\n\t*“Sua Mãe Te Conhece” (BoxFish)\n\n\tLiterally, “Your Mum Knows You,” though the title, a scripted reality contest, asks if that’s really true. “Nine mothers compete to prove they know their adult children best, wagering money on predicting their choices – only to discover that their children can still surprise them,” the logline runs. Blending humor, emotion, and cultural resonance, Netflix anticipates, a production by BoxFish (“The Hotel,” “Otro día perdido”) headed by ex-Cuatro Cabezas Diego Guebel, and hosted by actor, comedian and mother Cláudia Raia (“Bellísima”).\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClaudia Raia in Sua Mae Te Conhece. Cr. Nat Odenbreit/Netflix © 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNat Odenbreit/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHere’s Variety’s full interview with Elisabetta Zanetti, Netflix Brazil Content VP:\n\n\tOne focus of Made Here – Born in Brazil. Travels the World is the global success of Brazilian films and series on Netflix. I count 13 Netflix Brazilian movies in its global top 10 non-English films in the second half of this year. Did 2025 see a step-up in Netflix’s Brazilian global hits?\n\n\tAbsolutely. 2025 has truly been an incredible year for Brazilian content on Netflix. Series like “Criminal Code,” “Rivers of Fate” and “Rulers of Fortune”; films such as “Caramelo” and “The Son of a Thousand Men”; docs like “Vini Jr.” and “Eloá the Hostage: Live on TV” and realities like “Stranded With My Mother-In-Law” were created, developed and produced to the Brazilian audience, but, as truly authentic stories, they resonated so well with the local audience that they expanded their reach worldwide. We’ve always believed in the power of Brazilian storytelling, and this year reaffirmed that vision: titles sparked conversations and connected with audiences worldwide. It’s a testament to the boldness, experimentation and creative risks driving the industry forward and evolving from local recognition to global influence. Each success boosts our partnerships with the local creative community to take Brazilian culture even further.\n\n\tI sense that the presentation will say that it’s marvellous “I’m Still Here” won the Oscar and “The Blue Trail “the second biggest prize at Berlin Festival this year, but in fact Brazil’s success outside Brazil is broader, via Netflix. I believe you will also talk about Netflix’s drive into licensing films in that you licensed 55 Brazilian films in 2025. How many were first run and how many library titles, as it were?\n\n\tIt’s a balance, a strong mix of first-run titles like “Virtuosas” and “A Melhor Mãe do Mundo” and library classics such as “Central do Brasil” and “Carandiru.”Our licensing strategy focuses on variety of stories, in different genres and formats, so that every Brazilian can find something that resonates with them. We believe that licensing is a way to honor our culture, to allow more people to access what we create and to help preserve the memory of our audiovisual industry. When we pre-license, the goal is to help make projects viable and open the door for additional funders to come on board. It’s a way to collaborate with the independent market. And when these projects arrive on Netflix, they gain massive visibility. That makes a real difference – just remember the incredible reach of “Inexplicável” and “Homem com H,” even after a successful theatrical release before streaming on Netflix.\n\t\n\n\tGiven the huge excitement at the international recognition of Brazilian cinema in awards, box office and sales, could you see Netflix licensing even more Brazilian movies in 2026 (though 55 is I think already a large number)?\n\n\tOur focus continues to be looking for great stories. There is incredible creative talent in the Brazilian audiovisual market, and there is room for a wide variety of narratives. We are constantly looking at new opportunities and negotiating to bring even more films to our catalog, building on the strong foundation we established this year.\n\n\tNetflix lifted off to global excitement releasing principally series from 2015 which were premium series made with high production values and a cinematographic flair. 10 years later if you put together the new productions announced in May and on Tuesday, just  5 of the 15 are series. It’s clear that Netflix in Brazil had broadened its programming base in the types of originals you’re producing…. Do you see any trends in the kind of shows or films you are making now?\n\n\tWe’re intentionally strengthening a broad and balanced slate in Brazil. Our focus isn’t on prioritizing one format over another, but on developing great stories in scripted series, films, documentaries and non-fiction that can truly connect with a diverse and wide audience. What you’re seeing now is the result of a more mature market and a more confident creative ecosystem, which allows us to invest across genres and formats with the same ambition.  There isn’t a specific trend we’re chasing. What truly guides us is the priority to develop stories that will genuinely entertain our Brazilian members.\n\n\tA written stateent from Netflix mentions its second original melodrama. Would that be a briefer telenovela? And surely a lot of Netflix shows and films have an element of melodrama, which is part of the DNA of Latin entertainment…. \n\n\tNetflix’s first Brazilian melodrama was Pedaço de Mim (Desperate Lies) and it already had a longer episode count than a traditional series though still much shorter than the 150/180-episode novelas Brazilians are used to. This new melodrama will follow the same path: a blend between series and novelas, not only in episode count but also in its pacing. It’s more agile and dynamic, with a more concise set of characters, while still embracing strong melodramatic elements, including multiple parallel storylines, not just those of the protagonists. \n\t\n\n\tAnd yes, you’re right that some of our titles do incorporate melodramatic elements. The most recent one was “Os Donos do Jogo” (“Rulers of Fortune”), which beyond portraying Rio’s mafia, also brought in intrigue, revenge, love, and betrayal among rival families.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJason Bateman said in an interview with Esquire magazine that he reads all the reviews for his television shows and movies because “I am a people pleaser. I care about what people think about me.”\n\n\t“I read all the reviews. I am doing these projects for public consumption, so it matters to me what the public thinks about them,” Bateman said. “It matters to me what critics think about them. But what’s most important is that the weather inside is 72 and breezy. It takes a lot of work to stay happy, to stay clear, and to be proud of yourself. You can try to drink through it, but you’re sober in the morning and you got to live in those hours too.”\n\t\n\n\tBateman said one negative review from his career stands out: “I got a terrible review from The New York Times on the pilot of ‘Ozark.’ Mike Hale basically said I was so boring to watch, it reminded him of the person that he buys a ticket from in the airport. I laughed my ass off. I appreciate those that get creative with it.”\n\n\n\tHale wrote in his “Ozark” pan that Bateman plays his character “with the aggressive blandness of an airline gate agent,” adding: “The real saving grace of the show — and an almost sufficient reason to watch — is Laura Linney. Mr. Bateman isn’t really able to make a compelling character out of the blankly craven Marty, but Ms. Linney, with her gift for high-comic indignation, makes Wendy at once hilarious and sympathetic. If there’s a Season 2, maybe she can take over the business.”\n\n\tNot everyone agreed with The New York Times, however. Over the course of “Ozark’s” four-season run on Netflix, Bateman was nominated four times at the Emmys for outstanding lead actor in a drama series. He also picked up three Golden Globe nominations and four Screen Actors Guild nominations.\n\t\n\n\tHead over to Esquire magazine’s website to read Bateman’s interview in its entirety.\n",

    "body": "\n\tDaisy Ridley starred as Rey opposite Adam Driver as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo in three “Star Wars” movies between 2015 and 2019, so consider her shocked when news broke in October about the scrapped standalone “Star Wars” movie “The Hunt for Ben Solo.” Driver revealed the film’s existence in an interview with the Associated Press, explaining he had been developing a Ben Solo movie for two years with director Steven Soderbergh. Then Disney executives pulled the plug on them.\n\t\n\n\t“I knew a piece of it. I heard rumblings,” Ridley told IGN. “I have lots of friends who are crew, so things always travel like that. But, whoa! When the story came out, no, I was like, ‘Oh, my God!’ And it was him that said it, right? It was funny because, like, ‘Oh, wow, Adam is saying it,’ and that’s the big surprise of the year.”\n\n\n\tRidley is no stranger to dealing with divisive “Star Wars” fans given the polarizing responses to “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” which is why it was so heartening to see the fandom come together in support of “The Hunt for Ben Solo.”\n\n\t“I do love when there is a collective of positivity,” Ridley said. “The way the internet seems to have rallied to try and get it to happen. It’s fantastic for us all. It’s good for us to all be united about something in a really positive way. Obviously, everyone knows he was a very popular character, but it was also lovely to think, ‘Wow, people really, really care and want this.’ I just… I like it.”\n\n\t“I like when people join forces — excuse the pun — from all around the world, all different sorts of people,” she continued. “I just love that the ‘Star Wars’ fandom is such a huge and gorgeous array of different points of view and different people, and the fact that everyone is really behind this thing, I think, is just sort of lovely, in a time that is so fucking nuts for probably every single person on this Earth. I think it’s wonderful. So I was surprised, and honestly, I felt joyful about how it went down.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Hunt for Ben Solo” would have taken place after the events of “The Rise of Skywalker.” According to Driver, Soderbergh worked on the script with his “Logan Lucky” scribe Rebecca Blunt and longtime collaborator Scott Z. Burns (“Contagion,” “The Informant!”). Driver starred in Soderbergh’s “Logan Lucky” and Burns’ “The Report.”\n\n\t“I always was interested in doing another ‘Star Wars,’” Driver told the AP. “I had been talking about doing another one since 2021. Kathleen [Kennedy] had reached out. I always said: ‘With a great director and a great story, I’d be there in a second.’ I loved that character and loved playing him.”\n\n\tDriver loved “The Hunt for Ben Solo” script, calling it the “standard” of what a “Star Wars” movie “should be” and comparing it to the “handmade and character-driven” feel of “The Empire Strikes Back.” The Oscar nominee said Lucasfilm execs Kathleen Kennedy, Dave Filoni and Cary Beck backed the project until Disney shut it down.\n\n\t“We presented the script to Lucasfilm. They loved the idea,” Driver recalled. “They totally understood our angle and why we were doing it. We took it to Bob Iger and Alan Bergman, and they said no. They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.”\n\n\tDriver’s interview mobilized “Star Wars” fans on social media into calling for Disney to reverse its decision and put “The Hunt for Ben Solo” back in development. A group of “Star Wars” fans even paid for a plane to fly a banner reading “Save ‘The Hunt for Ben Solo’” over Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Netflix and Paramount began their fight for control of Warner Bros. this week, each sought to reassure the creative community that the outcome will mean more content and more jobs.\n\n\tBut Hollywood union leaders have seen that movie before, and have every reason to be skeptical. \n\n\t“We’ve seen in the past how these mergers have impacted workers,” says Lindsay Dougherty, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 399. “It’s never been good. It’s never created jobs. We have never seen the benefit for working people.”\n\t\n\n\tNetflix’s deal to buy Warner Bros. follows a brutal five-year stretch for the entertainment business, which has been buffeted by the pandemic, two strikes and an unshakable slump in global production. So when the deal was announced on Dec. 5, few were disposed to be optimistic. \n\n\n\t“This has created so much concern because we’re at the tipping point,” says Susan Sprung, CEO of the Producers Guild of America. “It’s suddenly hit people that there are going to be almost no places to sell.”\n\n\tThe standard antitrust analysis of the deal would focus on its impact on consumers. But regulators are also expected to consider how a merger will affect producers, writers, directors, actors and crew members.\n\n\tNetflix is either the largest streaming service or, if YouTube is counted, the second largest. Much of the initial discussion about the merger has focused on whether putting HBO Max under the same tent would give Netflix de facto monopoly power to raise prices.\n\n\tBut under the Biden administration, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission added labor market impacts to the list of criteria for evaluating mergers. That means the Trump administration could choose to go after Netflix as an unlawful monopsony — that is, a dominant buyer with the power to dictate terms to the creators of movies and TV shows. \n\t\n\n\t“I think there’s definitely a possibility,” says David Berger, a Duke University professor who has studied monopsonies in labor markets. “There has to be some small non-transitory change that permanently harms some class of workers in some market. It doesn’t need to be a huge class of workers. If it’s elite producers, that could be enough to form a viable worker claim.”\n\n\tUnions are already warning that any sale — whether to Paramount or Netflix — will drive down wages and result in less content, not more. The Writers Guild of America has blasted both suitors, saying they would be bad for writers. The Directors Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA have struck a more measured tone, saying they have questions and concerns without taking a firm position. \n\n\tThe Justice Department and the FTC — one of which will take the lead in evaluating the deal — each declined to comment. The transaction will also have to pass muster with European Union regulators and other agencies around the globe. It could also be reviewed by state attorneys general.\n\n\tThe California attorney general’s office declined to comment on whether it will investigate, but said that “further consolidation in markets that are central to American economic life — whether in the financial, airline, grocery, or broadcasting and entertainment markets — does not serve the American economy, consumers, or competition well.”\n\n\tThe AG’s office continued: “We are committed to protecting consumers and California’s economy from consolidation we find unlawful.” \n\n\tNetflix points out that it accounts for just 8% of all TV viewership, according to Nielsen data. HBO Max would add another 1.3% — hardly making the combined entity a dominant player. But that argument depends on a large denominator. If the market is limited to paid streaming TV, the combined entitywould account for nearly a third of viewership — enough to potentially trigger regulatory concern.\n\n\tTheater owners have also raised alarms about the impact on their business. Netflix could shorten theatrical windows for Warner Bros. releases, favoring its direct-to-consumer platforms. That sort of vertical integration could also be the basis for antitrust scrutiny.\n\n\t“The antitrust agencies have been more interested in vertical aspects,” says Jennifer Dixton, a former DOJ assistant chief who teaches at UCLA School of Law. “They would look at how this would affect theater owners and cinemas.”\n\t\n\n\tRegulators might have the most luck bringing a monopsony case — technically, an oligopsony case — similar to the one that blocked the merger of Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster. In that instance, the government argued that consolidation would reduce the number of buyers for book authors who make advances of at least $250,000.\n\n\tThe WGA has been warning for years that a comparable dynamic was unfolding in the TV and film business. It opposed the merger of Disney and Fox in 2017, saying that the combined company would become a “dominant” firm, controlling 28% of the market for writers’ work.\n\n\tSome have speculated that Paramount might have an easier time winning approval from the Justice Department, as it is a smaller player in streaming. But from the WGA’s perspective, both deals are bad. The union’s hope is for Warner Bros. to remain a stand-alone company.\n\n\t“The problem is the acquisition and pending consolidation of two media giants, not who the buyer is,” the WGA said in a statement Dec. 8. “These companies should be focused on investing in their own businesses rather than wasting tens of billions to buy up the competition.”\n",

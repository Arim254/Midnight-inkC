    "body": "\n\tPathé, the French production and exhibition powerhouse which is turning 130 next year, is getting ready to reboot its U.K. production division and make a big push in the English language landscape. The Paris-based company has hired FilmNation’s president of motion pictures Ben Browning as co-CEO of Pathé U.K. and has also tapped him to become president of global film, a newly created position. \n\n\tBrowning will join forces with Faith Penhale, Pathé UK’s co CEO to drive the expansion of the studio’s activities across both English-language film and television. Both will report to Ardavan Safaee, Pathé Films chairman. \n\t\n\n\tAn Oscar-nominated and BAFTA-winning producer, Browning has served as president of motion pictures at FilmNation since 2023 and was first appointed president of production and acquisitions in 2014. Under Browning’s tenure, FilmNation produced a raft of hits including “Arrival,” “The Big Sick,” “Promising Young Woman,” “Conclave” and “Anora.” While Pathé is best known for ambitious French movies, such as “The Count of Monte Cristo” and “The Three Musketeers,” it’s also delivered a few critical and commercial hits in the English-language space, notably “CODA” which won three Oscars including best picture in 2022. Prior to that, Pathé made “Slumdog Millionaire” with Danny Boyle which won eight Oscars, among others. \n\n\n\tPathé’s push in the prestige English language production space comes several months after welcoming a new shareholder, Rodolphe Saadé, a French-Lebanese shipping billionaire who 20% stake in May. \n\n\tWith Browning and Penhale on board, Pathé will now look produce and finance British and European films with global appeal, as well as premium television series.\n\t\n\n\t“We are delighted to announce that Ben has chosen to join Pathé in spearheading the revitalization of our international film lineup,” said Safaee. “His extensive experience, distinguished reputation, and impeccable taste align perfectly with our vision to establish Pathé as a leading European studio. With Faith by his side, we are confident that we have assembled a formidable team poised to realize this ambitious goal,” Safaee continued. \n\n\tBrowning, meanwhile, said: “I am sincerely grateful for the trust Jérôme Seydoux, Ardavan Safaee and Faith Penhale are placing in me to help lead this move back into global film for Pathé — a legendary company that means so much to all lovers of cinema.”\n\n\tPenhale said she has “known and admired Ben for years, his taste and passion is symbiotic with that of Pathé’s, with a dedication to identifying and supporting with the most exciting film-maker talent.” \n\n\t“We are fortunate at Pathé to have the independence and confidence to build for the long term and I’m looking forward to working with Ben and leading Pathé UK into a new era, as we create a thriving and diverse slate across film and television and a stimulating, supportive talent centered environment,” Penhale continued. \n\n\tUpcoming Pathé productions include “Bunker,” Florian Zeller’s next film starring Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem; as well as “Karma” by Guillaume Canet, starring Marion Cotillard; and “The Unknown” by Arthur Harari, the Oscar-winning co-screenwriter of “Anatomy of a Fall,” starring Léa Seydoux.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNorway’s Gudny Hummelvoll, producer of “Billionaire Island,” “Headhunters” and “Occupied,” and heavyweight Estonian producer Jevgeni Supin, behind international historical series “Von Fock,” will be the recipients of this year’s Honorary TV Beats Producer Awards. \n\n\tAdjudicated by the TV Beats Forum, the drama series strand of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, the industry arena of the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, the awards will be presented at the TV Beats Forum on Nov. 18, followed by a fireside chat with Hummelvoll, Supin and Marike Muselaers.\n\t\n\n\t“The decision to present two awards this year reflects the event’s desire to bring attention to the producer’s pivotal role in the  audiovisual industry – without their dedication, enthusiasm, dynamism, resourcefulness and sheer willpower a lot of the content that the audiences enjoy and gravitate to simply wouldn’t exist,” said Petri Kemppinen and Roosa Toivonen, co-heads of Tallinn’s TV Beats Forum.\n\n\n\t“Working as a producer in smaller countries where the home market cannot fully sustain a global ambition level is even more challenging, yet this year’s recipients have overcome even this obstacle,” they added.\n\n\tFounder and CEO of Hummelfilm, Hummlevol has emerged as an industry leader in a national production sector, Norway’s, which punches far above it weight, as seen in the number of prizes and selections it earns at key TV festivals in Europe such as Series Mania and Canneseries. \n\n\tBoth producers show large ambition. “Boasting one of the biggest original leaps of imagination of any series coming out of Europe,” Variety said when it premiered “Occupied,” based on a Jo Nesbit novel which posited Russia’s occupation of Norway, was billed as Norway’s biggest TV series to date It also grabbed a 53.4% share on Norway’s TV2. Hummelvol has also show how locally-rooted stories can hit global stages, 2024 “Billionaire Island,” hailed as Succession with salmon, a cutthroat battle for control of a local salmon industry in Norway, was a Netflix and critical hit. \n\t\n\n\tBeyond Hummelvol’s creative achievements, she has been a tireless advocate for collaboration, diversity, and mentorship within the European production community and has served as the first female President of the European Producers Club, championing her producer colleagues throughout challenging years of COVID-19 and post pandemic disruption. \n\n\tSupin, like Hummelvoll, work international co-production, making a virtue out of necessity. He also has shown large – and successful ambition. \n\n\tProducer of the first Estonian Viaplay original, “Who Shot Otto Mueller,” in September last year, he unveiled to Variety a slate of five high-end dramas, including “My Dear Mother” repped by Film.UA Group and “Von Fock.” The latter is a crime drama, but set in the early 19th century, allowing for liberal resort to Estonia’s historical patrimony. It was also the first Estonian series ever to receive support from both Creative Europe’s Media Program and Eurimages’ pilot program for series co-productions. Also set up at Supin’s fast-expanding Zolba Productions, “My Dear Mother,” produced with the Ukraine, is one of the most anticipated of Estonian dramas. \n\n\tAdvocating, promoting and supporting fellow producers, Supin was the first head of what has become the Baltic TV Beats Forum. His award celebrates his commitment and efforts to make Baltic voices resonate globally.\n",

Rodriguez plays Deputy Salazar while Emery plays Deputy Flynn. Branton Box, who plays Sheriff Johnny, will return in a guest star role. \n\n\tAs previously reported, Brittany Snow, Malin Akerman, Jaime Ray Newman, Dermot Mulroney, Evan Jonigkeit, and George Ferrier will all return for Season 2. The official logline for the second season states, “Sophie (Snow) and Margo (Akerman) are on the outs. But soon enough, old secrets and new foes force them back together. As they play their dangerous games the question arises. Are they the hunters or the hunted?”\n\t\n\n\t“The Hunting Wives” is based on the book of the same name by May Cobb. The series is produced by Lionsgate TV and 3 Arts Entertainment. Rebecca Cutter developed the series for television and serves as showrunner and executive producer. Erwin Stoff of 3 Arts Entertainment also executive produces along with Cobb. \n\n\n\tThe series originally debuted on Netflix on July 21 and ultimately spent five weeks on the Global Top 10 English language TV list, though it was only available in the US. It was originally set up at Starz before Netflix acquired the US rights, with the international rights being a key sticking point in the eventual Season 2 renewal. The second season will now be available in nearly all countries where Netflix is available. \n",

    "body": "\n\tMusic producer and songwriter Benny Blanco never invested money before meeting Phil Sarna, the senior managing director and founder of PS Business Management. “When I first met Phil, I had $26,000 in my bank account. I remember I went in there and I said, ‘Do I have enough to invest?’ And he kind of laughed at me, but for some reason, saw something in me and worked as my business manager,” Blanco reflected when introducing Sarna at the Variety Business Managers Breakfast, presented by City National Bank on Nov. 13 in West Hollywood.\n\t\n\n\tSarna was being honored with the Business Manager of the Year award at the event, which saw dozens of the entertainment industry’s top execs gather to celebrate Sarna and learn from additional conversations and speakers about their value to creatives.\n\n\tIn Sarna’s case, he launched PS Business Management as his own firm in 2002. Today, the firm’s clientele not only includes Blanco, but also Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Chappell Roan, Benson Boone, Duran Duran and other leading names in music, film, television, sports and fashion. \n\n\tAccepting the award and addressing the room full of managers, Sarna thanked his family, clients and partners for their support. “We spend a good chunk of our adult life together in service to great artists. It’s been challenging, but fun. It’s unbelievable that this is our jobs,” he said.\n\n\tHe shared some of the various tasks that he’s taken on as a manager, from helping creatives start businesses, to getting his clients in and out of rehab. “Going to business school and working in accounting and finance never really prepared me for this unique experience,” he explained with gratitude.\n\t\n\n\tThe event also included remarks from featured speaker Courtney B. Vance, the actor serving as president and chairman of the board at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation. He reflected on the importance of the organization, which provides actors with resources to strengthen their crafts and support themselves. “We believe that it is a duty and an obligation to help those in need within our own entertainment industry community,” said Vance before acknowledging the vital role that business managers play in helping actors and other creators thrive.\n\n\tVance then presented a new SAG-AFTRA Foundation PSA video, featuring the cast of Apple TV’s “The Studio.” Filmed in the theater at the Foundation’s Meryl Streep Center for Performing Artists in Los Angeles, it features Kathryn Hahn, Chase Sui Wonders and Ike Barinholtz wittily teaching Seth Rogen about the services the Foundation provides, with a special cameo from Bryan Cranston at the end. “They knocked out this video about 10 minutes,” said Vance. “It’s amazing, what you can do when you know what you do.”\n\n\tVariety‘s co-editor-in-chief Cynthia Littleton also hosted a keynote conversation with Focus Features chairman Peter Kujawski at the top of the event. They discussed the distributor’s current and upcoming releases, including “Bugonia,” “Hamnet” and “Song Sung Blue” from business as well as creative perspectives. While acknowledging that some films can exist to make money, Kujawaski said, “There are some stories that just have to be told. And even if it is like a completely unsustainable business model, sometimes you have to figure out a way to tell those stories. And I think everyone exists on that spectrum in some place. Every film exists somewhere on that spectrum.”\n\n\tWhether they’re serving creative visions or fiscal security, the business managers help artists navigate the tricky world of finances. Blanco put have put it best to the managers: “On behalf of every artist who asked all you guys the stupidest questions in the world, thank you for making us not lose all of our money.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe founder and CEO of Vue Entertainment, the largest privately owned cinema operator in Europe, has written a public letter attacking the controversial deal Imax signed with Netflix giving Greta Gerwig’s upcoming “Narnia” an exclusive two-week theatrical run on its screens.\n\n\tWhile the deal, first announced in January, led to reports of significant discontent from within the exhibition industry, the letter from Tim Richards — shared exclusively with Variety — marks the first time it’s been expressed formally.\n\t\n\n\tIn the letter, Richards asserts that both audiences and the industry itself will “lose” out from the deal and warns that Imax CEO Richard Gelfond’s claims that he’s looking to secure further exclusivity arrangements will be even more damaging.\n\n\n\t“It risks undermining the very ecosystem that makes theatrical success possible,” he said, noting that Gerwig’s “Barbie” managed to achieve its phenomenal box office success without a release on Imax (which he also claimed was “no longer” the most technically advanced Premium Large Format).\n\n\tRichards also referenced the “nuclear option,” raised by Gelfond to ensure his Narnia deal remained in place. This is understood to be a way of legally enforcing theaters to show “Narnia” on their Imax screens.\n\n\t“The industry should never try to convince audiences that there is only one way to enjoy a great film,” he concluded.\n\n\tSee the full letter from Tim Richards below:\n\n\tIMAX is proudly promoting its deal to screen The Chronicles of Narnia, Greta Gerwig’s highly anticipated first feature film since Barbie, despite it being a Netflix production released under an unusual “2 + 2” model, just two weeks in IMAX theatres, followed by two dark weeks before being released to Netflix subscribers at home.\n\t\n\n\tAs a result, Narnia will not be watched by audiences on 99% of cinema screens worldwide. It will only play on IMAX screens owned by operators willing to break established theatrical release windows. Those who choose to respect the established theatrical release window, have been threatened by IMAX with a “nuclear option” if they do not play it.\n\n\tThe outcome? IMAX and Netflix may enjoy a short-term gain, but the industry and audiences around the world — will lose. Millions of families who would love to watch Narnia at a theatre, will be needlessly deprived of the opportunity.\n\n\tAll other premium large formats (PLFs), including Dolby Cinemas, Cinemark’s XD screens and others, that consistently out-gross IMAX screens, will also be unable to show Narnia.\n\n\tIMAX has not only agreed to this restrictive model but appears to be encouraging other filmmakers to follow suit. In doing so, it risks undermining the very ecosystem that makes theatrical success possible.\n\n\tIMAX is one of many PLF options available to audiences globally. With less than 1% of screens worldwide, it is not singularly critical to the launch or success of any film — as proven by Barbie, which was not released in IMAX, yet went on to gross $1.5 billion and play theatrically around the world for several months. As Greta Gerwig stated “In my heart of hearts, I want audiences to see my movie in Dolby Vision with an [Dolby] Atmos mix because, to me, that’s the way I’ve most felt like….Ah! That’s my movie!“\n\n\tProjection and sound technologies have evolved dramatically in recent years. Dolby, Christie, and Barco’s new HDR projectors all deliver market leading images, while Dolby Atmos, with its 64-channel immersive sound, remains the industry benchmark and filmmakers’ first choice for audio.\n\n\tIMAX offers a strong product, but they are no longer the technological leaders they once were, and they represent a minority of the PLF box office market share globally. The industry can, and should, coexist by working collaboratively with our true partners, the studios, and by focusing on what matters most: delivering the very best experience for our customers. The industry should never try to convince audiences that there is only one way to enjoy a great film.\n\n\tTim RichardsFounder & CEO of Vue Entertainment and former Chair of the British Film Institute\n",

    "body": "\n\tWith the release of her expansive orchestral LP “Lux,” Rosalía has hit another landmark moment in her career. The singer celebrates her first-ever top 10 album as the 15-song (18-song on CD and vinyl) set debuts at No. 4 powered by a personal-best week of 46,000 equivalent album units, according to Luminate.\n\n\tHer fourth studio record — featuring Björk, Yves Tumor, Carminho, Estrella Morente, Sílvia Pérez Cruz and Yahritza y su Esencia — collected 34 million official streams and 19,000 sales. Rosalía previously charted one album on the Billboard 200, her experimental “Motomami,” which debuted and peaked at No. 33.\n\t\n\n\t“Lux” was introduced with the single “Berghain,” while its first-week sales were propelled by physical sales of four CD boxed sets and a pair of distinct vinyl LPs (one signed by Rosalía), along with a standard CD and digital download album. \n\n\t“The word ‘lux’ has always been circling in my mind,” Rosalía told the Spanish newspaper El País. “Suddenly, I understood why I was thinking about it so much. And all of that was happening while the ‘Motomami’ tour was going on. It was: now I’ll let myself feel this way, compose from this place, now is the moment.”\n\n\tThe only other new arrival in the top tier of the Billboard 200 this week comes from Tomorrow X Together’s Yeonjun. His debut project, “No Labels: Part 01,” enters at No. 10 with 29,000 equivalent album units earned, including 27,000 in album sales — a number largely driven by its multiple CD iterations. Olivia Dean’s “The Art of Loving,” meanwhile, reaches a new height as it climbs 7-5 with 41,000 equivalent album units earned. \n\t\n\n\tThe remainder of the top 10 is led by Taylor Swift’s “The Life of a Showgirl” as the record spends a sixth consecutive week at No. 1 with 110,000 units. Swift becomes only the second artist in 2025 to see an album spend its first six weeks at No. 1, following Morgan Wallen’s “I’m the Problem.”\n",

Scientology came into play when prosecutors argued women are discouraged and sometimes faced with threats if they report high-profile church members to the police.\n      \n    \n          In the papers, Masterson's lawyers claim legal counsel for the Church of Scientology recommended Cohen call a Scientologist to rebut the claim -- but Cohen never did. Instead, he says Cohen just questioned why Scientology was being made a focal point.\n      \n    \n          Masterson argues that \"the jury saw only the tip of the iceberg of available defense evidence in the form of the complaining witnesses' inconsistent statements while the wealth of directly exculpatory evidence went unused for no viable tactical reason.”\n      \n    \n          Masterson is currently locked up at California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo, serving 30 years to life for 2023 rape convictions.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Danny Masterson\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Rape and Sexual Assault\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

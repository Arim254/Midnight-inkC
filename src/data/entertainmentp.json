Tommy (Billy Bob Thornton) has to deal with being fired by Cami (Demi Moore), Cooper (Jacob Lofland) has to beat a murder charge and Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) has to learn a lesson — all of which wrap up in a satisfying way. Join us for one last trip to Texas this season with the recap below.\n\t\n\n\nI’m not trying to be indelicate, but Tommy and his family have to move out of this company house now that he’s fired, right?\n“For trying to run the company like a business, instead of a memento or a dream or whatever the hell motivates her” — Tommy is really breaking it down, much like the fans who have been yelling at their TV.\nDale (James Jordan) is a real one for his loyalty. Respect!\nTommy, just let T.L. (Sam Elliott) enjoy his (very!) young companion (Francesca Xuereb).\n“She ain’t gonna fire you. She could do that over the phone.” Ouch, Tommy!\nDamn, Gallino (Andy Garcia) has a nice house. I guess that happens when you’re a drug kingpin!\nCan’t they clean up Ariana (Paulina Chávez) and her wounds better?\nAww, cute baby!\nOh, Paigyn (Bobbi Salvör Menuez) is back!\nAinsley (Michelle Randolph) never had to work out in high school?\nOh, huh … Paigyn is actually smart and nice …\n“He was no longer a threat.” Um, Johnny (Mike Harkins) seemed very threatening! Cooper neutralized the situation and detained the rapist. End of discussion.\nJohnny died? Hooray!\nCalling Rebecca (Kayla Wallace) is smart! She must know some sharks.\nOh, damn, Rebecca is already on it.\nHell yeah, Ariana — let these cops have the business!\n“Who the fuck did he murder?” Tommy, understandably confused.\nOK, I do like the friendship between Angela (Ali Larter) and Bella (Stefania Spampinato).\nEek, Angela is going to murder Tommy.\nOh, OK — crisis quickly averted.\nWow, how did Tommy completely avoid that car crash?!? Very “Final Destination”!\n“Everyone with a law degree in the room raise their hand. Oh, it’s just me?” Give Rebecca a spinoff!\nJesus, Rebecca is amazing. I’m terrified! And … in love?\nOK, Ainsley, good on you for standing up for what is right.\nAww, Ainsley is becoming friends with Paigyn. I like this sweet turnaround!\nWow! I’ve often made fun of Nate (Colm Feore) for being the fun police, but I didn’t realize his swag as he flew to Cami’s office just to quit. What a good chess move.\nTommy’s letting his pride get to him — is he going to have a heart attack, too?\nGallino vs. Tommy: It’s a big business showdown!\nTommy, with his tail between his legs, is an odd look. But he got the money, so great — even though it’s from his frenemy.\n“It’s like I’m looking in the mirror.” Oof, Gallino hit Tommy hard.\nDamn, so much has happened in one day. The sun is still out!\nJohnny actually died of a heart attack?!? What the hell?\nBilly Bob is eating up this scene … nom nom nom …\nUh oh, this aspirin seems like foreshadowing …\nGlad we’re not leaving this murder charge as a cliffhanger until next season.\nWhy does Tommy have so many strippers in his phone?\nAww, cute. I love this new oil company.\nLong live CTT Oil Exportation (and Cattle)!\nOof, dour end to the season, Tommy.\nOK, good last negotiation with God.\n\n\n\n\tUntil next season, “Landman” nation! In the meantime, share in the comments below if you think CTT will be a win or a disaster.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore from Variety\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBruce Springsteen Blasts Trump at Surprise Benefit Gig: ‘ICE Should Get the F-ck Out of Minneapolis’\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tRobb Report\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGene Hackman’s 53-Acre New Mexico Estate Just Listed for $6.3 Million\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tSportico\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTrinidad Chambliss Sues NCAA in Test of Medical Waiver System\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\tWWD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSaudi Arabia’s Fashion Incubator Enters New Phase\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Zootopia 2” is hopping to another box office milestone. \n\n\tDisney’s hit sequel has earned $1.7 billion globally, overtaking another hit Disney sequel, 2024’s “Inside Out 2” ($1.69 billion), to stand as Hollywood’s highest-grossing animated film in history. China’s “Ne Zha 2,” a non-Motion Picture Association release, remains the biggest animated movie with $2.25 billion.\n\n\tWith these box office heights, “Zootopia 2” is now the ninth-biggest global release of all time, ranking behind two superhero juggernauts, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” ($1.9 billion) and “Avengers: Infinity War” ($2 billion).\n\t\n\n\t“This milestone belongs first and foremost to the fans around the world whose enthusiasm made it possible,” Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman said in a statement. “We’re incredibly proud of our filmmakers Jared Bush, Byron Howard, and Yvett Merino and the entire team at Walt Disney Animation Studios for creating a film that connects so deeply with audiences everywhere. ‘Zootopia 2’ is an extraordinary achievement, and we’re grateful to everyone who helped bring it to life.”\n\n\n\t“Zootopia 2” opened ahead of Thanksgiving to $156 million domestically and $559.5 million globally over five days, becoming the highest global animated opening of all time as well as the year’s biggest worldwide debut. The film has remained a box office powerhouse with $390 million domestically and a staggering $1.31 billion internationally. Among its many other milestones, “Zootopia 2” became the fastest animated Hollywood film and quickest PG-rated release to reach $1 billion globally. China, which has been hostile to Hollywood fare since the pandemic, has been especially enthusiastic about the return of the animal-filled metropolis, with $619 million to date. It’s the second-highest-grossing Hollywood film in the country behind Disney’s Marvel epic “Avengers: Endgame” with $632 million.\n\t\n\n\tDirected by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, “Zootopia 2” follows a rabbit police officer (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist fox (Jason Bateman) as they reunite to pursue a mysterious new reptilian resident (Ke Huy Quan). Disney has yet to announce the inevitable “Zootopia 3.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Marty Supreme” is officially A24’s highest-grossing movie in North America with $80 million. \n\n\tThe sports dramedy overtook the benchmark held by “Everything Everywhere All at Once” with $77 million domestically. “Everything Everywhere,” an Oscar-winning multiversal adventure, remains A24’s highest-grossing film at the worldwide box office with $142 million. Alex Garland’s dystopian thriller “Civil War” is the studio’s second biggest release with $127 million worldwide. \n\t\n\n\t“Marty Supreme,” which has only been released in select international territories and will slowly expand its footprint over the next few weeks, has earned $17 million overseas and $97 million globally to date. \n\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” opened nationwide on Christmas Day and earned $27 million over the extended holiday frame. Now in its fifth weekend of release, the film is projected to earn $6.6 million between Friday and Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, bringing the domestic tally to $80.8 million. Timothée Chalamet, who delivered a press tour for the ages, was vital in getting out the word about the original film. Yet “Marty Supreme” remained a theatrical draw in the new year because director Josh Safdie’s movie is resonating with audiences. The frenetic, R-rated adventure follows the fictional ping-pong champ Marty Mauser, who goes through the wringer to pursue his dream of becoming a table-tennis champ.\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” is A24’s most expensive film, costing $70 million to produce, so its box office staying power is necessary to justify its budget. (That’s because theater owners are keeping about half of ticket sales.) However, “Marty Supreme” has been proving its value to A24 beyond the balance sheet and through the awards circuit. Chalamet won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice for best actor and will likely find himself in the Oscar race when nominations are announced on Thursday. It’s good to be Marty.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Seduction” star Anamaria Vartolomei is lining up a polyglot year, with projects spanning English, French and Romanian. \n\n\tBorn in Bacău, Romania, and raised in Paris, Vartolomei won the César for Most Promising Actress for her breakout performance in Audrey Diwan’s Venice Golden Lion winner “Happening.” She has since maintained a steady presence in French cinema — balancing blockbusters like “The Count of Monte-Cristo” with auteur-driven projects including Bruno Dumont’s “The Empire” and last year’s Cannes Critics’ Week opener “Adam’s Sake” — all while steadily expanding her international footprint with English- and Romanian-language debuts in Bong Joon-ho’s “Mickey 17” and Teodora Mihai’s “Traffic.”\n\t\n\n\tShe’ll press ahead on all fronts this year, promoting her French-language turns in Pathé’s two-part historical epic “De Gaulle” and Fanny Liatard and Jérémy Trouilh’s arthouse fantasy “Les Yeux Verts,” before filming the U.S. period romance “Miles & Juliette.” Vartolomei is also circling an as-yet-untitled Romanian project, currently in final negotiations and eyeing a late 2026 shoot. While Vartolomei could not yet disclose the director of that project, she cited Cristian Mungiu and Emanuel Pârvu among her favorite contemporary Romanian filmmakers. \n\n\n\t(Mungiu, notably, wrote and produced Mihai’s “Traffic” and has just completed “Fjord” with Sebastian Stan — another immigrant-turned-international star remaining closely connected to Romanian cinema. Stan is next attached to a feature from Berlin Golden Bear winner Radu Jude. On the arthouse circuit, all roads lead to Romania.)\n\t\n\n\tBack in France, Vartolomei will play a fictionalized French Resistance fighter in Antonin Baudry’s two-part drama “De Gaulle” — a project she describes less as a conventional biopic than as a sprawling and “very political” war saga.\n\n\tWhat interested me most was the global scope and artistic ambition,” she says. “It’s a huge-budget, ambitious film, and I wanted French cinema to take those risks. The project has a Christopher Nolan-like visual sweep, while the theme of liberation today can resonate with young people in many countries.”\n\n\tShe also compliments the more artisanal visual aesthetic of Fanny Liatard and Jérémy Trouilh’s “Les Yeux Verts,” in which Vartolomei plays a young woman traveling through her brother’s subconscious in order to rouse him from a comatose state. “Their films mix fantasy and dreams, requiring a lot of effects and post-production work,” she says. “But those elements all complement another — making for something very abstract in their approach.”\n\n\tVartolomei will next star opposite Damson Idris and Xavier Dolan in “Miles & Juliette.” Directed by Bill Pohlad and produced by Mick Jagger, the film reimagines the 1949 romance between chanteuse Juliette Gréco and jazz legend Miles Davis, with production expected to begin later this year. \n\n\t“Their love story is very little known,” Vartolomei says. “Putting a mixed-race couple on screen is still rare, even though the story is very universal and continues to resonate today.” \n\n\t“It’s also about showing the emergence of two icons,” she continues. “Today they’re legends, but at the time they were just starting out, both in their twenties. It’s about portraying an era and making it a true romance — full of promise, something wonderful, something that makes you dream.” \n\n\tComing on the heels of “Mickey 17,” Vartolomei is looking forward to working in English again and hopes her role as Juliette Gréco will give her the chance to sing. Still, she stops short of dreaming of a Hollywood career — though she is signed with CAA, which packaged the film.\n\n\t“Doing American projects is a bonus,” she says. “When you’re foreign, it’s generally hard to land a first lead role or to avoid parts that are too clichéd. But if it’s something you want, you work toward it. And then it happens — or it doesn’t, and that’s okay. After all, the U.S. is not my home country.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tParamount+ has released the first teaser for Taylor Sheridan’s latest “Yellowstone”-adjacent series, “The Madison,” which premieres March 14 on the streamer.\n\n\tCast members for “The Madison” include Michelle Pfeiffer, Kurt Russell, Beau Garrett, Elle Chapman, Patrick J. Adams, Amiah Miller, Alaina Pollack, Ben Schnetzer, Kevin Zegers, Rebecca Spence, Danielle Vasinova and Matthew Fox. The teaser also reveals Will Arnett as a new cast member.\n\t\n\n\tThe teaser shows an emotional Pfeiffer collapsing into the Madison River before it cuts away to her confessing to her therapist, played by Arnett, “My center, my soul, is gone.” A calculated-seeming Arnett replies, “You will heal, if you let yourself.”\n\n\n\tThe neo-western drama is set in Manhattan and Montana. The official logline states that “The Madison” chronicles the lives of the Clyburn family and is a “heartfelt study of grief and human connection following a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana.”\n\n\t“Yellowstone” steward Sheridan created the series and is executive producer with his Bosque Ranch Productions banner. Other executive producers include David C. Glasser, John Linson, Art Linson, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, David Hutkin, Christina Voros, Michael Friedman, Pfeiffer, Russell and Keith Cox. Voros serves as a director as well as an executive producer. MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios produce, along with Bosque Ranch.\n\n\tIn addition to “The Madison,” Paramount has two other “Yellowstone” spinoffs in the works. These include “The Dutton Ranch,” following Kelly Reilly’s Beth Dutton and Cole Hauser’s Rip Wheeler of “Yellowstone,” and “Marshals” (formerly “Y Marshals”), starring Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton. “The Dutton Ranch” has yet to receive a release date, but “Marshals” is set for a March 1 debut on CBS.\n\t\n\n\tWatch the teaser below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn an unbilled performance Saturday night at the Light of Day festival in New Jersey, Bruce Springsteen took solemn time out during an otherwise celebratory 75-minute set to dedicate “The Promised Land” to the memory of slain Minneapolis woman Renee Good, decrying the “Gestapo tactics” that he said have resulted in a climate where citizens can be “murdered for exercising your American right to protest.”\n\n\tReciting a list of what he considers core American values, Springsteen then said that anyone who believes in them should “send a message to this president. And as the mayor of that city has said, ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis. So this one is for you, and the memory of the mother of three and American citizen Renee Good.” \n\t\n\n\tHe then launched, with the evening’s house band, into “The Promised Land,” the 1978 rocker that is one of his most enduring anthems and concert favorites.\n\n\n\tThe remarks about Good and ICE were disseminated on fan video (see below) and first reported in full by Jay Lustig of NJArts.net.\n\n\tSpringsteen began his “Promised Land” introduction by calling the “Darkness on the Edge of Town” favorite “his next song is “probably one of my greatest songs” and saying he wrote it “as an ode to American possibility … both to the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be. Now, right now, we are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested as it has never been in modern times. Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now.”\n\t\n\n\tHe continued, “So as we gather tonight in this beautiful display of love and care and thoughtfulness and community … if you believe in democracy, in liberty … if you believe that truth still matters, and that it’s worth speaking out, and it’s worth fighting for … if you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it … if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading American cities, and using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens … if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest … then send a message to this President.”\n\n\tThat message, he continued, was that “as the mayor of that city has said, ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis. So this one is for you, and the memory of the mother of three and American citizen Renee Good.”\n\n\n\n\n\tAlthough Springsteen’s appearance at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in Red Bank, NJ was unadvertised, it was widely expected, or at least hoped for, as the musician has often appeared at the Light of Day Foundation’s Winterfest series of concerts, which benefit research for Parkinson’s disease. His friend Joe Grushecky’s Houserockers were the backing band for the evening, as they typically are for these benefits. Saturday’s show also featured guest turns from Gary U.S. Bonds, Willie Nile, Goo Goo Dolls frontman Johnny Rzeznik and Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie.\n\n\tAmong the other songs performed during the hour-plus set he fronted, according to NJ.com, were the rarely performed “Lucky Town,” “Darkness on the Edge of Town” and full-band versions of two songs that are fresh on fans’ minds from the recent “Nebraska” boxed set, “Atlantic City” and “Johnny 99.”\n\n\tIt is no surprise to find Springsteen at odds with President Donald J. Trump, who has responded angrily to the rock superstar’s on-stage comments about his divisive actions. On an overseas tour that wrapped up last summer, Springsteen spoke out on a nightly basis, calling the current administation ““corrupt, incompetent and treasonous.”\n\n\tIn an interview with the New York Times in June, Springsteen called the current situation under Trump “an American tragedy… I think that it was the combination of the deindustrialization of the country and then the incredible increase in wealth disparity that left so many people behind. It was ripe for a demagogue. And while I can’t believe it was this moron that came along, he fit the bill for some people.” He added that “what we’ve been living through … is things that we all said, ‘This can’t happen here. This will never happen in America.’ And here we are.”\n\t\n\n\tTrump has not yet responded to Springsteen’s latest remarks, but he took to his Truth Social account last year after learning of the rocker’s remarks on tour, writing: “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States. Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK … This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tGregoire Melin’s Kinology has scored a raft of international sales on “Hell in Paradise,” Leila Sy’s suspense-packed survival thriller hailing from “Lucy” producers at EuropaCorp.\n\n\tBuyers include Dea Planeta in Spain, Dimeo Films in Poland, Falcon in the Middle East, Star in India, Blitz in Ex-Yugoslavia, and Ricochet for the airlines. Kinology is finalizing conversations in the U.K., Germany, Italy, Russia and Eastern Europe.\n\t\n\n\tProduced by Virginie Silla and inspired by a true story, the movie stars Nora Arnezeder and Maria Bello. Arnezeder plays Nina, a young French girl who leaves her native Marseille and accepts her first job as a receptionist at a luxurious hotel resort in a fictitious island named Mathara, hoping for a better life. But when a tragedy befalls the hotel, Nina is propelled in a relentless spiral of lies and manipulations. Wrongly accused and sentenced to life in prison, she will have no other choice but to run between traps and escape this paradise turned into hell. \n\n\tKarine Silla (“A Butterfly Kiss”) penned the script. The cast also includes Josephine de la Baume, Alyy Khan, Shubahm Saraf and Ranjit Krishnama. \n\n\tThe female-led thriller complements EuropaCorp’s roster of hit franchises from Luc Besson, from “Taken” to “Lucy.”\n\n\tThe film is “a story of resilience, a reminder that you should never give up, even in the darkest moments. That’s the power of cinema: experiencing powerful emotions,” said Sy, who is best known for directing “Street Flow” (“Banlieusards”), a 2016 action film she co-directed with Kery James for Netflix and topped the chart of the most watched movies on the streamer. \n\t\n\n\tSilla previously told Variety when announcing the project that she felt compelled to tell this “story of empowerment” about “this young woman who has to take control of her own destiny” after getting “caught in a web of lies, in a culture she knows nothing about, and surrounded by men who see her as easy prey.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” proved to be no match for “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” which remained No. 1 at the domestic box office in its fifth weekend of release.\n\n\t“The Bone Temple” stumbled with $13 million over the weekend and a projected $15 million in its four-day debut over Martin Luther King Jr. Day — below expectations of $20 million to $22 million over the long weekend. The film also collected $16.2 million from 61 overseas territories, bringing its global tally to $31.1 million.\n\t\n\n\tThe fourth installment in Sony’s dystopian “28 Days Later” franchise has great reviews and word of mouth (a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and “A-” grade on CinemaScore exit polls), so it’s possible the studio had overestimated the public’s appetite for the infected. After all, “The Bone Temple” was released less than a year after its zombie-infested predecessor, “28 Years Later,” which opened last June to $30 million over the traditional three-day weekend.\n\n\n\t“This is a steep drop from the third installment,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “Critics’ reviews and audience scores are the best of the series. But returning after seven months is too quick, and it’s hurting the numbers.” \n\n\tThat could become a problem for Sony because “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” is the franchise’s most expensive film yet, costing $63 million to produce before marketing expenses. Directed by Nia DaCosta and written by series creator Alex Garland, “The Bone Temple” takes place after the previous film and brings back Ralph Fiennes, Jack O’Connell and Alfie Williams as they continue to grapple with a Rage Virus that’s ravaging a post-apocalyptic Britain. \n\t\n\n\t“Avatar: Fire and Ash” continued its reign with $13.3 million over the weekend and $17.2 million through the four-day frame. So far, James Cameron’s third Na’vi adventure has generated $363.5 million domestically and $1.31 billion globally. Although a theatrical juggernaut, “Avatar 3” is running out of steam faster than the first two films, 2009’s “Avatar” and 2022’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which stand as two of the biggest movies in history with $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.\n\n\tOutside of the top 10, Neon’s dark comedy “No Other Choice” has generated $2.2 million over the weekend and a projected $2.8 million through Monday from 695 theaters. The film, directed by acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook, has amassed $6.9 million domestically to date while slowly expanding its theatrical footprint.\n\n\tElsewhere, Chloe Zhao’s Shakespearean tragedy “Hamnet” added $1.3 million over the weekend and a projected $1.6 million through Monday while expanding to 718 theaters. The film, which recently won the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama as well as a best actress trophy for star Jessie Buckley, has collected a strong $15 million domestically during its platform rollout. Overseas, “Hamnet” has made $12.9 million for a global tally of $27.5 million.\n\n\tAnother new release, Gus Van Sant’s crime thriller “Dead Man’s Wire,” collected $1 million over the weekend and $1.2 million from 1,101 theaters in its nationwide expansion. The well-reviewed movie depicts the real-life 1977 hostage situation and stars Bill Skarsgard as a small-town entrepreneur-turned-outlaw folk hero who kidnaps his bank mortgage holder and demands $5 million for allegedly wronging him. This is the first release for Row K, which launched in August 2025 and has several films on the calendar for 2026.\n\n\tMeanwhile, a major re-release, Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy — which returned to theaters for the 25th anniversary of “The Fellowship of the Ring” — earned $8 million from 1,680 theaters over the weekend and a projected $9.5 million through Monday. Fathom Entertainment set each film to play on a particular day, with “Fellowship of the Ring” generating $3.58 million on Friday, “The Two Towers” grossing $2.4 million on Saturday, and “The Return of the King” bringing in $2 million on Sunday. Despite record pre-sales, those ticket sales are slightly behind the company’s last “LOTR” re-release in 2024, which grossed $8.2 million over the traditional weekend.\n\t\n\n\tSince January tends to be glacial at the box office, several Thanksgiving and Christmas leftovers rounded out the top five on domestic charts. \n\n\t“Zootopia 2” was No. 3 with $9 million over the weekend and $11.6 million through Monday in its eighth (!) weekend of release. The animated sequel has remained a box office force for two months with $392 million domestically and $1.7 billion globally. It now stands as the highest-grossing animated Hollywood film of all time, ahead of “Inside Out 2” ($1.69 billion).\n\n\tFourth place went to “The Housemaid” with $8.5 million over the weekend and an estimated $10.1 million over the four-day frame, another impressive turnout for Lionsgate’s psychological thriller. The R-rated film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, has grossed $108.7 million in North America and $247.3 million globally against a $35 million budget, a very encouraging result at a tough time for mid-budget movies. “The Housemaid” is the first novel in McFadden’s best-selling trilogy, so naturally, the sequel, “The Housemaid’s Secret,” is already in the works with Sweeney and director Paul Feig.\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” captured fifth place with $5.4 million over the weekend and a projected $6.6 million through Monday’s holiday. The R-rated film has earned $80.8 million at the domestic box office, surpassing “Everything Everywhere All at Once” ($77 million) as A24’s highest-grossing film in North America. “Marty Supreme,” which has only been released in select international territories so far, has grossed $17 million overseas and $97 million globally. At this point, “Everything Everywhere” remains A24’s highest-grossing worldwide release with $142 million, followed by Alex Garland’s dystopian thriller “Civil War” with $127 million worldwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTennis champion Coco Gauff is a “Heated Rivalry” fan.\n\n\tFollowing a gushing review of HBO Max’s queer hockey romance series on social media, the American sports star said, “I’m their number one fan, I think.”\n\n\tGauff’s comments came during her Australian Open media day press conference. “I just kind of saw people talking about a hockey show, a gay hockey show. That interested me,” she said, according to tennis.com. “I was like, ‘Oh, six episodes, perfect.’ I just dove, like, right in. Obviously, there’s some nice spicy scenes. It’s such a beautiful love story. I think that was like the main thing.”\n\t\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry,” adapted from Rachel Reid’s Game Changer novel series, stars Connor Story and Hudson Williams as Ilya Rozanov and Shane Hollander, respectively, as professional hockey players who fall in love over the course of a secret decade-long affair.\n\n\n\tIn an interview with the Tennis Channel, Gauff said, “The storyline, I think is so relevant, I think a lot of people maybe can relate. I think that was really cool. The tension, obviously, the sexual tension and then the romantic tension. I love the trope that enemies – well, they aren’t real enemies – but enemies to lovers, but they both were denying their feelings. I don’t know. I just eat stuff up like that.”\n\n\n\tGauff then invited Storrie and Williams to watch her play: “Hey, Connor and Hudson, my name is Coco. I am tennis’ number one ‘Heated Rivalry’ fan. Please come to my match and watch me play…Love you guys.”\n\t\n\n\tShe’s also been urging fellow tennis players to check out the series. “I wanted the world to know about this show,” Gauff said. “I’ve been telling everyone. I told Jess Pegula and [Giuliana Olmos] to watch it today. We’ll see how much of the WTA I can convince to watch the show.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, “Heated Rivalry” creators Jacob Tierney and Brendan Brady attended the LA Kings vs. Pittsburgh Penguins NHL game in Los Angeles. The two received cheers and applause when they were shown – along with scenes from the show – on the Jumbotron above the rink.\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” star Robbie G.K., who plays Kip on the show, attended the Seattle Seahawks vs. San Francisco 49ers playoff game on Saturday. A video of the actor on the field was posted on the Seahawks’ Instagram grid along with the caption, “@robsgk in the cottage.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfghan filmmaker Shahrbanoo Sadat‘s “No Good Men,” which is set to open the upcoming Berlin Film Festival, has been boarded by French sales company Lucky Number. The Paris-based company will launch sales at next month’s European Film Market, where it will also unveil exclusive first-look images. “No Good Men” follows Sadat’s previous two movies, “Wolf and Sheep” and “The Orphanage,” which premiered at Cannes Directors’ Fortnight in 2016 and 2019, respectively.\n\n\tThe project also marks the third installment in a planned five-film cycle inspired by the autobiographical writings of author and actor Anwar Hashimi, who stars in the film alongside Sadat herself, who takes on the lead role.“No Good Men” is Sadat’s first Berlinale opening slot and continues her strong track record on the international festival circuit where she has quickly established herself as one of the most singular voices to emerge from Afghan cinema in recent years.Set in Kabul in 2021, just before the Taliban’s return to power, the film centers on Naru, the only camerawoman at Afghanistan’s main television station. Struggling to retain custody of her three-year-old son after leaving her unfaithful husband, Naru is convinced that no good men exist in her country — until a career opportunity offered by Qodrat, the station’s most influential journalist, forces her to reconsider. As the two crisscross the city covering what will become Afghanistan’s final days of freedom, a tentative romance emerges, pushing Naru to question her assumptions in a society stacked against her.\n\t\n\tBlending comedy, romance and political urgency, “No Good Men” explores the fragile pockets of freedom that women carve out for themselves within a patriarchal society. The film is believed to feature the first onscreen kiss ever depicted in an Afghan feature — a milestone that also underscores the project’s risks. For political reasons and due to the current context, it had to be shot entirely outside of Afghanistan, in Germany. However the entire cast is Afghan. ” ‘No Good Men’ addresses what I believe is the deepest and most enduring problem of Afghan society, and beyond: patriarchy,” Sadat said. “Through Naru, an independent woman living in Kabul during the ‘democracy’ era, the film reveals how deeply rooted oppression existed long before 2021.”She added that the film seeks to challenge the simplified narratives often applied to Afghanistan’s recent history, insisting that the Taliban represents not only a political force but a long-standing social mindset — while also acknowledging Afghan men who resist and reject that system.The film is produced by Germany and Denmark’s Adomeit Film (“The Square”), in co-production with France’s La Fabrica Nocturna Cinéma, Norway’s Motlys, Germany’s Amerikafilm, Afghanistan’s Wolf Pictures, and Sweden’s Film i Väst. German public funding came from MOIN Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein, the German Federal Film Board (FFA), the German-French Mini-Treaty, the German Federal Film Fund (DFFF), Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, nordmedia, and MV Filmförderung Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.Distributors are already on board in several key territories, including Denmark (Camera Film), Norway (Norsk Filmdistribusjon), France (Condor Films) and Germany (Eksystent).Lucky Number’s co-founders, Olivier Barbier, Ola Byszuk and Lenny Porte, described the film as “audacious and groundbreaking in countless ways,” praising Sadat’s resilience in bringing the project to completion “against all odds.”Lucky Number’s lineup includes Felipe Barbosa’s “Leila et La Nuit” (working title), starring Roschdy Zem and Marina Foïs, and Christophe Reveille’s documentary “Che Guevera: The Last Companions,” in time to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Che’s death. Both titles are on the company’s Unifrance Rendez-Vous With French Cinema slate.",

Despite the pain, he stayed in the game and fired a pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that fell incomplete but drew a crucial pass interference flag.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          On the second-to-last play, Nix's right ankle twisted awkwardly while kneeling to stop the clock. Cameras caught him wincing, slowly standing up, and walking gingerly to the sideline with his hands on his hips.\n      \n    \n          Not long after, Adam Schefter confirmed Nix fractured a bone in the ankle and is scheduled for surgery Tuesday in Alabama.\n      \n    \n          Broncos head coach Sean Payton didn’t hold back in praising his QB, saying ... Nix is a tough cookie.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Denver Broncos\n              \n                          \n                TMZ Sports\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

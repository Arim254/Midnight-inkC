    "body": "\n\tPaul Walter Hauser will soon play Chris Farley in Josh Gad‘s biopic about the legendary “Saturday Night Live” cast member, and “The Naked Gun” star has called out who he wants to play Lorne Michaels.\n\n\tWhile speaking with Variety on Wednesday night at the Los Angeles premiere of “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” Hauser said he wants Sam Rockwell to play the “SNL” mastermind.\n\n\t“I have some ideas for who to cast for Lorne,” Hauser said. “I really want Sam Rockwell to play Lorne Michaels, which I don’t think I’ve told anyone yet.”\n\t\n\n\tHauser then addressed his pitch directly to Rockwell.\n\n\n\t“Sam Rockwell, please play Lorne Michaels in my Chris Farley movie,” he added. “You love being around me when I do my Farley impression anyway, so I’ll do Matt Foley all day for you and make you laugh. It’ll be fun.”\n\n\tIf Hauser gets his wish, it would mark the second collaboration between Rockwell and himself after Clint Eastwood’s 2019 drama “Richard Jewell.”\n\n\tEarlier in the interview, Hauser shared that he recently received the “latest draft” of the script from “500 Days of Summer” screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, which he called “the best” yet. He added that shooting could begin as soon as “early to middle of next year” and that production is just waiting on that “elusive greenlight” from New Line and Warner Bros.\n\n\tThe Farley biopic was first unveiled in April of 2024. While plot details remain under wraps, the film is based on the New York Times best-selling biography “The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts” by Tom Farley Jr. (Farley’s brother) and Tanner Colby.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “If Then,” the sixth episode of “The Morning Show” Season 4, now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tLadies and",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This post contains spoilers from “If Then,” the sixth episode of “The Morning Show” Season 4, now streaming on Apple TV.\n\n\tLadies and gentleman, Stella Bak has left the building. And the country. And the show.\n\n\tIn the sixth episode of the” fourth season of “The Morning Show,” the tech genius turned news division leader at UBN played by Greta Lee saw the carefully curated and swiftly ascendant life she built for herself come crashing down on top of her –– in front of 200 journalists, her boss Celine (Marion Cotillard) and the rest of the world.\n\t\n\n\t“For me, this was that moment before an explosion,” Lee tells Variety. “It’s all of the centrifugal force that’s been piling up after years and years of having to operate a certain way. She has gotten quite savvy since the day she first arrived, but I think that it’s clear — or it was clear to me — that it’s not sustainable.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIt’s been one stumble after another this season for the woman who was first introduced to audiences in Season 2 as an intimidating problem-solver who’d sold her tech business and carved out a place for herself at a leading news network where women didn’t often find themselves in the C-Suite. But this season, Stella put everything on the line for her supposedly groundbreaking AI program (mind you, this is taking place in spring 2024) that can translate UBN’s popular anchors into any language ahead of the network’s global coverage of the Paris Olympics. But in the sixth episode, Stella’s crisis of conscious over her decision to not promote her friend Mia (Karen Pittman) because of pressures to elevate her male counterpart; Mia’s defiant return in which she declares Stella to be an enemy of the very progress she has long championed; and her ongoing affair with Miles (Aaron Pierre), Celine’s husband, leave Stella adrift.\n\t\n\n\tIn her voiceover across the episode, she laments that she has given in to the toxic pull of her “inner straight white guy” by doing what he would do –– “I fell into bed with the one person who could blow up his life.” While Miles isn’t the only thing putting pressure on the detonator, it doesn’t help the situation when she and Celine take the stage to present their ambitious Olympics coverage plan to the media. Hoping to distract the headline-hungry press from the network’s various other scandals, Stella rolls out a demonstration of her AI program, using her own manufactured image, despite telling Celine it isn’t ready. Unfortunately, her worst fear comes true when it not only malfunctions on stage, but regurgitates all the hurtful, racist and damning things Stella had spoken into it (aka herself) the night before in a digital-age version of taking a look at the mirror and asking if you like what you see.\n\n\tThe PR nightmare leaves Stella no choice but to resign. She initially retreats into the arms of Miles, and they resolve to run away to Naples together. But when she arrives at the airport with a hopeful smile and more time on her hands than usual, he texts her a simple “I’m sorry.” She gets on the plane anyway, and even Lee doesn’t know what awaits her on the other side.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“This is the end for her, as far as I know,” Lee says, confirming her exit, at least from Season 4. “But of course, since the show is so prescient and a direct commentary on what’s happening, I would love to see what kind of world would exist where she comes back, and what she might have to say.”\n\n\tStella’s undoing wasn’t a spiral contained to Season 4, though. Lee is of the camp that her downfall (at least professionally) started last season when she endured an excruciating lunch with a pair of slimy corporate investors. In order to gain their support and money, they forced her to command a waitress (also a woman of color) to lick a spilled drink off the table to prove she was one of the boys. Lee says Stella never recovered from compromising her ideals so irreversibly in that moment.\n\n\t“But I’m hoping she will now get a chance to,” she adds. “I think that’s part of the problem for her. It’s like she hasn’t been afforded the opportunity to reflect or to forgive or even, in a lot of ways, acknowledge in a bigger way some of the things she’s endured and done in order to get to where she is. So I’m hoping she’s doing that on a beach somewhere.”\n\t\n\n\tThe implosion of Stella’s image, literally thanks to her own AI, is two-fold. It exposed her own deep concerns about the ways she has contributed to the company’s stunted progress for people and women of color at the network (Mia scolds her earlier for this, saying, “You’re not one of us — you never were.”). But her AI also talks about her affair with Miles –– right in front of Celine. The French CEO uses it to immediately take Stella out, corporately speaking.\n\n\tThe AI version of Stella presented in the series wasn’t quite the leap forward in technology that Hollywood fears and reviles, but rather just another task handed to Lee this season.\n\n\t“Initially, I had to read opposite myself,” she says of the filming process. “The reality of what we’re doing is we’re showing tech that is developing as we speak. You see all the pitfalls of it, and how dangerous it can be if these guardrails aren’t put into place. So when I was doing it, it was a mess. I was doing a combination of reading with someone on script, and then also an image of myself that was like not quite the final product. Then going back and seeing what they generated and being totally weirded out by it — because trying to have any sort of the timing, comedic or dramatic, with a non-sentient representation of yourself is very weird.”\n\n\tBut she couldn’t just play herself. Lee and the creative team worked to find ways to make the AI present as technologically perfect, but also make sure the imperfections of AI were still on full display.\n\n\t“We talked at length about how many blinks we were gonna do and blinking in the wrong place and how funny that is, because there are limits to the avatars,” she says. “That is what is so uncanny about them and why, arguably, they will never be good humans. There are certain qualities that are impossible to nail. So, yeah, we did get to play with a lot of that, and we had a lot of laughs.”\n\n\tWhen she is betrayed by her own likeness, Stella can only look out onto a shocked audience, and happens to find a familiar –– albeit, not friendly –– face among them. Mia is watching from the nosebleed seats, and Stella has to process that moment through her as well. The two have been apprehensive advocates for each other over the past two seasons, and this season Stella vowed to go to bat for Mia’s bid for news director. But when she recanted on that to further her own ambition with AI and the network, Mia became the embodiment of Stella’s failings, one that haunts this scene like a ghost of what might have been.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Apple TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“That moment was so fully loaded because she knows that there’s a betrayal between them, the kind that you can’t come back from,” Lee says. “For each of them and for so long, the option to fail was something that just never existed. Like, it just wasn’t possible. So to experience the pinnacle of failure in such a public way and have Mia be a witness to that, is almost too much to bear. That exchange, that wordless exchange across that room, is like a hundred words being said between the two of them.”\n\n\tDuring the entire episode, Mia, Miles and Celine have all told Stella in one way or another why her decisions have set herself up for failure. With Miles especially, he admonishes her for choosing a man she could never truly have, despite their impassioned pleas to choose each other over his comfortable life and her career. However, his rejection of her at the airport in the execution of said plan may be the deepest cut in Stella’s no good, very bad day. She is left broken, unsure if she should still get on the plane or try to mend the wreckage in her wake.\n\n\tIn the final scene, Lee hesitates for a moment before letting Stella choose. \n\n\t“I think it’s a whole new sensation that she has literally never experienced before,” she says. “It’s a lot to process within a few moments. When she realizes Miles isn’t coming, she is taking stock and realizing she has nothing. But the surprising thing for her and someone like her is in that moment of realizing she’s got nothing, it sort of means she’s got everything. That’s the gift of the horrible circumstances that have fallen on her. She really is free. I think, arguably, that step toward the plane is the scariest thing she’s probably ever done in her life.”\n\n\tDon’t cry for Stella too much. Let’s not forget she sold her tech company for hundreds of millions, and had plenty of zeros on her paycheck before exiting stage left at UBN. So her next chapter will be very well-funded, even if her personal and professional lives are in shambles. But Stella has proven she is nothing if not resilient. The big question now is whether she will return to the show, as so many (maybe too many?) of UBN’s former execs have. Lee says she loves working with “The Morning Show” ensemble, and is always excited to spar with them over media jargon. But conversely, she’s also very protective of Stella and her journey, and she doesn’t think she should come back any time soon.\n\t\n\n\t“When I think about her and what I want for her, I don’t know if there’s a place for her that exists quite yet,” Lee says. “I think the world has to shift a little bit more to make room for her in the way that I would want to see her. Otherwise, we’ll just see her being a slave to this corporation. Being a slave to unfulfilled desires, and I don’t want that for her.”\n\n\tGiven that “The Morning Show” exists about a year and change behind our own timeline, audiences may be waiting a long time for our current world to be worthy of Stella Bak’s resurrection. Until then, Lee hopes she is spending some of those millions somewhere far from the 24-hour news cycle.\n\n\t“I want her to be completely taken by surprise by what’s out there for her,” Lee says. “If she ever comes back, I want her to be sort of like Matthew McConaughey as the beach bum, with bongos and the hair. I want her to really be roughed up a little bit by real-world living. Just to feed her soul a little bit, and become a person. Because I really do think it’s from that place that maybe she would have something ingenious to offer.”\n\n\tBut for those who watched the episode and momentarily thought Stella had suddenly died off screen, you weren’t alone. When Alex (Jennifer Aniston) announces Stella’s resignation on air, the reflective script on her career at UBN sounded an awful lot like a eulogy, so much so that some people even mentioned it to Lee.\n\n\t“Jen was crying when she came to set on my last day,” Lee says. “It was so sweet, and Mimi [Leder] had such beautiful words that day. We are a family, so it was really moving. But you’re not alone if you thought that was a eulogy. Some other people on our crew were like: ‘This is a eulogy. What’s happening?’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLauryn Hill will visit eight cities across Canada on a tour she’s calling “Artist In Residence.” \n\n\tLaunching on Nov. 19 at the Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Hill will perform in theatres, halls and auditoriums through Dec. 19. Her last showing is at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, Ontario. \n\n\tThe artist last performed at the Essence Festival on July 4. She was added to the lineup just days before its start. Essence Festival organizers came to her defense after the singer appeared late — starting roughly around 2:30 a.m. — to perform for a nearly empty stadium. \n\t\n\n\tTickets for her “Artist In Residence” tour will be available for purchase starting with a series of pre sales on Oct. 22. Public on-sale begins Oct. 24 at 12 p.m. Two dollars from every ticket sold will be donated to the MLH Fund, which provides resources for local community outreach. \n\n\n\tHill recently posted to her Instagram account an emotional tribute dedicated to the late singer D’Angelo, who died Oct. 14 of cancer. She called him “a beacon of light to a generation and beyond who had no remembrance of the legacy that preceded us.”\n\n\t“I regret not having more time with you,” she wrote. “Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world, and a presence not of this world needs protection in a world that covets light and the anointing of God. You sir, moved us, stirred us, inspired and even intimidated others to action with your genius.”\n\n\t“Artist In Residence” Canadian Tour Dates:Nov 19, 2025 – Burton Cummings Theatre – Winnipeg, MBNov 24, 2025 – The Orpheum – Vancouver, BCNov 30, 2025 – FirstOntario Concert Hall – Hamilton, ONDec 3, 2025 – Place des Arts – Montreal, QCDec 8, 2025 – Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium – Calgary, ABDec 10, 2025 – Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium – Edmonton, ABDec 16, 2025 – Massey Hall – Toronto, ONDec 19, 2025 – National Arts Centre – Ottawa, ON\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tElectronic Arts will shut down “The Sims Mobile” next January, seven years and more than 50 updates after the game launched.\n\n\t“First, we want to say thank you,” the “Sims Mobile” team said in a blog posted to the EA website Sunday. “The Sims Mobile and The Sims community as a whole are full of creativity, kindness, and imagination. You’ve amazed us with your stories, builds, and Sims. We’re proud to have shared this journey with you, and as a token of our appreciation, we’ve prepared a few surprises as we head into TSM’s final chapter.”\n\t\n\n\tBefore the game is sunset on Jan. 20, EA is rolling out one final update for “The Sims Mobile” in the coming months. The first part of the update launched Monday. However, “The Sims Mobile” was delisted from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store on Tuesday, so it is no longer available for new downloads, only for users who already have “The Sims Mobile” installed or have previously downloaded it.\n\n\n\t“The Sims Mobile” shutdown comes on the heels of EA announcing it will be going from a publicly traded company to a privately held. The buyout deal, valued at $55 billion, is with several investors, including private-equity firms Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners. \n\n\t“The Sims” franchise as a whole is still alive and well at EA, with a new update for “The Sims 4” released in September and ongoing plans for a new “Sims” game that will explore online multiplayer features.\n\n\tSee more gaming news from this week in the roundup below.\n\t\n\t\tNEW RELEASES\t\n\n\t“Jurassic World Evolution 3” launched Tuesday from Frontier Developments in collaboration with Universal Products & Experiences across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. \n\t\n\n\tPer the official description for the title, “players can delve into a game franchise first that brings adorable juvenile dinosaurs and a comprehensive breeding system, take on an epic global campaign that spans multiple stunning locations around the world, and shape their parks like never before with powerful creative tools.”\n\n\n\n\n\t*\n\n\tThe Sandbox has unveiled “San Junipero,” a new simulated experience based off of Netflix’s “Black Mirror” episode of the same name. The experience will be released on Oct. 22 to play on PC and Mac. \n\n\tPlayers will immerse themselves through a first-person, interactive journey where unforgettable locations, mind-bending themes of simulated reality and emotional twists await. Players will also be given the opportunity to meet key characters Kelly and Yorkie, interact with them across timelines and decide whether they are ready to become a permanent resident of the digital afterlife.\n\t\n\t\tEVENTS\t\n\n\tiam8bit will celebrate its 20th anniversary with an art exhibit open to the public on Saturday, Nov. 8, and Sunday, Nov. 9, located at Studio 8, 614 E 12th St. in Los Angeles.\n\n\tPer the gaming and media company, “In the last two decades, iam8bit has become a tastemaker at the intersection of games, art, and music, marking three original games published, 300+ albums and millions of records pressed. To commemorate this milestone, iam8bit is reopening the doors to its artistic roots with a gallery exhibition that celebrates both its origin story and its ongoing influence on the art and games landscape.”\n\t\n\t\tPARTNERSHIPS\t\n\n\tSports Interactive has teamed with National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) and NWSL Players’ Association (NWSLPA) to incorporate the leagues into “Football Manager 26.” “FM26” is set to launch on Nov. 4. \n\n\t“We are delighted to have the NWSL and NWSLPA onboard as headline licensing partners for the debut of Women’s Football in FM26,” said Miles Jacobson, Studio Director at Sports Interactive. “Throughout our multi-year project to introduce Women’s Football, we’ve maintained that we want to do it properly. This meant having the biggest world licences on board and the NWSL alongside the athletes who bring it to life is undoubtedly one of them. “I can’t wait to see the stories our fans write as they get to test their skills in the NWSL for the first time.”\n\t\n\n\tKatie Eaton, Vice President of Consumer Products at National Women’s Soccer League, added: “Partnering with Football Manager 26 is an exciting moment for the NWSL and our fans. Bringing our clubs and players into FM is the latest innovative way that our league is meeting soccer fans where they are and bringing the NWSL to new audiences.”\n\n\t“FM” fans will have the chance to take charge of elite teams, uncover new talent and compete at the highest level.

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel was a recent guest on Ted Danson’s “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” podcast and revealed that he nearly lost the job of hosting an ABC late-night talk show to none other than Jon Stewart. It was the early 2000s, and Stewart was a few years into his stint as the host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.” ABC was looking for a late-night replacement for Bill Maher, who had been hosting the half-hour political talk show “Politically Incorrect” since it moved to the network in 1997.\n\t\n\n\t“They wanted a traditional late-night talk show in that slot,” Kimmel said (via The Daily Beast). “Jon and I have the same manager, James ‘Baby Doll’ Dixon, and James was about to close this deal for Jon to host the show… [ABC chairman Lloyd Braun] watched my tape, and he was like, ‘I think this might be the guy.’ And he brought the tape to Bob Iger, and Iger said, ‘Yeah, I think this might be the guy.’ It was a very strange thing because [James] was in the difficult position of having to tell Jon, ‘Uh, you’re not going to ABC, but Jimmy is going to ABC.’”\n\n\n\tStewart was already a late-night favorite thanks to “The Daily Show,” while Kimmel was a lot more untested in the space as the host of Comedy Central’s “The Man Show.” As Kimmel quipped, “That was a mistake by the way. They definitely should hire Jon. If I’m in that position, there’s no question I hire John 100 times out of a 100.”\n\n\tKimmel was so confused over winning the gig over Stewart that he asked Bob Iger about it. As Kimmel remembered: “I said, ‘What was it, like why—this is quite a leap that you guys made. I was on ‘The Man Show,’ I was doing football picks on Fox NFL Sunday—what was it?’ He goes, ‘Well, you were cheaper.’ And everybody laughed, but I knew he wasn’t kidding.”\n\t\n\n\t“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” debuted in 2003, and Kimmel recalled that the early days were rough. “I think my vision of hell is being forced to watch my first year of shows, because it is just as painful as anything could get for me. It took us a long time to figure it out, and we’re very fortunate to get a long time to figure it out.” \n\n\t“Somehow we wound up getting good ratings,” he continued. “I still don’t know how that was, but they were good enough to keep us on the air, even though I was causing trouble once every, like two and a half months, some major thing was happening. Something that came out of my mouth, you know, and caused a whole thing. It was just tumultuous.”\n\n\tWatch Kimmel’s full interview on Danson’s podcast in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

She assists the cheer team with various odd jobs.” \n\n\n\tHiller recently won the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy for his role in HBO’s “Somebody Somewhere.” He has also appeared in shows like “30 Rock,” “Community,” “Broad City,” and “Evil.” He is repped by Innovative Artists and OPE Partners.\n\n\tPolanco is best known for her role in the hit Netflix series “Orange Is the New Black,” on which she starred throughout the show’s seven-season run. Since then, she has been in shows like “When They See Us,” “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,” and “Russian Doll” as well as films like “Joy” and “In the Heights.” She is repped by Gersh, Liebman Entertainment and Goodman Genow Schenkman. \n\t\n\n\tAtkinson currently plays Mamie Fish in the hit HBO series “The Gilded Age,” which is prepping its fourth season.

    "body": "\n\tWarning: This story contains spoilers from the Oct. 22 finale of “Love Is Blind” Season 9, now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tThe last remaining couples ended their relationships during the final episode of “Love Is Blind,” making Season 9 the first time in the show’s history where none of the contestants got married. \n\n\tIn the finale, there were three couples left: Ali Lima and Anton Yarosh, Kalybriah Haskin and Edmond Harvey, and Jordan Keltner and Megan Walerius. Among the remaining couples, only the first two made it to the altar, with both women saying no at the altar.\n\t\n\n\tAs viewers braced themselves to watch what they thought would be a third wedding, the show cut to Jordan and Megan in their apartment instead. While the pair sat on the couch, a tearful Megan decided to call off the engagement, citing their fundamental differences in lifestyles and other reservations as to why she wasn’t ready for marriage at the moment.\n\n\n\tAmong the engaged couples, the duo appeared to be the strongest despite early hiccups regarding lifestyle and finances. Additionally, parenthood was a major topic of discussion between the couple, with Jordan being a single father to a five-year-old boy. \n\n\tIn an interview with Variety, Jordan admits he wasn’t “blindsided” by their conversation in the end, as the two had previously made a pact not to go to the altar if they weren’t both certain. \n\n\t“We wanted to be open, honest and transparent with each other,” he says. “My son was supposed to be at the wedding, and I never wanted him to go through something like that. We tried until the last possible second. She made the best decision for both of us and our families.”\n\t\n\n\tBelow, he shares more about his final confessional, viewers’ reactions to Season 9, rewatching the show more than a year later, and where he currently stands with Megan.\n\t\n\t\tHow has it been for you to relive this experience more than a year later?\t\n\n\tIt’s weird watching yourself fall so hard in love with somebody. We were compatible on so many levels. We finished filming almost a year and a half ago, and I haven’t seen her since. I’ve spent a lot of time processing, going to therapy about it and improving myself. It was hard to rewatch it because I don’t remember much of it. But I see why we fell in love. It sucked, but at the same time, so much time has passed. I loved my life before I went on the show, and I love it now. \n\t\n\t\tWhat has it been like seeing everyone’s reactions to the show?\t\n\n\tI’ve been diligent to stay out of the comments and not read them for the most part. But what I’ve seen has been humbling. I did not expect any of this to happen. I didn’t think it would affect the Type 1 diabetes community on this scale. I was just telling my story, and in a way, I was telling a bunch of people’s stories. I never thought about how relatable all our situations are. I didn’t expect any of this, and I feel undeserving of the love and attention. I’m so glad I get to be an advocate.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFrom a viewer’s perspective, it seemed like you two had a strong connection, but there were clear differences around lifestyle, finances and parenthood. Do you feel like the relationship was accurately represented on screen?\t\n\n\tI do. We spent hundreds of hours with each other. We had every conversation there was to have. We understood each other’s intentions. We live two different lives. I’m a single dad. I never wanted her to have immediate responsibility with my son. That was never a conversation. It was like, ‘Ok, I got this. All I need you to do is love that guy. That’s it.’ I have a very healthy relationship with his mom and stepdad. We operate as a unit. The expectations with her being involved were hanging out with us and loving him. That was all I wanted. Everything else was just icing on the cake.\n\t\n\t\tWhat type of new insight about the relationship have you gained while watching the show back?\t\n\n\tI watched myself in Mexico. As a single dad, I work a lot and go to the gym. There are very few times when I’m out and about. We’re with these people in this crazy, unique situation. We’ve been pent-up for a little bit, and then we go to Mexico and get super drunk. Do I have regrets about doing that? For sure. I was being annoying, but we were able to move past that quickly. I’ve grown further as a person from her expectations. Most of my past girlfriends let me do whatever I wanted. It was refreshing to be held accountable. It helped me self-reflect. My end goal was to be a good example for my son. I know he’s going to watch it one day. I would have navigated that situation a little bit differently, but I was just excited.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAt any point in the relationship, did you have a feeling that she would end the engagement?\t\n\n\tYes. I’m a regular, blue-collar guy. I was making decent money at the time, but she was just absolutely killing it. It seemed like every time she would hang out with her friends, she’d come back, and I could hear hesitation in her voice. That was off-putting for me because I want to get married to someone who wants to get married to me. I don’t want someone to have hesitations. That’s not fair to her. We had discussions about not wanting to annul our marriage. We didn’t want to get a divorce. We wanted this to be a forever thing. At the end of the day, she decided it wasn’t going to be a forever thing for her. She made the right choice.\n\t\n\t\tIn your confessional after the split, you mentioned that Megan ended things because your lifestyles weren’t compatible and suggested that money played a significant role. Do you believe that’s the reason she called off the engagement?\t\n\n\tShe kind of says that herself. I don’t want to speak too much for her, but she simply said the lifestyles weren’t compatible. We live completely different lifestyles, so she’s not lying. That was just the fact of the matter at the time.\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you think ultimately made the relationship not work out?\t\n\n\tIt was time. I’m a single dad. I was working a very demanding job at the time. When we were in the pods, I was able to dedicate 100% of my time to Megan. Then we go back to Denver, and half of that gets ripped off to work. With filming, there was not a lot of time to decompress. Luca and Megan are two people I should have committed most of my time and energy to, but I have to support my family. They both got the short end of the stick during that time. I asked Megan to hang on because I knew the load was going to be light eventually. But, she didn’t make the wrong decision.\n\t\n\t\tWould you have said “I do” if you two had made it down the aisle?\t\n\n\tMegan is very strategic in how she thinks. I’m not. She checked all my boxes, and I was good. She was dead set on not wanting a divorce. I’m a chronic under-thinker. So I was like, “Oh, we could get a divorce if we hate each other.” She made the choice that was right for her, which in turn, was the right choice for everyone.\n\t\n\t\tHow would you describe where you guys stand today?\t\n\n\tSince the cast announcement, we’ve been talking almost daily, but it’s just very fun banter. I have no interest in pursuing and trying to go back. We’re friends because we went through this unique experiment together. But it’s very casual. We didn’t talk to each other for a full year. But once everything started dropping, we were just checking in on each other. We think the memes are hilarious. There’s no bad blood between us.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIn your final confessional, you mention that you regretted introducing her to your son, Luca. What was going through your mind when you said that?\t\n\n\tI was going through every emotion known to man. I was so tired. I couldn’t communicate the way I needed to. My son is at this young, tender age where stability is very important. I was regretful that we brought Megan in like, “Oh, this is your stepmom,” and then ripped her out of his life. For a 5-year-old, that’s not fair. That was on me. Nobody signed anybody up for the experiment but me. It was unfair that Luca and my son’s mom got pulled into it in a very dramatic fashion. He doesn’t ask for a stepmom anymore. That was not a healthy thing for him to go through. All I can do is live and learn. I can’t see myself introducing Luca to anyone else unless I’m 100% sure we’re going to be together forever.\n\t\n\t\tDo you still regret introducing her?\t\n\n\tIt was never about Megan. It could have been anybody. Megan is an amazing person. She and Luca got along so great. It was more that it’s not healthy to bring a young child into a situation like that and be like, “Oh, Luca, this is going to be your stepmom. We’re getting married.” Then two weeks later, we didn’t. It’s not Megan’s or Luca’s fault. I brought everyone into the experiment. That’s what I meant by I regret introducing her to Luca because she’s an amazing person. He deserves a stable environment, and what I was doing wasn’t necessarily stable.\n\t\n\t\tHow was Megan’s meeting with Luca’s mother?\t\n\n\tWe went to dinner together. It was important to me because I knew her [Megan] for three or four weeks. I needed her approval out of respect for her. It was amazing. Everyone got along perfectly fine.\n\t\n\t\tHow did she feel about you going on the show?\t\n\n\tShe didn’t care that I was going on it. She was concerned that I was going to be villainized because of my tattoos. But I was like, “Everything will be ok. There’s a reason I’m going on here.” And then everything turned out cool.\n\t\n\t\tWhat does your dating life look like now?\t\n\n\tIt’s been casual. I haven’t introduced Luca to anybody. I haven’t even met anyone to introduce to my son. I’m not interested in dating seriously right now. Every once in a while, it’s nice to go out and go on a casual date. I don’t see myself doing anything serious anytime soon. But never say never.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYour season made “Love Is Blind” history as the first season when no couples got married. Why do you think that the experiment wasn’t successful for your group?\t\n\n\tIt’s a condensed experiment. Everyone was down to earth enough to be like, “This is my life, and I don’t need to get married to satisfy a bunch of fans.” It’s a real marriage. You get a real marriage certificate. Everyone made the right choice, because we’re not getting married just because it plays well on TV. We don’t care what the fans think because this is our life. We’re regular people.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat surprised you the most about his experience?\t\n\n\tMegan and my cast mates are the greatest people I’ve ever met. It’s hard to meet people when you’re an adult. Megan taught me a lot about how I needed to treat and speak to a woman. We brought out the best in each other. Going forward in dating, I’m looking for someone who brings out the best in me, not the worst.\n\t\n\t\tI have to ask about your now viral Crystal Light and chicken protein shake. How did you come up with that combination?\t\n\n\tI was on TikTok. I’ve tried to build my life around convenience, and I saw this bodybuilder doing that exact recipe. And I was like, “You know what? Fuck it. I’m going to give it a shot.” I’m sorry to say I don’t hate it, and I still do it every single day. I don’t think I’ll ever stop doing it. I don’t think it’s that gross. It’s not as gross as chugging 13 raw eggs.\n\t\n\t\tWhat was your reaction to seeing audiences so fixated on your recipe?\t\n\n\tThere are a lot of people not doing the instructions right. You’re supposed to chug it, not drink it out of a straw. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. This is a free country. I’ve seen good and bad reactions. No one’s making you do it. It’s my thing!\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for the Season 2 finale of “Gen V,” now streaming on Amazon’s Prime Video.\n\n\tThe end of “Gen V” Season 2",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for the Season 2 finale of “Gen V,” now streaming on Amazon’s Prime Video.\n\n\tThe end of “Gen V” Season 2 opened the door to the final chapter of “The Boys,” with a finale that proved that at least one character in the Vought Cinematic Universe might have what it takes to destroy Homelander — since she just killed the supe who ultimately had created Homelander.\n\n\n\tIn the episode, titled “Trojan,” Marie (Jaz Sinclair) gets a handle on her blood-control powers to the extent she’s able to take down the all-powerful Thomas Godolkin (Ethan Slater) before he can take out all the “weaker” supe students at God U.\n\t\n\n\tBut just because Godolokin is dead — for sure this time — doesn’t mean he’s finished in the world of “The Boys.” Eric Kripke, “The Boys” showrunner and “Gen V” co-creator, says he would love to bring “Wicked” star Slater into the “The Boys” prequel series “Vought Rising,” which is currently in production with stars Jensen Ackles and Aya Cash reprising their roles as Soldier Boy and Stormfront. For now, though, Kripke says: “He’s a little busy with this tiny independent film about witches, I don’t know if you’ve heard of it.\n\n\t“And he’s been doing press, and so it’s been a little tricky to schedule, but we’ve been trying,” Kripke continues. “If there’s a Season 2 of ‘Vought Rising,’ we would definitely have him in as Godolkin. I’m so fascinated by that character, and to bring him in beside Frederick Vought, and seeing those two monsters work together, would be a blast.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKeeya King (Annabeth Moreau), Jaz Sinclair (Marie Moreau), Maddie Phillips (Cate Dunlap), Derek Luh (Jordan Li), Lizze Broadway (Emma Meyer), Asa Germann (Sam)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Prime Video\n\t\n\n\n\n\t(Speaking of Godolkin’s backstory, is Kripke looking to cast someone to play the still-unknown man who served as Godolkin’s first “puppet” before he took hold of Hamish Linklater’s Cipher? “Not yet,” he says. “But maybe.”)\n\t\n\n\tKripke says that when it premieres next year, the fifth and final season of “The Boys” will pick up “roughly six months” after where the “Gen V” Season 2 finale leaves off, with Marie and her friends joining Annie/Starlight (Erin Moriarty) and A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) in their fight against Vought. “You’ll get a sense of this resistance that really kicks off at the end of ‘Gen V’ — how it’s been going — when you pick up ‘The Boys’ Season 5. And the spoiler is: Not well,” he says.\n\n\tWhile Marie’s powers are powerful, Kripke says he and “Gen V” showrunner Michele Fazekas aren’t delivering her as a deus ex machina who’s fully primed and ready to solve the big-bad Homelander problem in “The Boys.”\n\n\t“She’s super powerful, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that she’s amazing at controlling it,” Kripke says. “She’s not Keanu at the end of ‘The Matrix,’ because — based on the next couple ‘Matrixes’ — it’s not great for drama. You want a character who’s really struggling and growing, especially a kid like Marie. So even though she has a lot of raw power, she has to learn how to control it.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJasper Savage/Prime\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBased on everything fans have seen by the end of the “Gen V” Season 2 finale, Kripke can now confirm the extent of Marie’s power as such: “She controls blood down to the cellular level, so that can mean manipulating it around to heal someone. That could mean making the blood inside their head combustible. That can mean using it as a whip. She has ultimate control over any cell that’s part of someone’s blood — question mark?”\n\n\tAccording to Kripke, the writers’ room has defined Marie’s power as within “the same branch of the tree” as Victoria Neuman’s, the head-popping vice president who Butcher killed in the Season 4 finale of “The Boys” — but “more powerful,” he says. And that would be key going into any future battle with Homelander, who still terrified Neuman.\n\n\tSee below for more from Variety‘s “Gen V” Season 2 finale interview with Kripke, who talks about plans for a possible Season 3, a potential “The Boys” video game — and an update on the Mexico-set spinoff of “The Boys.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJessie T. Usher as A-Train\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Prime\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAre there plans for “Gen V” Season 3 after “The Boys” final season?\t\n\n\tWe’d like to. I mean, we have story, we’ve talked about it, and I actually love it. I love the notions that have been kicked around. It’s going to come down to that classic, very boring television answer, which is ratings. We need enough people to watch to justify Amazon picking us up for a third season. We don’t know. They’re watching the numbers closely. They’re keeping a pretty tight poker face right now, but hopefully. Tell your friends, watch the show. Let’s get a Season 3!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI’ve heard some rumblings that there might be a video game adaptation that works. We’ve seen characters like Homelander pop up as integrations in some other games like “Mortal Kombat 1” — but is an actual “The Boys” video game adaptation in the works?\t\n\n\tThere is currently a desire, but no hard plans for, a console game. I don’t want to give anything away, because I’m not sure what I’m allowed to say or not, but there are plans for some other kinds of video games that aren’t necessarily Xbox or PlayStation.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tErin Moriarty as Annie/Starlight in “Gen V” Season 2/Amazon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Prime\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs the Mexico-set “The Boys” spinoff series still in the works, and if so, where would that take place in “The Boys” timeline?\t\n\n\tIt is still in the works. Gareth [Dunnet-Alcocer], who’s an amazing writer, is writing drafts right now. It’s in development. I think it’s hilarious. But we’ll see, it’s going through the bumpy rapids of development. It would take place at some point after Season 5 of “The Boys.”\n\t\n\t\tKnowing that there’s a chance for that, and there’s a chance for “Gen V” Season 3, would we potentially see some existing “The Boys” main series characters continue on depending on who survives?\t\n\n\tYes, that would be the hope, that there’s certain characters that we could cross over into “The Boys” Mexico [spinoff]. But we’ll see.\n\t\n\t\tSo by the end of “The Boys,” what would you say the goal is? What story is it you are trying to end by the end of “The Boys”?\t\n\n\tI would say we’re trying to land the plane on, really, the primary concerns of “The Boys,” which are Butcher vs. Homelander; the love story of Hughie and Annie; the fraught big brother/little brother relationship of Butcher and Hughie — all the things that “The Boys” are about, we’re trying to bring to a conclusion in a surprising and emotional way.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\tEditor’s note: An earlier version of this story listed the incorrect title for the “Gen V” Season 2 finale, which is “Trojan.”\n",

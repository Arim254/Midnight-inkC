    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tHeights are indeed getting wuthered.\n\n\tNot only did Emerald Fennell’s bold take on the classic novel collect an impressive $83 million at the global box office this past weekend, but the audiobook version of the Emily Brontë story has also seen a dramatic revival. According to the public relations and communications firm Burson Global, “Wuthering Heights” has seen a 440% increase in audiobook consumption since the film trailer dropped last September.\n\n\n\tAccording to data, this increase isn’t just repeat or nostalgia fans – first-time listeners to the audiobook increased by 260%. Their reports also indicate that Gen Z (ages 13-28) is particularly drawn to this classic, with this age group experiencing a 191% increase in streaming the audiobook.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t“The White Lotus” and “Sex Education” star Aimee Lou Wood voices the 2020 audiobook version, with an introduction by Pauline Nestor. The dark Gothic novel set in the Yorkshire moors traces the obsessive, destructive love between Heathcliff, an orphan adopted by the Earnshaw family, and Catherine Earnshaw, who loves him deeply but marries the wealthy Edgar Linton for social security. Devastated, Heathcliff disappears and later returns rich and vengeful, determined to punish both the Earnshaws and the Lintons, unleashing a cycle of cruelty that scars the next generation. Ultimately, while Heathcliff and Catherine’s passion ends in tragedy, the novel closes on a note of cautious hope as their children, Cathy Linton and Hareton Earnshaw, begin to heal the damage left behind.\n\n\tMargot Robbie and Jacob Elordi star as the toxic lovers in the Warner Bros. remake of the romantic drama, in theaters now. \n\n\n\tPurchase the “Wuthering Heights” audiobook here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMckenna Grace is joining the “Scooby-Doo” live-action series at Netflix, Variety has learned from sources.\n\n\tGrace will star as a young Daphne Blake in the show, which will delve into how the Mystery Inc. gang first met each other.\n\n\tNetflix picked up the show for eight episodes in March 2025. The official logline for the show describes it as a modern reimagining of the popular cartoon show. “During their final summer at camp, old friends Shaggy and Daphne (Grace) get embroiled in a haunting mystery surrounding a lonely lost Great Dane puppy that may have been a witness to a supernatural murder,” the logline reads. “Together with the pragmatic and scientific townie, Velma, and the strange, but ever so handsome new kid, Freddy, they set out to solve the case that is pulling each of them into a creepy nightmare that threatens to expose all of their secrets.”\n\n\n\tThe role marks a return to playing Daphne Blake for Grace. She voiced the young version of the character in the animated film “Scoob!” in 2020. She was to reprise the role in the prequel, “Scoob! Holiday Haunt,” but that film was axed by Warner Bros. Discovery in a cost-cutting move. Grace has also played the young version of main characters in shows like the Netflix series “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” and in films like “Captain Marvel” and “I, Tonya.” \n\t\n\n\tGrace went on to receive an Emmy nomination in 2021 for outstanding guest actress in a drama for her work in the hit Hulu series “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Elsewhere in television, she is also known for her work in “The Young and the Restless,” “The Haunting of Hill House,” “Young Sheldon,” and “Designated Survivor.” In film, she has starred in projects like “Gifted,” “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” and “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,” and “Five Night’s a Freddy’s 2.” \n\n\tShe is repped by CAA and Entertainment 360. \n\t\n\n\tJosh Appelbaum and Scott Rosenberg serve as writers and showrunners and will also executive produce along with André Nemec and Jeff Pinkner under their Midnight Radio banner. Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and Leigh London Redman will executive produce via Berlanti productions. Warner Bros. Television will produce. Berlanti Productions is currently under an overall deal at WBTV, with the studio controlling the rights to the Hanna-Barbera characters.\n\n\tThis will not be the first live-action Scooby-Doo project to make it to the screen. Most famously, “Scooby-Doo” was released in 2002 and starred Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, and Linda Cardellini, with Neil Fanning voicing Scooby. The film was a box office success, generating over $250 million worldwide. A sequel with the same cast, “Scooby-Doo: Monsters Unleashed,” came out in 2004 and grossed over $180 million. There was also the live-action TV film “Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins” and its sequel that were released in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\tThere have also been a wide range of Scooby-Doo animated projects over the years, beginning with the original cartoon series in the late 1960s. Various incarnations have followed over the years, spanning multiple animated series and films. \n",

    "body": "\n\tCBS said it did not force “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” to pull an interview with Texas state Rep. James Talarico from its TV broadcast Monday, contrary to the way the late-night host had framed it. Rather, according to CBS, its legal team provided “guidance” to “The Late Show” that Talarico’s appearance could “trigger the FCC’s equal-time rule.”\n\n\tIn a statement Tuesday, CBS said, “‘The Late Show’ was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico. The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. ‘The Late Show’ decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”\n\t\n\n\tOn Monday’s episode of “The Late Show,” Colbert said CBS lawyers had blocked him from airing an interview with Texas state Rep. James Talarico, who is running for U.S. Senate, over the FCC’s recent warning that it would consider enforcing the agency’s “equal time” political rules for late-night and daytime talks shows. Colbert also claimed the network’s legal team told the host specifically to not to discuss the matter on air.\n\n\n\tTalerico “was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network’s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said on the show. “Then I was told — in some uncertain terms — that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn’t want us to talk about this, let’s talk about this.”\n\t\n\n\tColbert noted that “there’s long been an exception” to the equal-time rule for news interviews and talk show interviews with politicians. But he cited the warning issued in January by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, that the exemption to the rule would not apply to “partisan” broadcast programming. “Let’s just call this what it is: Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV because all Trump does is watch TV,” Colbert said. “He’s like a toddler with too much screen time. He gets cranky and then drops a load in his diapers.”\n\n\tColbert also said even though the FCC’s Carr had not officially “done away with” the equal-time rule exception yet for late-night shows, “my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had.” He added, “I want to assure you, ladies and gentlemen, please, I want to assure you, this decision is for purely financial reasons.”\n\n\tHis comment about “purely financial reasons” was a reference to CBS’s statement last year that the decision to end “The Late Show,” which will end its 11-season run in May 2026, was a “purely” financial one. The network is not planning to relaunch the late-night show with another host.\n\n\tAfter Monday’s episode aired on TV, “The Late Show” released Colbert’s interview with Talarico on YouTube, X, TikTok and Instagram. \n\n\tOn Tuesday, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the agency’s only Democratic commissioner, called the move to “censor” Colbert another example of “corporate capitulation” to the Trump administration.\n",

    "body": "\n\tQuinta Brunson received the Variety Showrunner Award at SCAD TVfest on Feb. 6, joined by her “Abbott Elementary” co-star Sheryl Lee Ralph for an honest conversation about the highs and lows of the television industry. Variety moderated this conversation in partnership with SCAD TVfest.\n\n\t Brunson was introduced by Ralph, who praised her as someone truly rare in the business. “There are a lot of talented people in the industry — and she is talented. There are a lot of gifted people in the industry—and Quinta is gifted,” Ralph said. “But Quinta is also something we don’t often find. She is rare.”\n\t\n\n\tRalph credited Brunson’s leadership for the show’s success. “Everything trickles down from the top,” she said. “[She’s] the reason, five years into it, we still laugh and talk together. All of us as a cast, some of us even spend time together on the weekend.”\n\n\tTaking the stage, Brunson dismissed shortcuts to fame in favor of mastering fundamentals. “The ‘Abbott’ pilot is a result of me focusing on my craft,” she said. “If I didn’t sit there and learn how to properly write a pilot, how to do a three-act structure, none of this would’ve happened. I know there’s so many other ways to make it big and get famous and blah, blah, blah, but man, that craft will gift you all of this.”\n\n\tDuring a candid Q&A following the award presentation, Brunson and Ralph offered students a dose of reality about the entertainment business — one that balanced encouragement with unflinching honesty about the challenges ahead.\n\n\t“If you think this is difficult, if you think this is hard, please find another occupation,” Ralph told the audience. “None of what we do is for the faint of heart. It is very difficult exposing your raw feeling and talent, your art to people to have it rejected over and over and over again.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Emmy winner didn’t mince words about the arbitrary nature of rejection in Hollywood, noting that even stellar work can be dismissed for reasons like resembling someone’s “ex-wife.” She warned students that the business “will take a nice bite out of you, chew you up, maybe lean back, put some salt and pepper on you and decide I don’t like it. That’s showbiz.”\n\n\tBrunson added that success doesn’t shield anyone from criticism. Even with “Abbott Elementary’s” acclaim, she said, “We be getting our ass beat too. You deal with a lot every day. It’s just as much bad as it is good.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for SCAD\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA revealing moment came when Ralph teased Brunson about directing, something the showrunner has notably not done on her own series. When Ralph suggested she was “working on becoming a director,” Brunson pushed back, explaining that juggling multiple roles can be too much. Directors need prep time, meetings, shooting, then editing and a director’s cut. “When we have writers do it, we lose them in the room for like four weeks and it hurts,” she said. “I can’t afford to lose me in the room.”\n\n\tInstead, she’s focused on supporting other directors, calling it one of the most rewarding aspects of running the show. “It’s been so wonderful to give new directors experiences,” she said. That focus on nurturing talent connects to a larger theme both women emphasized: the value of honing one’s craft. “Lean into your craft because your craft will carry you,” Ralph said. “A lot of people think you just roll out of bed and do this. No you don’t.”\n\n\tWhen a student asked for advice on staying true to herself as a Black woman in the industry, Brunson emphasized community and foundation, crediting her college friend Lana as part of the reason she graduated. “We feed into each other as women and as Black women,” she said. “So you can stay grounded.”\n\n\tRalph emphasized knowing yourself before entering an industry designed to break you down. “I’ve seen it and I had to walk away,” Ralph said. “I know who Sheryl Lee Ralph is.”\n\n\tThroughout the panel, Brunson’s advice came back to a consistent theme: don’t lose yourself in pursuit of success. “I’ve read movies, pilots from people all the time. Some of them are unknowns and it’s the best writing,” she said. “So just be good at what you do. I feel like that’s getting thrown out the window. That’s why I’m putting so much emphasis on it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDamon Wayans Jr. is set to lead the NBC drama pilot “Puzzled,” Variety has learned. \n\n\tThe pilot was picked up at NBC back in January. It is based on the “Puzzle Master” books by Danielle Trussoni. The official logline states, “After barely escaping a tragic fire, once promising college athlete Mike Brink (Wayans) is transformed by a traumatic brain injury that gives him the unique ability to see the world in an unexpected way and helps him solve crimes with local police.” \n\t\n\n\tThe character description for Mike Brink says “He makes his living by betting on sports and is uniquely equipped to do this because he developed Acquired Savant Syndrome as a result of a traumatic brain injury. This rare phenomenon gives him exceptional skills in puzzle-solving, higher math functions and pattern recognition.” \n\n\n\tWayans and his Two Shakes Entertainment banner are currently under a first-look deal at CBS Studios. Under that deal, he starred in and executive produced the CBS multi-cam comedy “Poppa’s House” and currently hosts and executive produces the CBS game show “Raid the Cage.” His other notable television roles include “Happy Endings” and “New Girl,” while he is known for starring in films like “Let’s Be Cops” and “The Harder They Fall.” \n\n\tHe is repped by UTA, Ziffren Brittenham and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. \n\n\tJoey Falco is the writer and executive producer on “Puzzled,” with Jordan Cerf of Linden Entertainment also executive producing. Trussoni is a producer on the project. Universal Television is the studio. \n\n\tWayans is the latest lead casting for an NBC pilot to be announced in recent days. Previously, it was reported that Téa Leoni will star in the comedy pilot “Newlyweds,” while David Boreanaz will play Jim Rockford in the NBC reboot of “The Rockford Files.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tFrench pay TV channel Canal+ will be hosting a Cinema for Peace broadcast event on primetime Tuesday evening (Feb. 17), kicking off with Loris Lai’s “Les Enfants de Gaza: Les Vagues de la Liberté” (“How Kids Roll”), followed by a live debate with the film’s two leads.\n\t The 2003-set drama follows two 11-year-old boys — Mahmud, a Palestinian living in Gaza, and Alon, an Israeli — whose shared passion for surfing cuts through the violence surrounding them. Set during the Second Intifada, the shows how the two kids form a bond that deepens under the guidance of Dan, a 30-year-old former surf champion who becomes their mentor. As tensions escalate, Mahmud is forced into a choice that could alter the course of his life. The film was made before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2024, and before the outbreak of the war in Gaza.Written by Lai and Dahlia Heyman, the film is freely inspired by Nicoletta Bortolotti’s children’s novel “Sulle Onde Della Libertà,” published by Ragazzi Mondadori.\n\t\n\t“How Kids Roll,” which Canal+ praised for “its universal message of peace,” was produced under the original title “I Bambini di Gaza” by Eagle Pictures‘ Tarak Ben Ammar, who’s behind the 2024 Italian box office hit “The Boy With the Pink Pants,” and Elda Ferri, whose credits include Roberto Benigni’s Oscar-winning “Life is Beautiful.” The original score is composed by Nicola Piovani, the composer of “Life Is Beautiful” who won an Academy Award for the film.\n\n\t“Kids are the new generations and the only real hope for a different future, a better future… peace. Even if it’s only a dream, we have to believe it,” said Lai. “Ennio Flaiano once said: ‘Who refuses to dream, is forced to saddle with reality.” We can’t saddle with this reality, we must dream, we must believe,” he added.The film won best directorial debut at the 2025 David di Donatello Awards, Italy’s top film honors; as well as best international film at the Beverly Hills Film Festival and was selected at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The post-broadcast debate on Canal+ – hosted by prominent TV hosts Sonia Mabrouk and Laurie Cholewa — will reunite Lai with the young leads of the film, Mikhael Fridel and Marwan Hamdan, alongside Hugues Dewavrin, VP of Les Écrans de la Paix, and filmmakers Alexandre Arcady, Pascal Elbé and Jawad Rhalib. The discussion will explore the film’s origins, its themes of fraternity, and the broader question of how cinema can build bridges.The initiative follows a live screening of the film that Canal+ hosted at Paris’ Mac Mahon theater, where middle school students engaged the director and cast in a Q&A, underscoring the film’s resonance with younger audiences.",

The workers, represented by the Pacific Northwest Staff Union, voted to authorize a strike last month after talks broke down.\n\n\t“The Writers Guild Staff Union (WGSU) has called an unfair labor practice strike in protest of ULPs committed by Writers Guild of America West management,” the union said in a statement. “Guild management has surveilled workers for union activity, terminated union supporters, and engaged in bad faith surface bargaining, showing no intention to come to an agreement on most of WGSU’s core issues.”\n\t\n\n\tThe union members will begin picketing outside the WGA West headquarters.\n\n\tThe move comes one month before the WGA is due to sit down with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers to begin bargaining a new contract for Hollywood TV and film writers. The union leadership has said that it expects bargaining to go on as normal despite the strike.\n\n\tIn a statement on the guild’s website, the WGA said that it will continue to bargain in good faith with the staff. The union also stated that AMPTP negotiations “in particular will be minimally impacted since the executive staff and managers who play key roles working directly with the WGA Negotiating Committee will not be on strike.”\n\n\tWGA West headquarters will be closed to the public and to members for the time being, however. Screenings at the Writers Guild Theater will also be suspended.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHarris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment has announced the appointment of Bruce Wheeler as general manager of the historic Loew’s Jersey Theatre located in Jersey City, New Jersey. In this role, Wheeler will oversee all day-to-day operations, event management, and venue readiness as the theatre completes its ongoing restoration and prepares to reopen in Fall 2026.\n\n\tLoew’s Jersey Theatre, originally opened in 1929, is currently undergoing an extensive restoration through a collaborative partnership between the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency, the State of New Jersey, and HBSE. The project will return the theatre to active use after more than 40 years, transforming the space into a modernized entertainment venue while preserving its historic character.\n\t\n\n\t“We’re thrilled to welcome Bruce Wheeler to the HBSE family as we prepare to reopen Loew’s Jersey Theatre,” said Sean Saadeh, Chief Programming Officer and Head of Entertainment, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment. “Loew’s is a truly special venue, and Bruce’s experience and vision will help us unlock its full potential as we prepare to deliver world-class live entertainment to Jersey City and beyond.”\n\n\n\tWheeler is a 30-year veteran of the entertainment industry with stints in marketing and artist development at independent and major record labels, as well as industry relations with early online music site, ARTISTdirect. He spent the past 15 years in the venue world including senior management roles at Central Park SummerStage, The Beacon Theatre, and The Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY. His company Babylon Productions managed international touring efforts for Cage the Elephant, Jimmy Fallon, Rufus Wainwright, Bruce Hornsby, Regina Spektor, and many others.\n\t\n\n\tThe restoration includes rehabilitation of the theatre’s historic interiors and exteriors, modernization of mechanical and production infrastructure, upgrades to public and backstage areas, and the addition of other premium spaces. The renovated venue will accommodate a flexible capacity of 2,600 to 4,000 guests, enabling a wide range of live events.\n\n\tUpon its expected opening in Fall 2026, the theatre is expected to host approximately 150 events annually, in addition to at least 70 dates for public programming, contributing to the cultural and economic revitalization of the Journal Square District.\n\n\tTuesday, Feb. 12\n\n\tJohn Fogerty – best known as the songwriter, singer, lead guitarist, arranger and producer for Creedence Clearwater Revival – has been named as this year’s recipient of the Songwriters Hall of Fame’s Johnny Mercer Award.\n\n\tThe award, which is the Hall’s highest honor, “is exclusively reserved for a songwriter or songwriting team who has already been inducted in a prior year and whose body of work is of such high quality and impact that it upholds the gold standard set by the legendary Johnny Mercer.”\n\n\t“His style of composition is rock and roll mastery,” Songwriters Hall chairman Nile Rodgers said in a statement. “It’s what I’ve always personally believed in, something I call ‘The art of complex simplicity.’ He’s done what I believe all great songwriters do. He makes us feel. He deserves this award as much as anyone who’s ever received it, or will receive it, in the future.”\n\n\tFogerty was previously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, recognized with American Music Honors, BMI’s Icon Award, Board of Directors Award and the Troubadour Award, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n\tMercer was a co-founder of Capitol Records and recipient of four Academy Awards (and eighteen nominations) for Best Original Song, and also helped establish the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\n\tThe awards ceremony is scheduled for Thursday, June 11 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.\n\n\t+ Liz Rose, a Songwriting Hall of Fame inductee whose work includes Taylor Swift co-writes and singles for Miranda Lambert, Bonnie Raitt and Tim McGraw, among others, has renewed her global publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music Nashville, the pair have announced.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal will also reinforce the existing relationship between the publisher and Liz Rose Music, the songwriter’s independent publishing company whose signees include Eric Paslay and Cassidy Daniels.\n\n\t“Without a doubt, Liz is one of the most influential songwriters of our time, with an impressive catalog of music whose impact transcends generations,” Austen Adams, president of Warner Chappell Nashville, said in a statement. “We’re proud to continue our longstanding relationship and remain committed to supporting her vision as both a songwriter and a leader.”\n\n\t+ Mike Easterlin —former Elektra co-president, current Severance Records co-founder and a longtime label exec with promotions and A&R experience at Virgin, Def Jam and Atlantic — will be at the helm of ONErpm’s Nashville office, it was announced this week. At ONErpm, Easterlin will oversee A&R, roster development, and day-to-day operations in Nashville.\n\n\tIn addition, ONErpm also announced three more hires for its Nashville headquarters: Josh Tomlinson will be the new Director of A&R, Lindsey Terry was named Country Marketing Director and Chad Neville as a Project Manager.\n\n\tONErpm says it retains more than 600 employees in 40 countries, with staff having increased about sixfold since 2020.\n\n\t+ Vydia, the Gamma.-owned music distribution platform announced that June Saba and Tony Girakhoo have been elevated to VP, Label & Artist Relations. \n\n\tOver nearly seven years at Vydia, Saba has signed Zeddy Will, Champz (son of Grammy-winning artist Wizkid), and secured a partnership with Afrobeats powerhouse the Plug, bringing in their full catalog (Davido, Oxlade, M.I.A.), and Anomaly Publishing.\n\n\tIn his eight years at the company, Girakhoo has signed Afrobeats star Zinoleesky, Grammy-nominated R&B singer Kenyon Dixon, and secured a label deal with Grammy-winning producer and executive RedOne and his 2101 Records.\n\n\t+ The Black Music Action Coalition has announced five new members of its executive leadership council, the organization announced this week.\n\n\tThe new appointees are Omar Al-joulani, President of Touring for Live Nation Concerts; Colin Lewis, a member of Live Nation’s Global Touring division; Mona Scott-Young, CEO and founder of Monami Management; Jerry Clark, a widely respected figure in Atlanta hip-hop and a former VP of Promotions; and Jennifer Drake, SVP of A&R for Interscope.\n\t\n\n\tThe Executive Leadership Council provides strategic direction for advancing equity, accountability and access across the industry through policy advocacy, economic empowerment, and creator-focused programs.\n\n\t“These appointments strengthen our ability to meet this moment,” said Willie “Prophet” Stiggers, co-founder, president & CEO of Black Music Action Coalition, in a statement. “Each of these leaders brings a unique perspective and a proven track record that will help push the industry forward in meaningful, measurable ways. Mona Scott-Young will help lead initiatives focused on women’s equity and breaking the glass ceiling for the next generation of female industry leaders, while Jennifer Drake and Jerry Clark will support the expansion of BMAC’s footprint in Atlanta, a cultural hub that continues to shape global music culture.”\n\n\t+ Jazz Young, currently the director of the Warner Music/Blavatnik Center for Music Business at Howard University and a former Def Jam executive, today announced the launch of her new project, VRTEXX. The record label and “creative ecosystem” will focus on empowering “artists, executives, and communities across the African diaspora and beyond by blending cutting-edge innovation with authentic storytelling,” a statement on the news reads.\n\n\tThe firm will be supported by Warner Music Group’s distribution subsidiary ADA.\n\n\tThe label will debut its current roster with live performances at the next installment of the West Africa Music & Arts Festival in Accra, Ghana – a festival that was founded by Young. Dates for that event have not yet been announced.\n\n\t+ Sony Music Publishing has appointed Roslyn Pineda to oversee its operations in Asia, the company announced. Pineda was most recently with Sony Music as general manager, Philippines and prior to that as vice president, Artist Relations & Business Development, Asia.\n\n\tPineda will replace Carol Ng, the current president of SMP Asia and a 28-year veteran of the company overall, at the end of March.\n\n\t“I look forward to collaborating with our talented team and working closely with Guy Henderson and Jon Platt to empower our songwriters across Asia,” Pineda said in a statement. “Together, we will foster a vibrant, energetic environment that prioritizes creativity and innovation, ensuring that the voices of our creators are heard and celebrated.”\n\t\n\n\t+ Independent music publishing and neighbouring rights company Peermusic will appoint Jody Farber as its new Chief Financial Officer, the company announced today.

I am excited to carry forward the legacy that Bill established in this role. I look forward to leveraging my industry experience and finance expertise while collaborating with our global finance teams,” Farber commented in a statement.\n\n\t+ Independent label services firm Create Music Group is appointing Mitchell Shymansky as its new Chief Data & Technology Officer, the company announced this week.\n\n\tShymansky will oversee CMG’s data, analytics, and technology strategy, with a focus on building scalable, intelligent systems that enhance artist outcomes, operational efficiency, and long-term platform advantage.\n\n\t“Mitch has helped define what modern, data-driven music companies look like at the highest level. His arrival marks a major step forward in how we scale, innovate, and empower artists and labels globally,” said Jonathan Strauss, co-founder and CEO of Create, in a statement.\n\n\tShymansky spent two decades at Universal Music Group, where he led the company’s Global Data & Analytics organization, responsible for architecting and scaling Universal Music Group’s modern data and analytics infrastructure, leading the organization’s transformation from legacy, on-premise systems designed for physical-era reporting to a cloud-native platform capable of multi-petabyte data processing.\n\n\t+ Kobalt Music has struck a partnership with London-based publishing company Geo Music Group that will provide Geo creators with access to Kobalt’s royalties, accounting and payment technologies.\n\t\n\n\t“With Kobalt, our roster now has access to industry-leading publishing technology and fast, reliable royalty collection.

    "body": "\n\tWill David Ellison move higher than Paramount Skydance‘s current $30-per-share offer for Warner Bros. Discovery? The company didn’t indicate that it is willing to increase the price tag for its hostile takeover bid but said it was ready to start M&A talks in the seven-day negotiating window opened by WBD.\n\n\t“Although the [Warner Bros. Discovery] Board’s actions are unusual, Paramount is nonetheless prepared to engage in good faith and constructive discussions,” the Ellison-led company said Tuesday.\n\t\n\n\t“At the same time, we will continue to advance our tender offer, maintain our solicitation in opposition to the inferior Netflix merger, and proceed with our intention to nominate a slate of directors at the upcoming WBD annual meeting,” Paramount said.\n\n\n\tEarlier Tuesday, Warner Bros. Discovery said it will engage in discussions with Paramount to “seek clarity” on its “best and final offer.” Specifically, the Warner Bros. Discovery board cited a communication from a “senior representative for PSKY” to an identified WBD board member that if the WBD board authorized M&A talks, Paramount “would agree to pay $31 per share and that the offer was not PSKY’s ‘best and final’ proposal.” In addition, WBD set March 20 for the special meeting of shareholders to vote on the Netflix deal — which the board currently still recommends that investors vote for.\n\n\tWBD wants Paramount Skydance “to clarify your proposal, which we understand will include a WBD per share price higher than $31,” Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav and board chairman Samuel Di Piazza Jr. wrote in a letter sent to Paramount’s board.\n\t\n\n\tParamount continued press its position that its $30/share proposal for WBD in its entirety is superior to Netflix’s deal to acquire WB’s studios and HBO Max.\n\n\tThe WBD board “elected to proceed with convening its special shareholder meeting on March 20 to seek approval of the Netflix merger and has commenced mailing its proxy materials, which state that the range of merger consideration offered to WBD shareholders will be a minimum of $21.23 to a maximum of $27.75,” Paramount said in its statement. “By contrast, Paramount already offers a higher value of $30 per share, all-cash and a more expeditious and certain path to closing a transaction,” including with the previously disclosed addition of a “ticking fee” of 25 cents per share payable per quarter to WBD shareholders for each quarter after Dec. 31, 2026, that a Paramount-WBD merger has not closed.\n\n\tEven as it opens the door to negotiations with Paramount, WBD’s board of directors “continues to unanimously recommend in favor of the Netflix merger,” the company said — and the board also unanimously recommends that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance’s most recent offer.\n\n\tParamount said that in opening the seven-day window for talks, WBD’s board “has chosen to avoid making the customary determination under the Netflix merger agreement that Paramount’s superior $30 per share all-cash offer ‘could reasonably be expected to result in’ a superior proposal, which would have given it an unfettered right to negotiate without a deadline.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tAny new boxed set in the series of Beach Boys compendiums that have been released sequentially over the years has been highly anticipated by hardcor",
    "body": "\n\tAny new boxed set in the series of Beach Boys compendiums that have been released sequentially over the years has been highly anticipated by hardcore fans. Now, with the newly released “We Gotta Groove: The Brother Studio Years,” the band’s mid-1970s archives are being explored in a 3-CD, 3-LP set, which delves into a period that encompasses two officially released albums, “15 Big Ones” and “The Beach Boys Love You,” plus an additional project that never saw the light of day, “Adult/Child.” These are artifacts for cultists, to be sure, but how big is the clique that has been waiting to hear all this unvaulted material?\n\t\n\n\t“Universal really put some muscle into this one,” Howie Edelson, one of the producers of the collection, said in introducing a Grammy Museum program that took place on the eve of its release last week. “This is not an easy sell, this boxed set.”\n\n\n\t…or is it?\n\n\tWell, of course it couldn’t have been a simple pitch in a board room — no boxed set is, in 2026, least of all one devoted to half-century-old material that mostly didn’t sell well in the first place. But “We Gotta Groove” was a very easy sell to the group’s most devoted cadre of fans, who sold out the initial allotment of the set online almost immediately after it was announced and went on sale in January. That sellout created a minor panic among the empty-handed faithful, until it was announced that there would be a second edition, which will ship on March 20, a little more than a month after the initial Feb. 13 release date. (Don’t worry, it’s also on streaming, with no delayed gratification.)\n\t\n\n\tIf anyone was shocked by how demand outstripped supply with this set, the irony was inescapable. “The Beach Boys Love You,” released in 1977, was loved by a certain cadre of fans when it first came out, but it was also a significant commercial bomb, peaking at a paltry No. 53 on the Billboard 200, coming off of “15 Big Ones,” a top 10 success. They could barely give the LPs away in bargain bins in the years that followed, but now, a $130 set that appeals primarily to people who really, really, really care about “Love You” is so popular it can’t be kept in stock even for a day. Good news: The Beach Boys still love you! — and Beach Boys devotees still love vindication, in whatever belated form it comes.\n\n\tThe Grammy Museum’s program brought together six producers and engineers who worked on this material — then, or now — followed by a climactic cameo appearance by Mike Love. Participating from the original sessions were Earle Mankey, the first engineer at Brother Studio in the 1970s; John Hanlon, the second engineer for those same recordings; and mastering engineer Jeff Peters, who first put the mixes to vinyl. Joining them from the current Beach Boys team were historian, producer and writer Edelson; producer and mixing engineer James Sáez and band archivist Alan Boyd, who’s credited with “artistic direction” on the new set.\n\n\tThis will hardly be the last chance anyone has to celebrate “The Beach Boys Love You” publicly. Upcoming at L.A.’s United Theater on Feb. 27 will be the first full-length performance of that album by anyone directly associated with the Beach Boys, as Al Jardine and the Pet Sounds Band (formerly Brian Wilson’s touring band) will play the album in its entirety after a series of recent tour dates in which they did most but not quite all of “Love You.” (In the audience for the Grammy Museum event were members of the Wilson/Jardine band, including Darian Sahanaja and Jim Laspesa.)\n\n\tA quick warning that there will be some biased reporting here: I am among that strange sliver of fans who considers “Love You” to be my third favorite Beach Boys album — after “Pet Sounds,” and after any given version of “Smile” that was cobbled together after the fact… and there are some days, and maybe even some years, where “Love You” moves to the top of the list. Which, inevitably, translates into it being one of my favorite albums of all time. It’s a hard obsession to explain, when the ’77 effort can be characterized as the group’s rawest-sounding project, and “raw” is not necessarily what most people come to the Beach Boys for. But the combination of the usual musical sophistication with some unusual rough edges is part of what makes it a singularly fascinating entry in the canon. It’s no wonder to me that there is a younger generation that might prefer this to more polished Beach Boys works generally. While all five members’ voices are featured, the writing and instrumentals are largely Brian Wilson as a synth-crazed, one-man Wrecking Crew, indulging in delightfully DIY auteurism that we never got from him quite like this, prior or since.\n\t\n\n\tWhile “Love You” is my primary interest/obsession, as it is for many fans, I found myself also loving the set for the chance to explore more deeply the projects that bookended “Love You” on either side — the overtly commercial “15 Big Ones,” and overtly uncommercial “Adult/Child” — and what they, too, represent about Brian’s and the band’s always roller-coaster journey. Taken in whole, this period was an oasis of creativity for Wilson in-between long stretches of inactivity that preceded and followed it, so even the minor misfires are fascinating; the absolute gems contained within the entry and exit points of Brian’s 1970s flourishing feel all the more precious. There is a narrative there…\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversal Music\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHere’s how the panelists told the story at the Grammy Museum, obviously with more of a focus on what was happening in Brother Studio, and secondary guessing at what was happening in Brian’s not always permeable head.\n\n\tAs Edelson set up the backstory: “In 1973, the Beach Boys had purchased a porn theater in Santa Monica [at 1454 5th St.]. This was Dennis’ idea, and it was gut-renovated and redesigned and repurposed by Steven Moffitt… and they made this place their professional home till February ‘78. This was the only time the Beach Boys ever had a professional studio that was open to the public. … In the interim, they made some incredible music that’s finally gotten its due… all recorded at this space. What I’ve always loved about this music is that Brian Wilson came back, and although people were expecting him to come back as the 1965 hitmaker Brian Wilson, Brian came back as Brian Wilson 1976, and it was not the same guy. It was not the striped-shirt Brian. But this music was just as real, just as authentic as ‘Smile’ was, as ‘Pet Sounds’ was. It was Brian being real and giving you what he had at the moment.\n\n\t“And for someone who was supposedly housebound and bedridden and doing nothing — which wasn’t true — Brian came back and in 15 months or so recorded about 40 songs… He had help finishing it through Carl, but he came back and made a ton of music, producing original songs, covers, other band members… Mike and Al and Carl and Dennis had been working on a followup to (1973’s) ‘Holland’ — they were all writing and recording songs — and once Brian came back, they all stepped back and let Brian lead, and it was the first time he had been back as the producer officially in eight years. It marks the last time that records ever bore the credit ‘produced by Brian Wilson.’ So this is a really special period. And a whole new generation has taken to it like nothing else.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tBut the beginnings of Wilson’s creative renaissance weren’t exactly entirely organic. An infamous “Brian’s back!” campaign was set in motion by the record company … deeply complicated by the fact that Brian didn’t want to be back.\n\n\t“The Beach Boys were behind on their contract,” explained Edelson. “There was no followup to ‘Holland.’ Capitol [the group’s former label] wisely put out ‘Endless Summer,’ which Mike helped program and, unlike every other greatest hits, brought a new career to them. The Beach Boys had already gotten back to the point where they were selling out Madison Square Garden on their AOR cred and this dynamite live show. And then all of a sudden a whole new generation gets this compilation and it starts getting played on AM radio, where kids like me are hearing the Beach Boys for the first time. It changed the game. And Warner Bros. is looking at their own diminishing returns and essentially says to this band, ‘Where’s our Brian Wilson classic album?’ Brian rises to the occasion … He had he said to me, ‘I said I would, and I did.’ There’s just something to that work ethic, and this wasn’t just his band, this was his family. And it was like, ‘OK, now’s the time. Now I have to go back to work.’”\n\n\tBegrudgingly, apparently, for a while. “At one point he said, ‘I just don’t have the fire anymore,’” remembered Earle Mankey, who served as first engineer during this period. “Whatever lit him on fire to do all of that stuff in the past, he didn’t have that… When I started working with him, Stephen (Moffitt) told me, ‘Well, Brian would much rather be out in his woody with his buddies, smoking dope and driving down the boulevard.’\n\n\tSaid John Hanlon, who worked as second engineer, “When he came back in, Brian wasn’t really user-friendly in terms of wanting to be around a bunch of people at all — anybody, even his brothers. Brian didn’t really seem like he wanted to be there. … Carl, Dennis, Al and Mike, all of ’em were just completely solidly behind ‘Let’s support Brian.’ I didn’t see any ego whatsoever. I saw the other four guys in the band in complete support for their elder brother, their writer, their genius. It was selfless, like, ‘What do we gotta do to make our brother shine and to bring him out of his shell one more time?”\n\t\n\n\tAdded Mankey, “’15 Big Ones’ was like the whole crowd — everybody from the olden days. The Wrecking Crew, they were there, and the room was packed from side to side. Brian came in and looked around; luckily he didn’t turn around and run the other direction. That was Brian working really fast, doing those songs in a very short time. But that’s a lot different than the things later on where he was in the studio writing songs.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Hanlon and Earle Mankey speak onstage at “Celebrating The Beach Boys’ We Gotta Groove: The Brother Studio Years” at GRAMMY Museum L.A. Live on February 12, 2026.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for The Recording Academy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe idea, as explained in the boxed set’s liner notes, was to record covers of some oldies, to ease Brian back into the process, with at least some thoughts of eventually releasing a separate covers album and a full record of Brian originals, if they got ‘em. His writing muse returned, as hoped, and the camp around him thought they had the beginnings of a full-fledged return to greatness after all. But then Brian announced that the album was done, and they were left with a record that was neither fish nor fowl.\n\n\tYet it was a hit, thanks in part to one of those covers that not everyone was excited about. At the Grammy Museum, Mike Love was happy to defend the hit single that came out of “15 Big Ones” — the last really major one the Beach Boys would have before “Kokomo” in 1988. “That was actually a pretty fun album to work on for me,” he told the audience. “Because I told my cousin, ‘Brian, we did pretty good with “Surfing USA,” which was paraphrasing “Sweet Little 16.” Why don’t we do “Rock and Roll Music”?’ The Beatles did ‘Rock and Roll Music.’ Chuck Berry certainly wrote it, but we did our own version that was kind of quirky and it went top 5. That’s not bad.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMike Love and Howie Edelson speak onstage at “Celebrating The Beach Boys’ We Gotta Groove: The Brother Studio Years” at GRAMMY Museum L.A. Live on February 12, 2026.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for The Recording Academy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs the new archival project shows, there were more solid covers left on the cutting room floor, like a very solid Al Jardine-sung “Shake, Rattle and Roll.” But part of the mission of the part of the boxed set that commemorates “15 Big Ones” was to show that some of the cut that did make the album had more fascinating arrangements than were apparent in the mix that made it onto LP at the time.\n\t\n\n\t“There was a rush to get that album out, and I wish you hadn’t had to rush it out,” said Edelson to Mankey and Hanlon, “because there was a definite deadline, and if there had been more time, I think more stuff would’ve sounded like what it sounds like now. Because you recorded it incredibly well, and there’s so much there that’s just brought to life. What you did, (Alan) Boyd, with ‘Chapel of Love’ — it’s like little pieces of Eden are popping up, and you couldn’t hear it on vinyl. And now to hear ‘Just Once in My Life’ sounding like this… when you hear that track now, it’s the definitive moment of those sessions.”\n\n\tSaid Boyd, “One of the things that one of the participants told me 25 years ago, and I can’t remember exactly who it was now, was that at the time of the mixdown of ‘15 Big Ones,’ there was a bit of an effort to dial down the eccentricities of Brian’s arrangements, so it would sound a little bit more normal for 1976. And in a way, that’s why one of my greatest thrills on this project was working with James (Sáez) on remixing a couple of those tracks.” But Boyd — the band archivist who is credited with “artistic direction” on the new collection — is not going to make the case that this album is an unsung masterpiece. “I mean, ‘15 Big Ones,’ when that came out, was very much a mixed bag for me. Some of it I thought really worked; I particularly liked ‘Just Once in My Life,’ and (the original song) ‘Had to Phone Ya’ might be one of the the greatest backing tracks that Brian ever recorded— it is so delicate and there’s so many layers…\n\n\t“But,” said Boyd, “I mean, I hate to say it, but there were times on ‘15 Big Ones’ when it sounded like the Beach Boys were trying to imitate the Beach Boys.”\n\n\tNo one in recorded history would ever make that accusation about the offbeat classic that very shortly followed, “The Beach Boys Love You.”\n\n\tBoyd explained to the Grammy Museum how hearing the album hit him as a Beach Boys-obsessed kid. “People who know me well know that I’ve been obsessed with the Beach Boys’ music from a very young age, literally 5 years old,” Boyd said. “By the time I was 6 or 7, I was getting things like ‘20/20’ when they came out. … And I still vividly remember what it was like being a fan of 1977 when ‘The Beach Boys Love You’ came out. Because I rode down to the record store on my bike, got that album, took it home, listened to it, and I had never heard a record that sounded like that — before or since. It completely blew my mind. The musical textures, the synth basses going from the left and the right, the Hammond B3 organs, the tack pianos, the very rough vocals, which had a lot of texture… And the songs, well, they were some of the silliest lyrics I’d ever heard in my life! You know, ‘Roller Skating Child,’ ‘Mona,’ a song about Johnny Carson, a song about the solar system. But the music behind it was incredible and very deep and very complex, and that record just blew my mind.\n\t\n\n\t“As it turned out,” Boyd continued, “there were three albums that came out that year, all from Brother Studios. The first was ‘Love You.’ And then there was this album by Ricci Martin, Dean Martin’s son, called ‘Beached,’ that was produced by Carl and Billy Hinsche and had some very eccentric musical textures going on with it that I really wanted to pick apart and see how did they do that. And then ‘Pacific Ocean Blue,’ Dennis Wilson’s solo album, which is I just think another sonic masterpiece, and another record that didn’t sound like anything I’d ever heard before or since. And I was convinced that Brother Studio was this just absolutely magical place.”\n\n\t“It was!” Hanlon quickly piped in.\n\n\tWhatever muse had shown up only intermittently for Brian during the “15 Big Ones” sessions had now moved in for a serious residency, with the most explosive writing burst he’d had since “Smile” was abandoned. The peculiarity of some of the lyrics — representing the only times Wilson basically wrote an album’s worth of words on his own — is part of the charm of “Love You,” along with the one-and-done Moog-iness of the project. But what was clear was that the key to getting a whole record’s worth of material out of Wilsonwas to take the pressure off and leave him to his own devices, for hours on end. Some of that burst can be heard in the solo demos included on the boxed set.\n\n\tSaid Hanlon, “There was a point where Steven Moffitt told me to blend into the woodwork, which was easy for me. There was a Nakaamichi wall cassette recorder, and he said, ‘Just set up one mic on the piano and one on Brian’s vocal and get out of there. Don’t interrupt him, no matter what. If he daydreams, if he walks away from it, just leave him alone.’ And anybody who knows working with Brian knows that’s exactly what you do. We used 120-minute cassettes and I left never walked in that studio, once he started playing on these writing sessions.\n\n\t“He would be doing three-part harmony and get hung up on the fourth (part), so he’d go sit down at the piano and play another song, like ‘Help Me, Rhonda’ or something. Most engineers would make a stupid mistake of opening their ego-ed mouth and go, ‘Brian, we’re working on this.’ But that’s how he came up with the fourth or fifth part in his head, while he was working on something else. He’d clear his head, go back over to the mic and all of a sudden there’s the third, fourth and fifth. He was a genius, even though he couldn’t elucidate speech-wise to you what he was trying to do.”\n\t\n\n\tWilson is alone on those solo demos, apart from one moment that stands out to Edelson. “He’s playing ‘I’ll Bet He’s Nice’ to Mike for the first time, and you hear Mike give like a whoop — a holler — and you hear Brian just get filled with this little bit of joy. Like ‘I’m being heard and there’s kindness being shown to me.’ And he starts playing a little stronger and he starts singing a little better. It’s such a great moment,” said Edelson. “You know, there’s a lot of issues with family bands, but nobody loves you like your family. And in those demos, when you hear Mike giving him that love, when Brian’s a tentative guy as it is, and he’s playing new songs, just getting that is one of the highlights on the whole box for me.”\n\n\tThe result of this creative overflow: something you can edge your way toward calling a pop masterpiece, if a masterpiece can feel modest and minimalistic, have a high degree of mirth, and be very, very Moog-y.\n\n\tAlthough “Love You” is sometimes thought of as nearly a Wilson solo album — the supposed original title was going to be “Brian Wilson Loves You” — that’s not nearly fair, and not just because of how evenly Brian dispersed the lead vocals among band members once he brought them into his vision. Boyd noted how crucial Carl was to the final product. “When the ‘Love You’ album came out, on the record label, there was a credit I’d never seen before,” he noted. “It says ‘produced by Brian Wilson; mixdown producer Carl Wilson.’ When I was 15 years old, I didn’t quite understand what that meant. But many years later, after thoroughly examining and dissecting the multitracks, I have come to understand what it was that Carl brought to the mixdown process.\n\n\t“On a lot of those songs, Brian just sort of recorded them full-stop, all-out, all the way through. Carl was making choices in terms of what not to include in the mix, to give it some dynamics. And that’s one of the things about ‘Love You’ that I’ve always loved, that I now realize that Carl brought to the finished project.” That process continues even now on the boxed set, with a new mix of “Mona” — arguably the most monotonous song on the original album — that now has peaks and valleys built in.\n\n\tMusicians and studio heads in the audience nodded along as the producers and engineers spoke of some of the quirks of Brian’s production approach — some unique to the project and period, like his timely fixation on analog synths; some more long-lasting. Hanlon and Mankey made note that Elton John’s producer, Gus Dudgeon, stuck his nose in trying to figure out how they were getting the drum and percussion sounds, to see if it could be duplicated. Part of the secret of the sauce was in mic-ing the percussion with overhead shotgun microphones, instead of close-up. “The wonderful thing about Brian’s percussive use of tack pianos, and this goes all throughout his career,” Hanlon said, “is that where many arrangers would use a high-hat to kind of keep the quarter notes, Brian’s using a tack piano, where you’re getting the click,  click, click, click, but you’re getting these incredibly lush, deep chords underneath it, which adds to the whole musical swell, in a subtle way.” Added Mankey, “And if either Brian or Dennis would sit down at the drums, they would not play the drum kit. They would play the floor tom more than the snares.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJeff Peters, Alan Boyd, James Sáez, John Hanlon, Earle Mankey and Howie Edelson speak onstage at “Celebrating The Beach Boys’ We Gotta Groove: The Brother Studio Years” at GRAMMY Museum L.A. Live on February 12, 2026.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for The Recording Academy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPeters said that when it came time for him to master “Love You” for vinyl, there were some unique issues. “When he brought in the tapes to ‘Love You,’ it was like, this is music from a different planet!” Peters said. “It was nothing like we’d heard before. And cutting that to vinyl was a little bit of a challenge, in all honesty. Low frequencies are a problem when you are cutting a vinyl record, and it was all Moog bass. And there was some delay or something that you guys (Mankey and Hanlon) put on the bass, so it was spread; it wasn’t just right down the middle, and that causes a lot of activity on a vinyl record.”\n\n\tThen, inevitably, after the adorkable weirdness of “Love You,” things got weird in a somewhat less satisfying way with the aborted “Adult/Child” project. It’s a mongrel of a lost album — or shards of it, anyhow — that few cultists, even, would say should have come out in the late ‘70s. Yet it does include some of the best songs Wilson wrote in that decade (which previously came out on other boxed sets), and some intriguing curios (some of which are previously unreleased).\n\n\t“Well, it was like three albums in one,” Edelson told the audience, not necessarily meaning that as a compliment. “There were big band songs…” (Not a typo there.) “…and these ‘Love You’-like songs where it’s the Wilson brothers. And they brought in a Mike outtake and they brought an Al outtake in, and all of a sudden it was an album. And I think everybody kind of realized that, that although this is a collection of songs — and, albeit, some brilliant — it’s not an album. And that’s, I think, where its destiny lie.”\n\n\n\n\n\tPeters recalled getting the recordings and being puzzled… again. “So, coming off of ‘Love You,’ which is just this incredible thing, the ‘Adult/Child’ tapes come in. I put it up and the first thing is ‘Life is for the Living’” — one of the aforementioned “big band”-style songs — “and it’s like, oh my God. It was super weird… But, getting through the rest of the record, I mean, ‘Still I Dream of It’ — what an amazing cut. ‘It’s Over Now’ — I mean, wow. It was just a shock hearing it for the first time.”\n\t\n\n\tSaid Boyd, “Brian brought in the old Four Freshmen arranger, Dick Reynolds, to do full orchestral charts on these, and we pulled the multis, and James has done these new instrumental mixes of the orchestral tracks behind ‘Still I Dream of It,’ ‘It’s Over Now’ and (the old standard) ‘Deep Purple.’ And James, I had tears in my eyes listening to this the first time, because you’ve uncovered all this musicality that was kind of lost in the old mix, buried underneath the vocals” on the bootlegs that have circulated. “It’s beautiful. It’s incredibly delicate.”\n\n\n\n\n\tWith “Adult/Child” being consigned to the scrap heap — with another 50 years to pass before fans got an authorized listen to some of the scraps — Brian dropped the creative leadership mantle he’d taken on. It wouldn’t be until a little more than a decade later that there would another groundswell of “Brian’s back” enthusiasm, this time surrounding his celebrated 1988 solo album debut.\n\n\tBut the Beach Boys as a unit were anything but inactive in the immediate wake of the “Adult/Child” fizzle. Even though Brother Studio would not be sold until ’78, most of the group decamped to Maharishi International University in late ’77 to make the Jardine-co-produced “M.I.U. Album,” which had Brian still on board for vocals and co-writes, but as a team player, not leader.\n\n\tMost of the Grammy Museum event proceeded as a producers-and-engineers panel, with Love’s appearance saved for the very end. When he was brought out, Love launched into a 12-minute stream-of-consciousness monologue that touched on the Brother Studio years represented in the boxed set, but also events stretching back to him and Brian bonding over music while attending youth group at Angeles Mesa Presbyterian Church.\n\n\t“He’d come over to my house in his Nash Rambler, and we’d get kicked outta my house because my dad had to get up so early to go to work at Love Sheet Metal, where I was an apprentice at one time,” recalled Love. “The Nash Rambler had the feature of the seats going down, so we laid back and listened to all the R&B stations in L.A. and we’d listen to our Everly Brothers. … We loved doo-wop. We loved Chuck Berry. We loved Little Richard. You name it, we loved it.\n\t\n\n\t“And so when I wrote this song, ‘Brian’s Back’…” He recited the lyrics. “They say that Brian’s back / Well, I’ve known him for oh so long / Well, they say that Brian’s back / Well, I never knew he that he was gone / But still they say Brian’s back / Well, I know he’s had his ups and downs / Well, they say Brian’s back / But in in my heart, he’s always been around.’\n\n\t“’Brian’s Back’ was a campaign for a record company, but it was far more than that for all the rest of us. I mean, we witnessed him get to 312 pounds. We were all worried about his mortality… and anxious about Brian’s well-being to the point where he spent a fortune with someone who overstepped his bounds as a therapist. But nonetheless… he kept him alive. Dr. Eugene Landy came in and got him down into the 180s, 190s, swimming a mile a day at Pepperdine University. Brian went so through so much to literally get back.”\n\n\tLove turns 85 next month, and his soft-spoken manner in his museum soliloquy was touching to many of those in the audience, even some of those not normally inclined to favor his point of view on disputes that have been part of Beach Boys lore over the decades.\n\n\t“I mean, there’ve been differences and terrible things that have happened and lifestyle choices that were terrible, ultimately, to many,” Love said. “But it’s always been about love, and with me, about trying to accentuate the positive. This evening, tonight, is ridiculously positive. It’s kind of miraculous, in a way, that there would be an interest in a period of time and a group of songs that never saw the light of day until now… We did all get together and support Brian in whatever ways we could. And I just had nothing but love for Brian, for the other guys, and for the music, and all the people that have worked on our music.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJames Sáez, Alan Boyd, John Hanlon, Mike Love, Earle Mankey and Howie Edelson attend Celebrating The Beach Boys’ We Gotta Groove: The Brother Studio Years at GRAMMY Museum L.A. Live on February 12, 2026 in Los Angeles, California.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for The Recording Academy\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHe referred to the “M.I.U.” album that came after the music in the boxed set, saying, “That was an attempt to get out of town, going to Maharishi International University, because there were too many temptations in town. We felt, being in Iowa, maybe that would be a better thing health-wise…”\n\t\n\n\t“That’s gonna be the next box set,” said Edelson. “Oh gosh, really?” said Love, sounding surprised. “Oh my goodness.” \n\n\tA boxed set that moves from “Brian’s back” back into the “Brian’s a little bit checked out” era may not have the same natural appeal to devotees as a “Love You”-centric collection… and if there are any songwriting demos of “Kokomo” to be had, we’ll be having them. Any time there’s material to be unearthed from the archives, the hardcore will be there to tell the rights-holders: Do it again.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Godzilla Minus Zero,” the upcoming sequel to the successful “Godzilla Minus One,” will open in North America on Nov. 6 from Toho and GKids. The release comes just three days after the Japanese release, which Toho says is a rare near-simultaneous bow for a Japan-produced Godzilla movie. \n\n\tThe Nov. 3 Japanese release marks the same day the original “Godzilla” opened in theaters in 1954, now observed as Godzilla Day. “Godzilla Minus One” also opened Nov. 3 in Japan in 2023, going on to become the highest-grossing Japan-produced Godzilla film and winning the Oscar for visual effects. \n\t\n\n\tTakashi Yamazaki returns as director, screenwriter and VFX supervisor for “Godzilla Minus Zero.” Though plot details have not been released, production is already underway at Toho Studios, with Robot producing and visual effects handled by Shirogumi. \n\n\n\tThe sequel’s title was revealed during Godzilla fest in November after the sequel was first announced in 2024.\n\n\tIn North America, “Godzilla Minus One” earned $56 million, the highest-grossing Japanese-language live-action film of all time. It became the first Godzilla film ever nominated for an Oscar and the first Japanese feature to win in the visual effects category.\n\n\tYamazaki told Variety last year that “Godzilla Minus One” was made for $15 million and that the budget for the sequel would likely be larger. He also reflected on the use of AI in filmmaking, saying, “Until recently, I’ve been still shooting on film and I like to use miniatures. So I know that someday we’re going to  have to embrace and kind of work with AI, but I’m probably going to be one of the later ones because I do like working with older technology and techniques.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tNetflix has unveiled its first “KPop Demon Hunters” collaboration with toy maker Hasbro, with the release of an official Monopoly Deal card game based on the hit animated film.\n\n\tThe Monopoly Deal: Kpop Demon Hunters Card Game dropped this month on Amazon as the first official release from Netflix’s licensing deal with Hasbro. First announced last fall, the partnership will feature the “KPop Demon Hunters” characters used across Hasbro’s line of board games, plush toys and electronics, including popular IP like Nerf and Furby. Hasbro has teased a “range of engaging collaborations designed to delight fans of all ages.”\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNEW RELEASE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMonopoly Deal: Kpop Demon Hunters Card Game\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tThe officially-licensed Monopoly Deal game combines characters and themes from the Netflix film with the same goal of collecting a full set of cards. Only in this case, players race to collect items that Rumi, Mira and Zoey need to make the concert a success and seal the Honmoon. \n\n\tThe all-ages game was released Jan. 1 and became an instant bestseller online, with Amazon reporting more than 8,000 units of the card game sold in its first week alone.\n\n\tIn addition to Hasbro, Netflix is also developing a toy partnership with Mattel, with the brands teaming up to launch a full range of “KPop Demon Hunters”–themed dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets. The first release in the Netflix and Mattel partnership is a three-pack of HUNTR/X dolls set to drop later this year.\n\n\tCan’t wait for the official Mattel launch? Amazon currently has this three-pack of “KPop Demon Hunters”-inspired dolls available online. Each doll is fully posable and measures approximately 11.5 inches in height.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALSO AVAILABLE\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKPop Demon Hunter-Style Dolls (3-Pack)\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tNetflix calls the Mattel and Hasbro licensing deals a way to “help meet the massive fan demand to have these favorite characters as part of their everyday lives, and marks another major milestone for Netflix’s smash global hit.”\n\n\tThe full release slate is expected to include toys, dolls, games, role-play products and other collectibles.\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters unleashed a global fan frenzy,” says Marian Lee, Chief Marketing Officer for Netflix, in a press release. “HUNTR/X showed us that a truly great trio is more than the sum of its parts. Netflix, Mattel and Hasbro joining forces on this first-of-its-kind collaboration means fans can finally get their hands on the best dolls, games, and merchandise they’ve been not-so-subtly demanding on every social platform known to humanity. As Rumi, Mira and Zoey say — for the fans!”\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJessie Buckley stars as Agnes and Joe Alwyn as Bartholomew in director Chloé Zhao’s HAMNET, a Focus Features release.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Focus Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Adapted Screenplay Commentary (Updated Jan. 9, 2026): Is this one all figured out, or is there room for a surprise or two?\n\n\tBAFTA’s longlist established the widest view of the field, naming “28 Years Later,” “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” “Bugonia,” “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Nuremberg,” “One Battle After Another,” “Pillion,” “Train Dreams” and “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.” \n\n\tThe clearest industry indicator so far comes from the USC Scripter Awards, which traditionally align closely with the Academy’s writers branch. Their nominations singled out Guillermo del Toro for Frankenstein (adapted from Mary Shelley), Chloé Zhao and Maggie O’Farrell for Hamnet, Paul Thomas Anderson for One Battle After Another (from Thomas Pynchon’s “Vineland”), and Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar for Train Dreams (from Denis Johnson). That lineup overlaps heavily with both BAFTA and Critics Choice, reinforcing a relatively tight core of contenders.\n\n\tCritics Choice added some further clarity. Nominees included “One Battle After Another,” “Train Dreams,” No Other Choice, “Frankenstein,” “Bugonia” and “Hamnet,” with “One Battle After Another” emerging as the winner. That victory matters. Historically, adapted screenplay winners at Critics Choice often match up with the Academy, despite no overlap in the memberships.\n\n\tWhat complicates the picture is timing. Writers Guild Award nominations and final BAFTA nominations will not be announced until after Oscar nominations are revealed, leaving voters without the usual consensus-building markers. In their absence, literary-forward awards like Scripter takes on added weight, and films that consistently show up across multiple, unrelated bodies gain an advantage by default.\n\n\tAs it stands, “One Battle After Another” holds the clearest edge.\n\n\tNominations voting will begin Monday, Jan. 12, and conclude Friday, Jan. 16. Official nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theatre and will be televised live on ABC in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Netflix\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Mubi\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: \"The Chronology of Water\" (Courtesy of CG Cinema)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Titles (Adapted Screenplay)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

In the period feature film category, “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme” and “Sinners” all landed nods, immediately separating themselves as the core contenders. “Bugonia” added a crucial data point by appearing in the contemporary feature film category, signaling that its grounded, modern aesthetic still resonated strongly with the craft branch. \n\n\tThat cohesion only strengthened with BAFTA’s longlist, which included “Bugonia,” “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “Sinners,” “One Battle After Another” and “Wicked: For Good,” alongside genre-heavy entries like “Mickey 17” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.” The overlap between BAFTA and ADG is notable, especially in a category where international taste often diverges from the Academy’s final five.\n\n\tCritics Choice effectively crystallized the race. Nominees mirrored the expected Oscar field almost exactly, with “Frankenstein,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “Sinners” and “Wicked: For Good” all cited — and “Frankenstein” ultimately taking the win. That victory gives the film a commanding position, especially as it has consistently been recognized for scale and world-building across every major precursor.\n\n\tMarvel’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” adds a different dimension, offering a retro-futurist canvas where past and future collide through the sleek, stylized environments of Kasra Farahani and Jille Azis.\n\n\tNominations voting will begin Monday, Jan. 12, and conclude Friday, Jan. 16.

    "body": "\n\tNetflix has ordered a series adaptation of Justin Halpern’s 2012 memoir “I Suck at Girls,” which will be written by Halpert and Patrick Schumacker, who both serve as co-showrunners on “Abbott Elementary” alongside Quinta Brunson. “Shrinking” and “Scrubs” exec producer Bill Lawrence is also on board via his banner Doozer, as well as Warner Bros. TV.\n\n\tVariety hears the order is cast-contingent, meaning Netflix could scrap the project based on which actors the producers are able to attach.\n\t\n\n\tNetflix declined to comment.\n\n\n\tThe show follows three high school sophomores who stumble through teenage romances while navigating adolescence and identity. “I Suck at Girls” is based on Halpern’s romantic misadventures with childhood crushes and losing his virginity.\n\n\tHalpern and Schumacker are executive producing the series through their Delicious Non-Sequitur Productions alongside Chet Dave, Lawrence, Jeff Ingold and Liza Katzer.\n\n\tHalpern, Schumacker and Lawrence first developed “I Suck at Girls” as a pilot at Fox in 2013. At Fox, the show was developed with the working title “Surviving Jack,” and was framed as a single-camera ensemble comedy. Set in 1990s Southern California, Christopher Meloni was cast to as a man becoming a dad, as his son is becoming a man, “in a time before ‘coming of age’ was something you could Google.”\n\n\tLawrence remains involved because “Surviving Jack” was produced by Doozer Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. At the time, Halpern and Schumacker were perhaps best known for their adaptation of Halpern’s Twitter feed “$#! My Dad Says.” The Fox version was executive produced by Halpern, Schumacker, Lawrence (“Spin City,” “Scrubs,” “Clone High,” “Cougar Town”) and Jeff Ingold. Victor Nelli (“Scrubs,” “The Bernie Mac Show”) directed the pilot.\n",

    "body": "\n\tActor and director Timothy Busfield is facing two counts of sexual abuse involving a minor in New Mexico after an arrest warrant was issued on Friday.\n\n\tThe investigation involves twin boys who were actors on the TV series “The Cleaning Lady” in 2022, on which Busfield was director. One of the boys told an investigator last fall that Busfield touched his “private areas” when he was seven years old, and again when he was eight, while they were on set.\n\t\n\n\tAccording to an Albuquerque police affidavit, the boy said he was “very afraid of Tim and was relieved when he was off set.”\n\n\n\tThe “West Wing,” “Field of Dreams” and “Thirtysomething” actor directed six episodes of “The Cleaning Lady,” which aired on Fox from 2022 to 2025.\n\n\tAccording to the affidavit, Busfield spoke to police by phone in November. He was asked if he had “any physical contact” with the boys and if he had picked them up and tickled them.\n\n\t“Timothy said it was highly likely that he would have,” the affidavit states.\n\n\tBusfield then said that the boys’ parents would be around, and it would not be “weird.” He later said he did not recall picking those boys up.\n\n\t“I don’t remember those boys,” he said. “No, I don’t. I don’t actually, I don’t remember it, if it happened. I don’t remember overtly tickling the boys ever, but it wouldn’t be uncommon for me.”\n\n\tThe 2nd Judicial District Attorney’s office declined to comment. Warner Bros. issued a statement late Friday confirming that the studio is cooperating with authorities.\n\n\t“The health and safety of our cast and crew is always our top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions,” Warner Bros. TV said in a statement. “We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and have systems in place to promptly and thoroughly investigate, and when needed, take appropriate action. We are aware of the current charges against Mr. Busfield and have been and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement.”\n\t\n\n\tAccording to the affidavit, Warner Bros. conducted an investigation in 2025 after SAG-AFTRA received an anonymous complaint about a separate incident in December 2024.\n\n\tThe complaint alleged that Busfield had kissed a boy on the face in the hair and makeup trailer, and that he would tickle and caress the heads of the boys. Warner Bros. contracted with an outside investigator who was not able to substantiate that claim.\n\n\tAlbuquerque Police Det. Marvin Brown alleged in the affidavit that Warner Bros. “made it very difficult to obtain information for this case.” The detective obtained a search warrant to get a copy of the investigative report, but it was not turned over until three months later, he wrote. \n\n\tWhen the detective reached out to other child actors on the show to ensure their safety, he was advised by Warner Bros. that he would have to go through its lawyers to talk to employees, the affidavit states.\n\n\tWarner Bros. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\n\tWhen Busfield joined the series, he “grew closer to the boys,” the affidavit states, continuing, “It was reported that Timothy would tell his children to call him ‘Uncle Tim.'”\n\n\tA police officer first spoke with the parents and the boys in 2024, after police received a report from their doctor. At the time, the boys did not disclose any sexual contact to the officer, and the police declined to pursue charges.\n\n\tHowever, in September 2025, one of the children reported to his counselor and later to his pediatrician that Busfield had “touched him on his penis and bottom.”\n\n\tThe other brother said “he did not like being touched, but did not say anything because he did not want to get in trouble,” according to the complaint.\n\n\tIn his interview with the police, Busfield said he had heard from Elodie Yung, the lead actress on the show, that the boys’ mother “wanted revenge” because her sons were not brought back for the final season.\n\n\tYung declined to speak to the police, saying she “does not want to be involved in the investigation,” the affidavit states.\n\n\tThe arrest warrant was issued by a judge on Friday afternoon. Busfield’s legal representative did not respond to request for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” screenwriters Danya Jimenez and Hannah McMechan are taking on some massive new IP — signing on to script Tim Burton‘s reimagining of the classic “Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman.”\n\n\tWarner Bros. Pictures tapped the writing duo to write the screenplay for the film, news of which broke in 2024. Burton is attached to direct the update to the 1958 science-fiction horror movie, which follows a wealthy heiress who grows into a giant after an alien encounter and exacts revenge on her cheating husband. The “Beetlejuice” and “Nightmare Before Christmas” filmmaker is also producing the film alongside Andrew Mittman and Tommy Harper. Gillian Flynn penned an earlier version of the script.\n\t\n\n\tLuckyChap — the production company led by Margot Robbie, Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara — is on board to produce and develop; Morgan Begg, the company’s director of development, is overseeing the project. Kai Dolbashian serves as executive producer.\n\n\n\tJimenez and McMechan were named to Variety’s 10 Screenwriters to Watch for 2025 after penning the megahit animated movie, Sony Animation and Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters,” alongside co-director Maggie Kang. The screenwriting duo met while attending Loyola Marymount University; then, they got a script into the Sundance Feature Lab, where fellow screenwriter Nicole Perlman approached them with an idea that became “KPop Demon Hunters.” \n\n\t“We started writing that in 2020 during the pandemic,” Jimenez told Variety last year. “At first, we were like, ‘This is going to be the biggest movie ever, and then as time passed, we were like, ‘Maybe it won’t get made. Who knows?’ And then we were on set this summer and the trailer dropped and we were shocked. You don’t really expect anything from this career. You’re just grateful to get paid and if something happens with it, that’s great.”\n\t\n\n\tAdded McMechan: “This was truly the first time where there was all this manpower behind it, and it felt like it was on track to being made.”\n\n\tSince the release of “KPop Demon Hunters” last summer, it has become a worldwide phenomenon, becoming Netflix’s most-watched film of all time, while its songs broke records on Billboard 200. The movie is nominated for three awards at this year’s Golden Gobes including best animated motion picture, best original song and cinematic and box office achievement.\n\n\tThe Hollywood Reporter broke news of Jimenez and McMechan boarding the project. \n\n\tJimenez and McMechan are repped by WME and Mosaic.\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGazelle (voiced by Shakira) in Walt Disney Animation’s ZOOTOPIA 2. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Animated Feature Commentary (Updated Jan. 9, 2026): The Producers Guild of America nominations offered a look at a year defined by scale and audience reach. Their lineup blended major studio sequels with newer originals, citing “The Bad Guys 2,” “Elio,” “KPop Demon Hunters,” “Zootopia 2” and the anime juggernaut “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle.” \n\n\tBAFTA’s longlist narrowed the focus slightly, spotlighting “Arco,” “The Bad Guys 2,” “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle,” “Elio,” “Little Amélie” and “Zootopia 2.” Notably, BAFTA leaned more international and auteur-friendly, a reminder that animation voters often reward emotional intimacy alongside technical sophistication (i.e., “Flow”). Notably “KPop Demon Hunters” wasn’t eligible.\n\n\tCritics Choice pushed the race forward decisively. Nominees included “Arco,” “Elio,” “In Your Dreams,” “KPop Demon Hunters,” “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” and “Zootopia 2,” with “KPop Demon Hunters” emerging as the winner. \n\n\tThe strongest confirmation of industry momentum, however, comes from the Annie Awards. Netflix’s “KPop Demon Hunters” and Pixar’s “Elio” led the field with 10 nominations each, including best feature and best character animation, a key bellwether category that often overlaps with the Oscar winner. Joining them in the Annie best feature lineup are “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain,” “The Bad Guys 2” and “Zootopia 2,” a group that almost perfectly mirrors the emerging Oscar picture.\n\n\tWhat’s striking this year is how clean the consensus appears to be forming. “KPop Demon Hunters” checks nearly every box: a Critics Choice win, PGA recognition, dominant Annie support and strong cultural penetration. “Zootopia 2” remains its most formidable challenger, buoyed by Disney’s track record and equal strength at the Annies and box office, while “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain” stands a chance as the likely indie/art-house selection, especially given its sustained presence across critics and industry lists.\n\n\tNominations voting will begin Monday, Jan. 12, and conclude Friday, Jan. 16. Official nominations for the 98th Academy Awards will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theatre and will be televised live on ABC in more than 200 territories worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: GKids\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: NETFLIX\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Films (Animated Feature)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Evere\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet’s character in “Marty Supreme” was meant to embody a young kid from the streets of New York. \n\n\tDirector Josh Safdie wanted to bring real authenticity to the film, not just visually but also in how the characters looked and felt. \n\n\t“It wouldn’t make sense to drop Timothée in there and have him look like this clean movie star,” says prosthetic makeup designer Mike Fontaine. Fontaine — who is nominated at the Makeup and Hair Stylists Guild Awards, as well as shortlisted for best makeup at the Oscars — worked closely with Safdie and makeup artist Kyra Panchenko to ensure Chalamet fit seamlessly into the gritty world of the film.\n\t\n\n\tThe story follows Chalamet as Marty, an ambitious young man from New York’s Lower East Side, convinced that table tennis is his ticket to success. Set in 1952, Marty is a hustler working at his family’s shoe store, where he pretends customers’ sizes are out of stock to upsell them on pricier pairs. On the side, he’s always looking for his next get-rich-quick scheme.\n\n\tFontaine explains, “Josh knew what he wanted. He wanted acne scars, keloid scars, like he’s been in some fights.” Marty’s face prominently features a scar on his cheekbone and additional scarring under his chin, suggesting a rough life. \n\n\tIn one scene, Marty jumps out of a window and climbs down a fire escape to evade the cops. “Looking at that, you got the feeling maybe this isn’t the first time he’s done this,” Fontaine adds. “He’s probably taken a few falls and hits.” \n\n\tThe question during production was how far to take the look. “We had the great advantage on ‘Marty Supreme’ of doing extensive screen tests with Darius Khondji. He filmed those tests with Timothée on a stage.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter reviewing the footage with Chalamet and Safdie, Fontaine realized the makeup was too extreme and decided to re-sculpt and remake everything. The goal was to ensure the makeup didn’t distract the audience but rather felt invisible. “Myself, Kyra and [hairstylist] Jimmy Goode would get Timmy done in an hour. We’d be doing the hair and makeup all at the same time in Timothée’s trailer,” Fontaine explains. “Kyra would start on the brow, and Jimmy would be styling the hair.”\n\n\tIn total, Chalamet wore five prosthetics. “There were large pieces that covered his cheeks to give the acne-pockmarked skin texture. He had another piece on his cheekbone to create a deep scar on one side, two smaller pieces for scars under his lip, and a long scar under his chin.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSince Khondji was shooting close-ups with long lenses, Chalamet’s face was front and center, requiring intricate attention to detail. Fontaine also had to “drench him in fake sweat” during the intense table tennis matches Marty plays throughout the movie.\n\n\tSafdie wanted another level of authenticity when it came to distorting Chalamet’s vision. Rather than using prop glasses, Safdie opted for a combination of contact lenses and prescription glasses. Fontaine explains, “We put contact lenses in Timothée’s eyes that made his vision blurry, and then gave him very heavy prescription glasses on top of it, creating the illusion that his eyes were really beady and small.”\n\n\t Safdie previously told Variety, “At the time, we said we were going to put +10 contact lenses in your eyes, and we’re gonna put -10 prescription lenses in front of them so that when his glasses fall off, he can’t see anything.” When Chalamet tried on the combination, Safdie recalls receiving a call from the actor. “He calls me and says, ‘I’ve got the +10s in right now, and I’m pretty dizzy.’” \n\n\tAccording to Safdie, Chalamet described the experience as feeling like “he was in a fishbowl.” Still, Chalamet was determined. “I’ll do anything you ask me to do,” Safdie recalls the actor telling him. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “People We Meet on Vacation,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tBook lovers reached their happy place Friday when the film adaptation of Emily Henry‘s beloved beach read “People We Meet on Vacation” dropped on Netflix. \n\n\tStarring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth as longtime best friends Poppy and Alex, the movie follows the odd-couple pairing throughout many years of travels as the free-spirited Poppy and up-tight Alex grow up and struggle with their increasingly intimate feelings for one another.\n\t\n\n\tIn a shock to no one who is a fan of rom-coms — which make up the bulk of Henry’s books, almost all of which are being developed for film — Poppy and Alex get together in the end, but first need to overcome their biggest fear: losing their best friend to gain a chance at romance with the love of their life.\n\n\n\tAs with many book-to-screen adaptations, changes were made during the filmmaking process, which was overseen by director Brett Haley and Henry herself from a script written by Yulin Kuang. But by far the biggest difference between the “People We Meet on Vacation” movie and the book it’s based on is the spiciness of the climactic sex scene between Poppy and Alex.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople We Meet on Vacation. (L-R) Emily Bader as Poppy and Tom Blyth as Alex in People We Meet on Vacation. Cr. Daniel Escale/Netflix © 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Escale/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“So here’s what I’ll say. I saw the scene as he shot it, and it was gorgeous and perfect,” Henry told Variety. “I mean, I feel a little bit guilty because I went and told all of my friends, ‘It’s one of the sexiest sex scenes I’ve ever seen in my life.’ Like, genuinely it was like ‘Titanic’ level to me. It was so, so good and raw and tender. So when Brett first started considering cutting it, that was because they had started doing test screenings and people who, especially people who weren’t familiar with the books, felt kind of like it was a hard right turn in the movie. And so Brett first brought that to me and asked, how important is seeing the sex scene to you and to your readers? And I was like, I think it is kind of important, in a way, because it’s something we’re destigmatizing, etc. But ultimately, my opinion would be that if it doesn’t fit in the movie, then it  doesn’t work. It has to serve the larger movie. I don’t want anyone to feel like they were jolted out of the story, and feel like they hopped rails into a different movie.”\n\t\n\n\tSee below for more from Variety‘s interviews with Henry and Haley about Netflix’s “People We Meet on Vacation” film adaptation and what else needed to be cut and altered.\n\t\n\t\tChanging the location of the book’s present-day-trip storyline from a Palm Springs to Barcelona\t\n\n\tEmily Henry: Brett asked early on. He told me, “This is not really going to work to shoot in Palm Springs. That’s a really tall order.” And the funny thing that I always come back to is that not even the movie “Palm Springs” was shot in Palm Springs, that was shot elsewhere. That sealed the deal for me right off the bat that this is a fine change. I love Palm Springs and so I set the book in Palm Springs, because I love it and it’s an excuse to travel there and all that. But as far as story goes, it didn’t feel essential at all. What felt essential was that they were staying somewhere very, very, very hot. Uncomfortably hot. And so Brett brought the possibility of Barcelona to me. He knew that he really wanted to try and keep the Tuscany trip, and he knew that if we filmed in Spain, we would be able to use different locations to capture both Tuscany and Spain. And I had never been to Spain, so I was on board again because it was an opportunity for a trip for me. \n\n\tAnd he was excited about the fact that it could make the story and the scope of the movie feel really big to have multiple big international destinations. I feel this movie does have an international audience, too. So that’s a nice thing, too, to be able to get a couple of different countries represented on some level. But I was honestly fine with that change. I knew that that might be a harder one for the readers, because they pictured it all in Palm Springs, which looks quite different, but it didn’t change the story fundamentally, so I was fine with it.\n\n\tBrett Haley: What happens is, there’s logistics in making a film. I don’t have control over when the film is greenlit or how it’s greenlit. This movie was greenlit, and it was a go, go, go type situation. We didn’t have much time, and it was very clear on the budget that we had to shoot this film, that Palm Springs wasn’t an option at the time. There’s no crew there, it would have been a whole situation. And then California didn’t have any connections to any other parts of the book or the movie and the tax credit wasn’t around then. It was just a logistical change and we knew that we needed Europe settings, and what location could give us most bang for our buck?\n\t\n\n\tSo when I called Emily, and I just said, “Hey, what about Barcelona for the wedding instead of Palm Springs?,” she totally got it. And I said, “Let’s really look at that, what happens in that vacation?” And if you go back to the book, most of it is in an Airbnb with an air conditioner that doesn’t work. That’s the thing that was most important, and the balcony scene, which fans of the book will know what I mean, that was most important. \n\n\tAnd the wedding itself, and I think the wedding in this film is one of the most beautiful sets I’ve ever shot on. And Barcelona was a great stand in very hot in Barcelona, I can, I can attest, and, and I think we pulled off the balcony scene and, and the Airbnb stuff as great as possible, because that’s when he started realizing, like, it’s not really about being in Palm Springs, about these two being together again, stuck together after two. Years of something that went down, and we’re trying to figure out why. So at the end of the day, the location of that one wasn’t as as crucial to Poppy and Alex’s journey as maybe some of the other ones, but we did our best to pick the other locations and nail those and make it feel like, yeah, we’re we’re really in these places\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople We Meet on Vacation.

Short/Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhich of Poppy and Alex’s trips from the book made it into the film and which got cut\t\n\n\tHenry: When Brett formally got the job, the first thing he did was call me and just assure me that basically we were on the same team, and that he wanted to know everything that the readers were going to be looking for and hoping for from the movie, and he wanted also to know what I was going to be looking for and hoping for from the movie. And so I gave him fairly comprehensive list of what I thought the readers were really going to have a checklist of what they were waiting for. And it was a long list an we could not get every single thing i,n but he found creative ways to get so many of the little in jokes and bits of dialogue in. And I didn’t really have that strong of feelings that any specific location needed to be in the movie. It was more plot points. \n\n\tTuscany, to me, was a very important trip. It didn’t have to be set in Tuscany — it still is in the movie and the book — but it was more just that the events of that felt really important to me. And Brett instantly was really excited about New Orleans. He’s from Florida, and has a lot of affection and love for New Orleans, as do I. And New Orleans is just a cinematic city. It feels like a party. There were so many reasons that it was one of the right destinations to home in on. I didn’t feel that precious about any one of the locations. And again, the thing that I’ve always come back to during this process is that the book is always going to exist. So if he had wanted to do all new vacations, I would have considered it. I mean, I would have definitely stopped to think, how are the readers going to feel about this? But as far as how I personally would respond, that would have been fine if they still had the same emotional beats and the same jokes and things that I knew people were going to be hoping for.\n\t\n\n\tHaley: I didn’t want to do any green screen. I didn’t want to fake it in that way. Obviously, we had to fake stuff like, we’re-in-Canada-but-we’re-not-in-Canada stuff. But I didn’t want to VFX goop it up and make it something where the audience went, “This doesn’t feel real. This feels something’s off here.” It needed to feel like we were on vacation with them. So it was a logistical thing where Spain represented a location that we could get a lot of different locations, we could make a lot work there. And then the other half of it for me, which was non-negotiable, was New Orleans, which is my favorite vacation in the movie, one of my favorite cities in the world. And so I said, well, we have to do New Orleans — and then what can we get out of Louisiana? And then how can we do really subtle things to make sure this sells as Ohio, New York, Boston, Tuscany, Squamish.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople We Meet on Vacation.

Courtesy of Netflix\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Netflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tToning down the spiciness of the sex scene\t\n\n\tHenry: So here’s what I’ll say. I saw the scene as he shot it, and it was gorgeous and perfect. I mean, I feel a little bit guilty because I went and told all of my friends, “It’s one of the sexiest sex scenes I’ve ever seen in my life.” Like, genuinely it was like “Titanic” level to me. It was so, so good and raw and tender. So when Brett first started considering cutting it, that was because they had started doing test screenings and people who, especially people who weren’t familiar with the books, felt kind of like it was a hard right turn in the movie. And so Brett first brought that to me and asked, how important is seeing the sex scene to you and to your readers? And I was like, I think it is kind of important, in a way, because it’s something we’re destigmatizing, etc. But ultimately, my opinion would be that if it doesn’t fit in the movie, then it  doesn’t work. It has to serve the larger movie. I don’t want anyone to feel like they were jolted out of the story, and feel like they hopped rails into a different movie. \n\n\tAnd I think part of it is that we start with Tom and Emily in college, and they feel very young in those scenes, in my opinion. And you look at them in a different way, and you get to watch them grow up, but it does feel a little bit different than if you were watching a movie about two 40 year olds or something. You’ve been with them since they were just-barely-not children. \n\t\n\n\tSo it’ll be interesting, because I do think that that will be something that will vary from adaptation to adaptation [with the other book-to-film projects]. Because I think the tone of the different projects are not necessarily all going to be the same tone as “People We Meet on Vacation,” just like I don’t think the books are exactly the same tone. So I do think we’ll have some sexier sex scenes, and I think we’ll have others that are more a traditional, classic rom-com fade-to-black situation. I think we’ll see the full gamut. And Brett and I have also talked about, I wonder if someday there could be a director’s cut where people can see this scene? Because it is really so beautiful, like, they all just outdid themselves. It feels so tender and real, but very, very sexy and romantic, and it just didn’t fit in the movie. And that’s what they say, kill your darlings. Like, if it doesn’t work in the larger project, it doesn’t really matter how good it is on its own.\n\n\tHaley: I think this one is so unique because it’s friends to lovers, and that’s a difficult thing to get right. I don’t think many films have been successful in it, because I think there’s a problem in going, well, just get together. You guys love each door, get together. But I think smart people know that when you have a really close friend, there’s an immense amount of inherent risk, and there’s no coming back if you cross that line. So for me, it was important that Tom and Emily had friendship chemistry and then romantic chemistry, and could we could feel that.\n\n\tIn terms of the steamier stuff, I think it was a tonal question for me. I just kept going back to the romantic comedies that I adore. Like, I wanted to do right by Emily’s book. And so we shot a scene that was literally, exactly what’s in the book, and readers know what that means. It, frankly, just didn’t gel with the film. It just didn’t tonally work. So it was really about finding the balance. I do want to push this genre forward, and I do think that rom-coms can be extremely sexy. And I think that this one is that. You have your classics, like “When Harry Met Sally” and “Notting Hill,” where there’s very little sex there. I mean, it’s extremely sweet, and you feel the chemistry, and it really works, but it doesn’t go too far. And I just kept coming back to those films like “Jerry Maguire” and all these films that just really inspired this film and saying, yeah, this doesn’t fit. The level of spiciness does not fit this tone. You see them grow up, you see them as kids, and then you see them as adults. And so it was really important to me to find a balance. And I think we did. I think we found the balance in the steaminess and the sexiness versus just the wholesomeness and the earnestness of their love. And I think what’s there really works and is true to the spirit of the book without tonally breaking the film, which was really one of the only things that I was like, oh, this, this idea that I had for this scene to be true to Emily’s book just frankly, didn’t work.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPEOPLE WE MEET ON VACATION, from left: Emily Bader, Tom Blyth, 2026. ph: Daniel Escale /© Netflix / Courtesy Everett Collection.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow Poppy and Alex end up on the final trip together — with them running into each other at baggage claim on arrival vs. planning to meet up from the start\t\n\n\tWe still keep the idea that she lies and says, “I’m going to Barcelona, too!” We wanted to really build up the possibility of conflict. And, like, wow, whatever went down between Poppy and Alex must have been bad. But deep down, they both want to see each other again. Like, that’s clear. And I think that’s from the book. There was something in when you read the book, it worked to be like, “Let’s go on one last trip and see if we can do this.” There was something in the film that just felt a little too easy. It just felt like, again, you want to pause the film and go, “Why are they not getting together?” \n\n\tAnd when I came up with the baggage claim scene, which I’m very proud of, I was like, on one hand, it’s chance, and on another hand, it’s very much Poppy being Poppy, and them being in the same place and getting sort of stuck together. It took a lot of figuring it out, but it feels like the stakes are higher to me for the film. And it’s not to say the stakes aren’t high in the book, it’s just a different type of stakes. And I would call one book stakes and movie stakes, and they just require different things and different elements. And again, we kept Emily Henry very close throughout all of this, I didn’t make any decisions without going to her and saying, “What do you think of this change? How do you feel about this?” \n\n\tI think it’s really important that Poppy still makes the decision to go. She still lies, she still makes the decision to go to see him, and he still calls her out to say, “What are you really doing here? Because I know the answer isn’t to cover some Barcelona story, it’s to see me, right?” So that was the most important thing, and I think we just needed a little bit more tension and drama in that for the film. It just required a little bit more. It’s those nuances in the adaptation that just show you what a movie is asking for and what a book is asking for. I think they’re just different things.\n\n\tThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n",

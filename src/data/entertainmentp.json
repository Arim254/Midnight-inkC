    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ray-winstone/\">Ray Winstone</a> was out a little too late the night before his “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/star-wars/\">Star Wars</a>” audition.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring a recent conversation with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/ray-winstone-drunk-disorderly-star-wars-audition/\">Far Out</a>, the “Black Widow” star said he showed up to his audition for the role of Padmé Amidala’s father drunk, or “pissed,” as he put it. As a result, the casting “didn’t go well.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Had words and that was that,” Winstone said. “I’ve worked for George since, and he was fine. He didn’t remember. Or if he did, he didn’t take it to heart.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWinstone recalled that he was “out all night” the evening prior, and as soon as he walked into the audition, he knew he was “wrong for the part.” Instead of telling him outright, Winstone said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/george-lucas/\">George Lucas</a> “relayed the message to me through someone else,” which he “took umbrage” at.</p>\n<p>\n\tWinstone remembered Lucas yawning through his entire casting, presumably because of “jet lag.” After the try-out was over, the “Star Wars” mastermind was dead silent, prompting Winstone to tell him, “Why don’t we both have a 15-minute sleep and then I’ll fuck off?”</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite missing out on the role, Winstone has no regrets. He said that “Star Wars” is “that sort of film would bore the arse off me, all that bluescreen work.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe role of Padmé’s father, Ruwee Naberrie, ultimately went to Graeme Blundell, who appeared in the role in “Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThree years after the 2005 release of “Revenge of the Sith,” Winstone reunited with Lucas on “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” Lucas was a writer and executive producer on the film, while Winstone played antagonist George “Mac” Michale.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWinstone’s more recent credits include “Damsel,” “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” and “The Gentlemen” TV series.</p>\n</div>",

Rocking a black and blue “Marty Supreme” branded track suit and a ping-pong ball Halloween mask, faceless individuals also sporting the mask droned on around him, rallying in pairs at ping-pong tables. Soon enough, Chalamet rips off his mask and storms out of the box, and the masked men follow close behind.\n\t</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tChalamet stomps through an open field to the sound of a skull-shaking EDM track, which samples Jason Mewes’ monologue from the 2001 film “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.” Eventually, he retreats into a shipping container decorated like an interview set. Pleasant muzak played as Chalamet tied his shoelace and slipped water from an armchair, a poster for the A24 propped up behind him on an easel.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“‘Marty Supreme’ is an American film that comes out on Christmas 2025,” Chalamet said after nearly two minutes of silence, appearing out of focus in the frame of his Instagram live as the camera displayed the film’s poster.</p>\n<p>\n\tChalamet teased the live broadcast with a clip from an intense music festival mosh pit, with the hand-drawn caption “Supreme season incoming.”</p>\n<p>\n\tA24 is known for its left-field marketing tactics, and Chalamet has more skin in the game than usual — he’s credited as a producer on the project.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAlong with Chalamet, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/josh-safdie/\">Josh Safdie</a>-directed film stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Odessa A’Zion, Kevin O’Leary, Tyler Okonma, Abel Ferrara and Fran Drescher.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tBeing at war with Gavin Adcock was one thing. But to be warred upon by some of his own fans is another. And so <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/zach-bryan/\">Zach Bryan</a> has clarified, somewhat, his intentions with a song snippet he posted on social media that contained a line about ICE, saying that “when you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBryan’s attempt to tell his followers that he was not making a partisan political statement with the song comes in the wake of a deluge of “fans” posting that they are now ready to cancel the singer-songwriter. Many have posted that they are even ready to “Dixie Chick” him, which would amount to not just abandoning him but working to ruin his career. Even the White House and the Department of Homeland Security weighed in Tuesday on the partial tune.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“To see how much shit it stirred up makes me not only embarrassed but kind of scared,” wrote the Navy veteran, who has claimed in the past that he does not stand on either side of the political divide, and is trying to reiterate that now in the face of a firestorm. “Left wing or right wing we’re all one bird and American. To be clear I’m on neither of these radical sides,” he said.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe brouhaha started over when an audio snippet of a verse of an unnamed song began to be recirculated, in both electric and acoustic versions. Not all of the lyrics were completely legible, nor was it clear if the song was meant to be from Bryan’s point of view or one of his character-driven songs. What was clear, though, was that it included the line “ICE is gonna come bust down your door,” and was captioned “the fading of the red, white and blue” — lines that deeply upset many on the right, who weren’t about to wait to hear the full tune before weighing in with outrage. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tBryan posted his first message with the header: “Pls fuckn read this””</p>\n<p>\n\t“I wrote this song months ago,” he began. “I posted this song three months ago as a snippet. This shows you how divisive a narrative can be when shoved down our throats through social media. This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything. When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back.” </p>\n<p>\n\tHe continued, “I served this country, I love this country and the song itself is about all of us coming out of  this divided space. I wasn’t speaking as a politician or some greater-than-thou asshole, just a 29-year-old man who is as confused as everyone else. To see how much shit it stirred up makes me not only embarrassed but kind of scared. Left wing or right wing we’re all one bird and American. To be clear I’m on neither of these radical sides. To all those disappointed in me on either side of whatever you believe in, just know I’m trying my best too and we all say things that are misconstrued sometimes.”</p>\n<p>\n\tHe concluded this first message on a sunny note: “Everyone have a great day and I love each and every one of ya!!!”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a followup post on his Instagram Stories, Bryan added: “The last few months of my life I’ve been scrutinized by more people than I ever thought possible. I feel like I’ve tried my hardest in so many ways and it’s so hard to see where my bearings even are anymore. Been falling off a cliff while trying to grow wings at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I am SO proud to have served in a country where we can all speak freely and converse amongst each other without getting doxed or accosted on the internet or worse; the violence and heartbreak we’ve faced in the last few months!” he concluded. “God speed ol sons, I’m out!”</p>\n<p>\n\t(His reference to having received other scrutiny over the past few months likely refers to his feud with country singer Adcock. Video was shown of Bryan climbing a fence at a music festival they both were attending to try to get at Adcock and being held back by security guards.)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe furor over the lyrics prompted Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary of public affairs Tricia McLaughlin to issue a statement telling Bryan off: “Stick to ‘Pink Skies,'” she said, referring to a hit ballad about family members gathering for a funeral.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tLater, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson took Bryan on with a social post that mashed up a half-dozen of his song titles: “While Zach Bryan wants to Open the Gates to criminal illegal aliens and has Condemned heroic ICE officers, Something in the Orange tells me a majority of Americans disagree with him and support President Trump’s great American Revival. Godspeed, Zach!”</p>\n<p>\n\tBryan is said to have a new album in the works that will presumably include the new song in full, but no release date has been announced.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the past, while trumpeting his nonpartisan bona fides, the singer did praise President Donald J. Trump, after last fall’s assassination attempt on the campaign trail. “I don’t support Trump or Biden,” Bryan said in an Instagram video post, “but the man got shot in the ear, head, whatever you guys want to call it. And then: fist bump in the air! That is sick, dude!” </p>\n<p>\n\tA typical response to Bryan’s new song snippet came from the MAGA commentator self-described as “Catturd,” who posted that that the song was a “desperate Hail Mary” from Bryan, whose “non-career is in the toilet.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBryan has sold the equivalent of 30 million units in the U.S. alone, according to the RIAA, has amassed more than 16 billion Spotify streams, and set a record for the largest ticketed concert in U.S. history last month, drawing more than 112,000 fans to Michigan Stadium.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cody-johnson/\">Cody Johnson</a>, one of the leading contenders for the upcoming CMA Awards, says he has had to cancel the remaining dates on his current arena tour due to a ruptured eardrum that requires immediate surgery.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe country star, who just picked his first CMAs nomination for entertainer of the year, broke the news about the cancellations and shared his health emergency on his social media.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It is with a very heavy heart I have to share the remainder of this year’s concert performances will not be able to happen,” Johnson wrote. “While battling a severe upper respiratory and sinus infection, I burst my ear drum. The severity of the rupture means I must undergo immediate surgery. The healing process will take many weeks, and it is not possible for me to sing during this time.”  \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added, “Without the surgery my downtime could be months. I pray for full healing so I can get well and return to doing what I love. Thank you COJO Nation for the love and support now, and always.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe further posted a video message with a bandage over his left ear, saying he was “home from surgery and it went well, as best as they could have expected.”</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tJohnson had six dates left to go on his schedule this year, all in arenas or at festivals: Oct. 18 in Pittsburgh, Oct. 24-25 in Birmingham, Oct. 31 at Lousiana’s Boots in the Bayou festival, Nov. 8 in Phoenix and Dec. 5 in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis social blast said to “please stay tuned for an email from your ticket providers for further details.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn mid-September, Johnson had canceled shows in Columbus due to health issues. He wrote then, “I arrived home Monday after my shows in Nebraska feeling fine. Tuesday, I felt like I was coming down with a mild cold. I took every precaution that I could: IVs, meds, even sweated in the sauna… unfortunately today I woke up without a singing voice: severe cough, burning chest and throat.” He said then that his team was working on rescheduling those shows for 2026.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s no word yet on whether Johnson will be sufficiently recovered to appear at the CMAs on Nov. 19, where, as one of the leading nominees, it’s expected he would receive a first-call invitation to perform. Johnson’s reps could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tJohnson is nominated for four CMAs, the most of any male artist. Besides entertainer of the year, he is up for male vocalist of the year, music event of the year and music video of the year (the latter two for his duet with Carrie Underwood, “I’m Gonna Love You”).</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides his CMA nominations, Johnson was in the news recently when he was announced as one of three headliners for next April’s Stagecoach Festival in California, alongside Post Malone and Lainey Wilson. The next date currently on his schedule is Feb. 14 in Louisville.</p>\n</div>",

The project was documenting the singer-songwriter’s late life as he struggled with Parkinson’s disease, pneumonia, sepsis, a broken neck and more, when he passed away on July 22. \n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two-hour long documentary shares an intimate glimpse into Ozzy’s tumultuous final years, as he strived to continue with his passions despite physical setbacks. The film shows how to rocker’s tenacious spirit motivated him to create the 2020 album “Ordinary Man” and the 2022 album “Patient Number 9,” to perform at the Commonwelath Games’ closing ceremony in 2022 and his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, and to deliver his emphatic “Back To The Beginning” final performance with Black Sabbath in his hometown of Birmingham just seventeen days before his death.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAlongside exclusive footage of Ozzy and his family, “No Escape From Now” features interviews with fellow rockers Zakk Wylde, Andrew Watt, Billy Morrison, Billy Idol, Black Sabbath’s Tony Iommi, Guns N’ Roses’ Duff McKagan and Slash, Metallica’s Robert Trujillo and James Hetfield, Tool’s Maynard James Keenan, Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Chad Smith, Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello, Alice In Chains’ Mike Inez and Smashing Pumpkins’ Billy Corgan, all reflecting on Ozzy’s incomparable musical impact.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/dolly-parton/\">Dolly Parton</a>‘s sister Freida is asking fans to pray for the Queen of Country, who “hasn’t been feeling her best lately.” Parton’s health has been top of mind for fans ever since she <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/dolly-parton-postpones-las-vegas-shows-health-issues-1236533561/\">postponed her Las Vegas residency </a>in late September due to health issues. Neither Parton nor her team has disclosed specifics about the singer’s health challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Last night, I was up all night praying for my sister, Dolly,” Freida wrote on social media (via <a href=\"https://people.com/dolly-parton-sister-was-up-all-night-praying-for-singer-amid-health-struggles-11826073\" target=\"_blank\">People</a>). “Many of you know she hasn’t been feeling her best lately. I truly believe in the power of prayer, and I have been lead to ask all of the world that loves her to be prayer warriors and pray with me,” Freida Parton wrote in a post on Tuesday.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFreida concluded with a heart emoji and added: “She’s strong, she’s loved, and with all the prayers being lifted for her, I know in my heart she’s going to be just fine. Godspeed, my sissy Dolly. We all love you!”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tParton was set to begin a six-show Las Vegas residency at Caesars Palace in December. The shows were slated to take place from Dec. 4 through Dec. 13 and would’ve been Parton’s first string of concerts since her “Pure & Simple” tour wrapped up in 2016. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I want the fans and public to hear directly from me that, unfortunately, I will need to postpone my upcoming Las Vegas concerts,” Parton posted on Sept. 28. “As many of you know, I have been dealing with some health challenges, and my doctors tell me that I must have a few procedures. As I joked with them, it must be time for my 100,000-mile check-up, although it’s not the usual trip to see my plastic surgeon! In all seriousness, given this, I am not going to be able to rehearse and put together the show that I want you to see, and the show that you deserve to see. You pay good money to see me perform, and I want to be at my best for you.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tParton added at the time that she would “still be able to work on all of my projects from here in Nashville.” A couple days later, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/dolly-parton-to-miss-oscars-governors-awards-health-concerns-1236534983/\">news broke </a>that Parton would not attend this year’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/governors-awards/\">Governors Awards</a> in November, where she was set to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Parton originally planned to attend the event virtually from Nashville, but now her appearance will not happen for reasons her team have not disclosed.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn her statement announcing her Las Vegas postponement, Parton stressed to her fans that she had no plans of retiring soon by writing: “Don’t worry about me quittin’ the business because God hasn’t said anything about stopping yet. But, I believe He is telling me to slow down right now so I can be ready for more big adventures with all of you. I love you and thank you for understanding.”</p>\n</div>",

    "description": "<div><p>\n\tAnd then there were two.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/noah-oppenheim-leaves-nbc-news-reorganization-re",
    "body": "<div><p>\n\tAnd then there were two.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/noah-oppenheim-leaves-nbc-news-reorganization-rebecca-blumenstein-1235486142/\">After unveiling an unorthodox three-executive structure for NBC News in 2023</a>, the top officer overseeing news operations at NBCUniversal, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cesar-conde/\">Cesar Conde</a>, is bringing two units under a single person’s oversight.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a memo sent to staffers Monday, Conde revealed that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/janelle-rodriguez/\">Janelle Rodriguez</a>, who has overseen “NBC Nightly News” and the live-streaming service <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/nbc-news/\">NBC News</a> Now, will report to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/rebecca-blumenstein/\">Rebecca Blumenstein</a>, NBC News’ president of editorial, who has responsibility for newsgathering as well as “Meet the Press” and “Dateline.” Rodriguez will continue to supervise the operations already under her aegis, but she will no longer have a direct line to Conde, as she had in the past, though she is expected to continue to provide some counsel to the executive. Libby Leist, who oversees NBC News’ multi-hour “Today” franchise, will continue reporting to Conde.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tConde said the moves were made to bolster a new  “story-centric” approach that “further align our award-winning broadcast, streaming, digital and audio newsrooms. It will enable us to strengthen editorial oversight across all our platforms, build on our exclusives and the original storytelling that is distinguishing our journalism, and expand the reach of our content in ways that are unique to our organization.” \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new structure was unveiled on a day when NBC News and MSNBC were formally separated from one another, as parent<a target=\"_blank\"> Comcast sets about spinning off the bulk of its cable properties </a>into a new company called Versant.</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth Rodriguez and Blumenstein have had notable achievements in recent months. Rodriguez supervised a recent anchor transition at “NBC Nightly News” from Lester Holt to Tom Llamas, and the broadcast has on some evenings won more viewers than ABC’s first-place “World News Tonight” among viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most coveted by advertisers. She also built the NBC News Now streaming service so that it offers fresh content across most of the day, carving out space for a news product that expanded beyond political news and cast itself as separate from MSNBC. Blumenstein has overseen the a continued expansion of “Dateline” into digital venues such as podcasts and the rise of “Meet the Press” in the same advertiser demo. She was also at the helm as “Meet the Press” moved from Chuck Todd to current moderator Kristen Welker.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, Rodriguez has more experience in TV news than Blumenstein, who nonetheless has impeccable journalistic credentials garnered from a career at The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe choice to broaden Blumenstein’s oversight comes as mainstream TV-news divisions are grappling with difficult economics as consumers get more of their headlines and information from mobile video and social media. Others are also tapping executives who in years past might not been seen as obvious candidates. Warner Bros. Discovery’s CNN, for example, recently unveiled the hire of Bridget Ruane, who has worked as an executive coach and consultant at ZRG Partners and the former Sucherman Group. Ruane was named “head of organizational change” at CNN and has been tasked with looking at “operational and organizational design and new ways for us all to work together  on our shared goals,” CNN CEO Mark Thompson recently detailed in a memo.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe desire to shake up traditional TV-news executive structure got a giant spotlight on Monday when Paramount Skydance named Bari Weiss, a digital-media entrepreneur with no history running a large TV operation, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/paramount-bets-bari-weiss-cbs-news-free-press-1236540961/\">as the editor in chief of CBS News</a>. Weiss’ hire has gained so much notice because she has made her mark as an opinion writer, not as a mainstream fact-gatherer, and her stands on various issues would seem to tilt CBS News away from the neutral stance it tries to maintain.</p>\n<p>\n\tConde offered details on other new initiatives at NBC News, noting that a launch is looming <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nbc-news-mobile-first-service-q4-launch-1236322950/\">for a new NBC News subscription service</a> “that will feature the best of our coverage and include new premium offerings.” That new product is expected to aim for mobile customers. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nbc-news-sports-coverage-kentucky-derby-1236385207/\">NBC News is also expanding its recent foray into sports news</a>, an effort made as NBCUniversal pivots more strongly into sports with the launch of an 11-year NBA rights deal, and prepares for Super Bowl, World Cup and Winter Olympics coverage in 2026. NBC has also been in talks with Major League Baseball about running a Sunday-night package of games, according to two people familiar with the matter, that would have the NBC broadcast network hosting top sports on most Sunday nights throughout the year, adding baseball to NFL and NBA games on Sunday evenings.  </p>\n<p>\n\tConde also  noted that NBC News will soon launch a new marketing campaign “that will reinforce our reputation for rigorous fact-based reporting that is indispensable and accessible across all platforms for all,” which he billed as “the first such campaign in modern memory.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tConde suggested NBC News would have more new ideas in future months. “Our strategic priorities continue to focus on content, innovation and culture,” he said. Even so, NBC News will do all that with a two-executive structure rather than three.</p>\n</div>",

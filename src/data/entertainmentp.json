    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tDIRECTV is serving up even more ways for customers to watch television at home, with the introduction of seven new “multiview Mix Channels” on their streaming platform.\n\n\tOne of the leading over-the-top media services (OTT) in the market today, DIRECTV’s latest offering allows customers to stream up to four live television channels at once from a single screen. It’s an ideal proposition, say, for sports fans wanting to keep up with multiple games; for tuned-in viewers who like to always have the news on; or families divided over the type of content they want to watch. You can toggle among the audio feeds on each of the four channels, or switch to a single channel with the click of a button.\n\n\n\tDIRECTV’s multiview experience is currently available on packages that include DIRECTV “Mix Channels,” a selection of pre-curated channels based on genre and interests. Current Mix Channels include a Sports Mix with ESPN, ESPN2, FS1, NBC Sports Now; a League Sports mix with MLB Network, NBA TV, NFL Network and NHL Network; a News Mix with CNN, Fox News Channel, Fox Weather, MSNBC; and a Kids Mix with Disney Channel, Disney Jr., Disney XD, Nickelodeon.\n\n\tDIRECTV also offers a Business Mix package of multiview channels, a Locals Mix (ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC) in select markets, and a special Sunday Sports Mix that lets you watch live sports on CBS, FOX, ESPN and FS1 all at the same time – and on the same screen. Choose to watch all four pre-selected Mix Channels at once or select the one you want to watch full-screen.\n\n\tMost multiview channels are included in all of DIRECTV’s streaming packages, with some also available in select Genre Packs. Availability varies based on service selection and only includes channels in your DIRECTV package. Feature only available on your television; not available on other devices.\n\n\n\tDIRECTV has long been a pioneer of multi-channel viewing technology, having first introduced mix channels to its satellite TV subscribers back in 2008. The company is now offering the same experience to its OTT service, with viewers able to watch live TV over the internet without needing a satellite dish or cable box.\n\n\tIn a blog post, DIRECTV says this “next generation of mix channels brings this technology fully to streaming, delivering curated, genre-based layouts and local channel mixes for even more ways to watch.”\n\n\tYou can find out more about the multiview experience and see the latest DIRECTV deals and offers at directv.com/affiliates/stream.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBeverley McGarvey, president of Network 10 and head of streaming at Paramount Australia and New Zealand, opened the Asian Academy Creative Awards National Winners Conference in Singapore on Dec. 3 with a rallying call for the region’s content industry, praising the diversity and youthful energy of Asia-Pacific programming while emphasizing the critical importance of strategic deal-making in today’s fragmented media landscape.\n\n\tSpeaking at the two-day conference ahead of the Grand Awards Gala on Dec. 4, McGarvey, who also serves as chair of the Asian Academy Creative Awards, reflected on her experience judging one of the 40 categories among the record 340 judges this year, marking a 30% increase from 2024.\n\t\n\n\t“The diversity has been great across the board this year,” McGarvey said. “Every genre has been covered in terms of what’s been nominated, and every market has been covered.”\n\n\n\tComing from a background in English-language content across Australian, U.K., Canadian and American markets, McGarvey said she was particularly struck by the age demographics of Asia-Pacific programming. “There were lots of shows that really featured lots of young people and featured lots of stories that I think would really resonate with younger audiences,” she said. “In lots of platforms in the English-language speaking markets, things are aging up quite a bit. And that’s just not true in all the content that I’ve seen here.”\n\n\tThe conference precedes the gala ceremony featuring 331 national winners from 16 countries competing for the Golden Goddess trophies, with high-profile contenders including Jacob Elordi for Prime Video’s “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” and Cate Blanchett for Apple TV’s “Disclaimer.”\n\t\n\n\tMcGarvey devoted significant attention to the evolving economics of content production, arguing that strategic deal-making has become as crucial as creative execution in the current marketplace. “A great idea doesn’t make a great show — great execution makes a great show,” she said. “To get to that point of great execution, it kind of starts with the deal.”\n\n\tThe exec highlighted the increasing complexity of rights management in an era of multiple platforms and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. “Twenty years ago, 15 years ago, we started to buy less broad rights, and we didn’t use them for about five or six years,” McGarvey recalled. “Now you move forward to today, and you have to buy so many different rights. You have to construct a deal that allows you to do so many different things.”\n\n\tMcGarvey cited examples from Paramount’s recent Australian productions that demonstrate the company’s flexible approach to windowing and platform strategy. “NCIS: Sydney” airs on Paramount Plus in Australia and other markets, on CBS in the U.S., and on Network 10 in Australia as a second window after Paramount Plus. Conversely, the Australian version of “Ghosts” launched on Paramount Plus before airing weekly on Network 10, allowing the free-to-air broadcasts to promote the streaming service.\n\n\t“Every show is different, every genre is different, every market is different,” McGarvey said. “Although you can create guardrails, we’ve got to be clever and construct things that service that product the best way possible.”\n\n\tBeyond content partnerships, McGarvey highlighted the growing importance of technology collaborations. Network 10 recently partnered with LG to carry the network’s signal on the electronics manufacturer’s electronic program guides as a live stream. The deal addresses the reality that less than half of Australian households plug in a terrestrial aerial, ensuring discoverability for free-to-air content.\n\n\tMcGarvey also pointed to Network 10’s reimagined “Big Brother” as an example of multi-platform strategy targeting younger audiences. The reality format now includes a live TikTok stream alongside traditional broadcasts, with episodes also available on YouTube. “If you’re whatever age you are and you haven’t watched free-to-air possibly since you were born, you might watch the TikTok stream, and then it brings them back into our ecosystem,” she said.\n\t\n\n\tDespite the complexity of modern content distribution, McGarvey returned to a fundamental principle. “A great show will always find an audience,” she said. “A great show, well executed, will always find an audience. Maybe not tomorrow, but it will eventually work if it’s got great stories and great characters.”\n\n\tThe National Winners Conference continues Dec. 4, featuring panels on generative AI and copyright, platform strategy and deal-making. The Grand Awards Gala takes place at Capitol Theatre on the evening of Dec. 4.\n\n\tThe 2025 Asian Academy Creative Awards marks the seventh edition of the ceremony. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“We’re not an independent label. We’re a pissed-off startup. That’s what I call it,” says producer Joey Moi, one of the three chiefs of Big Loud Records, along with Seth England and Joey Moi. It’s good rhetoric, but at the very least, Big Loud gets to be both those things, when they’re not being mistaken for a major, with a level of success that includes the biggest male artist in the music business, Morgan Wallen.\n\n\tAsk the three principals which labels that preceded them were most inspirational in Big Loud’s path, and they don’t cite any of the most obvious Nashville antecedents. Instead, England quietly walks over to his shelf and pulls down what is apparently the personally most treasured piece of physical music product in his office: a Motown boxed set that came in a package shaped like the house at 2648 West Grand Blvd. in Detroit, where it all began.\n\t\n\n\t“Hitsville USA,” he says, naming the boxed set he’s proudly holding up. “I obsessed over the Berry Gordy story… \n\n\n\t“But I had read stories of folks for years. It’s not just Motown. Craig would say A&M…” (Early in his journey to becoming a label head, Wiseman was signed to Rondor Publishing, a division of A&M, as an up-and-coming songwriter.) “I mean, it can come in all shapes and sizes, like John Janick and Fueled by Ramen,” England continues. “Just from an entrepreneurial side of things, I’d give a shout-out to Clive Calder and Jive Records and Zomba [Publishing, the mecca of ’90s boy bands]. As a nerdy student of the game, I found there was something to be learned about his strategy as an entrepreneur when it came to his global distribution deals.\n\t\n\n\t“But Motown… One time I was in Detroit and they let me take a tour of the building by myself, and it was a day that just changed me forever. You know, we were already on our cultural path, but it really just reinforced for me that you don’t have to be the big major label in the big building to do something that they even envy. And Motown was a very much a Smokey Robinson company too; Smokey had just as much insight and effect on what was going on, and I think about that all the time.”\n\n\tWhich ties directly on how Big Loud Records was founded 10 years ago and built upon the earlier foundation that was Big Loud Publishing. England says Motown’s mojo — and or his own company’s — is “hard to harness and really hard to create. But you’ve gotta do it by including the songwriters and the creators. You know, we have a staff lunch here in the record label building, and sure enough, our songwriters in sweatpants start coming through and filling up their plates, and they’re on staff too. That’s got complexities to it, but more times than not, the supernatural happens because of it. And the artists and songwriters end up becoming often best friends.”\n\n\tIn fact, England continues, “Morgan and Ernest [the songwriter-artist who goes by a single name] met in the hallway of Big Loud, and they sat down for an hour and realized they played against each other in high school, in two back-to-back state championship games. They reconnected in our hallway, and now they’re creatively inseparable. And that just wouldn’t have happened if we didn’t create that environment much like Motown, A&M and others.”\n\n\tOf course, a huge point of pride is that they literally own that environment. “We are absolutely and adamantly independent,” says Wiseman. “In early days, even as a publishing company, I turned down many, many, many, many offers, to stay independent. We’ve remained independent. And of course there’s things we have to do, distribution deals and ancillary things. And we’re very good friends with Universal staff and work with them some. But nobody owns us. Nobody finances us. Everything has been out of pocket. People ask, ‘How’d you start your label?’ Well, we all put in money, and nobody got a paycheck from this label for frigging years. With other guys around Nashville, their whole idea of ‘here’s how you start a label’ — ‘well, first you gimme a million dollars, then…’ No. Guess what? If you wany yo do an independent label, you’re like any small business, you get paid last, and so you don’t get paid at all for a long time.”\n\t\n\n\tSays England, “I can say to Joey, I agree, I’m a pissed off startup. I don’t care how big we get — if we ever lose that, then we’ve lost the mission. … (Big Machine founder) Scott Borchetta is his own kind of entrepreneur too. Through the prime Florida Georgia Line years, we were helping steer that ship [when that duo was a Big Machine management client, signed to Big Machine], I bet I went to a thousand marketing meetings in his building, so I got such a close front-row seat. And he himself was a pissed off startup. Not to speak for him, but he was offered many times to go take the keys to the big building — you know, ‘Which major one would you like?’ — because of his skill set and resume. But I think in his very fabric, he enjoys being the chip-on-his-shoulder entrepreneur, because he gets up quicker out of bed for that.\n\n\t“And so there was a lot to be learned from Scott in the early days. The only difference is, he didn’t have a publishing company, originally — but if you look now, they have one of the most competitive publishing companies in town. He just did it a little bit in reverse, but kind of got to that destination all the same. He’s got a great development engine there. And yeah, he’s definitely a pissed-off startup.”\n\n\tWhat they feel makes their label so different is that it was basically founded atop an already successful song publishing company. It’s no coincidence that two of their more thriving artists, Hardy and Ernest, are country music Supermen — sorry, touring headliners — who still double as mild-mannered songwriters by day. Wiseman was a country writing titan before he became a label mogul, and still gets his hands dirty, as it were, co-writing with relative newcomers. Even recent signee Miranda Lambert gets involved in co-writing songs for other artists. And Morgan Wallen has been known to write 2-3 fresh tunes a day if that particular writers’ room is a fruitful one.\n\n\t“On our business cards, it all says ‘publisher’ first,” says Moi. “And that stat wouldn’t exist — and Morgan wouldn’t exist — without all of the great songwriters and collaborators that have come along the way. To me that’s the nucleus, and we’re just trying to be as close to the nucleus as we can, and push it in the right direction and use it for our advantage. But there’s dozens and dozens of really great kids that have shown up along the way and offered their best ideas and best moments for those projects.”\n\t\n\n\tWiseman: “And because Morgan is so brave, [songwriters] will say, ‘Oh my God, I can say shit that I was never supposed to say in a song. In fact, if I don’t say it, I’ll never even make the cut for Morgan.’In fact, one of our dear friends that used to write for us and has a bunch of Morgan cuts, when the album was over, told me, ‘Man, writing is hard when I’m not writing knowing Morgan is out there to listen to it. God, man, it’s just so boring.’ And I was like, how proud that we’re a part of that, where these songwriters are just going, ‘That’s what it’s all about.’”\n\n\tIt would be tempting to call Big Loud Records the house that Wallen built — his success has been that oversized in an environment where fewer superstars are coming along, let alone ones who are breaking records for No. 1 chart streaks. But it’s more the house that songs built, and Wallen just turned it into a castle.\n\n\tEngland says, “Another superpower Morgan has is he’s such a self-starter. We don’t have to call him to say, ‘Hey, are you ready to make some music? Are you feeling creative again?’ Our text thread with Joey this morning was a very active thread and it was Morgan excited to get going; he’s written eight or 10 things [for the next record following “I’m the Problem,” the chart-dominating 36-song collection that came out in May]. He’s intense when he is in that mode too; he’s all-consumed with it.”\n\n\tMoir adds with a laugh “I got a terrifying text message from him just a few weeks after [‘Problem’] was released: ‘Man, I think I’m ready to start cutting more songs.’ The record just dropped! He is ready to go, and I’m going, ‘All right, let me get this calendar sorted here, buddy.’ As soon as I got that text, I was like, ‘Uh-oh, shit… time to get going again.’” \n\n\tBut that’s how it goes in Hitsville, Tennessee.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrincipal photography is set to begin Thursday in Pasadena on Matt Kelsey’s independent drama “Above Ground.”\n\n\tKelsey makes his directorial debut with the feature, which he also wrote.\n\n\tAn official summary of “Above Ground” reads, “When a once-successful writer Tom (Kelsey) retreats from the world after a devastating loss, he’s forced to confront his isolation and the ghosts of his past. Through unexpected connections and painful self-discovery, he begins to uncover what it truly means to come back to life.”\n\t\n\n\tKelsey describes the screenplay as being “written in the vein of a Chekhov play.”\n\n\n\tHe said in a statement, “No superheroes, no car chases, drug cartels, shootings, just how we live, love, process loss, and ultimately carry on. I wrote ‘Above Ground’ as an ode to loss and hope for the future.”\n\n\tA graduate of London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, Kelsey’s 2021 short “Her Place” earned multiple awards as it made its way through the film festival circuit.\n\n\tThe “Above Ground” cast also includes Christian Zuber (“Fly Me to the Moon,” “The Morning Show”), Marion Kerr (“Her Place,” “Criminal Minds”), Craig Thomas (“Source Code,” “I’m Not There”) and Austin Woods (“American Horror Story,” “American Horror Stories”).\n\n\t“At its core, this is very much a hero’s journey, Tom is sort of an Odysseus, except he can’t go back to Ithaca, his home is his deceased wife,” Kelsey said. “How do you survive when there is no home to go back to? It’s also a deeply personal admission of my own battle with the demons of mental health, hopefully showing others that it’s a very human trait, and none of us are totally ‘normal’ or ‘OK.’ It’s OK to not be Ok.”\n\t\n\n\tKenn Viselman joined the project as producer under his production company, Kenn Viselman presents.\n\n\t“It’s very rare to experience a story so raw, so authentic, so vulnerable and so real,” Viselman said. “One minute you find yourself grappling with the pain of losing someone you love and then you find yourself unexpectedly laughing at the joy of being alive. This is a very special little film.”\n\n\tDirector of photography is Charles Schner (“Captain America: Civil War,” “The Big Lebowski,” “Insurgent,” “American Horror Story”) with Dallin Burns (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Rebel Moon 1” and “2” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 2”) as composer and music supervisor. Celebrated Hollywood stylist Johnny Wujek (“Legendary,” “America’s Next Top Model,” “Project Runway All Stars”) serves as costume designer and art director. Michael Yanivich (“Waltzing with Brando,” “Face Off”) is the editor.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tMalaysian production house Double Vision has formed a strategic alliance with microdrama distributor RisingJoy, marking CEO Min Lim’s company’s entry into the burgeoning short-form content sector.\n\n\tUnder the partnership, Double Vision will acquire a minority ownership position in RisingJoy, the venture established by Cassandra Yang and Ricky Ow. The Vision New Media group member will serve as RisingJoy’s inaugural official production partner for microdrama formats. \n\t\n\n\tThe alliance was unveiled at Singapore’s Asia TV Forum and Market. \n\n\n\tYang and Ow’s company manages a library exceeding 500 hours of short-form content across four languages — Chinese, Korean, Japanese and English. Its distribution network spans more than two dozen territories, including markets in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and South America. RisingJoy plans to debut RJoy, a curated co-branded streaming platform.\n\n\tSince its 2021 launch, RisingJoy has pursued a business model centered on collaborating with established regional operators to create co-branded microdrama services, leveraging its content selection capabilities alongside partners’ existing infrastructure and audience reach.\n\n\tDouble Vision contributes four decades of experience creating drama programming for Malaysian and broader Asian audiences, with credits including localized versions of formats “The Bridge” and “Liar.” The partnership extends beyond creative collaboration — Double Vision’s production services arm will provide support for RisingJoy’s global expansion, offering capabilities ranging from music licensing and format documentation to adaptation services and on-the-ground production in strategic territories.\n\t\n\n\t“I have long admired the work that Cassandra and Ricky have been doing in the microdrama space, building this new stream of the industry with quality content and successfully taking it out into the world,” said Lim. “It is therefore truly exciting to invest in and partner with RisingJoy at such a pivotal time.”\n\n\tAccording to Lim, Double Vision’s production infrastructure and service offerings “will help supercharge this business and push it further on its impressive growth trajectory.” The company has multiple large-scale international productions scheduled to commence in 2026.\n\n\tYang characterized microdrama as having evolved from being “once seen as a Chinese curio” to now standing “on the cusp of becoming a truly global phenomenon and this new strategic partnership leaves us well placed to capitalise.”\n\n\t“Double Vision’s financial investment, its experience in drama production and of doing business in the international arena, will play an important part in helping RisingJoy to the next level and meeting our global ambitions,” Yang said.\n\n\tThe RisingJoy deal follows Double Vision’s recent announcement of a co-production agreement with ABS-CBN and Astro Shaw to develop three drama series over the next two to three years. The slate includes a reboot of “A Time for Us,” the 2008 Filipino-Malaysian co-production that earned an International Emmy nomination, along with crime thriller “Besa” and YA sci-fi series “Habitat.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Challenge” Season 41 comes to an end on Dec. 3 and one outcome has already been spoiled: Olivia Kaiser was pregnant during filming. The “Love Island” alum welcomed her first child, Atlas, with boyfriend Theo Campbell, who also competed in the final, on Nov. 20.\n\n\t“Obviously, I was not pregnant going into the show — you cannot compete if you’re pregnant,” Kaiser told Variety during a Zoom interview on Tuesday, while her son napped on her lap. She revealed that she conceived during the first week of “Vets & New Threats,” during Derek Chavez’s birthday party, which was shown in the Aug. 13 episode.\n\t\n\n\t“As you see in the whole season, I started out with a lot of steam. I kind of lost it halfway through, and it’s because I was so tired. I started to get so lethargic,” Kaiser said. However, since she wasn’t doing well in the game — “I was getting so abused by everyone, and there’s only so much someone can take,” she added — so she chalked her lack of energy up to that. “I definitely will admit that I was not as strong and confident as I was going into the season. The first trimester is exhausting and hard. I knew something was up. I just didn’t know what. I thought I was getting depressed from the house, so I was sleeping a lot, and now looking back, it makes so much sense. I was running out of breath really quickly.”\n\n\n\tKaiser does say that there was one point during the season where she wondered if she was pregnant, but then the cave challenge (which aired Nov. 12) happened.\n\n\t“Will [Gagnon] and I were going down, and I fell so hard. I went to the bathroom after that, and I was bleeding. I had phantom periods, so I didn’t think I was. I was also so skinny, I didn’t look any different,” she said, later learning that it was implantation bleeding. “Also, Theo and I did not get freaky in the house often!”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYeremi Hykel and Olivia Kaiser on “The Challenge” finale\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAfter the finale was filmed, Kaiser said that she and Campbell stayed in Chile for an extra two days to relax. It was then that she started feeling crampy, but had no other symptoms. Still, she decided to go get what she thought was a pregnancy test.\n\n\t“It was in Spanish! It was a week of gestation test. So I took it, and I couldn’t look at it. Theo’s like, ‘What is it supposed to say?’ I said, ‘Well, does it say a plus?’ He says, ‘It says plus three,’ which meant I was over three weeks pregnant,” she laughed. “We got home, and at my first appointment, I was eight weeks and five days pregnant. So hiking that mountain, I was seven weeks pregnant. \n\n\t“Not even to boost myself up, I’m just talking for all women: We are badass. Because that was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I did it pregnant. And childbirth? It is no joke. I’ve never felt pain like that.”\n\n\tKaiser, who’s competed in four seasons of “The Challenge,” will now take a “hiatus” from the game to spend time with her son, but hopes to return in the future. “I’m a person who’s driven by purpose. I have the biggest purpose now, and I want to fight for him,” she said. “I want to see where that gets me.”\n\n\tThe finale of “The Challenge: Vets & New Threats” airs on MTV at 8 p.m. ET.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAt Monday night’s Gotham Awards, Joel Edgerton pushed back on James Cameron’s take that films without theatrical runs shouldn’t be eligible for the Oscars.\n\n\t“None of us should be squabbling with each other over what has a right to be seen or awarded or part of a conversation — because there are some people that only get their chance because of streamers,” Edgerton, who latest awards buzzy film is Netflix‘s “Train Dreams,” told Variety. “I don’t necessarily think something should be seen as lesser than.”Last week on Matt Belloni’s podcast “The Town,” Cameron blasted Netflix’s awards strategy as “fundamentally rotten at the core,” arguing the streamer should only be eligible to compete if a film plays for a month in at least 2,000 theaters.\n\t\n\n\t“A movie should be made as a movie for theatrical,” Cameron said. “The Academy Awards to me mean nothing if they don’t mean theatrical.”Since first changing the landscape with “Roma” in 2019, Netflix has earned 10 best picture nominations, but has never taken home the big prize. All met the basic eligibility rules through limited theatrical runs in major cities, but none had a traditional wide release.\n\n\n\tUnder the Academy’s updated rules for 2025, best picture hopefuls must pair a one-week qualifying run with a seven-day expansion in 10 of the top 50 U.S. markets within 45 days of the initial release. Some, like Edgerton, argue that the shift could negatively impact lower-budget entries that lack the resources to book and market extended runs.\n\n\t“I think the point that James is making is there should be more of a robust fight for the survival of cinema, but at the cost of saying that people whose only chance is to get their movies made on a streamer shouldn’t have a chance to also be seen and heard,” Edgerton explained. “Some people who have had a long history, where it makes it a bit easier for them, they’re willing to fight harder. And I really respect that. James is one of the greats. He’s making movies on a big canvas. He’s always been a pioneer.”\n\n\tOther longtime industry voices, such as “Sentimental Value” star Stellan Skarsgård, sided more with Cameron’s fight to prioritize theatrical releases at the Oscars. “That’s the only way to make the theater survive,“ the actor explained. “That’s the only way to make cinema survive. And without cinema, you don’t have any Netflix.”\n\n\tYet as the industry has anticipated a post-pandemic comeback, moviegoers have grown more accustomed to watching news movies from the comforts of their homes. About three-quarters of U.S. adults watched a new movie on streaming instead of in theaters at least once in the past year, according to a recent AP-NORC survey. Nearly a third said they did so at least once a month.\n\t\n\n\t“I understand the sentiment behind why [Cameron] would say that,” said “No Other Choice” director Park Chan-Wook, “but because of the increasing number of great films that have been made for streaming, I just don’t think that fits in with the reality that we’re living in right now.”\n\n\t“I’ve died on the hill of cinema a few times over a few issues as a producer, director and an actor,“ Edgerton said. “A friend of mine once said to me, ‘How many of your favorite films did you ever actually watch at the cinema?’ Most of my favorite movies were made in the 70s… I didn’t get a chance to watch him until I was watching them on a VHS cassette on a shitty TV. And they’re still my favorite films.“\n\n\tEdgerton concluded, “I would still semi-die on a hill for cinema. But I’m also a pragmatist.”\n\n#TrainDreams star Joel Edgerton on James Cameron saying Netflix films that don’t play in theaters shouldn’t qualify for the Oscars: “None of us should be really squabbling with each other over what has a right to be seen or awarded,” Edgerton said on Monday night at the… pic.twitter.com/PUtvlp0DnC— Variety (@Variety) December 2, 2025\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Hunger Games” franchise star Josh Hutcherson responded to director Quentin Tarantino’s recent claim that the original young-adult book series by Suzanne Collins “ripped off” the 1999 Japanese novel and subsequent film adaptation “Battle Royale.” Upon being asked about Tarantino’s harsh take by Variety at the premiere of Hutcherson’s new horror film “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” the actor responded with, “There are similar themes, for sure. But, you know, everyone borrows from everyone.”\n\t\n\n\tTarantino— who has long been a champion of “Battle Royale” — made his comments on “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast” in November, while listing his favorite films from the 21st century. “Battle Royale” came in 12th on the director’s list, and he elaborated on the property’s similarities to “The Hunger Games.”\n\n\n\t“I do not understand how the Japanese writer didn’t sue Suzanne Collins for every fucking thing she owns,” Tarantino said. “They just ripped off the fucking book! Stupid book critics are not going to go watch a Japanese movie called ‘Battle Royale,’ so the stupid book critics never called her out on it. They talked about how it was the most original thing they’d ever fucking read. As soon as the film critics saw the film they said, ‘What the fuck! This is just “Battle Royale” except PG!’”\n\n\tHutcherson played Peeta, a love interest and fellow Games competitor to Jennifer Lawrence’s lead Katniss, across the first four “Hunger Games” films.\n\n\tA new “Hunger Games” prequel, “Sunrise of the Reaping,” debuted its first teaser in November, a year ahead of its 2026 release. When asked about the footage, Hutcherson said that he hasn’t seen the trailer yet, nor read the book it is based on.  \n\t\n\n\t“I’m so excited to see the series continue and the amazing cast they’ve gotten for it,” Hutcherson said. In the “Sunrise of the Reaping” book, Peeta makes an appearance at the end of the novel in a flashforward; Hutcherson hasn’t confirmed that he has any involvement with the film adaptation though. \n\n\tHutcherson reprises his leading role as Mike Schmidt in “Five Nights At Freddy’s 2,” a sequel to the 2023 Blumhouse adaptation of the popular horror game franchise. Directed by Emma Tammi, the sequel also sees Elizabeth Lail, Piper Rubio, Matthew Lillard and Theodus Crane return from the first film and introduces Freddy Carter, Skeet Ulrich, Mckenna Grace, Teo Briones and Wayne Knight to the franchise. The film hits theaters Friday. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJason Biggs takes a page out of the Coen brothers’ playbook in his directorial debut “Untitled Home Invasion Romance,” about a romantic getaway gone absurdly, violently wrong. \n\n\t“They are my favorite filmmakers. When I first read the script, I thought: ‘Oh, this is also happening in that kind of world.’ I mean, I am not a Coen brother, obviously. But they’re always my reference point.” \n\n\n\tHe’s ready to switch sides and “work a little more behind the camera,” he admits.  \n\t\n\n\t“When I was coming up, I’d wait by the phone and then go and audition. I was just an actor. Now, because of these things [he points at Variety’s phone], no one is just an actor anymore. Everyone’s learning how to ‘create content.’ In a way, everyone is a filmmaker. I’m a little late to the game, but I’m hoping it sticks.”\n\n\tHe laughs: “All right, I’ll become a Coen brother. Why not? It’s a great idea.” \n\n\tBiggs talks to Variety at Italy’s Torino Film Festival. It’s his first trip to the country since becoming an Italian citizen. “My family is siciliana. It’s the very first time I got to use my new password,” he’ll tell local journalists later during the press conference.   \n\n\tIn “Untitled Home Invasion Romance,” he plays a commercial actor trying to get back with his wife Suzie (Meaghan Rath). They are separated – or “on a break,” as he insists, inadvertently echoing Ross Geller. A short trip might be just what they need, but Kevin won’t leave anything to chance. To look like a hero, he plans a fake break-in with a friend from his acting class. But once she sees the masked assailant, Suzie has other plans. \n\t\n\n\t“It’s a dark comedy about two people who don’t really know each other and, well, things are revealed,” he notes, praising Rath’s portrayal of the complicated character who refuses to be a victim. “It’s really her movie.” \n\n\tTaking backseat this time as hapless Kevin, Biggs is appreciative of the role that turned him into a household name back in the 1990s. Still, in his first feature as a director he wanted to try something else.\n\n\t“It’s different than ‘American Pie,’” he underlines. \n\n\t“I was briefly attached to direct a film that was a little bit more like it, but ultimately decided against it. I love the ‘American Pie’ films and I love that kind of comedy, and I feel that I could have directed it very well. But this is darker, more unexpected and edgier. It’s more in line with the kinds of movies I’m watching right now.”\n\n\tSadly, it seems that the era when comedies ruled the box-office is long gone.\n\n\t“People watch things at home, and studios are more inclined to keep cinemas for action and superhero films. But I really think comedies work better in a theater with an audience watching together. More than any other kind of film,” he stresses.\n\n\t“The truth is, this movie will mostly live on people’s TVs or iPads. That’s fine, but it’s also a little bit sad. There’s something about laughing together with an audience that’s unlike anything else. When ‘American Pie’ first came out, people were rolling in the aisles and it was just contagious. Laughter is so contagious.”\n\n\tAs audience tastes change, so does the nature of celebrity.\n\n\t“Fame has changed so much. It’s much more accessible to people because, once again, we all have these things [cell phones]. We’re just one viral post away from becoming famous. Also, there’s so much content. It used to be much more concentrated: when ‘American Pie’ came out, everyone saw it. Now, lots of people see something.” \n\n\tAs an actor, he wouldn’t say no to another show like “Orange Is the New Black,” however. In Netflix’s early smash, he played Piper Chapman’s fiancé Larry. “TV is so great right now and that’s part of the reason why it’s harder for movies to gain a foothold with audiences,” he says. \n\t\n\n\t“I’m just grateful that 27 years after we made ‘American Pie,’ I’m still here. And I’ve directed a movie.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Torino Film Festival\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn today’s episode of “Daily Variety” podcast, “The Studio” star Ike Barinholtz discusses his tubthumping campaign to raise money for the Motion Picture and Television Fund. And we take a Vintage Variety look back at the birth of the MPTF as covered the pages of Variety.\n\n\tBarinholtz shares that the work of backslapping and drumming up donations comes easily to the multihyphenate. “I don’t know what that says about my personality, but I have no qualms standing on a stage with a microphone and pointing to someone and guilting them into giving us a couple extra bucks,” Barinholtz says.\n\t\n\n\tIt was a deeply personal connection that led Barinholtz to volunteer for the MPTF which operates a retirement home in Woodland Hills and provides healthcare and financial support for industry workers of all ages. He’s representing the MPTF’s Second Act campaign that aims to generate six-figure donations for naming or dedication rights to cottages and apartments on the Lew Wasserman Campus in Woodland Hills.\n\n\t“I had heard about them a little bit throughout the years. They have parties every year before the Oscars, the evening before the Emmys. And I went to one of those parties, and I learned a little bit more about what they do. And then a couple years ago, my beloved cousin, Michelle Rifkin, who was a writer and a member of the WGA for many years, she has since sadly passed away. Towards the end, like a lot of people in this business, she needed help,” Barinholtz says. \n\n\t“And she reached out to the MPTF, and the MPTF was there. She actually spent some time at the residences. And so once I learned exactly what they do, I said to [MPTF leaders] Courteney Bailey and Bob [Beitcher], ‘What do you need from me? What can I do for you guys?,’ ” he says. “And I learned that it’s much more than just the residence. The MPTF is there for people in our business. And so when they came to me this year and said, ‘Hey, we’re starting our Second Act program, will you join the Board of Governors?’ I could not have said yes quickly enough.”\n\t\n\n\tThe episode also features a Vintage Variety segment taking a long look back at Variety‘s coverage of the MPTF from its earliest days, as Mary Pickford, Jean Hersholt and other Golden Age leaders of our industry worked to establish an institution that still helps showbizzers every day. Whatever you do, don’t let Louis B. Mayer down.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe back page advertisement in the Dec. 2, 1940, edition of Daily Variety had a direct message for the industry about the importance of supporting the predecessor of the Motion Picture and Television Fund.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tListen to Daily Variety on iHeartPodcasts, Apple Podcasts, Variety’s YouTube Podcast channel, Amazon Music, Spotify and other podcast platforms.\n",

    "body": "\n\tU.S.-Venezuelan producer Elizabeth Avellán, whose credits span iconic titles such as Robert Rodríguez’s “El Mariachi,” “Desperado” and  “Machete,” alien film “Predators” and the “Spy Kids” franchise, has wrapped principal photography on supernatural thriller “Bonded,” a production Avellán is positioning as a flagship for her new Canary Islands-based film hub.\n\n\tDirected by Venezuelan writer-director Gisberg Bermúdez (“The Whistler: Origins”), “Bonded” toplines Oscar-nominated Demián Bichir (“A Better Life”), his daughter Gala Bichir (“Now and Then”) and brother Bruno Bichir (“Narcos”), in the first time the three Bichirs have worked together on a feature.\n\t\n\n\tAlso starring Ingrid García-Jonsson (“Seven Kings Must Die”), Malena González (“Rabbit”) and Michael Stobbe (“Band of Spies”), with a special appearance by Paz Vega (“Spanglish,” “Kaleidoscope”), the film shot for four weeks in La Esperanza, in the island of Tenerife’s forested interior, followed by one week in Austin, Texas, Avellán’s long-time production base.\n\n\n\tBuilding a Canary-Texas Pipeline \n\n\tThe English-language film is produced by Anaga Media Productions, the Tenerife company backed by Avellán, Bermúdez and González, structured under the Canary Islands Special Zone (ZEC), whose advantages include a reduced 4% corporate income tax rate, compatible with a 45%-50% tax incentive.\n\n\tFrom this base, Avellán is building a pipeline of Texan-Canarian partnerships, which already includes Bermúdez’s previous work, horror film “Gara’s Return,” now in post.\n\t\n\n\t“Despite having my whole career in Texas, I wanted to firmly invest in the Canary Islands,” says Avellán, whose Canarian great-grandparents emigrated from the islands to Venezuela. \n\n\t“For us it was important not just to come here once, shoot and leave. We wanted to plant roots – build a company, keep coming back and make this a real hub.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Avellán on the Canary Island of Tenerife \n\t\n\n\n\n\tTime-Slip Thriller About Grief \n\n\t“Bonded” follows Louis Abrams (Demián Bichir), a grieving father, and his troubled 13-year-old daughter Ruth (Gala Bichir), who retreat to a rundown farmhouse after a road accident kills Louis’ wife, Sarah (Vega).\n\n\tHoping for solace, they instead find the property haunted by restless spirits tied to a century-old tragedy in the same house, and their own grief becomes entangled with that of another family from the 1920s, a synopsis says.\n\n\t“It’s a psychological thriller but also fantastical,” Avellán explains. “We play with what we’re learning about quantum physics and how time isn’t really linear. Two families, a hundred years apart, are bound together by tragedy.”\n\n\tThrough visions and time slips, Louis is pulled into the world of Anna Heller (García-Jonsson) and her gravely ill son Ethan (Nil Gomez), watched over by Ethan’s stern father Isaac (Bruno Bichir) and Rabbi Sholem Minda (Stobbe).\n\n\tAs Louis attempts to help Anna and Ethan, Ruth’s recurring dreams begin to echo Ethan’s visions, suggesting the children are sharing images across time. Underneath the genre frame, the film probes how both families confront loss. \n\n\tTraining Ground for Local Talent \n\n\tAnaga Media Productions is also doubling as a training ground. Avellán, who has long worked with film schools and universities in Texas, is now channelling that model into the Canaries. Speaking at a recent masterclass at the César Manrique educational center in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, she underlined her commitment to local crews.\n\n\tThe masterclass forms part of a wider program linking ZEC, Proexca, the islands’ public sector promotion agency, and the Canary Islands schools to the archipelago’s fast-growing audiovisual sector, aimed to  connect training centers directly with producers and service companies so graduates can transition into professional shoots.\n\t\n\n\tWith Avellán’s arrival, the Canary Islands’ film strategy takes a further step forward: professionals trained on the islands are finding work on international films at home, alongside a producer who has helped shape Latin cinema’s presence in Hollywood for decades.\n\n\tCome-back to independent cinema\n\n\tSince the pandemic, Avellán has already produced six small independent films, part of a deliberate move back to hands-on producing and filmmaker-driven projects.\n\n\t“I wanted to help certain filmmakers get their shot,” she says. “It’s been beautiful for me to come back to truly independent cinema.”\n\n\t“Bonded” is in the editing stage, with Avellán expecting the film to be completed within six months, allowing submissions to spring festivals such as SXSW, where she has premiered three different titles in as many years.\n\n\tAnaga is lining up a slate of thrillers, genre fare and documentaries anchored out of Tenerife, with Texas and Latin America as natural partners on both financing and talent.\n\n\tFor studios and streaming executives weighing the Canaries, Avellán boils her pitch down to one idea: “You have seven islands where you can find almost any location you can imagine, plus stages where you can build whole worlds.” \n\n\t“Also, the culture here is very rich, and there are so many stories to tell,” she adds.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnaga Media Productions: Gisbert Bermúdez, Elizabeth Avellán, Malena González\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDespite President Trump routinely reinforcing his threat to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S., productions big and small continue to look for the best locations to shoot abroad, with Europe remaining a leading destination for major Hollywood projects. Last year, Brady Corbet’s epic “The Brutalist” made headlines during awards season when the director openly spoke about the benefits of filming in Budapest, Hungary. His partner, director Mona Fastvold, also shot her awards-hopeful “The Testament of Ann Lee” in the Hungarian capital. \n\t\n\n\tIt’s not only Hungary reaping the benefits. Scotland has also welcomed a heap of major Hollywood productions in recent years, with Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Destin Daniel Cretton’s “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” shooting in the country over the last year. A recent study by the BBC reported the positive impact its hit TV show “The Traitors” brought to Scotland: a whopping £21.8million ($28.5 million) injected into the local economy. A representative for Screen Scotland also highlighted that productions like “Frankenstein” boost talent development through on-set training programs.\n\n\n\tWith cash and tax rebates becoming more and more aggressive and crews more and more experienced in multiple countries around the world, there is a wealth of options when it comes to where to take production. \n\n\tAs leading figures in the industry prepare to attend this year’s Focus production conference, taking place in London on Dec. 8-9, Variety gathered a list of some of the rising international shooting destinations:\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGlasgow, Scotland, hosted the shoot for ‘Spider-Man: Brand New Day.’\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPA Images via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGosford House, Scotland \n\n\tScotland, like all nations in the U.K., offers a cash rebate of up to 25% of qualifying expenditure, with the tax relief capped at 80% of core expenditure. The country has seen a boom in international productions in recent years, with its three main cities — Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen — doubling for other international locations for films like “The Running Man,” “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and “Spider-Man: Brand New Day.” \n\n\tAlthough the country has seen its number of studios grow in recent years to keep up with demands from international productions, particularly major streamers, its natural scene and many castles have remained a great draw. Located in East Lothian just outside Edinburgh, Gosford House provided many of the exterior shots of Victor Frankenstein’s childhood residence in del Toro’s “Frankenstein.” The iconic property has also been seen in many other high-profile productions, including Apple TV’s “The Buccaneers” and hit Scottish TV series “Outlander.” \n\n\tStrathspey Railway, Scotland\n\n\tA growing global sensation, BBC’s reality show “The Traitors” is filmed in Scotland, having shot its big final mission showpiece on the iconic Strathspey Railway. The steam train is based in Aviemore, a town in the Cairngorms National Park in the Scottish Highlands, popular for its stunning natural scenery. The railway line and its historic 19th-century platforms also played a vital part in the beloved highlands-set drama “Monarch of the Glen,” starring “Downton Abbey’s” Julian Fellowes, with the fictional Glenbogle station used for the series — still visited by fans from around the world. \n\n\tCanmore, Alberta,  Canada \n\n\tThe Canadian province of Alberta offers a tax credit rate of either 22% or 30% on eligible productions. The town of Canmore is known for its impressive Rocky Mountains, rugged peaks and turquoise rivers. Located just outside of the Banff National Park, the location offers the benefits of a similar landscape without the added bureaucracy.  \n\n\tHBO’s hit show “The Last of Us” was filmed in over 180 locations across Alberta, becoming the largest production in the province’s history and one of the biggest in Canada. In the show, Canmore was transformed into the post-apocalyptic society of Jackson, Wyoming. Cast and crew have often listed the location as one of their favorites in Canada, with the cozy, private feel of the town and the stunning natural scenery proving great draws. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSeason 3 of ‘The White Lotus’ shot on the islands of Koh Samui and Phuket in Thailand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHBO/Max\n\t\n\n\n\n\tKo Samui, Thailand\n\n\tThailand offers a cash rebate of up to 30% for foreign film productions with local expenditures of approximately $1.4 million or more. The Southeast Asian country skyrocketed in popularity earlier this year when it hosted the latest season of the hit HBO show “The White Lotus,” but it has long been a popular destination for international productions thanks to its diverse mix of beaches, mountains, jungles and large cities.  \n\n\tKo Samui is the third-largest island in the country but remains small enough to be circumnavigated in just a couple of hours by motorbike or car, making neighboring locations easy to access. The island is home to the main “The White Lotus” location: the Four Seasons, a world-class luxury resort perched on a private hillside overlooking the Gulf of Thailand with panoramic sea views, lush coconut groves and secluded beachfront settings ideal for high-end productions. Nearby, one can also find the popular Fisherman’s Village, a charming coastal street lined with old wooden shop-houses, local markets and beachfront cafés. \n\n\tRiga, Latvia\n\n\tLatvia offers a cash rebate program of 20% for local spend and 30% for wages. That sum can be combined with a rebate provided by the Riga Film Fund, as long as 50% of the total budget is confirmed before application. \n\n\tRiga has increased in popularity in recent years, much thanks to how easily it can double for other major European cities like Warsaw, Berlin, London and Zurich. Riga also offers a coastline in the district of Kurzeme, and sprawling forests in Latgale, making it a versatile location. \n\n\tLatvia has recently welcomed high-profile international indie productions like Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut “The Chronology of Water” and Sergei Loznitsa’s “Two Prosecutors.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHit series ‘Wednesday’ used key locations in Romania.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCantacuzino Castle, Romania\n\n\tThe recently revamped Romanian cash rebate program offers returns of 30% of expenditure, covering eligible expenses incurred in the country. The rethinking of the program comes as an effort to attract more international productions to the country at the crossroads of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, especially in the light of the war in Ukraine. Recently, Romania was chosen as a key location for the Netflix series “Wednesday,” which turned the Cantacuzino Castle in Bușteni into Nevermore Academy. The palace is located against the Carpathian Mountains and its lush forests, mixing the sharp edges of neo-Romanian architecture and vast natural landscapes. It is also somewhat conveniently located at two hours, 30 minutes away from the capital, Bucharest. \n\t\n\n\tAuckland, New Zealand \n\n\tThe New Zealand Film Commission recently made changes to its rebate program to incentivize a sector that generates almost $2 billion yearly for the country. The rebate, currently sitting at 20% with a possible 5% uplift for international productions, is simple to claim and not tied to tax, with the New Zealand dollar offering excellent value for international productions. The new program has also lowered the threshold for qualifying projects to a $2.6 million minimum, lowered from $8.5 million. The city of Auckland is a popular shooting destination thanks to its geographical diversity — with plenty of urban landscapes, forests, coastlines, black sand beaches and volcanic fields within a short drive from the center — but also because of its wealth of studios and post-production facilities. This year, the city has housed shoots for “Predator: Badlands” and Netflix’s “East of Eden” series.  \n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked” cinematographer Alice Brooks knows why the “For Good” number tugs at heartstrings.\n\n\tAside from the split door scene with Elphaba and Glinda on either side in tears, the handholding moment also hits emotionally. Thematically, it’s also a repeated shot in “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” — and it was something important to filmmaker Jon M. Chu.\n\n\t“Hands were the very first thing that Jon talked about when we first started talking about ‘Wicked,’” says Brooks, who sat down for Variety’s Inside the Frame. She added at that point Chu didn’t yet have the script. “He said, ‘There’s something about touch. Two friends; how they embrace each other, how they hold each other. And the hands became the thing that he wanted to become a visual theme.”\n\t\n\n\tThe two, who have worked together on “In the Heights” and “Jem and the Holograms,” started to explore what that would look like. Brooks says they always shot the hands from behind. “We do it in the first film, and then we do it two times in the second film. We do it in ‘Wonderful’ when Elphaba and Glinda are about to get on the broomstick ride. And then we do it again in ‘For Good.’ It completely pulls at the heartstrings.”\n\n\tEmotions were key to “Wicked” and its conclusion. Brooks and Chu tied yearning, longing, friendship, choice and desire to the first film, but “the second film were words like sacrifice, surrender, separation and consequence.”\n\n\tThose words helped Brooks map how the films would be lit. “The first movie would live in this effervescent daylight and the second film would be steeped in maturity and density and have a weight to it,” she says. “As we were designing it, ‘Wicked: For Good has this handmade feel to it, but it also feels textured and raw and edgy.”\n\t\n\n\tBrooks points out that 90% of the second movie takes place “at night or in the deep dark underbelly of Oz, in the shadow of Oz, in the secret places that no one knows exists in Oz.” That gave her new ways to tell the story. She used every color of the rainbow as symbolism and to light key sequences in the film– blue was important in the “For Good” sequence.\n\n\t“Blue is the color of love between Glinda and Elphaba,” she explains. “It’s the exact moonlight color we use in the Ozdust ballroom.”\n\n\tSimilarly, orange symbolized transformation.\n\n\t“We first see it in ‘No Good Deed’ when she starts the fire and the monkeys start flying around and lighting all the torches. She’s about to transform into the Wicked Witch of the West,” Brooks says. “In ‘For Good,’ she’s about to give up being the Wicked witch of the West. This is her goodbye. This is the goodbye to the Elphaba that we have now come to know.”\n\n\tIn shooting the sequence, Brooks used huge torches, which were lit and carefully placed throughout production designer Nathan Crowley’s set. “You’d see the flame slowly as the wind blew, you’d see it play dance on their faces and you can feel it in their hair.”\n\n\tWhen it came to shooting the scene, Brooks says the end of the number was meant to be a big crane move. But during playback, the scene didn’t work for Chu or Brooks. They weren’t feeling anything. “It was the wrong way to tell this moment, so we started thinking about the moments where they connected.”\n\n\tThe 360-degree shot had been used twice, for the Ozdust Ballroom and in “Defying Gravity.” “We decided, ‘Let’s do it as a 360.’”\n\n\tHowever, Erivo and Grande were at the very front of the parapet, and there was no space to move around in a full space. “Not only that, there’s nowhere to light it from because we didn’t rig our lights for a 360-degree shot. Jon goes and talks to Ari and Cynthia and says, “Look, we’re going to have to come back on Monday morning and shoot this.”\n\n\tOver the weekend, Brooks discussed with her team the idea of building a platform to execute the shot. In the end, Brooks and her team spent eight hours lighting the shot.\n\n\tShe adds, “The other thing he says [is], ‘I want to do the split screen between Glinda and Elphaba the very end. I don’t want to do it in two pieces on Monday morning. I also want to do it as I want them to finish ‘For Good,’ and I want to go shoot that moment so that they have a complete goodbye. Nathan goes, ‘Well, if you do that, I have to rip the walls of the set apart, and then you’re not going to be able to shoot anything else there.’ And Jon goes, ‘This is when this moment’s happening, so this is what we’re doing.’” Everyone was on board. Brooks adds, “That incredible collaborative spirit is why I loved making this movie.”\n\t\n\n\tAs for the challenge of shooting in low lighting with flame lights, costume designer Paul Tazewell would bring Brooks different iterations of Elphaba’s jacket so she could camera test it.”The problem is all of that darkness, all of that black can disappear into nothing so easily.” In the end, Tazewell brought in linen which had a sheen to it. “The sheen just made everything so much easier for me because it picked up the little teeny highlights so you can actually see the flame playing in the reflection of the jacket, even though it’s a solid black.”\n\n\tWatch the video above.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMost biopics persuade you to empathize with the main character. But as actress-turned-writer/director Kristen Stewart explains, her screenplay adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s memoir “The Chronology of Water” allows you to virtually become the protagonist.\n\n\t“[Lidia] invites you to project yourself into her book,” she says. In a similar way, the film presents the thoughts of a woman (Imogen Poots) overcoming childhood abuse and adulthood addiction through sound design that places viewers inside her head. “Some of the emotional triggers are specific to her life, but I think they’re [also] invitations to remember your own. I wanted to make a movie that was not just about one person, but was kind of about all of us.”\n\t\n\n\t“Water” is one of several fall features with scripts adapted from the lives of real protagonists, down-to-earth and extraordinary in equal measure. Scott Cooper (“Crazy Heart”) explores the tortured soul of a musical icon in “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” Derek Cianfrance (Oscar nominee for “Sound of Metal”) and Kirt Gunn portray a criminal with a heart of gold in “Roofman” and David Michôd (“Animal Kingdom”) and Mirrah Foulkes show the determination and survival skills of a female boxing pioneer in “Christy.”\n\n\n\tStewart’s feature writing/directing debut, which premiered as a Cannes Un Certain Regard selection in May and hits U.S. theaters in December, is the most impressionistic film of the bunch. The project has consumed her thoughts for the past eight years, in part due to the time she needed to raise “purely independent” financing. “I reached out to Lidia [and] told her, ‘Please don’t give this to anyone who’s going to voiceover it to death or provide a three-act structure that’s much easier to finance than the movie that we could make.\n\t\n\n\t“I always wanted to make sure that you could watch this movie with your eyes closed, because I wanted it to feel like a haunted house,” Stewart says. “I wanted [the protagonist] to feel like she was sitting next to you in a theater whispering in your ear, giving you a little more emotional context.”\n\n\tWriter/director Cooper is proud of his Bruce Springsteen biopic, based on Warren Zanes’ 2023 book “Deliver Me From Nowhere: The Making of Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska.” Cooper was a fan of the stripped-down, non-commercial 1982 album that paints stark portraits of the dark side of America. “Like Warren, when I was reading Bruce’s autobiography ‘Born to Run,’ I recognized that most every chapter was quite lengthy except for the chapter on ‘Nebraska.’ I wanted to understand why Bruce was reluctant to talk about it and the process behind writing it. As it turns out, it was too painful for him to put into his autobiography.”\n\n\tCooper met with Springsteen and his manager, Jon Landau. “Out of that, I received Bruce’s blessing to write the screenplay,” Cooper says. “I realized that the film had to echo that stripped-down, brutally honest [tone of the LP], and to get that, I needed to go straight to the source … That really opened up a conversation between Bruce and me,” that led to “countless hours” of deep conversations with the musician about his life.\n\n\t“I just said, ‘I’m not interested in myth or nostalgia. I want to explore this man with a four-track recorder [‘Nebraska’ was made on] and nothing left to prove.’ And I think that resonated with him. I said, ‘I don’t want to dramatize your pain. I’m asking to explore the courage that it took to face it.’ And once he knew that there wasn’t going to be a jukebox or a celebration of celebrity, it actually relaxed him.”\n\n\tThe script Cooper wrote focused on Springsteen’s severe depression, a romantic relationship based on a composite of women he dated at the time, and his efforts to reconcile with his cold, hard-drinking father. “I wanted to know, ‘Bruce, what’s it like when you’re driving down a country road 92 miles per hour experiencing suicide ideation? Tell me why you couldn’t connect with someone [romantically]. Tell me what it felt like at 8 years old when your father’s roughhousing turns into violence.’ It was about trying to get to the truth of Bruce’s most painful moments, ones that he’s never expressed before in an interview or biography.”\n\t\n\n\tAside from licensing rights to his songs, Cooper says Springsteen had no screenplay or casting approval. “Our trust and respect for one another turned into a deep and abiding love for one another,” he says. \n\n\t“The film is not a biopic. It’s a psychological portrait of an artist at one moment in his life. He kept saying, ‘Please give me a Scott Cooper movie. Don’t let the audience off the hook. The truth about yourself isn’t always pretty.’ Bruce wanted this chapter to be told, and he’s now seen the movie 13 times,” Cooper says.It’s rare to find a feel-good true crime story, so perhaps it was no surprise that “Roofman,” the misadventures of Jeffrey Allen Manchester, a robber who drilled through the roofs of numerous McDonald’s and hid inside a Toys “R” Us, would find its way to the screen.\n\n\tA mid-level-budget comedy released by a major studio is almost as rare as a story like this. But writer/director Cianfrance and screenwriter Gunn managed to sneak one into theaters last month with the Paramount feature “Roofman,” based on a criminal who was nice to his victims.\n\n\tOther scripts about Manchester had been floating around, but Cianfrance hadn’t read them, so he called his longtime producer, Hunting Lane Films’ Jamie Patricof, to say that he wanted to start doing his own research and bring in Gunn. They got on the phone with Manchester in maximum security prison back in 2021.\n\n\t“He was like no one else we’d ever met,” Gunn says. “We talked to him on the phone 400-plus times for several years between the two of us. … He was a character with contradictions. He was locking people in freezers but giving them jackets. He was bad at being a criminal because his humanity kept kicking in, kind of foiling his criminal enterprise.”\n\n\tAfter a year and a half, the pair called Manchester’s pastor and one-time girlfriend to validate his stories. “We thought they’d have bitterness, but they told us he was the greatest adventure of their lives and that he left their lives better than when he found them,” Cianfrance says.\n\n\tTruth can be stranger than fiction, and that’s definitely the case with “Christy,” the wrenching story of female boxing pioneer Christy Martin. “When you consider how almost unimaginable Christy’s story is, the fact that it happened is part of what makes it so powerful,” says director Michôd, who co-wrote the screenplay with Foulkes. Sydney Sweeney, who signed on as a producer, plays the West Virginia woman who became one of the most prominent female fighters in history. Pressured to break up with her girlfriend, she was coerced into marrying her boxing coach (Ben Foster), only to face years of domestic abuse that nearly killed her.\n\t\n\n\tWith Martin’s life rights secured, Michôd and Foulkes spent many hours interviewing her via Zoom from their Australian home. “We got the script to a place where we felt really happy. She was very happy with it quite early on, which was a great relief,” Foulkes says. “We watched all of her fights, spoke to [her wife] Lisa a lot. And because she was at the pinnacle of her sport, there was a lot of research material to draw from.”\n\n\t“We have done this film for her and with her, yet it isn’t hagiography,” Michôd says. “Christy is accepting of her flaws. She adopted a persona that had her treating people really unkindly, and she regrets that. So she surrendered to the process knowing that it wouldn’t always be flattering.” The film is the first release from financier Black Bear’s new domestic distribution arm.\n",

According to the Coast Guard, they were reported missing by another family member Tuesday night.\n      \n\n          They spotted a Coast Guard chopper later that night, but couldn’t get its attention ... which meant a brutal night as waves picked up while they climbed onto the boat’s rigging. All the while, Dennis explained he was trying to keep his uncle safe.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Dennis’ sister Teresa told Fox 13 and Tampa Bay 28 they thought they weren’t gonna make it, and prayed all night. So when they were finally found the next morning -- about 26 miles west of Clearwater -- it felt like a full-on miracle ... especially since the catamaran was almost completely submerged by then.\n      \n    \n          They were finally hauled to safety -- warmed up, rehydrated with electrolytes, and water -- and Dennis cracked that his 70th birthday was all good ... now that they were officially done celebrating anywhere that isn’t solid ground!\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tAfter just one season, Emmy-winning drama “The Pitt” is already having an impact on healthcare conversations. That’s the finding from a new study released Monday by the USC Norman Lear Center, which said “The Pitt” has shifted the conversation on issues such as organ donation and end-of-life planning.\n\n\tAccording to a group of 1,409 viewers surveyed by the Hollywood, Health & Society division of the USC Norman Lear Center, 26.9% of respondents said they were more likely to seek out organ donation information after watching “The Pitt,” while 17.2% said they shared the information with others. The study helpfully noted that the impact was especially great with Black audiences — an important distinction as Black patients are often overrepresented on transplant waiting lists and underrepresented with donors.\n\t\n\n\tAlso, a storyline on “The Pitt” about family members debating over the end-of-life decisions for an ailing father also appeared to have a major impact on viewers. Around 38.8% said they would look deeper into end-of-life planning such as a living will or power of attorney, while 15.3% said they shared this information with others.\n\n\n\tAnd the study found that among the 709 viewers who had watched at least three episodes of “The Pitt,” almost 90% of them said “the series reveals how systemic problems like understaffing affect patient outcomes and helps make provider stress relatable.”\n\n\tThe USC Norman Lear Center Hollywood, Health & Society team also spoke with doctors, nurses and trainees, most of whom confirmed the authenticity of the show’s storylines — such as overcrowding, underfunding and other realities of their work.\n\t\n\n\t“While our primary goal is to create compelling, complex stories, we are also committed to being current and accurate with our portrayal of medical topics,” said “The Pitt” executive producer and writer Joe Sachs, MD. “Because of this, public health education is a wonderful side effect of our dramatic storytelling.”\n\n\tThe study coincides with Monday’s USC Normal Lear Center Hollywood, Health & Society honors, which includes the Culture of Health Award for “The Pitt.” Recent Emmy winner Katherine LaNasa will present the award to exec producer/star (and fellow Emmy winner) Noah Wyle and creator/showrunner R. Scott Gemmill, along with the show’s writing team.\n\n\t“For 25 years, our work has been built upon the idea that stories matter, but conventional wisdom suggests the ‘broccoli’ needs to be hidden in the ‘hamburger’ for audiences to stomach it,” said Erica Rosenthal, director of research at the USC Norman Lear Center. “‘The Pitt’s’ success is a powerful reminder that stories can prioritize accuracy, highlight systemic challenges through authentic characters, spark emotion, and inspire real-world action, all without sacrificing entertainment value.”\n\n\tOther series set to be honored include “Shrinking,” “Dying for Sex,” “Paradise,” “Matlock,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Chicago Med,” all of which are being recognized for making a difference in topics including healthcare, racism, climate change, cancer and more. Comedian Carol Leifer is hosting the event, held at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills.\n\n\tIn addition to LaNasa, other presenters include Jason Ritter (“Matlock”), Wendie Malick (“Shrinking”), Sarah Shahi (“Paradise”), Nikki Boyer (“Dying for Sex”) and Jason George (“Grey’s Anatomy”). Among those also in attendance are Lear’s wife, Lyn Lear, as well as the team from Lear’s final show (“Boots”), including actor Miles Heizer and author Greg Cope White.\n\n\tThe 2025 host committee for the awards are Jimmy Kimmel, Judith Light, Lyn Lear, Phil Rosenthal and Yvette Nicole Brown.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA new Japanese-Taiwanese co-production is seeking financing at the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, bringing together voices from across borders to tell an intimate story set in Tokyo’s LGBTQ+ hub.\n\n\t“Polaris,” directed by Seta Natsuki and produced by Twenty First City in partnership with Taiwan’s Volos Films, unfolds over one winter night at a bar in Ni-chome. Based on the novel “The Night of the Shining North Star” by Li Kotomi, the film centers on women of different ages, nationalities and sexualities who gather in the titular establishment, sharing drinks, laughter and fragments of their lives under soft blue light. As their stories intersect like stars in a constellation, the film explores themes of self-identity and human connection before the women part ways at dawn.\n\t\n\n\tFor Seta, the project represents a meditation on authenticity and understanding. “This film is a reflection on what it means to be yourself and how hard it can be to understand one another,” the director says. “It’s also about how we define our sense of self. How we categorize ourselves and others – or choose not to. And how we can begin to rethink what we once thought of as ‘normal’.”\n\n\n\tThe production has faced unique challenges in adapting Li Kotomi’s source material, which comprises seven interconnected short stories spanning different times and places. “One of the major challenges has been finding a way to weave them into a single film,” Seta notes. The team is conducting extensive research and interviews in Japan and Taiwan to inform their exploration of sexuality and gender issues central to the narrative.\n\t\n\n\tFor producer Kawashima Shoichiro, “Polaris” marks a significant departure for Twenty First City, which has served as a local production partner for Hollywood and European shoots in Japan since the 1990s. “This is the first time we are developing a film project from the beginning ourselves,” Kawashima says. The company gained momentum through participation at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest. \n\n\t“This is a cross-border story with characters of diverse nationalities,” Kawashima explains of their Tokyo market objectives. “We want the film to resonate widely, so we hope to receive feedback from as many people as possible. It would be ideal to meet partners who share our vision and are willing to support us in bringing the project to completion.”\n\n\tThe production is eyeing a winter 2026 shoot, with Seta and screenwriter Kyoko Inukai continuing script development. Casting is slated to begin later this year as the team actively pursues investors, distribution partners and world sales.\n\n\tSeta’s directorial interests extend beyond this project to exploring how small moments can shift perspectives on everyday life and society, with a particular focus on the complexity of human understanding – themes that appear central to “Polaris” itself.\n",

    "body": "\n\tA new feature film examining the buried trauma of America’s “Secret War” in Laos is seeking co-producers and sales agents at the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, with production slated for 2026.\n\n\t“Rhizome,” directed by Jakrawal Nilthamrong (Rotterdam winner “Vanishing Point,” Venice selection “Anatomy of Time”) and produced by Chatchai Chaiyon (“Manta Ray”), follows Na, a Lao-American woman who returns to her homeland in 1994 to join a bomb disposal team clearing unexploded ordnance from the Vietnam War era. As she falls in love with Bua, a local team leader, Na confronts the violent legacy that continues to shape the scarred landscape.\n\t\n\n\tThe film opens in 1974 as civil war refugees flee toward the Thai border. When a young girl witnesses a traumatic incident involving her father and an American helicopter crash, the memory haunts her into adulthood. Twenty years later, now working alongside Bua to clear the land of bombs, Na’s mission collides with outsiders – David, an American searching for missing soldiers, and Big-D, a troubled local. A fatal explosion forces Na to reckon with fragmented memories and her father’s wartime past.\n\n\n\tFor Nilthamrong, the title carries symbolic weight. “‘Rhizome’ refers to a subterranean root system – nonlinear, interconnected, and hidden. It symbolizes both trauma and survival, much like the buried legacies of war and the invisible networks of memory, pain, and resilience that bind Laos, its people, and my character’s journey toward wholeness,” the director says.\n\n\tThe film is rooted in the history of the U.S. “Secret War” in Laos between 1964 and 1973. “It addresses how we might build a future from within the ruins,” Nilthamrong explains. “How can we reinhabit spaces shaped by violence once they have become the very ground of our existence? The work seeks to resonate with the urgency of forgotten histories – reminding us that Laos remains the most bombed country in the world, yet its people continue to live, rebuild, and find life growing again from the most wounded soil.”\n\t\n\n\tThe production has faced unique challenges given its sensitive subject matter. “Since the film engages with history and the real bomb disposal units that still operate today, the research and writing process for accuracy has been particularly challenging,” Nilthamrong says. “Gaining permission to access locations and conduct filming in Laos required a foundation of trust.”\n\n\tThe director spent significant time in the field to ensure authenticity. “I wanted to tell the story of Laos from an insider’s perspective, which led me to spend significant time in the field, revisiting locations and refining the screenplay,” he says. “Our intention is not to reopen the past in search of blame, but to maintain a delicate balance between historical truth and sensitivity.”\n\n\tProducer Chaiyon acknowledges the project’s commercial challenges while expressing confidence in its potential. “Although the project’s subject matter and the director’s vision are both compelling, development and financing remain challenging,” he says. “As a producer, I strive to bridge arthouse and commercial cinema to reach a wider audience. I am confident that Rhizome possesses the elements and potential to achieve that goal.”\n\n\tThe team is looking to close the remaining financing gap at the market. “We are looking for co-producers and sales agents to join the project,” Chaiyon says. “Our goal is to close the remaining financing gap and be ready for production in 2026.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIliza Shlesinger will bring the laughs with her when she hosts Variety‘s Power of Women gala on Oct. 29 in Beverly Hills. “It’s the perfect fit,” the comedian says of the gig. “My whole career has been commentary on women, and I always want my female audience feeling a little bit better than when they walked in.” Funny, empowering and insightful? Yep, she checks all three boxes.\n\n\tThe event, in partnership with Lifetime, will honor Sydney Sweeney, Nicole Scherzinger, Wanda Sykes, Kate Hudson and Jamie Lee Curtis, highlighting female leaders in the entertainment industry, who are profiled in the Women’s Impact Report.\n\t\n\n\tShlesinger, who is currently touring the country with her “Iliza! Live” show and can be seen in the Amazon Prime comedy special “A Different Animal,” spends a good deal of her stand-up act encouraging women to stand in their power. “I think to be a woman who dares to get out of bed often garners criticism, and so I think that there is something truly special about being around powerful women who don’t ask permission, who create their own lane and do it,” she says.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShlesinger performs during the 16th Annual Stand Up for Heroes Benefit \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images for Bob Woodruff Fo\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShlesinger is certainly one of those women, which helps keep her focused on her gift to make people laugh. “You have to truly believe that what you have to say is so important that it warrants a microphone that makes you louder than everyone else,” she says. “And you have to believe that the way that you look at things is so funny that people are gonna want to stop and listen.” She sums it up: “It’s about feeling seen. Especially as a woman, I think that that’s paramount — feeling seen and feeling heard. And that is the guiding light of my career, knowing that what I have to say is just as valid — if not more valid — than the male comic next to me and deciding that I’m allowed to talk and it’s gonna be pretty good. And, 20 years in, survey says what I have to say is pretty good.”\n\t\n\n\tBut if her audience really listens to her act, it’s not just jokes; there’s also a hefty dose of wisdom behind the words. “As you age in comedy, it’s OK to just tell superficial jokes. There’s nothing wrong with that,” she says. “But I feel things very deeply as an artist. I think comics and comedy get brushed off as, ‘you’re just a comic.’ At the end of the day, I’m not just some road dog who’s there to tell some dick jokes. I’m an artist, and I feel very deeply. I see things a certain way. And I feel like it’s my job to hold up a mirror to society and to call out things when I see them, especially for women, because we’re told that we’re crazy,” she says. “I know a lot of other women don’t have the voice to say the things that they want to say. And so I just try to say the way I’m feeling, and I hope that other people feel the same way.”\n\n\tWhile touring the U.S. and Europe with her comedy show, she notes that one thing she sees over and over is that people are having a hard time “dealing with things that — by the grace of God — you or I don’t have to deal with.” She explains, “The fact that people take the time out of their stresses and their lives to watch my stand-up or buy a ticket, the fact that people give me their time is something that has never been lost on me. I’ve never taken it for granted. And to get to be a part of people’s lives when they are going through something horrible is actually, energetically, a very special thing. I think about that a lot.”\n\n\tAlso on her mind: censorship, which has been a hot topic in the entertainment business since the cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and the suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” “People on both sides who have ideas about how this country should be run slowly chip away at the moral fabric and constitutional foundation, misinterpreting and deliberately interpreting our amendments,” she says. “If enough people do that, at the end of the day, we do not have the America that the bulk of normal people love and defend. As a Jewish person, I think about this like: very bad things happen when very good men do nothing. It’s so important to have critical thinking and to have healthy, open public debate. Comedy should be an example of that. No comics should be censored. No comics should be told that because of one thing that you said, you can’t have a career. If you don’t like what a comic is saying, then you don’t have to watch that comic. This idea that your feelings are facts and that your feelings take precedence over everything else in this person’s life, so much so that that person should be wiped off a map, is delusional and, quite frankly, self-centered.”\n\t\n\n\tIf Shlesinger sounds passionate about the topic, it’s because she is. The comic has long used her platform to speak out against antisemitism — and make sure her voice is heard. “Antisemitism is as old as Judaism itself, that’s the truth,” she says. “But the other truth, the louder truth, is that Jews aren’t going anywhere and now, more than ever before, we are able to be more vocal about our permanence. But the fact that I have to think carefully about my answer to why hating Jews is unacceptable should be a tonal indicator of the blatant and ignorant hatred we are up against. Every socio-political and religious conflict on Earth is assigned nuance, but when it comes to the blanket dismissal of Jewish people, it has become acceptable, and lauded, to be absolute.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTokyo International Film Festival‘s programming director Ichiyama Shozo has been curating films since the 1990s, navigating the seismic shift from 35mm to digital while maintaining his core philosophy remains unchanged.\n\n\t“Cinematic expression has hardly changed at all just because it has become digital,” Ichiyama tells Variety. “Therefore, I believe that fundamentally nothing has changed in my programming either.”\n\n\n\tHe references a 2000 Cannes talk event on digital’s impact, noting that while certain French directors voiced concerns, filmmaker Kurosawa Kiyoshi stated his approach remained consistent regardless of format.\n\t\n\n\tFor TIFF 2025, Ichiyama describes the Competition selection as his boldest programming move. “I believe it has resulted in a challenging selection that blends various genres,” he says. “With a wide range of films, from those with entertainment elements to experimental cinema and even documentaries, we have a lineup which is difficult to compare.”\n\n\tThe competition spans filmmakers from Thailand to North Macedonia to Palestine, though Ichiyama insists regional balance isn’t the primary goal. “We primarily prioritize quality over regional balance in our selection process,” he explains. “This year, coincidentally, we have achieved a diverse lineup in terms of the nationality of the production countries.”\n\n\tTIFF’s International Competition notably favors Asian premieres rather than world premieres, a strategic choice Ichiyama defends in the streaming era. “The necessity of insisting on world premieres seems to have diminished,” he says, noting that films are now accessible through streaming platforms shortly after festivals.\n\t\n\n\tHowever, he acknowledges limits to this approach. “We think there is less meaning in screening films that have already been shown in competition at major film festivals such as Cannes, Venice, Berlin, Locarno, or San Sebastian in TIFF’s competition, so we try to introduce such works in the Gala Selection or World Focus section.”\n\n\tOn the festival-versus-streaming debate, Ichiyama is unequivocal about the value of theatrical premieres. “For a film, being released in theaters or at a film festival is more beneficial,” he says, citing Spike Lee‘s “Highest 2 Lowest,” a remake of Kurosawa Akira’s “High and Low,” which was distributed streaming-only in Japan. “Most people in Japan are unaware of its existence,” he notes. “It is regrettable that films with the potential to garner significant attention are completely overlooked when they are not.”\n\n\tThe 2025 edition marks the centenary of Yukio Mishima’s birth, with TIFF spotlighting Paul Schrader‘s “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters” — screening in Japan for the first time — alongside a new documentary and two Japanese films based on Mishima’s works. “Mishima’s writings are still widely read in Japan, and we hope that this multifaceted program will once again shine a spotlight on his works,” Ichiyama says.\n\n\tAsked about balancing artistic merit with commercial potential, Ichiyama points to this year’s Competition entry “Blonde” by Sakashita Yuichiro as an example. “It appears commercial at first glance but showcases the director’s unique individuality,” he says. “Of course, the Competition also includes films whose commercial potential is considered very difficult.”\n\n\tTIFF has expanded its youth and educational programming, launching the Asian Students’ Film Conference this year — the festival’s first official short film competition, though limited to film school productions. “There are many hidden gems in the younger generation, who are waiting to be discovered,” Ichiyama says. “We hope that a future master will emerge from this new section.”\n\n\tWhether to establish a broader short film competition like major European festivals “remains one of our future challenges,” he adds.\n\n\tAsked to describe TIFF 2025’s essence, Ichiyama says, “Looking at the film selection, I think that it reflects the current chaotic world situation in various ways.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRafael Manuel‘s debut feature “Filipinana” is making its pitch at the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market as the international co-production enters advanced post-production.\n\n\tThe film, which expands on Manuel’s Silver Bear Jury Prize-winning short of the same name from the Berlin Film Festival, follows Isabel, a tee-girl at Manila’s Alabang Golf & Country Club who spends her days teeing up golf balls mere inches from swinging clubs. When she encounters the club president, Dr. Palanca, asleep in some bushes on the course, a brief connection sets her on a journey deeper into the country club’s world – and into what Manuel describes as “a cosmos that reflects the inherent structural violence of the Philippines.”\n\t\n\n\t“Yes, the film is set on a golf course in the Philippines, but it could be set anywhere really,” Manuel tells Variety. “What I’m trying to convey is that regardless of where we find ourselves in the hierarchy of any oppressive system, we all have our part to play in perpetuating it. And that when places are made beautiful, the violence that lays underneath becomes that much harder to see.”\n\n\n\tThe project has been six years in the making, with Manuel citing patience as the biggest challenge. “But this is because we aimed to be as intentioned as possible in searching for the right partners for the project,” he says, noting that Jia Zhangke came aboard as a mentor.\n\n\tThe film is structured as a four-country co-production between the U.K. (Film4/Ossian), Singapore (Potocol), the Philippines (Epicmedia Productions) and France (Easy Riders), with financing combining national funds, rebates, investment and presales.\n\t\n\n\t“We are working on a pretty large scale for a first film,” says producer Jeremy Chua. “This definitely added to the complexity of legals and spending allocations.”\n\n\tShooting presented unique logistical hurdles, with different sequences filmed across multiple golf courses around Manila’s peripheries due to restrictions. Production designer Tatjana Honegger “formed a singular, absurdist, architectural universe” from the disparate locations, Chua says.\n\n\tProducer Bianca Balbuena Liew notes that the production secured both development and production grants via rebate from the Film Development Council of the Philippines. She joined the project after filmmaker Lorna Tee and Chua both urged Epicmedia to come aboard.\n\n\t“We all believed in Rafael’s vision and I guess that’s why six years felt like a breeze,” Balbuena Liew says.\n\n\tAt Tokyo, the team is seeking presale opportunities from Japanese and broader Asian distributors, potential P&A partners for an Asian release, and building programmer interest for a festival tour. “We also hope to deepen our understanding of the Japanese market,” Chua says, adding that a small financing gap may need closing pending final works requirements.\n\n\tThe film, which still has VFX and editing to complete, is being readied with sales agent Magnify for a world premiere next year.\n\n\t“I believe the film is going to offer audiences a new sound and image of Southeast Asia cinema, made in an ambitious scale but with a handmade touch,” Chua says. “This film was designed for the big screen.”\n\n\tManuel is currently developing several projects, including a colonial period piece set in the Philippines.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIndonesian producer Shanty Harmayn is bringing animated feature “Garuda: Dare to Dream” to the Tokyo Gap-Financing Market, marking the company’s first foray into animation ahead of a planned early 2026 theatrical release.\n\n\tThe film follows Putra, a 13-year-old boy with asthma who dreams of playing for Indonesia’s national soccer team. After facing ridicule at the Sanca Perkasa Soccer School trials, he discovers a mystical jersey from Gaga, a glowing Garuda spirit, which unlocks incredible speed, power and skill. The genre-blending story weaves together adventure, drama, humor and sports action.\n\t\n\n\t“We see Japan as a leading center of animation/anime and, since this is our first time producing an animated feature, we wanted to meet and learn from other animation companies, have some exposure to gap financing, potential distributors and potential festival to launch,” Harmayn says.\n\n\n\tDirector Ronny Gani, whose credits include working as an animator in Marvel films, says the film’s core message resonates deeply with his own experience. “The story of finding the courage to take that first step toward a dream directly mirrored my own experience of facing significant limitations in access and social challenges when I chose to pursue a career as a professional animator,” he says.\n\n\tThe production has been in development for three years. “Setting up the project took longer time as it was our first animated feature and with a new team,” Harmayn says. “The challenge has been finding the right scale in terms of finance and investment, while making sure we deliver a strong story with top quality animation.”\n\t\n\n\tBarunson E&A has come onboard as both investor and sales agent for the film. “We plan to release theatrically in Indonesia in the first part of 2026,” Harmayn says, adding that the team sees Indonesia as the primary market with expectations the film can travel to other territories.\n\n\tFor Gani, developing a unique visual identity has been crucial. “In the current competitive landscape of animation, it is imperative that we develop a unique and compelling visual identity from the outset,” he says, noting the style must be both memorable and feasible within production constraints.\n\n\tThe multifaceted narrative requires extensive research across multiple genres. “We constantly study real-world soccer footage to ensure the authenticity and energy of the sports-action sequences,” Gani says. “Similarly, we analyze a wide range of comedy to understand timing and delivery for our humorous beats.”\n\n\tThe team is already developing additional projects to follow “Garuda: Dare to Dream,” though details remain under wraps.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Netflix feature film “A House of Dynamite” tells “a vastly different story” about the U.S. government’s capability of repelling a nuclear attack than real-world testing suggests, according to an internal government memo obtained by Bloomberg.\n\n\tThe movie, directed by Kathryn Bigelow (“The Hurt Locker”) and written by former NBC News president Noah Oppenheim (“Jackie”), depicts how the U.S. government might respond to an incoming nuclear ballistic missile headed for Chicago. The secretary of defense (Jared Harris) expresses shock that the missile defense system, which cost $50 billion, has just a 50% chance at successfully shooting down the missile — and, indeed, in the film, the system fails to do its job.\n\t\n\n\n\tA Missile Defense Agency memo, reportedly dated Oct. 16, however, states that current interception technology has “displayed a 100% accuracy rate in testing for more than a decade.”\n\n\tThe memo was generated to “address false assumptions, provide correct facts and a better understanding” of the current system, according to the Bloomberg report, so that leadership at the agency “has situational awareness and is not ‘surprised’ by the topic, which may come up in conversations or meetings.”\n\n\n\tTo the credit of whoever authored the memo, it does account for dramatic license, stating that “the fictional interceptors in the movie miss their target and we understand this is intended to be a compelling part of the drama intended for the entertainment of the audience.” But it goes on to assert that current testing tells “a vastly different story” than what is depicted in the movie.\n\n\n\tRepresentatives for Netflix, Bigelow and the U.S. military did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On the Oct. 12 episode of “CBS Sunday Morning,” Bigelow said that the filmmaking team did not work with the military in a desire to be “more independent.”\n\n\t“But that being said, we had multiple tech advisers who have worked in the Pentagon,” she said. “They were with me every day we shot.”\n\n\tIn an interview with MSNBC on Oct. 26, Oppenheim responded to the memo, saying the filmmakers “respectfully disagree” with the Pentagon’s assessment of “A House of Dynamite.”\n\t\n\n\t“I’m not a missile defense expert, but I did talk to many missile defense experts who were all on the record,” Oppenheim said, noting that he and Bigelow spoke with former White House and Pentagon officials to “report out” the screenplay. “We just asked them a ton of questions. How does it work? What are the processes? What are the procedures? So what you see on screen is hopefully a fairly accurate portrait of the reality that exists.”\n\n\tHe continued: “Unfortunately, our missile defense system is highly imperfect. If the Pentagon wants to have a conversation about improving it or what the next step might be in keeping all of us safer, that’s the conversation we want to have. But what we show in the movie is accurate.”\n\n\tAt the “House of Dynamite” Los Angeles premiere in early October, Bigelow told Variety that she was hoping the film would “certainly begin a conversation” about nuclear threats and attacks.\n\n\t“We live in a very combustible world and bringing awareness to that is a very positive step forward,” she said. “My hope is that we begin to move into a world toward non-proliferation and reducing the nuclear stockpile. These are lofty aspirations, I know, but nonetheless.”\n\n\tMarc Malkin contributed to this story. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Wrecker” packs so many action-thriller cliches into its first few minutes — including Harvey Keitel screaming “You don’t mess with a man’s family!” at a bloodied bloke tied to a chair in a warehouse — that you might worry if there will be any left to fill out the remaining 90. Fear not. This latest from actor-stuntman turned prolific B-movie director Art Camacho “introduces” star Niko Foster, though the only truly new element here for either party is that it represents a relatively rare theatrical (rather than direct-to-home-video) release. Seismic is rolling “The Wrecker” out to U.S. venues this Friday, with Quiver Distribution launching to home formats at an unspecified future date.\n\t\n\n\tHimself a veteran producer with several prior onscreen credits, Foster has the requisite bulging biceps, gravel voice and three-day stubble for a stock macho action-figure hero, amidst other 1980s/90s-style genre tropes. But the script he wrote with Sophia Louisa and James Dean Simington is so shamelessly derivative of already-cartoonish precedents (like “Road House” and “Stone Cold”), it might as well have been assembled by AI — or even intended as self-satire, though regretfully that does not appear to be the case. \n\n\n\tAlso featuring name actors Mena Suvari, Tyrese Gibson and Danny Trejo in thankless roles, this tale of mob-related malfeasance and solo vengeance in Vegas is slick but thoroughly ridick. However, it’s pacy and colorful enough that those in the mood for a deep-fried knuckle sandwich with extra cheese may have fun.\n\n\tAfter an awesomely hokey prologue that deprives Det. Boswell (Gibson) of his partner at the hands of ruthless “Dante the Untouchable” (Keitel), the film introduces protagonist Tony Minetti (Foster). He’s an ex-Marine who got dishonorably discharged. Now he runs an auto-repair shop while raising daughters Sarah (Rebekah Samuel) and Sunshine (London Dee Falcon), whose mother is deceased. Vrooming into the garage one day is his bad-boy little bro Bobby (Chad Michael Collins), high as a kite, driving a canary-yellow Ferrari he surely didn’t acquire through legal means. Unwisely agreeing to go for a spin, Tony finds they’re soon tailed by an ominous black SUV.\n\t\n\n\tWhen the inevitable chase ends in an inevitable crash, he wakes up facing the smirking, fedora’d “biggest crime boss since Al Capone,” whose vehicle Bobby had stolen. Dante informs Tony he won’t see his ne’er-do-well sibling again until he’s paid off that debt by performing some “jobs.” These involve raiding the lairs of hoodlum rivals, then singlehandedly dissuading them from competition. Tony refuses to handle guns (a third brother died in childhood playing with one), so he accomplishes these forceful cleanups with nothing more than his fists — plus one big, swinging wrench. \n\n\tSuch crackdowns attract notice from Boswell, who detects a civilian ally in his fight against local syndicates. But Tony eludes the cop’s inquiries, protected by his waitressing quasi-girlfriend (Suvari, stuck in doe-eyed “honey, be careful” terrain), coworkers and other loyal pals. The two men do eventually join forces, however, once Dante’s goons cross an unforgivable line. \n\n\t“The Wrecker” is lively enough, albeit without much distinction to its action, let alone plotting. It seems entirely recycled from whole parts of other movies. Nothing is too obvious for inclusion: The scantily clad women who provide background scenery in “lair-invading” scenes, yet never get a line of dialogue; the frequently ludicrous ease with which good guys defeat bad ones (at one point Trejo conquers a hulking tough by swiveling an office chair); moldy-chestnut dialogue like “He’s one man against an army” or the inescapable “Let’s do this!!” \n\n\tKnee-jerk sentimentality is cued by any mention of “family,” and there’s a howler of a sappy twist at the close. We get a training montage and an armoring montage, scored to generic hard rock, naturally. The title is derived from possibly the single silliest development among many: When Tony decides to “go to war,” his garage buddies reveal hitherto hidden skills to convert a truck into a “Mad Max”-worthy bulletproof tank, complete with flamethrower… virtually overnight, to boot. \n\n\tThis is not a finest hour for any of the better-known actors in the cast, though it must be said that, unlike in many a similar joint, they aren’t limited to glorified cameos. But the character writing is still so vapid that there’s not much they can do. The lesser-knowns, who often appear recruited from the ranks of pro wrestling and so forth, provide some awkward thesping moments. Still, they’re seldom required to provide more than sneering physicality. Foster himself is carefully presented in all the customary ways for this kind of quiet-cool, deadly-when-riled hero. (Does Tony even own a shirt with sleeves?) If there’s any personality, charm or humor to go with that rugged surface, however, those qualities remain MIA here. \n\t\n\n\tThough it might’ve taken advantage of the Las Vegas setting more, “The Wrecker” has an attractive-enough look in Stefan Colson’s widescreen cinematography. Some of the visual and editorial gimmicks feel a bit desperate in trying to lend third-hand ideas a patina of fresh excitement, but the film’s tech and design factors are solid for its relatively modest scale. \n\n\tIncreasingly towards the end, stylistic and narrative conventions get taken so far over-the-top that you do begin to wonder if Camacho & co. might be pulling our leg. Yet the only element reinforcing that notion is Mauricio Trabanino’s original score, which goes from standard bombast to underlining every pow! and thwack! a la the 1960s “Batman” series. Even so, one suspects that he’s having a private joke the other filmmakers aren’t in on. \n",

She had traveled to Basel, Switzerland, where she chose to end her life at Pegasos, a nonprofit clinic for assisted dying.\n      \n    \n          Jackie was based in NYC, where Medical Aid in Dying (MAID) isn’t legal -- and in the U.S. states where it is legal, patients have to be terminally ill, which she wasn’t. That’s why she traveled to Switzerland, where the law doesn’t require someone to be terminally ill.\n      \n\n          Important to note ... medical aid in dying isn’t the same as euthanasia. Euthanasia is illegal in the U.S., and that’s when a doctor gives the drugs. With medical aid, the patient takes the meds themselves.\n      \n    \n          Jackie recently told \"The New York Times\" that even though she was in good health, she felt ready to go -- explaining that after taking two falls in the past year, she never wanted to end up dependent on others.\n      \n    \n          Jackie was 95.\n      \n    \n          RIP\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                RIP\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                Health\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tBritish actor Amanda Abbington, best known for BBC One’s “Sherlock” and ITV Studios’ “Mr. Selfridge,” has joined “Jones,” a mystery drama produced by Caracol Studios for Portuguese pubcaster RTP.\n\n\tCreated and directed by Bruno Gascon (“Carga”), “Jones” illustrates Portuguese TV fiction’s growing ambition of  global reach. It is handled by Austria’s ORF Enterprise for international distribution.\n\t\n\n\tCurrently lensing across Portugal’s Sintra and Vila Nova de Foz Côa, the series blends whodunit mechanics with supernatural twists, leavened by dark humor. \n\n\n\tIn the six-part TV drama, Abbington plays Eve, a sharp-witted, slightly off-kilter actress drawn into an investigation led by Oliver Jones, played by Portuguese thesp José Pimentão (Netflix’s “1899”), a detective with the unnerving gift of speaking to the dead.\n\n\tAfter a murder at a lavish family gathering in Sintra, Jones teams with the victim, Júlia (Laura Dutra, of RTP’s “Irreversível”), to crack the case amid a maze of secrets, lies and spectral clues. \n\n\tThe ensemble cast also features Ivo Canelas, Rui Morrison, Raquel Rocha Vieira, Rafael Morais, Paula de Magalhães, Afonso Lagarto, Margarida Moreira and Sílvia Chiola.\n\n\tFor Gascon, Abbington’s presence both suits the show’s Agatha Christie-tinted universe and amplifies its crossover pull. \n\n\t“‘Jones’ is my tribute to classic mystery stories, deeply inspired by Agatha Christie. Every episode invites the audience to question every detail, every shadow and every character — where neither the living nor the dead tell the full truth,” he said. \n\t\n\n\t“Amanda was perfect for Eve — nuanced, natural and deeply connected to the story. Her international recognition brings visibility and prestige, and the British touch of humor was essential to this universe.”\n\n\tAbbington was hooked by the character and the show’s multilingual, actor-driven approach. “Eve is complex, fun, mysterious and interesting,” she said. \n\n\t“I loved the challenge of acting with Portuguese castmates while delivering my dialogue in English — it was incredibly rewarding and much easier than I expected.” \n\n\tShe continued: “Filming in Portugal was a big draw, and Bruno is very much an actor’s director; there was a freedom in working with him that was refreshing and easy.” \n\n\t“The series is completely character-driven and multiple languages weave through the show, which feels innovative and unique,” Abbington added.\n\n\tHugo Azevedo, whose credits take in Netflix Portuguese original hit “Rabo de Peixe,” serves as cinematographer on “Jones.”\n\n\tGascon’s previous features tied up “Jones” for international play. “Carga,” his breakout film debut, secured U.S. distribution via Breaking Glass Pictures and later surfaced across major AVOD/SVOD stores, while follow-up “Sombra” saw sustained momentum on the festival circuit and sold Portuguese TV rights to RTP.\n\n\tHis series “Irreversível” was selected for MipDrama 2024 and subsequently won the Globo de Ouro 2025 for Best Fiction Project in Portugal.\n\n\t“Jones” is produced by Caracol Studios for RTP, with support from Pic Portugal, the Municipality of Vila Nova de Foz Côa and Quinta da Penalva, among further local partners.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAtresmedia Sales has sold both seasons of “La Ruta” to Portuguese pay TV operator NOS, expanding the global reach of the hit Spanish drama, as its second installment, “La Ruta. Vol. 2: Ibiza,” bows Oct. 26 on Atresmedia’s Atresplayer platform in Spain.\n\n\tNOS will first launch Season 1 of the series in Portugal as Season 2 will follow in 2026. \n\n\tThe Atresmedia-NOS pact headlines a wave of post-Mipcom deals that further cements the Spanish company standing as one of Europe’s most active exporters of Spanish-language fiction content.\n\t\n\n\tBeyond “La Ruta,” Atresmedia has secured the sale of “Honor,” the Spanish redo of Showtime Hit legal-thriller “Your Honor” – in turn, based on the Israeli TV drama “Kvodo” – to the U.K. via Global Series Network’s Walter Presents and to Greece through Nova. \n\n\n\tMeanwhile, “Alba,” toplining Elena Rivera and inspired by Turkish mega-hit “Fatmagül,” has expanded its roll-out to SIC (Portugal), Alpha (Greece) and Telma (the Balkans), as period saga “Entre Tierras,” led by Megan Montaner (“La Caza”), premieres in Finland on YLE.\n\n\tA 12th-century period drama, “Beguinas,” starring Amaia Aberasturi and Yon González, will air on NOS and Finland’s YLE. Sci-fi thriller “Santuario,” led by Aura Garrido, also joins NOS’ slate after its Baltic launch via TV3/GO3 and platform TET.\n\n\tPortuguese public broadcaster RTP continues to strengthen its partnership with Atresmedia, picking up its musical dramedy “Mariliendre,” produced in collaboration with Javier Calvo and Javier Ambrosi’s Madrid-based outfit Suma Content. \n\t\n\n\t“Déjate ver,” the dramatic comedy created by Álvaro Carmona, addressing issues such as identity and emotional disconnection in today’s world, “Dos años y un día,” a comedy starring Arturo Valls as a famous actor and presenter who ends up in jail, and sports biopic “El Gran Salto,” have been licensed to Greece’s Nova.\n\n\tAtresmedia also drew attention at Mipcom when market analyst The Wit highlighted “Las Hijas de la Criada” and “La Encrucijada” among most outstanding new dramas. \n\n\tAdapted from Sonsoles Ónega’s 2023 Premio Planeta-winning novel, “Las Hijas de la Criada” premieres Nov. 30 on Atresplayer before its Antena 3 prime-time debut, while “La Encrucijada,” co-produced with Secuoya Studios and Turkey’s Ay Yapim, adapts Turkish fiction “Brave and Beautiful.”\n\n\t“La Ruta. Vol. 2: Ibiza” at Mostra de València\n\n\tA new episode of “La Ruta” premiered last week at Spain’s Mostra de València – Cinema del Mediterrani, where audiences got an exclusive first look before Sunday’s launch on Atresplayer.\n\n\tDirected by Borja Soler and produced by Atresmedia with Rodrigo Sorogoyen-partnered Caballo Films, “La Ruta. Vol. 2: Ibiza” spans two timelines — 1996, when DJ Marc Ribó (Àlex Monner) spins at Amnesia, and 1972, when his parents lived on a freer-spirited Ibiza before dying in a plane crash. \n\n\tWith those deals, Atresmedia continues showing how local hits can translate into global successes — fuelling Spain’s status as a relevant territory for scripted TV content.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Ruta\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: LAIA LLUCH\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tJon Stewart got candid about his future at “The Daily Show” at the New Yorker Festival on Sunday, telling editor David Remnick that he’s “working on staying.” \n\n\tStewart’s current contract at Comedy Central — which is now owned by the newly-merged Paramount Skydance Corporation — expires in December. Especially after the company announced that CBS’ “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” would be ending in May 2026, many have been questioning Stewart’s future at “The Daily Show.” Both Colbert and Stewart have been critical of the merger and President Donald Trump on their shows, including Paramount’s settlement with Trump over Kamala Harris’ “60 Minutes” interview. \n\t\n\n\tHowever, Stewart confirmed to Remnick that he is looking to extend his “Daily Show” contract. “We’re working on staying,” Stewart said (via the Daily Beast). “Look, the other thing to remember is it’s not as clear cut as all that… They’ve already done things that I’m upset about. But then if I had integrity, maybe I would stand up and go, ‘I’m out.’ Or maybe the integrity thing to do would be to stay in it and keep fighting in the foxhole.”\n\n\n\tStewart added: “You don’t compromise on what you do, and you do it until they tell you to leave.” \n\n\tDuring the interview with Remnick, Stewart also sounded off on Trump’s administration. “There’s a reason Donald Trump came to power, and that is that in the general populous mind, government no longer serves the interests of the people it purports to represent,” Stewart said. “That’s a broad-based, deep feeling, and that helps when someone comes along and goes, the system is rigged, and people go, ‘Yeah, it is.’”\n\t\n\n\tThough late-night hosts such as Stewart, Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel — who was suspended from his ABC show in September after comments he made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination — are under scrutiny, Stewart insisted that they are not “victims of this administration.”\n\n\t“We are a visible manifestation of certain things, but the victims are the people that are struggling to have any voice and are being forcibly removed from streets by hooded agents,” Stewart said. “Those are the victims of this administration.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe 38th Tokyo International Film Festival got off to a spectacular start on Monday with a galaxy of stars in attendance.\n\n\tAttendees parading the red carpet at the storied Takarazuka Theater included a veritable who’s who of celebrities and filmmakers, from Asia and around the world.\n\n\tThey included French actor Juliette Binoche, who is presenting her directorial debut “In-I in Motion” at the festival; Chinese superstar Fan Bingbing, who plays the lead in competition film “Mother Bhumi”; members of Japanese boy band Generations From Exile Tribe (with their documentary scheduled at the festival); and Japanese actor Takuichi Kumi, serving as festival “navigator,” TIFF’s special name for ambassador.\n\t\n\n\tJapanese actor Yoshinaga Sayuri and American filmmaker Paul Schrader brought a well-needed dose of old-school cool to the proceedings. Yoshinaga, an institution in Japanese cinema, stars in the festival’s opening film “Climbing for Life.” She was presented with the TIFF Lifetime Achievement Award at the opening ceremony. Yoshinaga wore a kimono displaying a picture of Tabei Junko, the pioneering female Japanese mountaineer who she plays in the film.\n\n\n\tSchrader is presenting his 1985 classic “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters” in a sidebar dedicated to the 100th Anniversary of the birth of the legendary Japanese novelist. When asked on the red carpet if he had any comments for Japanese audiences, he replied sardonically: “Don’t blame America for Donald Trump!” A controversial biopic, “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters” has been effectively banned from screening in Japan since its 1985 release. It was originally scheduled to screen at the first TIFF in 1985, but organizers rejected it. Forty years later, it is finally getting its official TIFF premiere.\n\t\n\n\tThe cast of Japanese school comedy “Blonde” received some of the loudest applause from awaiting fans, with their cast turning up in matching costumes and bright blonde hairdos from the movie.\n\n\tOther notable names at the event included “She Has No Name” director Peter Chan Ho-sun; Shibasaki Ko and Mitsushima Hikari, stars of “Bring Him Down to a Portable Size”; “Elvis” producer Schuyler Weiss; Urmila Venugopalan, MPA’s president and MD for the Asia-Pacific region; Zhang Lu, director of “Mothertongue”; Pengfei, director of “Take Off”; Kitagawa Keiko, star of “Night Flower”; competition jury chair Carlo Chatrian; and Pen-ek Ratanaruang, director of “Morte Cucina.”\n\n\tFor the second year in a row, the weather gods played nice, leading festival chair Ando Hirayasu to remark: “After two days of rain over the weekend, I wondered what would happen on Monday, but the autumn weather turned out to be clear, and thanks to everyone’s support, the red carpet was a spectacular success. This year 270 people walked the carpet, a 30% increase from last year.”\n\n\tBeyond the stars, Ino Toshiro — Japan’s State Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry — got down to business in his speech at the opening ceremony, including the revelation that Japan will be the country of honor at next year’s Cannes Market. “Japan has been given the opportunity to serve as the country of honor at the Marché du Film. I pledge that we will work together, in partnership between the public and private sectors, to make the most of this opportunity,” Ino said.\n\n\tIno also announced that to recognize the outstanding efforts of film commissions, which play an indispensable role in location shooting, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has established a new Minister’s Award this year.\n\n\tThe minister also name-checked Lee Sang-il’s kabuki-based drama “Kokuho,” which debuted at Cannes and has gone on to become the second biggest hit of the year in Japan after “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle.” \n\n\t“Recently, the Japanese film ‘Kokuho‘ became a major hit, and as a result of its influence, public interest in kabuki, a core part of Japan’s cultural heritage, has grown significantly. I am delighted that such works are helping to deepen understanding of and promote the development of Japanese culture,” Ino said. “As a government, we will continue to support efforts to bring these fascinating Japanese contents to audiences worldwide.” \n\t\n\n\t“I sincerely hope that film and the broader content industry will continue to grow as key industries of Japan and as symbols of our culture,” Ino added. \n\n\tThe festival runs through Nov. 5. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSwedish actor Björn Andrésen, best known for his breakout role as Tadzio in Italian director Luchino Visconti’s 1971 drama “Death in Venice,” has died. He was 70. \n\n\tAndrésen’s death was announced on Sunday by Kristian Petri and Kristina Lindström, co-directors of the 2021 documentary “The Most Beautiful Boy in the World,” which explored the trauma suffered by Andrésen during and after “Death in Venice.” He was just 16 when he landed the life-changing role opposite an older man, a composer grappling with failing health played by Dirk Bogarde who becomes obsessed with the 14-year-old Tadzio.\n\t\n\n\tPetri told Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter that Andrésen died on Saturday and remembered him as a “brave person” who “had an incredible charisma and presence in front of the camera.” The cause of his death has not been disclosed.\n\n\n\tBorn in Stockholm in 1955, Andrésen had a traumatic childhood after his father died in an accident followed by his mom’s death by suicide when he was 10. He was raised by his grandmother who, looking to capitalize on his high cheekbones and cherubic looks, pushed him into modeling and acting which led to being cast by Visconti in the performance that made him an overnight star. That lucky break became a nightmare, particularly after Visconti labelled Andrésen the “most beautiful boy in the world” at a Cannes press conference.\n\n\t“Life and career-wise, it fucked up a lot of things,” Andrésen told Variety in 2021 when the doc came out.\n\n\t“The Most Beautiful Boy in the World” contains footage of Andrésen’s audition for Visconti, in which he’s photographed shirtless. “When they asked me to take off my shirt, I wasn’t comfortable,” Andrésen told Variety in 2021. “I wasn’t prepared for that. I remember when he posed me with one foot against the wall, I would never stand like that. When I watch it now, I see how that son of a bitch sexualized me,” he said.\n\t\n\n\tFollowing “Death in Venice,” Andrésen went to Japan where he became a pop star. “The Most Beautiful Boy in the World” includes footage of the actor being swarmed with fans when his plane touches down in Tokyo.\n\n\tHe subsequently continued to act, with appearances in more than 30 movies and TV series, most recently in Ari Aster’s 2019 horror film “Midsommar” in a small role as an elderly man named Dan.\n\n\tAndrésen is survived by his daughter Robine, whom he had with his ex-wife, the poet Susanna Roman.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn a move to boost series from the Baltics and their ties to Europe’s market, the Series Mania Institute has launched Serial Bridges Baltics, a new workshop for Baltic screenwriters and series producers, staged in partnership with the Institute Français and Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event.\n\n\tThe inaugural session, due to roll out Nov. 13-17 at Tallinn’s TV Beat Forum, will reunite six writer/producer duos, including some of the Baltics’ hottest names in serialised drama: Estonia’s Raoul Suvi, writer of the Berlinale Series Market 2025 title “My Dear Mother” and the acclaimed “Traitor,” Latvia’s wrier/director Juris Kursietis (“Soviet Jeans”, “The Exhalted,” “Oleg”), as well as Lithuania’s actor/writer/producer Gabija Siurbytė (“Troll Farm”).\n\t\n\n\t“We are delighted to be organising such a workshop in Estonia for all Baltic talent,” said Pierre Ziemniak, director of programs at the Series Mania Institute who oversees other international workshops under the ‘Serial Bridges’ banner. “Despite tighter budgets than in Western Europe, Baltic series are increasingly recognized and appreciated by the international market, as exemplified by “Soviet Jeans” from Latvia, which was presented at Series Mania in 2024. This is a dynamic that we want to support,” he said.\n\n\n\t“Building this bridge between TV Beats and Series Mania Institute was a quick but smooth and exciting process,” added Petri Kemppinen, co-head of TV Beats Forum who also welcomed the chance for Baltic series creators to be recognized internationally. “I am convinced that the workshop format, bringing together several experienced experts and including a final pitch in front of professionals, will help develop new skills and open doors for future co-productions.”\n\t\n\n\tMentors assigned to the Baltics duos take in Hungarian writer/producer Gabor Krigler, former HBO Europe creative executive, and Finnish writer Jemina Jokisalo (“Money Shot”). Further expertise will come from Emmanuelle Guilbart, About Premium Content co-CEO, as well as Emmanuel Eckert, former deputy director of acquisitions, Mediawan Rights, and French-Swedish producer Patrick Nebout (“Whiskey on the Rocks”).\n\n\tSpeaking to Variety about the first batch of Serial Bridges Baltics projects, Ziemniak said: “We were pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the projects submitted, particularly in terms of series genres. While thrillers and dramas reflecting the geopolitical situation are well represented, we also had the pleasure of reading comedies, fantasy stories and horror stories.”\n\n\tHe added: “Several submissions showed a certain ingenuity in seeking to connect local stories with the international market by targeting the right partners, which is entirely in line with the spirit of Serial Bridges: building bridges while respecting local DNA, overcoming the constraints of local markets with limited funding, by partnering with other European companies and aiming for universality while remaining faithful to cultural specificities.”\n\n\tOn the closing day of the workshop Nov. 17, the Baltic teams will pitch their project to a professional jury and the winning show will get an entry ticket to Series Mania Forum 2026.\n\n\tSerial Bridges Baltics is backed by the Estonian Ministry of Culture, the Estonian Film Institute, the platform Elisa Eesti in Estonia and Latvian pubcaster LRT.A fuller rundown of the Serial Bridges Baltics projects:\n\n\t“Aurora Newsroom,” (“Aurora.Redakcija,” 6X52’, Latvia, Estonia, Finland)\n\n\tCreated by Gints GrūbeWritten by Juris Kursietis, Katri Manninen, Osvalds Zebris, Martin AlgusDirected by Juris KursietisProduced by Mistrus Media’s Gints Grūbe, Inese Boka-Grūbe, Elīna Gediņa-Ducena, with partners Riina Sildos from Estonia and Petri Kemppinen from Finland\n\n\tContemporary spy thriller from “Soviet Jeans”’ co-helmer Juris Kursietis, who shares the writers’ room with co-national Osvalds Zebris, Finland’s Katri Manninen (“Shadow Lines”) and Estonia’s Martin Algus (“Traitor,” “Kalev”).

    "body": "\n\tFan Bingbing is so unrecognizable in “Mother Bhumi” that even her friends didn’t know it was her. For the Chinese superstar, that’s exactly the point.\n\n\t“Seeing this kind of feedback for the first time actually made me quite happy,” Fan tells Variety ahead of the film’s competition premiere at the Tokyo International Film Festival. “I hope audiences see not Fan Bingbing, but the woman fighting for the land and standing firm for her people — that I’ve fully immersed myself in the role.”\n\t\n\n\tSet in a late-1990s Malaysian rice-farming village, “Mother Bhumi,” directed by Chong Keat Aun, follows Hong Im, a widowed farmer and ritual healer who struggles to protect her family and community amid political unrest and land seizures. By day, she resists developers; by night, she heals and exorcises. As colonial-era conflicts resurface, strange events unfold: spirits return, black magic stirs, and the legacy of empire haunts the land, the living and the dead of Bujang Valley.\n\n\n\tThe film represents a striking departure for Fan, who has built a career playing bold, outwardly powerful characters in everything from historical epics to intimate dramas. “Hong Im is different. Her strength is inward,” she explains. “She doesn’t shout or scream; instead, she fights through silent persistence and gentle protection. This quality of overcoming strength with gentleness is something I’ve rarely expressed before.”\n\n\tThe transformation required months of intensive preparation that went far beyond typical script work. Fan watched documentaries about Malaysian villages daily, learned to work the fields like the characters, and studied blessing rituals alongside the villagers themselves.\n\t\n\n\t“I learned the local dialect by shadowing villagers — not just memorizing lines from the script, but mimicking the intonations of everyday conversations and the shouts during farmwork. I immersed myself in their traditional rituals, like the land blessing mentioned in the script. I studied every gesture and the meaning behind each prayer from the village elders, not merely acting out the motions but grasping the underlying belief in humanity’s symbiosis with the earth,” Fan says.\n\n\tThe immersion extended to living the rhythms of village life. “During filming, I watched villagers head to the fields at sunrise and saw smoke rise from every household at sunset,” she recalls. “I etched these scenes into my heart, immersing myself fully. That way, when I acted, it felt grounded — not detached.”\n\n\tMost crucially, she says, was “emptying my mind. I imagined myself as someone who grew up in the village, feeling her dependence on the land and her panic at losing her home. The land’s influence on people is profound. Immersed in this atmosphere, I gradually became more and more like Hong Im —even my gaze carried the character’s obsession.”\n\n\tHong Im navigates both tangible and spiritual realms, but Fan was determined to keep the character rooted in reality. “This character’s spirituality isn’t fantastical — it grows from the earth itself,” she says. “For instance, she foresees danger through nature’s shifts. These abilities must be grounded in genuine emotion.”\n\n\t“I’ll transform seemingly mystical elements into the character’s intuition: when she senses the land is about to be encroached upon, it’s not through supernatural powers, but through details like the growth of crops or the temperature of river water. This gives her spirituality a grounded foundation,” Fan adds. “In this way, realism and mysticism don’t clash — instead, they make the character more multidimensional. She is both an ordinary person rooted in the land and a guardian carrying its mission.”\n\n\tWorking on the Malaysian-Italian co-production proved revelatory, offering Fan insight into different approaches to storytelling and performance. “What excites me most is the clash of creative visions,” she says. “The Malaysian team emphasizes emotional nuance — when filming villagers interacting, they’d encourage us to capture more unscripted moments like passing water or a gentle pat on the shoulder, describing these as the unspoken bonds within the village.”\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, she notes, “the Italian team excels at poetic cinematography, guiding me to convey a character’s inner turmoil through mere gazes. Even a single shot of someone staring at the earth could evoke a profound dialogue between humanity and the land.”\n\n\tThe collaboration wasn’t about one side persuading the other, Fan explains, “but about jointly discovering the most fitting expression for the story. Take a scene blessing the land, for instance: we blended local ritual details with the romantic interplay of light and shadow seen in European cinema, resulting in a truly breathtaking effect.”\n\n\tAfter more than two decades in the industry and a global career that has taken her from Golden Horse Awards to the Berlin and Tokyo film festivals, Fan has developed clear criteria for selecting international work.\n\n\t“For me, the appeal of international projects has never been about the scale of production, but whether the role has soul,” she says. “Of course, first I look for universal emotions in the story — like in ‘Mother Bhumi,’ which is about protecting one’s homeland. Whether audiences are from Malaysia, China, or elsewhere, they can all feel that emotion. Next, I consider whether the character has room to grow, whether it allows me to explore sides of myself I haven’t shown before. If a project merely has an international label but the role is flat, I won’t take it.”\n\n\tHer artistic goals have crystallized with time, with her main mission being “to portray characters that resonate with audiences, regardless of the story’s national origin.”\n\n\tPlaying Hong Im fundamentally shifted Fan’s relationship with nature. “Before, I felt the land might be distant from me, but after playing this role, I now instinctively connect with the ground beneath my feet,” she says. “Walking along a field ridge, I wonder how long it will take for the crops here to mature; seeing a downpour, I worry whether the plants in the fields might be flooded.”\n\n\tThe film’s title — which literally translates to “Mother Earth” — took on deeper meaning through the process. “This role has taught me that the land isn’t a lifeless vessel — it’s a family member living in symbiosis with us. We depend on it for survival, and it needs our protection in return. Now, when I witness nature’s transformations, I feel a deeper sense of reverence than before and truly grasp the meaning of cherishing what we have.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen asked how she defines artistic growth after more than 20 years in the industry, Fan’s answer reveals an evolution in her approach to the craft. “My artistic growth has evolved from initially playing roles to now striving to become them,” she explains. “Before, I focused on how to portray a character well; now, I think about how to bring them to life — not through technique, but through empathy.”\n\n\t“What truly challenges me now are unfamiliar characters — those embodying lives I’ve never lived or emotions I’ve never felt,” she says. “A role like Hong Im, with its many uncharted uncertainties, excites me immensely. Each new character feels like unlocking a fresh door to a different world. This sense of novelty is what keeps me going.”\n\n\tThe experience of playing Hong Im confirmed for Fan that “sometimes the power of quietness can be more impactful than intense outbursts.” It’s a lesson that applies to her character choices going forward. “The characters I’ve played before, whether historical figures or modern women, mostly radiated an outward force — passionate in love and hate, bold in pursuit and struggle,” she reflects. “But Hong Im is different. To preserve her land, she endures daily negotiations with developers. To comfort her tribe, she quietly shoulders the responsibility of rituals.”\n\n\tLooking ahead, Fan remains focused on depth over spectacle. “I still want to immerse myself in roles. Regardless of the project, as long as the character has depth and the story has substance, I’m willing to give it a shot,” she says. “Over the next year, I hope to engage with more stories that focus on reality and female growth.”\n\n\tShe’s currently in discussions about several scripts but isn’t ready to make official announcements. “In short, there are a hundred ways for a living flower to bloom,” Fan says. “I hope each new role I take on can offer audiences a fresh perspective.”\n\n\tFor now, her attention is on Hong Im and the land she fights to protect. What began as preparation for a role has become something more lasting. “I’ve gained a new understanding,” Fan says of her relationship to the earth. It’s the kind of transformation that can’t be faked — and couldn’t be recognized by even her closest friends.\n\n\tThe film stars Fan alongside Natalie Hsu, Bai Run-yin and Pearlly Chua. It is is a Malaysia-Hong Kong-Italy-Saudi Arabia co-production between Janji Pictures Production, Volos Films Italia and Southern Islet Pictures. Wong Kew Soon, Stefano Centini and Zoey Teng serve as producers, with support from Finas, the Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum and the Red Sea Fund.\n",

Ritter is leaving to “take on new professional challenges,” according to a statement from Beta.\n\n\tRitter has more than 30 years of experience in the international film industry.

    "body": "\n\tNewly launched sales company Odd Slice Films has boarded “Stories of a Lie,” directed by Olia Verriopoulou, due to world premiere at IDFA in the Luminous section, and nominated for the best first feature award. A clip debuts below.\n\n\n\tThe film is a “playful personal investigation on the rationale behind hiding a cancer diagnosis from patients, questioning whether silence protects—or harms—the people we love.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film asks: What does concealing (or revealing) the truth do to a patient’s mental state? Is it better to know nothing, or only the bare minimum? Does it differ from patient to patient? Does it happen in Greece because Greek has no word for “infantilize,” or out of fear that merely uttering the “C-word” would open Pandora’s box—with unforeseeable consequences?\n\n\n\t“With curiosity, humor and heart, the director dives into a culture of silence, speaking to medical professionals in her close circle (including her theatrical father), while confronting myths, fears and family habits,” according to a statement.\n\n\tOdd Slice Films’ Martina Droandi, a former sales and acquisitions executive at Austria-based Autlook Filmsales, said: ” ‘Stories of a Lie’ is full of surprising images, revealing an imagination in Olia I truly admire. Her film holds a rare balance of lightness and depth, moving originally between humor and vulnerability without ever losing emotional truth.\n\n\t“The topic she explores is not a conventional one: a philosophical and ethical dilemma with no easy answers. Approaching it through a personal lens was a bold choice—and it works beautifully. ‘Stories of a Lie’ is a tender, intelligent and deeply human film that I am excited to represent.”\n\t\n\n\tAlso in the Odd Slice Films’ catalog are “Amilcar” by Miguel Eek (IDFA, Envision competition, 2025), “Afterlives” by Kevin B. Lee (DocLiboa, BFI London, 2025) and “Silent Observers” (IDFA, 2024, winner of best documentary at DOK.Münich, three awards at the Bulgarian film awards and the artistic vision award at DocAviv).\n\n\t“Stories of a Lie” is produced by Mina Dreki for Marni Films in Greece and Gaëlle Jones for Perspective Films in France, in coproduction with Tamarisk, Filaos Productions and Yellowgroove. The film is supported by the Hellenic Film and Audiovisual Center – Creative Greece, ERT Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation and the CNC in France.\n",

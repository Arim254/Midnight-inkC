    "body": "\n\tEven the most inspirational films about growing up in the inner-city have a tendency to look down on their subjects, portraying them as characters to be rescued or redeemed. But in Walter Thompson-Hernández’s one-of-a-kind Sundance discovery “If I Go Will They Miss Me,” the filmmaker — and his largely untrained (and by extension authentic) ensemble — spend most of their time looking up to the skies, where passing airplanes represent the world beyond Los Angeles’ working-class Watts neighborhood.\n\t\n\n\tThat perspective, which rhymes with the low-angle view of boys jumping between the roofs of neighboring apartment buildings in Charles Burnett’s street-level classic “Killer of Sheep,” rejects the concerned but condescending narrative of films in which the forces of crime, drugs, gangs and poverty pull Black boys down. Instead, Thompson-Hernández gives them wings. Aiming to establish a new idiom to represent the community and conditions in which he was raised, the journalist-turned-director (whose instinct is to point the camera at people commonly overlooked) channels elements of surrealism, modern dance and Greek mythology that have never been combined in quite this way before.\n\n\n\tThompson-Hernández grew up directly below the LAX flight path, gazing up at passing jets without realizing quite how harmful they were to his community (in addition to the toxins they release, there have been unconscionable cases of fuel dumps over populated neighborhoods near the airport). To him, they symbolized something else, as he and his peers imagined themselves as planes, running with arms outstretched, as if preparing to fly. In his movie, young African American men do the same, assuming the inverted-V pose rendered iconic in “Weapons,” with altogether different connotations.\n\t\n\n\tAt a certain age, a kind of metamorphosis takes place, and these boys “take off” to whatever unspecified next phase awaits. Hence the question asked by the title, “If I Go Will They Miss Me,” which Thompson-Hernández applies to both his 2022 Sundance jury award-winning short film and its more refined (if still slightly unfocused) feature-length expansion. Here, the filmmaker recasts his main character, 12-year-old Anthony Harris, Jr. (who played himself in the short), named after his father. The film refers to these two as “Lil Ant” (Bodhi Jordan Dell) and “Big Ant” (J. Alphonse Nicholson), respectively, exploring the complicated dynamic between them — with family matriarch Lozita (Danielle Brooks) serving as the radiant heart and unsung lynchpin in their relationship.\n\n\tLil Ant has a vivid imagination, which manifests itself in school, where doodling in class — he draws a winged Pegasus, who comes to life on the page — doesn’t prevent him from paying attention. He’s a model student with a well-formed answer when the teacher asks about ancient Greek gods. Among the many ideas the film explores, front and center is the notion that communities like Ant’s create their own mythologies.\n\n\tLil Ant lionizes his father, who’s far from perfect (in fact, as the film opens, he’s just returning from his latest stint in prison), and yet, the long-absent figure remains heroic in his son’s eyes. Lil Ant likens his dad’s absence to time spent at the Trojan War, “kind of like Odysseus, who eventually returned back to Ithaca after being away from him family for a long time,” the boy explains via voiceover. He hopes his dad won’t have to go back (to jail). Looking through his son’s notebooks, Big Ant recognizes himself, flashing back to a costly teenage mistake.\n\n\tIf Lil Ant identifies as Pegasus, that would make his father Poseidon, appearing with toga and trident in his son’s imagination — visions that may remind audiences of the ecstatic, revisionist folklore dimension of Benh Zeitlin’s “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” Thompson-Hernández clearly has such films in mind (as well as RaMell Ross’ “Hale County This Morning, This Evening”), though his most important visual references are to paintings by the likes of Jacob Lawrence, Winfred Rembert and (especially) Noah Davis.\n\t\n\n\tSome audiences may find it difficult to adjust to the filmmaker’s mesmerizing, somewhat avant garde cinematic style — more lyrical than logical — in which composition (how Black bodies are posed within the frame) takes precedence over what the characters are saying at any given moment. But he’s right to realize that those choices are more likely to stick with us, from Black skin lit blue (à la “Moonlight”) to a papier-mâché Pegasus imprint themselves on our memory. For instance, Big Ant keeps a horse at Richland Farms (the subject of Thompson-Hernández’s 2020 book “The Compton Cowboys”), and the film observes him spending long hours there. He also takes his son to the beach, which offers an escapist backdrop for a bonding experience.\n\n\tMalcolm Parson’s soulful piano score connects these disparate elements, while the entire project is bookended by Jon Batiste’s “This Bitter Earth.” Although “If I Go” can occasionally feel amorphous and meandering at times, it’s comprised of a hundred indelible images which collectively make a powerful impression, especially footage of the community at large. Thompson-Hernández and his DP, Michael Fernandez, shot in and around the Nickerson Gardens public housing development, embracing the faces they found there. The film brims with resonant inserts of Lil Ant’s neighbors, leaning against project walls, backlit by fireworks, sitting in basketball hoops, high above the ground.\n\n\tRepeatedly, the project seems to transcend the projects, defying gravity in its poetic depiction of how this resilient, supportive community comes together around Lil Ant, stepping in where his father stumbles to embrace the boy. In that sense, the film answers its own question.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen it came to finding a composer for Charli xcx‘s mockumentary “The Moment,” no one made more sense than her longtime producer and friend A. G. Cook. Though he’d never scored a feature before, his fingerprints are all over “Brat,” Charli’s seminal 2024 album that became a lime-green, party-girl phenomenon and serves as the backdrop for the Aidan Zamiri-directed film. \n\n\tIn “The Moment,” which premiered at Sundance Film Festival before opening in select theaters on Friday, an alternate-reality Charli must choose between standing by her art or selling out when a sinister director (played by Alexander Skarsgård) is hired to make her concert movie. But “The Moment” mostly avoids songs from “Brat,” relying instead on an electrifying score from Cook that evokes — though doesn’t directly pull from — the sonic landscape of the album.\n\t\n\n\t“I’ve been working with Charli for so long that, reading the script and seeing the fly-on-the-wall situations with venues, managers, tours — that feels very funny and also real and vivid to me,” Cook told Variety over Zoom just hours before he took off for Sundance. “‘Brat’ is used almost to haunt Charli as a character, so for me it’s just a really nice opportunity to think about the palette of that album but also twist it in ways.”\n\n\n\tBelow, Cook speaks more about scoring “The Moment,” how David Lynch’s “Mulholland Drive” inspired him and the film’s big “Bitter Sweet Symphony” needle drop. \n\t\n\t\tWhen did you first hear about “The Moment” and how was the idea of scoring it brought to you? \t\n\n\tI think it’s been exactly a year since I read the script and actually started doing some bits of the sound already. It was sent around in January, and it was during the L.A. fires as well, so I was supposed to be in L.A. and then I wasn’t and I used the extra week or two to start doing bits of the music. I did a lot it before they shot, and then obviously I worked on it again to picture afterwards. There was a lot of reasons for that, but it was nice because it also meant that it was part of the Coachella and Glastonbury sets and it was in Aidan and the cast and crew’s ears and minds as they were actually [filming].\n\t\n\t\n\t\t“Dread,” in which you sample Charli and Icona Pop’s “I Love It,” is the song that was used at Coachella and Glastonbury, right?\t\n\n\t“Dread” was used for that kind of first trailer at the end of Coachella, and then there’s a longer version we zoomed in on for Glastonbury with the “Brat” backdrop going on fire. They’re all sort of different parts of the longer track. And there’s other way subtler things, like me playing bits and pieces in DJ sets around that time. But “Dread’s” been the one that is the kind of main theme, even though it’s used a bit differently in the movie edit.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThis is your first time scoring a feature film. What was your approach?\t\n\n\tIt’s a really weird, once-in-a-lifetime brief anyway just because of being involved in “Brat.” I had resisted doing full-length music scores — I’d done some short pieces and I have some really close friends who do film music constantly so I know how much work that is. I basically set up all these rules for myself. I was like OK, I don’t want any of Charli’s vocal in the score, like I don’t want to use her voice unless you see it on the screen — she’s rehearsing a song or she hears it in a car. And we only break that at the end with the “I Love It” [sample] in “Dread,” but that’s also such a strange use of it. It’s like, nothing to do with “Brat.”\n\n\tI had this palette that almost felt like a full score before they shot, like really within a week of reading the script. But then, obviously there were these certain scenes that I really wanted to perfect to picture. Towards the end of the film is where this other, more emotional music takes over that really has to work with the exact dialogue and monologues. \n\t\n\t\tTell me more about subverting the sonic palette of “Brat” for the score.\t\n\n\tThere’s bits and pieces of “Brat,” but I’m not using the actual melodic content — there’s a few of the same harsh synth textures, but they’re actually used quite sparingly and toward the end of the film they start to fall apart. There’s some referencing of that bass that you might hear on “365,” so it was a little bit of that DNA. But on “Brat” itself, I was having a lot more fun. You know, even just how we did drums and recording stuff, this was a lot more controlled. Like there’s not much drums in this, and when they come in it’s really obvious.\n\t\n\n\tI’m also a big fan of scores with a lot of silences in them, so this is something I had to push and pull a lot. There’s something really awkward about the way this whole film is shot, you know? It’s got this fly-on-the-wall quality and occasionally you see glimpses of Charli as this superstar. So I wanted it to have this feeling of really extreme music moments and then things completely vanish.\n\t\n\t\tWere you inspired by any other film scores while making this one?\t\n\n\tWhen it was the L.A. fires and I was writing was also the same week that David Lynch died. And I’m a big fan of Lynch and all the Angelo Badalementi soundtracks like “Twin Peaks” and “Mulholland Drive.” I was rewatching some Lynch stuff, especially “Mulholland Drive,” which thematically felt like it was some relation to “The Moment.” There’s that opening shot where they’re driving the canyons and it’s reminiscent of the kind of “Twin Peaks” style of suspended classic chords, but the chord progression is moving so slowly that your brain doesn’t necessarily latch on to them being the typical positive or negative, happy or sad — the emotion is pretty ambiguous. You can hear that across some of my other stuff, but I would say even though “Dread” has this big panic thing, a lot of the chords actually move in this way. There’s also one piece of music towards the end where Charli has a monologue and it shifts around but it never completely sits on one emotion. So that was a very conscious influence.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharli xcx in “The Moment.”\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBesides bits of “Brat” songs here and there, the only needle drop in “The Moment” is the Verve’s “Bitter Sweet Symphony.” How did that come to be and how did it work with your score?\t\n\n\tIt was in the script and it was pretty much like, “We’re going to blow all the budget on one big sync.” It felt very on brand, like “OK, there’s going to be only one needle drop and it’s going to be really good and really important.” And it stops the score itself from having to do this thing where it’s just working around these big songs all the time. That gave it somewhere to go and kind of crescendo towards. And for that reason I have no strings in the score, like “Bitter Sweet” will be the first string you hear. Probably the most intricate bit of the score is where it sort of morphs into “Bitter Sweet,” and that was done really carefully. They managed to find some of the original stems, so I could really finesse and have it come in at just the right moment. I haven’t heard many scores that really do that, where the one big needle drop also kind of morphs and oozes out of the previous score.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWould you score a film again?\t\n\n\tWhat’s funny is my tracks as A. G. Cook were getting longer and longer — from “7G” onwards I have these 10-minute tracks. And then some of those longer ones were already being used in small films here and there, and I’ve done things for fashion soundtracks as well. There’s a part of my music that really is related to that. So I think definitely, as long as the project is something that feels fresh. I’m almost certain that I will.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Are you fine with not sleeping at night?” an employer asks a candidate for a lowly security guard position, late in Kosovan director Visar Morina‘s new film “Shame and Money.” The question refers simply to the job’s antisocial hours, though it’s one that various characters in this stoic, slowly lacerating look at economic desperation and exploitation in contemporary Europe could stand to be asked, for a variety of reasons. Broke and anxiously navigating the urban menial employment market after having to abandon the family farm, middle-aged Shaban (Astrit Kabashi) is lying awake most nights, whether he’s working or not. Meanwhile, those higher up the capitalist food chain probably aren’t tossing and turning nearly as much as they should be.\n\t\n\n\tWinner of the Grand Jury Prize in Sundance’s world cinema competition, Morina’s third feature sees him turning his focus back to his homeland, after his excellent, likewise Sundance-premiered 2020 sophomore effort “Exile” offered a bitingly comic look at the Kosovan immigrant experience in modern Germany. There is markedly less humor in the studied, achingly sober “Shame and Money,” which again examines social outsider status, but this time with wealth and class — whether inherited or suddenly acquired — as the dividing barriers. Though his latest is a slow burn offering little in the way of hope or levity, Morina doesn’t trade in one-note miserablism either: Intricately observed domestic dynamics keep the drama textured and humane, as does Kabashi’s delicately layered performance as a man softly beaten down but screaming on the inside.\n\t\n\n\tA somewhat protracted first act, set in a dusty rural village not far from Kosovo’s capital Pristina, introduces a host of knotty tensions and conflicts in the extended family of dairy farmer Shaban, his wife Hatixhe (Flonja Kodheli) and their three young daughters — and that’s well before an inciting setback that relocates the action to the city. While Shaban and Hatixhe make a modest but solid living, with his mother Nana (Kumrije Hoxa) carefully managing the household income, Shaban’s irresponsible, work-shy younger brother Liridon (Tristan Halilaj) is in desperate need of cash. A third brother, the hot-tempered Agim (Abdinaser Beka), has no desire to help, but Shaban is an easier mark — and when Liridon takes off without warning or payback, the family is left in dire financial straits.\n\n\tWith the farm suddenly unsustainable, there’s nothing for it but to pack up and seek work in Pristina, where Hatixhe’s sister Lina (Fiona Gllavica) lives a comfortable nouveau riche life in a large, gleaming new-build home courtesy of her entrepreneur husband Alban (Alban Ukaj). Alban isn’t one for handouts, but he does offer his country-bumpkin in-laws part-time employment as a cleaners at a nightclub he owns — a somewhat high-handed treatment of kith and kin that is echoed in Lina’s awkward domestic arrangement, where she’s paid scant pocket money to work as a carer for Alban’s ailing, disabled father (Selman Lokaj). Even when you marry up, it seems, you’re briskly reminded of your true place on the social ladder.\n\n\tThe work offered by Alban isn’t sufficient for the couple to make a living, least of all in a new-to-them urban economy where everything from renting an apartment to making a bank withdrawal comes with hidden costs. Yet their attempts to find supplementary employment are frequently thwarted — including by Alban and Lina, who deem it embarrassing for the family for Shaban to be seen as a day laborer, and repeatedly instruct him to polish up his non-existent CV instead. Though Hatixhe pointedly reminds Lina that shame is a luxury most can’t afford to feel, she’s equally uneasy about taking money and gifts when her sister offers them. Morina’s complex screenplay has little interest in moral binaries, which tends to leave the politics unspoken. Instead, it keenly watches how each character locates the precise level of personal corruption at which they feel able to function in a society built on the bottom line.\n\t\n\n\tInterjections of strident folk singing sporadically disrupt the film’s otherwise muffled, throbbing soundtrack: bitter signifiers to the characters and audience alike of simpler, more rustic ways of life that have been forcibly left behind. Often favoring intimate, nervy tracking shots, Janis Mazuch’s cinematography is fluid and unassuming — save for in one showpiece shot, circling a raucous musical gathering in Pristina’s central town square. There, the camera also swirls around the surreal landmark of a Bill Clinton statue, watching passively over the bustle of the city from a lofty height. To anyone who cares to look up and notice, it’s a quaint reminder of when the future, and Eastern Europe’s westward-looking economic ideals, looked quite different from the cynical survival struggle of today.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIranian auteur Mohammad Rasoulof’s new work “Sense of Water” – which is the dissident director’s first film since “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” – has been picked up for global distribution by the Berlin and Lyon-based sales company Films Boutique. \n\n\tThe 39-minute “Sense of Water” short, which is premiering at the International Film Festival Rotterdam, also marks the first film Rasoulof has shot outside Iran. It reflects his personal journey since escaping to Germany in May 2024 after receiving a jail and flogging sentence from Iranian authorities for making “Sacred Fig,” which won the Special Jury prize at Cannes.\n\t\n\n\tIn “Sense of Water,” an Iranian writer living in exile, retreats with his former lover, Nazanin, to a glass cabin “in the northernmost reaches of the world,” as the synopsis puts it.\n\n\n\t“There, in the silence of the polar night, he intends to say goodbye. Despite facing a long prison sentence, Ali has decided to return to Iran — to continue the struggle he once left behind,” it adds.\n\n\t“My lived experience in exile was the starting point for this story,” Rasoulof said in his directors’ statement. “I suddenly realized that the first thing I had lost was the ability to feel words in a deep, immediate, and intimate way in a second language.”\n\n\t“A person in exile, striving to build a new life, finds themselves distanced from their most fundamental emotions; as if exile is not only the absence of homeland, but a rupture between words and feelings, between language and experience.”\n\n\tCommented Films Boutique CEO Jean-Christophe Simon: “We’re incredibly proud to continue our collaboration with Mohammad Rasoulof and our friends at Run Way pictures, following the great success of ‘The Seed of the Sacred Fig.” He further noted that “its subject sadly resonates with the current actuality.”\n\t\n\n\t“Sense of Water” is clearly a very timely work given the recent killings of thousands of protesters in Rasoulof’s homeland. The film was produced by Amin Sadraei, Rozita Hendijanian, and Mani Tilgner via Hamburg’s Run Way Pictures. It is supported by the Displacement Film Fund recently launched by Cate Blanchett), the Hubert Bals Fund, and the Moin Film Fund Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein.\n\n\t  Rasoulof wrote and directed,\n\n\t the Displacement Film Fund\n",

    "body": "\n\tAccording to Agnieszka Holland, Oscar-nominated director and Göteborg’s Honorary Dragon Award winner, truth is still important in today’s world. But it’s easy to twist.  \n\n\t“It happened during Stalin’s propaganda and Goebbels’ propaganda. It showed how easy it is to change the meaning of the words and how fragile they are. Sometimes it feels they’re becoming less and less important, like when we are listening to what American propaganda is saying about the victims of the shooting in Minneapolis.”\n\t\n\n\tHer 2019 film, “Mr. Jones,” reflected that sentiment. It’s based on the true story of journalist Gareth Jones, who wrote about the Holodomor, the famine in Ukraine that killed millions. \n\n\n\t“He tried to tell the truth about what was going on, but no one was interested. When the media are corrupted and play with the truth regarding political and ideological agendas, democracy dies. We are in that moment right now,” she said. \n\n\t“A fact is not abstract. It happens. You see a dead person – that’s a fact. We have to be humble now and [realize] that ‘truth’ is different for different people. So let’s stick to the facts.”\n\n\tHolland, whose unconventional Kafka biopic “Franz” was Poland’s Oscar submission, is known for being politically outspoken. Whether she’s discussing the women’s strike against abortion law amendment or the crisis at the Polish-Belarusian border. She depicted the latter in “Green Border,” which proved massively controversial in her native country and threatened her own safety. \n\t\n\n\t“It provoked incredibly violent attacks from Polish authorities and some far-right members of the Polish population. There were a lot of threats. In Poland, I had to travel with bodyguards, which was one of the funniest experiences I’ve had,” she recalled. \n\n\t“Their first task was to protect me during the public premiere in Warsaw. But so many people were hugging me and grabbing my hand – apparently the worst thing that can happen to a bodyguard. By the end of the evening, they were sweating. They said it was the worst experience in their professional lives.”\n\n\tAt the Swedish festival, Holland – known for “Europa Europa,” “The Secret Garden,” “Washington Square” or “Total Eclipse,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio – opened up about her challenging post-war childhood, which shaped her. \n\n\t“The experiences of my parents were very intense. The trauma they lived through marked them forever. It also marked me somehow,” she said. \n\n\t“I was a witness to their weakness and to their strength, to their vitality and their depression, and it certainly made me more mature and tolerant. I understood I can’t expect people to always be flawless and strong and that I can’t really count on them.”\n\n\tGrowing up amid the destruction in Warsaw – “the ruins were my playground” – made her sensitive to her surroundings. Later, her father died in mysterious circumstances. \n\n\t“He was very disappointed when the truth about Stalin’s crimes became public, and he became a party dissident. In 1961 he was arrested, and he committed suicide during the investigation.”\n\n\tHolland’s international career began when she left Poland to promote her film “Provincial Actors.” When martial law was imposed in 1981, she was in Sweden. Initially reluctant to talk about the situation – which is also at the center of her daughter Kasia Adamik’s film “Winter of the Crow” – she later changed her mind. \n\n\t“I was afraid it’d cost me too much. Then a Swedish journalist I knew hugged me and said: ‘Our poor Poland.’ I thought: ‘Fuck. That guy is crying, and I am Polish! I have to fight for my country’.”\n\n\tStill, Holland doesn’t dwell on the past – or past successes – too much. What’s the film she’s most satisfied with?\n\t\n\n\t“Always the last.” \n\n\tAlthough the power of cinema has been “evaporating” since the 1980s, she’s not giving up just yet. \n\n\t“Now, when the world has become complicated and dangerous again, maybe it’s when a new generation of the filmmakers will emerge. And make people go to the cinema again to have the collective experience of receiving important images and important messages,” she said. \n\n\t“Maybe we will reach some kind of a wall or an abyss, and if we survive, there will be a resurrection of a new world with new values. After every disaster in human history, something good has come out of it. If we survive as a planet, the next step will be the new progress. That is my optimism.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe family drama “Take Me Home” is a not an easy watch and (arguably harder than it needs to be). Yet, how could a film that takes such an intimate look at the fraying healthcare net through the story of a woman with a cognitive disability and her declining parents be otherwise? And yet, writer-director Liz Sargent’s debut feature — which premiered in the U.S. Dramatic competition at the Sundance Film Festival and won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award — is suffused with love: the director’s love for her own sibling, who stars in the film, but also the tenacious and so often under-appreciated love of caregiving.\n\t\n\n\tThat the trio’s affection often expresses itself in frustrated shouts, sighed exasperation or muted defeat, has become part of the bargain for 38-year-old Anna, who takes care of and is cared for by her parents (Victor Slezak as Dad and Marceline Hugot as Mom).\n\n\n\tWhen we enter their cramped Florida home, this wee mutual aid society of three is in a brewing crisis. Acknowledging this on the parents’ part would signal a defeat. And, though able to navigate a great deal of the daily routine, Anna has gaps that will widen as her parents’ needs become more demanding.\n\n\t“What are we doing today, Mom?” Anna asks as her mother sits in the bathtub on a stool shampooing her daughter’s hair. “We’re doing it,” she replies. She then leans on Anna in an unsteady effort to get over the bathtub rim. Yes, their lives have become this circumscribed. Later, a trip to the grocery store finds Dad staring at shelves of plastic-wrapped bread loaves. While this moment might offer a commentary on the weird plenty of the marketplace, Anna senses her father is lost an increasing haze and intervenes.\n\t\n\n\tWhen in doubt, Anna’s likely to speed-dial her sister, Emily. Mom did the same thing and it’s clear that there’s been hurt feelings. As the sister who relocated to Brooklyn two years earlier, Ali Ahn carries the burden of being the one who escaped. We can hear in her voice, or see on a video call, that she worries about being dragged back in.\n\n\tA tragedy forces her home, where the depth of familial decline startles and scares her. The looming challenges mute the grief. There’s so much to be done: financials, Social Security, disability and Medicaid benefits. Welcome to an increasingly common situation in which health concerns are swamped by economics. Call it “hanging on by a thread,” where any unexpected — or expected but unaffordable — setback will snip that thread.\n\n\tIt’s a lot, and Emily’s got a job back in New York that she not only will need to return to but wants to return to.\n\n\tEarly in “Take Me Home,” we learn that when they were children, Emily adored Anna. Those days aren’t gone but they’ve changed as one has gone into the world and the other has stayed at home. Anna, who lives in the now in many ways, doesn’t appear to feel resentment about this; Emily clearly has tinges of guilt. “Why did you adopt someone with a disability?” she asks her father.\n\n\tWhen Anna heads over to the neighbor’s home, we learn that she hankers for social interaction. The viewer might wonder if the scene of Anna interacting with neighbor James (Shane Harper) and his drinking buddies, who are hanging out on lawn chairs in the drive, elicits more anxiety for her safety than the director intended. Or is this another example of how Anna’s capable and how her parents’ decisions have perhaps made her less equipped and more vulnerable in the world?\n\n\tWhen Emily tells their father that they need to seek alternative living situations for him and Anna, he balks. On his own, he’ll learn just how out of reach something safe and suitable might be. Anna and Emily are the Korean adoptees of white parents. So are the director and her sister, but this is not an autobiography. “Take Me Home” is instead a deeply felt examination of the challenges so many face when familial love is swamped by economic reality. The director puts a lot on her characters’ shoulders to illustrate how unsupported and isolated illness and disability can be. She also tries to imagine an out. Note to us all: It’s not as sunny as it seems.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe cast of “Schitt’s Creek” are mourning the loss of Catherine O’Hara, who died Jan. 30 following a brief illness. She was 71. \n\n\tO’Hara portrayed exuberant matriach Moira Rose on the Canadian sitcom from 2015 to 2020, starring alongside Eugene Levy as Johnny Rose, Dan Levy as David Rose and Annie Murphy as Alexis Rose. The Emmy-winning series was created by Eugene Levy and Dan Levy. \n\n\n\tDan Levy wrote on Instagram, “What a gift to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O’Hara’s brilliance for all those years. Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family. It’s hard to imagine a world without her in it. I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke and every member of her big, beautiful family.”\n\t\n\n\tLater on Friday, Eugene Levy issued a statement. “Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today,” Levy wrote. “I had the honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O’Hara for over fifty years. From our beginnings on the Second City stage, to SCTV, to the movies we did with Chris Guest, to our six glorious years on ‘Schitt’s Creek,’ I cherished our working relationship, but most of all our friendship. And I will miss her. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke and the entire O’Hara family.” \n\n\n\tIn “Schitt’s Creek,” the once-affluent Rose family falls into financial ruin and must move to the eponymous small town. The series also starred Emily Hampshire, Jennifer Robertson, Noah Reid, Sarah Levy and Chris Elliott. \n\t\n\n\tRobertson told USA Today, “I am deeply saddened to hear we have lost Catherine. Being in Catherine O’Hara’s orbit was a beautiful, magical gift. She was absolute star who never understood why people made such a fuss about her. Her passing is a loss for everyone who knew and loved her. My deepest condolences to Bo, her sons, and the O’Hara family.”\n\n\tElliott, who played Roland Schitt, said in a statement to USA Today, “Working with her and Eugene was a dream come true for me – made all the more special because Catherine was such a warm hearted, generous and humble human being. I will always remember the laughs we shared on screen and off, and I’ll never forget our fun shopping spree at Joe Fresh.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCatherine O’Hara, Annie Murphy, Eugene Levy and Dan Levy in “Schitt’s Creek.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPop TV\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“We are devastated to learn of the passing of Catherine O’Hara, a beloved Canadian icon whose brilliance lit up screens and stages around the world. From SCTV and Home Alone to her unforgettable portrayal of Moira Rose in Schitt’s Creek, Catherine brought unmatched talent and a rare and radiant spirit to everything she touched,” CBC Television, which produced “Schitt’s Creek,” said in a statement. “With her passing, a light has gone out. We send our heartfelt condolences to Catherine’s family and friends. She will be forever missed.” \n\n\tDuring the show’s six-season run, O’Hara received a Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, SAG-AFTRA’s Actor Award, TCA Award and Critics Choice Award for her performance as Moira. “A proudly out-of-touch lady of leisure forced to rub elbows with the hoi polloi, Moira’s impractical outfits and fish-out-of-water frenzy helped crystallize the comedic contrast that was the series’ creative engine,” Variety TV critic Alison Herman wrote in her tribute piece.\n\n\tPrior to “Schitt’s Creek,” O’Hara and Eugene Levy collaborated on multiple mockumentary films with Christopher Guest, including “For Your Consideration,” “Best in Show, “Waiting for Guffman” and “A Mighty Wind.” \n\n\t“I am devastated. We have lost one of the comic giants of our age,” Guest said of O’Hara in a statement. “I send my love to her family.”\n\n\tO’Hara’s other notable roles include Kate McCallister in the first two “Home Alone” movies, Sally and Shock in the 1993 animated classic “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” and Delia Deetz in Tim Burton’s “Beetlejuice” films. \n\t\n\n\tSee more tributes to O’Hara here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for Sam Raimi‘s “Send Help,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\t“Send Help,” Sam Raimi’s twisty thriller written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift and in theaters Friday via 20th Century Studios, is filled with shocking moments. Too scared to catch the new Raimi project on the big screen? Far too busy seeing “Melania” again and again? Keep reading to break down all of the big moments of “Send Help.”\n\t\n\n\tRachel McAdams stars as Linda Liddle, who works at a company where the new nepo baby CEO, Bradley Preston (Dylan O’Brien), doesn’t know or care that she’s been promised a VP position by his late father. While she’s brilliant with numbers, he gives the job to his douchey college buddy and condescendingly asks her to come with them on an international trip to help do work while the guys golf.\n\n\n\tUnfortunately, the private plane goes down and Linda and Bradley are the only survivors, getting swept away to a deserted island. Bradley is in luck, as Linda is a devoted “Survivor” fan and loves reading adventure books, so she is amazingly proficient at building shelter, fire and increasingly complex items like hats and backpacks. \n\n\tYet while Linda helps Bradley, as his leg is injured and he’s not outdoorsy, he is rude and bossy to her, bringing his attitude from the office to outdoor life. At one point, Linda abandons him, and Bradley quickly realizes he needs her to survive. He apologizes, and they are peaceful with each other for a while.\n\n\tYet their niceties don’t last. Linda, more mobile than Bradley, explores the island and notices that boats come close on occasion. But she’s enjoying her time as a leader on the island, so she keeps this information to herself. \n\t\n\n\tAlthough Bradley acts increasingly warm to Linda, he soon begins to believe she doesn’t want them to get rescued. So he makes a dinner for her but includes poisonous berries, which temporarily incapacitate her. He uses the opportunity to try to escape on a homemade raft, which almost immediately kills him, and Linda has to save him again. She then takes control back by feeding Bradley a poisonous fish, which paralyzes him but keeps his mind and eyes clear. She then pretends to castrate him, but was only killing a rat, and uses the opportunity to let him know that she is not to be trifled with.\n\n\tOne day, weeks after the plane crash, Linda is spotted while walking through the woods by Bradley’s fiancée, Zuri (Edyll Ismail), who hired a private guide to find him and any other survivors. Yet Zuri trips off of a winding mountain trail, and Linda attacks the private guide while he’s trying to save her, sending both to fall to their death.\n\n\tSoon after, Bradley sees Zuri’s hand (complete with an engagement ring on the finger) popping out of the surf and believes that Linda killed her. The two begin brawling, and Bradley starts running away to a part of the island Linda advised against, citing poisonous plants. But he realizes that there’s actually a huge mansion there, which was where the boats had been coming to and from. \n\n\tLinda catches up to him and reveals that she’s been getting supplies from the house — which is owned by a billionaire who is never around — for weeks. Bradley tries to get the upper hand and kill her, yet Linda grabs a shotgun from the home and aims it at him.\n\n\tAt this point, Bradley begs for his life, saying he’s a changed man and telling Linda he loves her. But she doesn’t buy it, and he scrambles to get the gun. He finds it empty when he points it at her, at which point Linda beats him to death with a golf club.\n\n\tCut to one year later, where Linda is playing a celebrity golf game and telling reporters about how thrilled she is that the memoir she wrote about her escape is going to be made into a movie. She says she’s also writing a self-help book, and drives away in a gorgeous car, living the good life as the credits roll.\n\n\tNow that you know the plot, watch a trailer for “Send Help” below.\n\n\n\n",

But I only know what to do because I see other people in my life doing good things, like listening to trans people who need representation, and money for health care and rent, and I think it’s an artist’s and anyone who has money’s duty to give it away.”\nCheck out photos from the Resonator Awards and all of this week’s celebrity-filled Grammy events and parties

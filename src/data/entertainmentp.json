    "body": "\n\tTom Noonan, an actor and director whose imposing presence made him one of Hollywood’s most memorable screen villains, died on Feb. 14. He was 74.\n\n\tHis death was announced online by actress Karen Sillas, a longtime friend and collaborator, and Fred Dekker, who directed Noonan in “The Monster Squad.” Variety has also reached out to Noonan’s representatives. No cause of death was immediately disclosed.\n\n\n\tBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Noonan began his career in the late 1970s and early 1980s with small film and theater roles, including an appearance in “Heaven’s Gate.” His breakout came with “Manhunter,” after which he became a sought-after character actor.\n\t\n\n\tOften described by fans and filmmakers as the “perfect bad guy,” Noonan carved out a singular career playing outsiders, monsters and deeply unsettling antagonists. He was best known for portraying the serial killer Francis Dollarhyde in “Manhunter,” director Michael Mann’s adaptation of Thomas Harris’ novel “Red Dragon.” He later embraced cult status as Cain, the drug-fueled cult leader who becomes the mechanized villain RoboCain in “RoboCop 2.”\n\n\tHis genre work extended to fan favorites including “The Monster Squad,” in which he portrayed Frankenstein’s Monster, and “Last Action Hero,” where his turn as the slasher villain The Ripper left a lasting impression on younger audiences. His film résumé also included “Heat,” “The House of the Devil” and “12 Monkeys,” along with television appearances on “The X-Files” and “CSI.”\n\n\tBeyond acting, Noonan was a respected playwright and director. He wrote and directed “What Happened Was…,” first staged off-Broadway in the early 1990s before being adapted into a critically praised independent film. Sillas, who starred in both versions, credited the project as a defining moment in her career.\n\t\n\n\t“Working with him was a turning point in my life as an actor,” she wrote in a tribute shared on social media. “What a privilege — and crazy fun — it was to call him my friend to the end.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCrime remains king when it comes to first-run original scripted TV series in Western Europe, where original content is still a driving force, particularly in Germany, according to the latest data from Ampere Analysis presented by executive director Guy Bisson on Monday at the opening session of the Berlin Series Market.\n\n\tAlso discussing the use of IP and original material in developing new shows were Johannes Jensen, head of scripted and business at French giant Banijay Entertainment; Michele Wolkoff, creative director at the London and L.A.-based The Ink Factory; Alex Medeiros, head of content and fiction at Brazil’s Globoplay and Globo Filmes; and Helene Aurø, sales and marketing director at Denmark’s Reinvent Yellow.\n\t\n\n\tThe participants were largely in agreement that even when adapting IP, it’s usually necessary to make tweaks and changes to better update or modernize it for today’s audiences.\n\n\n\t“It’s interesting to see that originality is driving the business, although it’s a very risk-averse market,” Jensen said. “For us, I think we need both – that’s something we are focusing on.”\n\n\tHe added that while adapting a book or remaking a film “is an easier first step,” he pointed out that things are changing.\n\n\t“The market has changed rapidly over the last years. Previously, you could have the book and then you could go pitch it, and then you would get the commission,” Jensen explained. “Today it’s all about, ‘So what’s your take on this? Why should we bring this old story back now? What’s the new version of it?’\n\t\n\n\tYou now have to do the same work with a known IP as you would in creating original material, otherwise it won’t sell, he stressed. “So for us it’s a balance.”\n\n\tJensen pointed to last year’s Netflix show “The Gardener,” from Spanish subsidiary DLO Producciones, and “Peaky Blinders,” from Caryn Mandabach Productions and Tiger Aspect, both group labels, as two original works that became major hits.\n\n\t“For us, it’s like today’s originals are tomorrow’s IP,” he added. “So we need to focus on creating and getting new originals in.”\n\n\tThe Ink Factory similarly seeks to find new angles in adapting the works of John le Carré.\n\n\t“The adaptation has a different challenge,” said Wolkoff, noting that a straightforward take on a well-known does not necessarily lead to success. The challenge is finding a way to tell a good story that resonates today, she added. “We’re not looking for people who can just take the book and adapt it in a very direct way. We need someone who comes to it with voice and perspective.\n\n\t“The thing about le Carré’s novels that we always talk about is underneath, though he wrote in espionage, and that was the genre, he was writing about the human condition. He was writing about people’s relationships. Most of his characters reflect a relationship with his father. And so you’ve got fathers and sons, you’ve got the question of institutions and moral corruption, and the choices we make: How far do we go? Do we cross moral lines?”\n\n\tWhile such themes remain relevant to today’s audiences, period stories are becoming less interesting for viewers, she noted.\n\n\t“Buyers right now don’t really want period and what’s great about the le Carré novels is that they feel timeless when we’re looking at updating them because of thematics that underscore the storytelling. So at the end of the day, it’s always about good storytelling, and whether it’s an original story or IP, you still need to find those character elements that are driving the narrative.”\n\n\tPeriod works are also proving tough for Reinvent Yellow. When it comes to series, Aurø said: “It’s mainly crime and thrillers, and it can be crime in different ways, but it’s very difficult for us to sell period pieces, even going back just to the ’70s or ’80s can be really difficult.”\n\t\n\n\tWith regard to films, horror and action remain popular genres despite slightly waning demand for the former, she stressed.  \n\n\t“A few years ago, the demand was higher, or I think there were less horror films and thrillers on the market,” Aurø said. “What we’re seeing now is actually that the prices are dropping, but there is still quite a high demand, so when we talk about the films that we distribute, it’s disaster, action, thriller and horror. That’s really what we hear that the buyers are looking for from us.”\n\n\tFor Globoplay and Globo Filmes, with their focus on the domestic Brazilian market, the strategy is a little different, Medeiros explained.\n\n\t“We just sell our shows internationally, but the language is one of the barriers that we face.”\n\n\tWhile stressing that Globo shows are very well liked around the world, Medeiros pointed out that the group is not really in the same game. “We make shows to sell; we make shows to drive subscription in Brazil — so that’s like our key thing.”\n\n\tMedeiros is currently working on half a dozen shows that are all original IP and Brazil-set stories. “As far as Globoplay originals, we stand at roughly the 75% original idea mark.”\n\n\tIn the past five years, Medeiros has launched 40 series, 30 of which have been originals.\n\n\tAt the same time, he noted that the company has enjoyed major success with recent IP-based works, such as Walter Salles Oscar-winning 2024 adaptation of Marcelo Rubens Paiva’s 2015 memoir, “I’m Still Here.”\n\n\tLooking forward, Medeiros predicted crime would remain a hot topic.\n\n\t“I think crime is always going to be on that screen, like forever. It’s the genre that travels the most, everyone knows that. And there’s crime everywhere. So yeah, I don’t think that’s going to die anytime soon. There are variations — sometimes there’s more true crime, sometimes there’s more procedural, sometimes it’s existing IP.”\n\n\tMedeiros stressed, however, that the shows that are winning awards are those that stand out, that have their own identities. “I think people really have a taste for things that stand out right now.”\n\n\tRegardless of whether they’re based on IP or not, shows that are currently attracting big audiences are “very, very challenging and daring in terms of structure, in terms of casting.”\n\t\n\n\tAs an example, Medeiros pointed to “Emergency 53,” a new Globoplay action-driven medical show that follows a young ambulance crew that offers a new take on a well-established genre. “It’s not an ER show; it’s not a procedural show; it’s not a romance show … it’s an action show that happens to be a medical show.”\n\n\t“Emergency 53” is also one of 20 new shows that unspooled in this year’s Berlinale Series Market Selects section.\n",

    "body": "\n\tShia LaBeouf wrote “Free me” on his X account Wednesday morning, one day after his arrest over an alleged physical altercation during Mardis Gras in New Orleans.\n\n\tThe “Transformers” actor was involved in an incident early Tuesday outside a bar in the French Quarter, during which he allegedly assaulted two men. According to a statement from the New Orleans Police Department shared with Variety, LaBeouf was “reportedly causing a disturbance and becoming increasing[ly] aggressive” at a business on Royal Street.\n\t\n\n\t“Once removed from the building, the victim reported being struck by LaBeouf, who used his closed fists on the victim several times,” the department said.\n\n\n\tAfter briefly leaving, LaBeouf returned and acted “even more aggressive.” Police added, “Multiple people attempted to hold him down — he was eventually let up in hopes that he would leave — but he reportedly again struck the same victim with closed fists to the victim’s upper body.” \n\n\tThe statement noted that LaBeouf allegedly assaulted another individual by “punching him in the nose.” \n\n\tLaBeouf is facing two charges of simple battery. He was released from jail in New Orleans on Tuesday, and a pretrial hearing is scheduled for March 19.\n\n\tLaBeouf has had a history of erratic behavior and prior legal issues, including a lawsuit filed against him by musician FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit was settled in July of last year.\n\n\tIn an earlier incident, LaBeouf was ordered by a court to attend rehab after his 2017 arrest in Georgia on charges of public intoxication and disorderly conduct.\n\t\n\n\tIn 2025, LaBeouf appeared in Leo Lewis O’Neil’s documentary “Slauson Rec,” which followed the actor as he leads an experimental theater company. The film, which screened at the Cannes Film Festival, shows LaBeouf berating actors and crew members, instigating a fistfight and engaging in other aggressive behavior.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMargaret Cho, Megan Stalter and Mae Martin will receive the Icon Award, the Vanguard Award and the Groundbreaker Award, respectively, at the 14th Annual Queerties Awards, presented by leading LGBTQ+ entertainment news site Queerty. Dedicated to honoring excellence in queer media and culture, the ceremony will be held on March 10 at The Avalon Hollywood in Los Angeles. \n\n\tCho, Stalter and Martin have each played a key role in the evolution of LGBTQ+ comedy excellence, shaping elements of queer culture for past, present and future generations. In the ‘90s, Cho broke barriers as a queer woman in entertainment; Stalter’s presence has captivated audiences online and off; Martin’s work has redefined creative boundaries across film, television and stand-up. \n\t\n\n\tCho will receive the Icon Award for her impactful, lifelong career as a comedian, actor and activist. She first broke barriers with her ABC sitcom “All-American Girl” in 1994, which made Cho one of the first Asian American women to star in a primetime network sitcom. When not entertaining, Cho is an anti-racism, anti-bullying and gay rights activist, and currently is touring her “Choligarchy” stand-up comedy show, bringing laughter and advocacy to audiences worldwide. \n\n\n\tThe recipient of the Vanguard Award, Stalter will be recognized as a leader in comedy, acting and writing. As a stand-up comedian, Stalter has become known for her inventive character work and sketch work, with a fresh, fearless approach that has established her as one of the most promising talents of her generation. She also recently starred in Netflix’s “Too Much,” created by Lena Dunham. \n\t\n\n\tMartin will receive the Groundbreaker Award for their work as a writer, comedian, musician and actor telling authentic and personal stories. Most recently, Martin created, co-showran, starred in, wrote for, and executive produced the Netflix limited series “Wayward,” which debuted as the platform’s most-watched TV series globally with 8.2 million views in its first week. The comedian also co-hosts the podcast “Handsome” and released a debut album last year. \n\n\t“The Queerties has always been about celebrating the voices that inspire us, challenge us, and make us proud,” said Scott Gatz, CEO of Q.Digital, Queerty’s parent company. “Margaret, Megan, and Mae embody the spirit of this event. They are fearless performers who use comedy not just to entertain, but to create space for queer joy, authenticity, and connection. We’re honored to celebrate their incredible contributions to our community.” \n\n\tTrixie Mattel will host the awards, which will stream exclusively on WOW Presents Plus, World of Wonder’s owned and operated streaming service, beginning March 19. Tickets for the live event are on sale now here.\n",

In the years in between, the actor also directed “Um Ano Inesquecível – Outono” and the documentary “Bando, A Movie Of.” Brazilian banner ELO Studios, which produced and distributed “Executive Order,” has boarded the project. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEmmy-nominated Ramos is one of Brazil’s leading creative voices, with a decades-long illustrious career in film, television and theater. The actor starred in seminal Brazilian films of the early 2000s, most notably Karim Aïnouz’s “Madame Satã” and Héctor Babenco’s “Carandiru.” Ramos broke out into the scene in Salvador alongside best friend and frequent collaborator Wagner Moura, who recently became Brazil’s first-ever best actor Oscar nominee for his performance in Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent.”\n\n\n\tRamos will also star in “Mais Que Amigos,” which finds the still undescribed pair of friends in a decisive moment of their lives and careers. The trip they decide to embark on becomes a journey of political, musical and existential reflection. Ramos and Machado aim to “transcend the biographical to craft a sensitive manifesto about a profound Brazil where popular culture and poetry coexist as means of resistance and beauty.”\n\t\n\n\t“I am very happy to direct my fourth film and reaffirm my partnership with ELO,” said Ramos. “Especially because my film will be in direct dialogue with this moment where Brazilian cinema is celebrating its identity and language by telling a story that takes place in our country.”\n\n\tBriefly speaking with Variety from a very busy Berlin, Ramos added that he yearns to “make a film about strong, extreme emotions.” By extreme, the director means not only in terms of the deep investigations surrounding his two characters but also in how the film portrays “the unlikely friendship between two very different people, during a historical period when a specific type of Brazil was being born.”\n\n\t“This trip across the Northeast of that time will uncover foundational elements of our country of today, also allowing me to talk about how art moves our lives, whether we work with or not,” he added.\n\n\tELO Studios CEO Sabrina Nudeliman Wagon believes “Mais Que Amigos” reinforces the studio’s commitment to “powerful and sensitive” narratives. “We worked with Lázaro in 2022 and are very happy to produce such a special project. Lázaro brings an irrefutable truth in his work and being able to follow the development process so closely has been an honor. ‘Mais Que Amigos’ will portray a Brazil that many are not aware of, but that is the cultural foundation of our country.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tNational news events have a way of minting public figures out of people who had not spent their lives expecting the spotlight. This can cut in either direction: For better, as when a person toiling in obscurity suddenly meets their moment, or for worse. And, for the millions following the Nancy Guthrie case, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has proven unready for the tests he’s faced.\n\n\tNanos makes headlines for reasons beyond his being the conduit of whatever paltry information exists about Guthrie’s whereabouts. Tasked with overseeing the local law enforcement response to the apparent kidnapping of news anchor Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nanos has met a charged situation with infelicitous choices of what words to use and what tone to take. \n\t\n\n\tFor instance, in a recent interview with the New York Times, Nanos described his investigation — notably marked by the detention of an apparently unrelated delivery driver, who was later set free — as “exhausting, these ups and downs.” He then said that Nancy Guthrie would inevitably be found, but that “maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now” when that discovery will happen. \n\n\n\tThe case, seen from the outside, is legitimately baffling; the kidnapper or kidnappers seems to have entirely obscure motives (given that Savannah Guthrie’s public offer to pay ransom has gone effectively unacknowledged). But Nanos cannot help but telegraph how little, weeks in, law enforcement has been able to figure out about the identity of Nancy Guthrie’s captor or captors. (A sheriff confident in his information might not suggest that an investigation would take, well, years.) In responding to criticism, too, Nanos has tended to center himself and his own feelings; while he surely must be exhausted, a more circumspect public servant might take a beat and wonder how much more exhausted the Guthrie family must be. And, in a baffling outburst last week, Nanos took on his critics head-on, declaring: “Now, you want to get picky that the sheriff speaks funny or talks off the cuff, or you can call him a buffoon or Barney Fife or whatever you want to call him. The haters are going to hate, but my local media, you included, know me. You know what I’m about, and you know I’ve always been a pretty much open book. You ask me a question, I’m going to answer it. That’s just the way it is.”\n\t\n\n\tThe inability of the local police to make any headway in this case has been noticeable as the case has drawn on, but those commenting on it are not always accusing Nanos of being a “buffoon”; that he hears it that way suggests a me-first approach that, if nothing else, is a bad look. But then, Nanos breaking his silence about his own communication style was nothing new: Early in the investigation, he told reporters, “I’m not used to everyone hanging onto my every word and then holding me accountable for what I say.” It is fair to consider that Nanos had never expected to be under a national spotlight, but, really: Perhaps he ought to get used to it. Among Nanos’ many jobs is to preserve the public’s trust that this crime is being competently and thoroughly investigated. He seems instead to alternately be spilling inadvertently revealing information — as in his declaration that Savannah Guthrie’s public plea for help solving the case generated “4,500 more leads,” which suggested just how scattered the investigation is — or attempting to clean up his own comments and making everything worse. Why does a sheriff trying to crack a challenging case even have time to address “the haters”?\n\n\tThe Nancy Guthrie case has been a painful media spectacle for many reasons, among them the inescapable fact of Savannah Guthrie’s particular brand of celebrity. A figure whose stock-in-trade has been a sunny, amiable approach to morning conversation — and a devoutness that manifests in the form of optimism — has been brought to the point of pleading via Instagram video for her mother’s safe return. Savannah Guthrie’s videos, difficult to watch for how much they show a familiar figure at the absolute end of her rope, present a person who is at every turn decentering herself. This isn’t, for the anchor, about her fame or notoriety or the years she’s spent on TV; it’s about her mom. It might not materially affect the case, but might be a show of a grace that’s too rare in an increasingly blunt age, if only the sheriff overseeing the case took a similar approach. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” was blocked on Monday by CBS from broadcasting its interview with Texas State Rep. James Talarico — fearing retribution from the FCC. So, instead the conversation was posted on YouTube and other social media platforms, where at last count, the clip had been viewed more than 5.3 million times. Talarico also revealed on X that his campaign raised $2.5 million in the 24 hours after Colbert revealed he was barred from airing the interview.\n\t\n\n\tThat’s an astounding number for a video that has been up for less than 48 hours — and already puts it among the top political interviews that have ever been posted by “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” since its launch in 2015. It’s also easily the most-watched YouTube clip so far this year for “The Late Show” — and its most-watched Colbert clip since one in September, where the host celebrated the return of fellow host Jimmy Kimmel after his own battle with his parent network (ABC) and the FCC.\n\n\n\tAs of Wednesday morning, the Talarico interview — which can be found here — has been viewed X.X million times on YouTube, 4 million views on TikTok and 400,000 likes on Instagram. What’s remarkable is that any other Colbert “Late Show” political interviews that have higher numbers were posted prior to 2019. Those clips have had several years of cumulative traffic, compared to the mere days that the Talarico clip has had.\n\n\tThe Talarico clip racked up those numbers even though Colbert noted the network would not allow him to share a URL or QR code directing viewers there.\n\n\tIronically, many YouTube commenters on the clip noted that they had never heard of Talarico, and wouldn’t have sought out an interview with a mostly unknown politician, until CBS blocked Colbert from airing the chat on his broadcast. “Not gonna lie, I probably woulda skipped this if CBS and FCC hadn’t tried to ban it,” wrote one viewer. Said another: “The FCC and CBS brought this interview to my attention.”\n\t\n\n\tColbert’s most-watched “The Late Show” political interview of all time is with then-candidate Donald Trump on Sept. 23, 2015, which now boasts 17.85 million views. After that is a chat with President Barack Obama on Oct. 18, 2016 (14.86 million) and then two with then-New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (9.85 million on Sept. 27, 2018, and 8.26 million on Nov. 19, 2019). A March 31, 2018, interview with former President Jimmy Carter has accumulated 8.14 million views; an April 17, 2018, talk with then-FBI director James Comey earned 7.25 million views; and a Nov. 13, 2017 conversation with then-former Vice President Joe Biden has attracted 6.51 million views.\n\n\tOn Monday’s “The Late Show,” Colbert told his audience that CBS lawyers forbade them from including an interview with Rep. Talarico, a Democratic candidate for Senate in Texas, because of FCC’s “equal time” rule — which requires broadcast networks to provide opposing political candidates equivalent airtime. News and talk shows have traditionally been exempt from “equal time” demands, but FCC chair Brendan Carr has suggested the exemption should no longer apply to programs he characterized as being “motivated by partisan purposes.” But he has only threatened to aggressively go after shows that skew to the left, such as “The View” and late night talk, for “equal time” violations, while allowing right-skewing outlets like talk radio to proceed without any similar enforcement. \n\n\tColbert noted that Carr had yet to eliminate the “equal time” exception for talk, but that CBS was “unilaterally enforcing it as if he had.” He said he wasn’t even allowed to show a photo of Talarico on screen.\n\n\tOn Tuesday, CBS said in a statement that “‘The Late Show’ was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico. The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. ‘The Late Show’ decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”\n\n\tThen, on Tuesday’s “The Late Show,” Colbert took the Eye network to task: “Without ever talking to me, the corporation put out this press release,” Colbert said, presenting the statement to the audience on a sheet of paper. “This statement, it’s a surprisingly small piece of paper considering how many butts it’s trying to cover.”\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Hollywood Bowl has unveiled the lineup for its 2026 summer season, and a key touchstone will be a week in August celebrating Gustuvo Dudamel’s 17th and last season as music and artistic director of the LA Phil — including a departure from strictly classical programming as the conductor shares the stage for a joint gig with Foo Fighters on Aug. 22.\n\n\tSt. Vincent will also do a symphonic show, performing with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, and the Beach Boys will be joined by that same orchestra for the traditional three-night July Fourth Fireworks Spectacular. OneRepublic will be on board for the September Fireworks finale, although that is not the actual last night of the summer season; Jon Batiste will be the one actually bringing down the curtain on Bowl-produced programming on Sept. 27.\n\t\n\n\tTwo ninetysomething artists who perform like they’re in their prime will take the Bowl stage: Herb Alpert, who will bring the Tijuana Brass revival that recently sold out two nights at the Dolby to the outdoor stage up the hill, and blues icon Buddy Guy, whose star is bigger than ever thanks to “Sinners.”\n\n\n\tJuneteenth shows have become a staple of Bowl programming in recent years, and this year, Chance the Rapper will lead that celebration. The Roots will bring the west coast version of their Roots Picnic to the Bowl for the third year in a row.\n\n\tPop, rock, R&B and reggae performers coming to the historic stage this summer include ZZ Top with Cheap Trick, Smokey Robinson with Gladys Knight, Ziggy Marley with Burning Spear, Al Green, Squeeze with Adam Ant and the English Beat, Bob Moses and Cannons, and Blues Traveler with the Gin Blossoms and Spin Doctors.\n\t\n\n\tJazz-oriented programming gets off to a big start June 13-14 with the Blue Note Jazz Festival, hosted by Arsenio Hall and featuring Patti LaBelle, Wyclef Jean, Robert Glasper, Samara Joy, Gregory Porter and others. Wynton Marsalis will lead a Jazz at Lincoln Center program in September, and Herbie Hancock will celebrate the centennial of Miles Davis in August.\n\n\tThe movie screen will be kept in as much use as ever at the Bowl, whether for tributes to composers or filmmakers or for full-on live-to-picture film screenings. “Music from the Films of Wes Anderson” will take over the Bowl for three nights in July, followed by a three-night tribute to Studio Ghibli stalwart Joe Hisaishi. Will John Williams get his traditional three-night salute in September? Of course. Films showing in full with live orchestral accompaniment include “Amadeus,” “How to Train Your Dragon” and “Top Gun: Maverick.” The audience will provide the live accompaniment, meanwhile, for the annual “Sound of Music” sing-along in September.\n\n\tTickets for the summer season will be available online at hollywoodbowl.com or via phone at 323-850-2000 on these dates:\n\n\t● New subscriptions available today, Wednesday, February 18, at 10AM\n\n\t● Group sales for select concerts begin today, Wednesday, February 18, at 10AM\n\n\t● Blue Note Jazz Festival two day passes on sale today, Wednesday, February 18, at 10AM\n\n\t● The Roots Picnic Experience tickets are currently on sale.\n\n\t● Bob Moses and Cannons tickets go on sale Friday, February 20, at 10AM\n\n\t● “Create Your Own” packages available March 24, at 10AM\n\n\t● The Hollywood Bowl Box Office opens for single-show ticket sales May 5, at 10AM\n\n\tThe LA Phil’s list of summer programming does not include outside events exclusively produced by Live Nation-Hewitt Silva. Some of those concerts that have already been announced include Paul Simon, Rod Stewart, My Chemical Romance, Andrea Bocelli, Jack Johnson, Pitbull, “The Last Five Years” with Ben Platt and Rachel Zegler, Lewis Capaldi, several Netflix is a Joke events (Shane Gillis, Night of Too Many Stars, John Mulaney, FEID and Marcello Hernández), Bright Eyes, the Human League, John Mellencamp, Santana/the Doobie Brothers, the Black Crowes/Tedeschi Trucks Band and Mac DeMarco.\n\n\tHere is a full chronological list of this summer’s LA Phil-produced offerings:\n\n\tJUNE\n\n\tBlue Note Jazz FestivalSaturday, June 13, 6PMSunday, June 14, 6PMPatti LaBelleWyclef JeanGregory PorterSamara JoyYussef DayesCimafunkRobert Glasper presents R+R=NOW featuring Terrace Martin, Chief Adjuah, Derrick Hodge, Justin Tyson,and Taylor McFerrinKokorokoElena PinderhughesHerbie Hancock Institute of Jazz Performance Ensemble at UCLALAUSD Beyond the Bell All-City Jazz Big BandLA County High School for the Arts BandArsenio Hall, host\n\n\tJuneteenth with Chance The RapperFriday, June 19, 8PM\n\n\tOpening Night: The Best of BroadwaySaturday, June 20, 8PMHollywood Bowl OrchestraThomas Wilkins, conductorGuest vocalists to be announced\n\n\tReggae Night XXIVSunday, June 21, 7PMKCRW FestivalZiggy MarleyBurning SpearZuri Marley, DJ\n\n\tA Roots Picnic ExperienceA Great Night in Hip-HopSaturday, June 27, 7:30PMThe RootsNasT.I.Bun BDe La Soul\n\n\tJULY\n\n\tJuly Fourth Fireworks Spectacular with The Beach Boyswith Special Guest John StamosThursday, July 2, 7:30PMFriday, July 3, 7:30PMSaturday, July 4, 7:30PMHollywood Bowl OrchestraThomas Wilkins, conductorJohn Stamos, special guest\n\n\tHerb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass & Other DelightsSunday, July 5, 7:30PM\n\n\tWilkins Conducts Bernstein & EllingtonWednesday, July 8, 8PMLos Angeles PhilharmonicThomas Wilkins, conductorValerie COLEMAN Fanfare for Uncommon TimesSTILL Mother and ChildShaina TAUB Suffs Song CycleBERNSTEIN Three Dance Episodes from On the TownELLINGTON Harlem\n\n\tThe Classical World CupThursday, July 9, 8PMLos Angeles PhilharmonicTito Muñoz, conductorRandall Goosby, violinGINASTERA Four Dances from EstanciaBARBER Violin ConcertoAdam SCHOENBERG Art of the Goal (world premiere, LA Phil commission)REVUELTAS SensemayáCOPLAND Billy the Kid\n\n\tMusic from the Films of Wes AndersonFriday, July 10, 8PMSaturday, July 11, 8PMLos Angeles PhilharmonicThomas Wilkins, conductor\n\n\tMusic from the Films of Wes AndersonSunday, July 12, 7PMKCRW Festival\n\n\tTchaikovsky & BeethovenTuesday, July 14, 8PMLos Angeles PhilharmonicCristian Mǎcelaru, conductorLeonidas Kavakos, violinTCHAIKOVSKY Violin ConcertoBEETHOVEN Symphony No. 7\n\n\tSalsa Night: Nathy Peluso & Grupo NicheWednesday, July 15, 8PM\n\t\n\n\tMozart & BrahmsThursday, July 16, 8PMLos Angeles PhilharmonicRoberto Gonzáles-Monjas, conductorMao Fujita, pianoKORNGOLD StraussianaMOZART Piano Concerto No. 19BRAHMS Symphony No. 4\n\n\tLet the Sunshine In: The Music of ’69Friday, July 17, 8PMHollywood Bowl OrchestraTed Sperling, conductorLizzy McAlpineMorgan JamesNoah J.

TMZ has learned.\n      \n    \n          This is the second time Tyler, 20, is in trouble with the law after his son got loose ... he was slapped with a similar citation last year.\n      \n    \n          A watch commander at the Windsor Police Department in Colorado confirmed the latest incident ... and Tyler was cited on a misdemeanor charge of child abuse without injury.\n      \n\n          According to local outlet KUSA-TV, the incident occurred at Rep. Boebert's Colorado home. Boebert told the station she was at an event in the district while Tyler was watching the toddler, who often accompanies Boebert in Washington and around her district.\n      \n    \n          Notably, Boebert's home is near a lake ... but thankfully, \"A kind woman quickly and safely secured [the child], and authorities were called as a precaution,\" Boebert told the outlet.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          While the 2025 incident -- Tyler was charged with misdemeanor child abuse -- led Boebert to downplay the event as \"a miscommunication\" ... this time, she's condemning her son, saying there's \"no excuse\" and that she's \"very frustrated.\"\n      \n    \n          Tyler became a father in June 2023. In 2024, he was charged with 22 counts tied to vehicle break-ins and property theft, including multiple felonies. He later entered a guilty plea to attempted identity theft as part of a plea deal, with other charges dropped, and was put on probation.\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Lauren Boebert\n              \n                          \n                Crime & Arrests\n              \n                          \n                Crime\n              \n                          \n                Politics\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                True Crime\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

Thanks for the great work.\"\n      \n\n          His cause of death has not been released.\n      \n    \n          In 1980, Noonan launched his film acting career in the romantic comedy \"Willie & Phil,\" playing a small role as Man In Park. After that, he took on mainly villainous roles because of his imposing figure, standing 6-foot-5. \n      \n    \n          Noonan played Cain in \"RoboCop2,\" Ripper in \"Last Action Hero,\" Francis Dollarhyde in \"Manhunter,\" and Gary Jackson in \"The Pledge\" ... to name just a few of his wicked parts.\n      \n    \n          He also played Kelso in \"Heat,\" Mr. Ulman in \"The House of the Devil,\" Ray Gullikson in \"The Alphabet Killer,\" and Sammy Barnathan in \"Synecdoche, New York.\"\n      \n    \n          Furthermore, Noonan starred in several notable TV series, including \"The X-Files,\" \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent,\" \"Tales From The Darkside,\" and \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\"\n      \n    \n          Tom was 74.\n      \n    \n          RIP\n      \n      \n              \n            \n              Related articles\n            \n        \n              \n          \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity Death\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

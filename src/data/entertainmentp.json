The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOrwell: 2+2 = 5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Neon\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Documentary Feature Commentary (Updated Nov. 11, 2025): As the documentary race comes into sharper focus with DOC NYC ahead, and the Critics Choice Documentary Awards just announced, it’s clear this year’s lineup is as politically charged and emotionally resonant as ever.\n\n\tAt the top of the field, Geeta Gandbhir’s “The Perfect Neighbor” has established itself as the early frontrunner. Fresh off its CCA triumph — where it claimed best documentary feature, director, editing, archival documentary and best true crime documentary — the Netflix release has cemented its status as both a critical and popular favorite. Gandbhir’s gripping exploration of “stand your ground” laws through police bodycam footage has positioned the film as the kind of urgent, socially conscious storytelling that the branch tends to reward.\n\n\tNot far behind is Laura Poitras’ “Cover-Up,” another Netflix acquisition, and a cerebral and fiercely investigative work examining journalist Seymour Hersh’s lifelong pursuit of truth. Poitras, an Oscar winner for “Citizenfour,” is no stranger to the Academy, and this latest effort could easily return her to the winner’s circle.\n\n\tPBS is in strong contention with Mstyslav Chernov’s “2000 Meters to Andriivka,” a harrowing follow-up to his Oscar-winning “20 Days in Mariupol.” The film’s inclusion in DOC NYC’s Short List section, where 13 of the last 14 Oscar winners have appeared, only strengthens its case.\n\n\tHBO’s “The Alabama Solution,” from Andrew Jarecki, brings another socially conscious angle, examining systemic failures in the American justice system. A CCA winner for best political documentary, helps bolsters its campaign as one of the year’s most urgent entries.\n\n\tApple is betting big on “Come See Me in the Good Light,” a tender and deeply human portrait from director Ryan White and producer Tig Notaro chronicling the love and resilience of two poets facing terminal illness. It continues to build quiet but meaningful momentum after positive receptions that began at Sundance.\n\n\tWatch out for Neon’s “Orwell: 2+2=5,” directed by Raoul Peck and co-produced by Alex Gibney. The philosophical essay film — which won CCA honors for best score and narration — merges historical insight with contemporary urgency, drawing parallels between Orwell’s warnings and today’s modern political doublespeak.\n\n\tAs DOC NYC kicks off its 16th edition, the race for best documentary feature feels a bit wide open. With heavyweights from Netflix, PBS, HBO and Neon all in play, the question may not be which film wins — but which kind of film, Academy voters will choose to honor this year.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited producers are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Apple TV/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Independent Lens\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Brian Hamill \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Films (Documentary Feature)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Bayerische Staatsbibliothek/Bildarchiv\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tSales veteran Pia Patatian has used this year’s American Film Market to launch production and sales banner Noora Films.\n\n\tAlongside unveiling her new company, Patatian has come onboard to handle international rights on alternative period drama “Madfabulous” from BAFTA Cymru winner Celyn Jones (“The Almond and the Seahorse”). Jones directs from the debut feature script by Welsh writer Lisa Baker.\n\n\n\tInspired by the life of the fifth Marquess of Anglesey, “Madfabulous” stars Callum Scott Howells (“It’s A Sin,” “The Beautiful Game”), Ruby Stokes (“Lockwood & Co,” “Rocks”), and Rupert Everett (“Napoleon,” “The Serpent Queen”).\n\t\n\n\t“Madfabulous is a fun, yet inspiring ensemble cast film with a meaningful message,” said Patatian. “Along with our superb partners at Mad as Birds Films and the director Celyn Jones, we look forward to introducing this incredible film to international distributors at AFM. They will love it,” said Patatian, who serves as Noora CEO.\n\n\tFrom Jones’ Mad as Birds production company, the film is produced by Nadia Jaynes (“Marcella,” “The Responder”) and Sean Marley (“Poms,” “Six Minutes to Midnight”). Nicola Pearcey (“Military Wives,” “The Almond and the Seahorse”) executive produces for Picnik Entertainment, alongside Paul Baker. Jay Cohen at Gersh will handle U.S. rights.\n\n\t“With its humour, heart, and sense of irreverence, Madfabulous is a rare gem,” said Cohen. “It’s a film brimming with personality and anchored by exceptional performances. We’re proud to bring it to U.S. buyers.”\n\t\n\n\tPatatian was recently president of Cloud 9 Studios (formerly Concord Studios), which she launched last year, and led sales on titles including Paul Schrader’s Cannes competition title “Oh, Canada,” Renny Harlin’s “Deep Water” and the romantic comedy “Under the Stars” starring Toni Collette and Andy Garcia, which she also produced. Prior to that, she served as senior vice president of sales for Capstone Pictures, running the company’s operations in London, and previously served as director, international sales at Blue Box International (a label of Red Granite International). She began her career at Universal Pictures in Madrid, where she worked on “Mamma Mia” and “Inglorious Basterds.”\n\n\tNoora Films, which has offices in Europe and the U.S., aims to develop, produce and finance content for film and TV.\n",

Few films in recent memory have generated this kind of sustained affection from festivalgoers across continents.\n\n\tBut the bigger question is what that affection means for Oscar season. “Hamnet” looks destined for an awards-season tug-of-war with Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” which also shows no signs of slowing. Beyond those two juggernauts, only a handful of other contenders — like Ryan Coogler’s gothic horror film “Sinners” and perhaps Josh Safdie’s high-octane sports film “Marty Supreme” — could spark passion among industry voters. \n\n\tElsewhere, Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Hikari’s “Rental Family” have each picked up their share of regional honors. “Frankenstein” claimed the top prize at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival, while “Rental Family” tied with “Hamnet” at Middleburg and earned runner-up status at SCAD.\n\n\tLet’s see where it all ultimately settles. \n\n\tThis week’s updates are below, and the first official charts for international feature, documentary feature and cinematography have been released.\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): “One Battle After Another” (14); “Sinners” (13); “Hamnet” (12); “Wicked: For Good” (10); “Sentimental Value” (7)\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSINNERS, Li Jun Li, 2025. © Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Cinematography Commentary (Updated Nov. 11, 2025): The men and women behind the lens are showing this will be one of the most competitive races at the Oscars ceremony.\n\n\tFor the first time in Oscars history, the best cinematography category will utilize a shortlist. The Cinematographers Branch will announce between 10 and 20 titles for consideration. Voting for all shortlist categories — which now include casting, sound, visual effects, makeup and hairstyling, documentary feature, international feature, and all three shorts — will run from Dec. 8–12. \n\n\tLeading the pack — and the conversation — is Autumn Durald Arkapaw, whose luminous work on “Sinners” bathes every frame in unease and tragic beauty. Set in the 1930s, the film’s glow evokes a timeless sense of dread and longing. Known for her dazzling compositions in “Teen Spirit” and her Emmy-nominated work on TV’s “Loki,” Arkapaw may be on the verge of making history. Only three women have ever been nominated in this category: Rachel Morrison (“Mudbound”), Ari Wegner (“The Power of the Dog”), and Mandy Walker (“Elvis”). Skeptics often wonder whether we’ll ever see a woman win best cinematography in our lifetime. After watching “Sinners,” I’m inclined to believe the answer might finally be yes.\n\n\tSeveral overdue names are hoping to gain traction this season.\n\n\tDan Laustsen’s lush, gothic camera work in Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” continues to build momentum. Having earned previous nominations for Del Toro’s “The Shape of Water” (2017) and “Nightmare Alley” (2021), Laustsen remains a clear contender, and overdue for some Oscar love.\n\n\tAnother strong bet is Polish master Łukasz Żal, whose collaboration with Chloé Zhao on the emotionally moving “Hamnet” delivers some of the year’s most striking imagery. A two-time nominee for black-and-white gems “Ida” (2014) and “Cold War” (2018), Żal’s embrace of color here — and his ability to hold a moment, asking the audience to sit with it — adds layers of depth to an already devastating story.\n\n\tThis season is sure to welcome a few exciting newcomers.\n\n\tAdolpho Veloso’s camera work in Clint Bentley’s “Train Dreams” channels the quiet majesty of Terrence Malick and Bruno Delbonnel, pairing natural light with meditative pacing. Then there’s Michael Bauman, a rising name in the field. While he’s served as a longtime collaborator with Paul Thomas Anderson previously, including on “Licorice Pizza” (2021), Bauman is now stepping into the spotlight with “One Battle After Another.” He’s primed for his first official bid, especially with the film emerging as a major awards frontrunner.\n\n\tNominations voting will take place from Monday, Jan. 12, through Friday, Jan. 16. Final nominees will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. Final voting begins Wednesday, Feb. 26, and closes on Wednesday, March 5.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: A24\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Filmes da Ermida, Cannes Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Artisans (Cinematography)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Neon\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tEddie Murphy recently joined Entertainment Weekly to promote his Netflix documentary “Being Eddie” and looked back to when he presented best picture to Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Last Emperor.” Murphy deliberately used his time at the Oscars podium to call out the Academy for failing to recognize Black actors over the years. He thought the bit would generate headlines in the Hollywood press, but Murphy says in the doc that he was surprised to discover there were barely any the next day.\n\t\n\n\t“I remember being with Robin Williams backstage,” Murphy recalled to EW about that Oscars night. “I was like, ‘I’m gonna say this.’ And he goes to me, like, ‘But why go there?’ I was like, ‘Oh, you don’t think it’s funny?’ It was more, ‘Is it funny?’ Rather than, ‘It’s controversial.’ I was trying to be funny and say a little something, but be funny too. Have a little edge to what I said.”\n\n\n\tIn his introduction to announcing the best picture nominees, Murphy recounted how his manager told him the Academy was inviting him to present at the Oscars and that he originally wanted to decline.\n\n\t“I’m not going because they haven’t recognized Black people in motion pictures,” Murphy told the Oscars audience. “And I’ll probably never win an Oscar for saying this, but hey, what the hey, I gotta say it. Actually, I might not be in any trouble because the way it’s been going is about every 20 years we get one, so we ain’t due to about 2004. So by that time, this will all be blown over.” \n\n\tAt the time, only three acting winners in the Oscars’ 60-year history were Black performers (Hattie McDaniel, Sidney Poitier and Louis Gossett Jr.). Denzel Washington would join the group two years later by winning best supporting actor for “Glory.”\n\t\n\n\t“So I came down here to give the award. I said, ‘But I just feel that we have to be recognized as a people. I just want you to know I’m gonna give this award, but Black people will not ride the caboose of society, and we will not bring up the rear anymore. And I want you to recognize us,” Murphy’s speech concluded.\n\n\tMurphy told EW that he “wasn’t thinking of the ramifications” of calling out the Oscars’ lack of diversity among its winners when he gave the speech, adding: “I was just trying to be funny in the moment and I wanted what I was saying to be relevant.”\n\n\tThe comedian was right about one thing, though. He has yet to win an Oscar despite being a frontrunner for the best supporting actor prize in 2007 for “Dreamgirls.” Alan Arkin ended up winning in a surprise victory for “Little Miss Sunshine” after Murphy took home prizes from the Golden Globes and Screen Actors’ Guild Awards. Some have speculated that “Norbit,” Murphy’s disastrously-reviewed comedy that opened just a week after he received his Oscar nomination. Murphy has defended “Norbit” in various interview of the years.\n\n\t“I love ‘Norbit,’” Murphy said earlier this year on Complex’s “360 With Speedy Morman” series. “‘Norbit’ came out right after I got that Oscar nomination. There were articles like, ‘How can he get an Oscar, he did this?’ They’re two different movies. I wrote ‘Norbit’ with my brother, Charlie [Murphy], and we think ‘Norbit’ is funny. Here’s the thing with ‘Norbit,’ it came out and they gave me a Razzie Awards for worst actress, worst actor and worst actor of the decade. And I was like, ‘Come on now, shit ain’t that bad.’”\n\n\t“Being Eddie” premieres on Netflix on Nov. 12.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCleto Escobedo III, Jimmy Kimmel‘s close friend and the bandleader of his talk show, has died. He was 59.\n\n\tKimmel shared the news on Instagram, writing, “Early this morning, we lost a great friend, father, son, musician and man, my longtime bandleader Cleto Escobedo III. To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement. Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto’s wife, children and parents in your prayers.”\n\t\n\n\tEscobedo and Kimmel were childhood friends and neighbors growing up in Las Vegas. As Kimmel went into comedy, Escobedo formed the band Cleto and the Cletones in 1995, mostly playing saxophone. When Kimmel launched “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on ABC in 2003, he asked Escobedo to lead the house band. “I always thank him for this gig because he could have tried to get somebody that was established and would help the show more, being a bigger name or whatever,” Escobedo told ABC7 in a 2013 interview. “But he trusted me with this job, and I’ve tried to do the best I can.”\n\n\n\tEscobedo’s cause of death is unknown, but Variety has confirmed that his condition was the “personal reason” Kimmel’s show was abruptly canceled on Thursday. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” returned on Monday with a new episode, and will also broadcast a new episode on Tuesday, with Kimmel expected to address his friend and bandleader’s passing.\n\n\tEscobedo played the alto, tenor and soprano saxophones and also sang as part of the band. Outside of performing on Kimmel’s show, Escobedo toured with Paula Abdul, Marc Anthony and Earth, Wind & Fire’s Phillip Bailey. Escobedo’s father, Cleto Escobedo Jr., is also a part of the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” house band.\n\t\n\n\tIn 2016, Kimmel celebrated Escobedo’s 50th birthday on air with a tribute: “I met Cleto in January of 1977 when my family moved from Brooklyn to Las Vegas. Cleto lived across the street from us… We began a lifetime of friendship that was highlighted by the kind of torture that only an older brother can inflict on you without being arrested.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJesse Williams has joined “Shifting Gears” at ABC in a recurring role, Variety has learned exclusively. \n\n\tThe multi-cam comedy began airing its second season at ABC on Oct. 1 Williams will appear alongside series stars Tim Allen and Kat Dennings as well as cast members Seann William Scott, Daryl “Chill” Mitchell, Maxwell Simkins, and Barrett Margolis. \n\n\tWilliams will recur as Andy, who is described as “a single dad who frequents Riley’s (Dennings) coffee cart and has eyes for Riley too.”\n\t\n\n\tWilliams is best known for his time on the hit ABC medical drama “Grey’s Anatomy,” on which he played Jackson Avery. Williams first joined the show in 2009 and was a main cast member up until 2021. He has since appeared as a guest star multiple times. He also played Avery on the spinoff series “Station 19.” His other notable roles include “Little Fires Everywhere,” “Only Murders in the Building” and the Amazon original movie “Hotel Costiera.” He has been in films such as “The Cabin in the Woods” and “Lee Daniels’ The Butler.”\n\n\n\tHe is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Granderson Des Rochers.  \n\n\tThe official logline for “Shifting Gears” states that it follows “Matt (Allen), the stubborn, widowed owner of a classic car restoration shop. When his estranged daughter, Riley (Dennings), and her kids move into his house, the real restoration begins.”\n\n\tAllen executive produces along with Michelle Nader, Marty Adelstein, Becky Clements, Richard Baker, Rick Messina, John Pasquin, Jim Patterson, Bob Daily and John Amodeo. Dennings serves as a producer. 20th Television is the studio.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Alien: Earth” has been renewed for Season 2 at FX, Variety has learned. In addition, series creator Noah Hawley has signed a new overall deal with FX and Disney Entertainment Television. \n\n\tAccording to an individual with knowledge of the situation, Hawley’s overall deal is valued in the nine figure range. Production on Season 2 of “Alien: Earth” will begin in London in 2026, whereas the first season was shot in Thailand. \n\n\n\t“It has been our great privilege to work with Noah for more than a decade on some of FX’s best and biggest shows, and we are thrilled to extend our partnership well into the future,” said John Landgraf, chairman of FX. “Noah never stops surprising us with truly original stories— and his unique ability to bring them to vibrant life as a director and producer as well as writer makes him extraordinary. We can’t wait to get to work on the next season of ‘Alien: Earth,’ as well as some equally exciting future projects in advanced development.”\n\t\n\n\t“Alien: Earth” serves as the TV extension of the “Alien” film franchise. It debuted on FX back in August to strong reviews from critics and audiences alike. The cast includes Sydney Chandler, Alex Lawther, Timothy Olyphant, Essie Davis, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay, David Rysdahl, Adrian Edmondson, Adarsh Gourav, Jonathan Ajayi, Erana James, Lily Newmark, Diem Camille, and Moe Bar-El. \n\n\tThe official logline for the first season states, “When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat. \n\t\n\n\t“I’m thrilled that this expanded deal opens the door to new opportunities across all of Disney Entertainment Television,” said Hawley. “FX has always supported bold, character-driven storytelling. From the very beginning with Fargo, they’ve encouraged me to take creative risks and follow the story wherever it leads. I’m grateful to continue exploring the world of ‘Alien: Earth’ alongside our partners, cast, and crew as we begin the next chapter.”\n\n\tHawley is the creator and executive producer “Alien: Earth.” Ridley Scott, David W. Zucker, Clayton Krueger, Emilia Serrano, Bob DeLaurentis, Peter Calloway, Monica Macer, John Campisi and Simon Emanuel also serve as executive producers. The series is produced by FX Productions.\n\n\t“I learned first-hand that Noah was a unique talent while we worked on ‘Fargo’ at FX,” said Eric Schrier, president of Disney Television Studios & Global Original Television Strategy. “He has gone on to make many of the best shows in television, and I couldn’t be more excited that Noah will continue his FX partnership and broaden it across Disney Entertainment Television.”\n\n\tHawley first came to FX with the anthology series “Fargo” in 2014. Five seasons of that series have aired to date, with the show collectively winning seven Emmy Awards out of 70 nominations, as well as three Golden Globes out of 14 nominations. Hawley also created the FX-Marvel series “Legion,” which aired for three seasons at the network. \n\n\tHawley is repped by WME, Untitled Entertainment, Sunshine Sachs Morgan & Lylis, and McKuin Frankel Whitehead.\n",

    "body": "\n\tFlorence Pugh has been honest in previous interviews about not planning to do roles like “Midsommar” again because she abused her mental health in order to play the character (in this case it was Dani, a grief-stricken American woman who has a psychological breakdown when she joins her toxic boyfriend on a trip). Now in a new interview on “The Louis Theroux Podcast,” the Oscar nominee reveals the emotional exhaustion of filming “Midsommar” led to six months of depression.\n\t\n\n\t“I just can’t exhaust myself like that because it has a knock-on effect,” Pugh said. “I think [‘Midsommar’] made me sad for like six months after and I didn’t know why I was depressed. I got back after shooting ‘Little Women,’ which was such a fun experience and obviously a completely different tone from ‘Midsommar,’ so I think shelved all of that. And then when I got home for Christmas, I was so depressed and I was like, ‘Oh, I think that’s from “Midsommar,”‘ and I didn’t deal with it and I probably shouldn’t do that again.”\n\n\n\t“Midsommar” was “Hereditary” filmmaker Ari Aster’s second feature directorial effort. The movie required Pugh to play a character “in such a horrible state in her life,” the actor explained, and Pugh responded by diving head first into Dani’s emotional breakdown.\n\n\t“I had never seen that level of grief or mental health in the way that was being asked of me on the page,” Pugh said on the podcast. “So for that, I really put myself through it. At the beginning, I just imagined hearing the news that one of my siblings had died, and then towards the middle of the shoot it was like, ‘Oh no, I actually needed to imagine the coffins.’ And then towards the end of the shoot, I actually was going to my whole family’s funeral.”\n\t\n\n\t“It wasn’t just crying. I needed to sound pained,” Pugh continued. “I’d never done anything like that before and I was like, ‘OK, well here’s my opportunity. I need to give this a go.’ And I would just basically put myself through hell. But I don’t do that anymore. It really fucked me up.”\n\n\tAfter “Midsommar” wrapped, Pugh traveled immediately to the Boston set of Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women.” The Oscar nominee was overcome with emotion during the switch between movies and even broke down in tears on the flight to “Little Women’s” Boston set when it dawned on her that she was leaving Dani in the past.\n\n\t“My brain was obviously feeling sympathy for myself because I’d abused myself and really manipulated my own emotions to get a performance, but I also then felt sorry for what I’d done,” Pugh said. “It was very, very strange and I’ve never ever been worried about my characters from the day that I finish. But [Dani] was the one that I felt like I’d left her in that field with the film crew just filming her cry.”\n\n\tAny abuse that Pugh suffered during the making of “Midsommar” was strictly self-inflicted and had nothing to do with Aster. She’s always had nothing but praise for the director, once telling The New York Times last year that he’s “peculiar in a mad genius kind of a way” and “a stand-up comedian at heart.” She added, “Once you laugh at one thing, he will try and make you laugh at all the other things. He’ll keep going and everybody will be crying in fits of laughter.”\n\n\t“The Louis Theroux Podcast” is available on Spotify now.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSpotify and the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) have together opened an “opt-in portal” for NMPA members to retain access to direct license agreements for expanded audiovisual rights in the United States.\n\n\tWith a license, independent music publishers and songwriters will have access to higher royalty payouts. Spotify will also receive rights to build video features that better connect artists and fans. The portal is open strictly for audiovisual rights as the NMPA continues its legal dispute with the Federal Trade Commission against Spotify, challenging the company’s plan to bundle music and audiobooks — a move that would lower mechanical royalty rates for songwriters and artists. (Spotify has acknowledged the royalty reduction but maintains that overall creator earnings will continue to grow.)\n\t\n\n\tThe portal is open to eligible publishers beginning Nov. 11, with onboarding continuing through Dec. 19.\n\n\n\t“This new partnership with the NMPA will increase revenue for songwriters and independent publishers who are the heart of the industry.” said Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer, Spotify. “We look forward to continuing to work with the NMPA to create new value and opportunities for their members.”\n\n\t“We are pleased that this deal offers indie publishers the chance to enter into direct deals with Spotify in regard to audiovisual streaming functionality on the platform alongside the recently announced larger publishing companies,” added David Israelite, president and CEO of NMPA. “This new income stream reflects the growing value of songs as digital platforms offer new capabilities to consumers.”\n\t\n\n\t+ The USC Thornton School of Music has tapped Greg Phillinganes to join the faculty as a part-time instructor. Phillinganes, whose career spans five decades and includes collaborations with many of the world’s most celebrated artists, will work directly with Thornton students beginning this semester.\n\n\tA Detroit native, Phillinganes began his career in 1975 as a member of Stevie Wonder’s Wonderlove. Since then, he has become one of the most in-demand musicians in the industry, recording, performing, and touring with artists including Quincy Jones, Eric Clapton, Barbra Streisand, Andrea Bocelli, Herbie Hancock, Mick Jagger, John Mayer, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Lionel Richie, and countless others.\n\n\tIn addition, Phillinganes was the music director for Richie’s “Can’t Slow Down” tour, Jackson’s “Bad” and “Dangerous” tours, multiple “In Performance at the White House” specials, MusiCares’ Person of the Year events, the Super Bowl Halftime Show, and several Grammy Awards broadcasts.\n\n\t“Greg Phillinganes is one of the most influential keyboardists and musical directors in the history of recorded music. We are honored to welcome him as an instructor to USC Thornton,” said Jason King, dean of the USC Thornton School of Music. “I know that his profound experience and artistry will inspire the next generation of musicians and leaders.”\n\n\tPhillinganes’ teaching will focus on individual performance instruction, ensemble coaching sessions, and a keyboard masterclass. He will serve as co-musical director, along with Professor Tim Kobza, of the Thornton School’s annual senior pop showcase on March 6, 2026 at the El Rey Theater. During a November 12 masterclass, for instance, Phillinganes will discuss and contrast four unique recordings of the song “Behind the Mask”: the original Ryuichi Sakamoto version, Phillinganes’s own solo recording, Michael Jackson’s, and Eric Clapton’s.\n\t\n\t\tMonday, Nov. 11 \t\n\n\tSZA and Los Angeles-based Italian restaurant Jon and Vinny‘s have teamed up to provide 1,400 free meals for people struggling without SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. SZA’s own NOT Charity is behind the partnership. \n\n\t“Yall know how much I love Jon and Vinny’s,” SZA wrote on a collaborative Instagram post with Jon and Vinny’s. “But it ain’t no fun if the Homies can’t have none!!”\n\t\n\n\t“Last week [SZA] reached out to us with an idea and now, with her help, it’s a reality,” wrote the restaurant. “Over the next 7 days we are partnering with her NOT Charity to provide 1400 free meals (100 dinners for 2 per day) for Los Angeles community members who receive SNAP.”\n\n\tEach meal will be available as takeout at the restaurant’s Slauson location from 3 to 5 p.m. starting Nov. 11 and ending Nov. 17. “Thank you SZA for inspiring all of us to be there for our neighbors,” wrote Jon and Vinny’s.\n\n\tThe future of SNAP benefits for approximately 5.5 million Californians remains uncertain amid the government shutdown, leaving many without resources. \n\n\t+ Luminate, a data partner, and TME Chart, a music chart under Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME), have announced a new global data partnership. The agreement allows the integration of streaming and sales consumption metrics from TME platforms, including QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music, and JOOX, into Luminate’s industry-leading music data platform CONNECT. \n\n\tThe new partnership provides international visibility into China’s music market and the data will be reflected in CONNECT’s global streaming and sales in the coming weeks.\n\n\tSpeaking on the announcement, Luminate CEO Rob Jonas shared, “This partnership marks a pivotal moment for the global music industry, underscoring Luminate’s unwavering commitment to providing the most accurate and comprehensive measurement of music activity worldwide. As the industry’s most trusted source of streaming and sales data, our customers and partners expect as much information as possible to make the best business decisions, and we know how valuable it is for a market as large and influential as China to be represented in those insights.”\n\n\tTC Pan, Group Vice President of TME and President of the Content Cooperation Department, said, “This collaboration with Luminate represents a data-driven effort to establish a unified global content ecosystem. China is one of the most dynamic music markets in the world, and through this partnership, all content on TME’s platforms — whether domestic or international — will participate in, and even help shape, global music trends. Moving forward, TME will continue to strengthen its content ecosystem, enabling more quality content to be discovered worldwide, realizing long-term value through a journey from ‘data connectivity’ to ‘ecosystem synergy.’”\n\t\n\n\t+ Sony Music Publishing today announced the appointment of Michael Young as chief information officer. Based in Nashville, Young will report to Sony Music Publishing’s Chief Financial Officer Tom Kelly.\n\n\tAs CIO, Young will lead the company’s technology strategy and its ongoing transformation initiatives to advance growth, scalability and efficiency on behalf of SMP songwriters and catalogs worldwide. He will also work closely across departments to optimize workflows, expand data-driven insights, and refine and implement best practices across software development, security, compliance and data governance.\n\n\tYoung said, “I am extremely excited to join Sony Music Publishing. As a career technologist and a lifelong amateur musician, it’s thrilling to be a part of SMP’s mission-driven culture. I look forward to working with the team to advance support for SMP songwriters throughout their creative journeys.”\n\n\tKelly said, “Michael is an experienced leader who understands how to innovate. We look forward to advancing our capabilities and delivering further growth on behalf of our songwriters around the world.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tI tend to shy away from the term if I can, but there’s no denying that Keeper, the new movie directed by Osgood Perkins (“Longlegs,” “Monkey”), is an experimental horror film. That’s what’s good about it, and also what’s not so good about it. In theory, making an experimental movie is a bold creative act (though I wouldn’t score their success rate at too high a percentage). Two years ago, there was a radical experimental horror film that was nothing short of amazing — Kyle Edward Ball’s “Skinamarink,” which used a fragmentary narrative to touch the uncanny.\n\t\n\n\tBut in “Keeper,” a serial-killer drama with a handful of honestly creepy moments, the mood is low-key and naturalistic, yet a streak of trippy weirdness keeps intruding. And here’s the thing: The weird parts don’t add up. That’s likely by design, but that doesn’t make it good. There’s probably a great serial-killer movie to be made using experimental film language (to touch the core of their bloody psychosis), but the “impressionistic” dream logic of “Keeper” just leaves you feeling that Osgood Perkins has seen too many movies and that he wants to project the random horror mixtape of his brain onto the screen.   \n\n\n\t“Keeper” has a canny and disturbing opening sequence, and it got me hooked on the film’s possibilities. We see, entirely from the main character’s point-of-view, a montage of the women he has dated and dumped. As his pattern of behavior becomes clear, it hits a note of social familiarity — we’re seeing the diary of a serial monogamist, a phrase that’s a contradiction in terms (he’s monogamous! Until he cuts you loose to be with someone else), and also one that has that telltale overlap with “serial killer.” The message: When it comes to men, serial is probably a problem.\n\t\n\n\tLiz (Tatiana Maslany, from the TV series “Orphan Black”), who is sharp and urban and confused about her life, is about to head upstate with her boyfriend of one year, Malcolm (Rossif Sutherland), to stay in his family’s cabin. “Cabin” is a modest rustic word, but this place is pretty posh. It’s an elegant two-story wood house, with high ceilings and large open windows, all renovated, so that it looks like the perfect nook-and-cranny hideaway for a killer to take his victim. But is Malcolm a killer?\n\n\tHe sure seems like he could be. He’s a physician, nerdish and unsmiling, played by Rossif Sutherland (the son of Donald Sutherland), who’s hidden behind a morose beard and has a quirky monosyllabic passivity. Why is she even with this guy? We may not fully buy it, but he’s at least got a surface normality, and that’s the point. (A slight joke, intentional or not: In a country as snarky as America has become, Rossif Sutherland’s dour Canadian earnestness plays as a red flag.)\n\n\tMalcolm has told Liz that she’s “not like all those other girls,” a line that lets you know she’s exactly like those other girls. We’re braced to ride out his descent into madness, but here’s what happens instead. Malcolm’s cousin comes over — a super-skeevy bro named Darren (played by Birkett Turton like a depraved Carson Daly), who brings along an Eastern-European-model-who-speaks-next-to-no-English named Minka (Eden Weiss). This comes under the category of “realistic horror,” but here’s what doesn’t: Minka points to a cake box that got delivered by the caretaker and says, “Tastes like shit.”\n\n\tLater on, Malcolm offers Liz a piece of the chocolate cake, and she eats it (a suspenseful scene), and it tastes…fine. But then, in the middle of the night, she goes down to the kitchen and gorges on the entire rest of the cake. And it seems to start giving her visions: of ghostly gray humanoids, of the ex-girlfriends who have been killed, of steam rising from two piles of rocks in the woods — and, bizarrely, of a flashback to many years ago when the cousins, as boys, held muskets and killed a woman in the woods who looked just like Liz. Then Malcolm has to return to the city to attend to a patient, and Darren stops by again, this time going into the kitchen to get a butcher knife (is he the serial killer?), all of which comes to…nothing.\n\t\n\n\t“Keeper” is well shot (the cinematography, by Jeremy Cox, has a woodland austerity that’s classier than the slapdash flamboyance of “Longlegs” and “Monkey”), but for the audience it’s a two-hour exercise in figuring out what in the actual fuck is going on. The film is dotted with serial-killer tropes (heads dunked in gooey dissolving fluid, etc.), but if you listen to the music cues, like Peggy Lee singing “I Don’t Want to Play in Your Yard,” or Mickey & Sylvia’s version of “Love Is Strange,” or Elvin Bishop’s “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” playing over the closing credits, you get the feeling that Perkins thinks he’s making a movie about the place where serial homicide meets lack of commitment. Actually, it’s Osgood Perkins who can’t commit — to a filmmaking style that isn’t based on the next damn thing that comes into his head.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Mexican corridos group Los Tigres del Norte sent a powerful and political message on the Latin Grammys stage on Thursday night. Against a backdrop of videos of teary-eyed Mexican people and American and Mexican flags, the group sang their sociopolitical single, “La Lotería.” \n\n\tNamed after the Mexican board game, “La Lotería” comments on topics including immigration, and criticizes President Donald Trump’s criminal past with lyrics like “El diablo ya lo mandan a la corte” (They’re even sending the devil to court), and “Nuestra gente se rebela en estos tiempos” (Our people are rebelling in these times).\n\t\n\n\tThe videos playing behind the group at the Latin Grammys also featured street signs that read “immigration reform ahead” and images of families crossing. In the audience, artists including Bad Bunny watched with intent and nodded along to the song’s groove. \n\n\t“The most important thing is that we now see that [‘La Lotería’] comes out at a critical moment,” Los Tigres told Los Angeles Times’ De Los in February. “We took on the task of recording and having this number and hopefully the public will analyze it and reflect on each of the themes that are touched upon in this song, because there are several and each lotería card has a different meaning for all of us.”\n\n\t“La Lotería” won a Latin Grammy earlier that evening for best regional song, while the eponymously titled parent EP took home best norteño album. The evening’s most decorated acts were Bad Bunny — who took home five awards, including album of the year for his politically and culturally empowering “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” — and Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso, who also earned five wins.\n",

    "body": "\n\tMiles Teller opened up about leading the ill-fated 2015 “Fantastic Four” adaptation, telling Andy Cohen that he already wasn’t expecting a warm response for the superhero reboot after watching the final cut.\n\n\t“When I first saw the movie, I remember talking to one of the studio heads and said, ‘I think we’re in trouble,'” Teller said in an interview on Cohen’s SiriusXM talk show. Teller went on to explain the industry pressure he felt in his late twenties to take on a superhero film — a genre that the “Top Gun: Maverick” star hasn’t touched since.\n\t\n\n\t“As a young actor at that time, it’s like, ‘Alright, if you want to be taken seriously as a leading man, you got to get on this superhero train. That was our chance,” Teller said. “And the casting, I thought, was spectacular. I love all those actors.”\n\n\n\t“Fantastic Four,” which starred Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell as the titular team, was critically reviled upon release. Directed by Josh Trank, the feature only grossed $168 million globally against a $120 million production budget. The Marvel characters were put on ice for the next decade, only revived last summer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe entry “The Fantastic 4: First Steps.”\n\n\tSpeaking with Cohen, Teller appeared to lay the blame for the project’s failure on one individual, though he did not put a name to his allegations.\n\n\t“It’s unfortunate for that, because so many people worked so hard on that movie. And honestly, maybe there was one really important person who kind of fucked it all up,” Teller said.\n\n\tTeller is currently promoting his next feature “Eternity,” in which he, Elizabeth Olsen and Callum Turner play a love triangle in the afterlife. A24 is releasing the film to theaters on Nov. 26. \n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains major plot details for Thursday’s midseason finale of ABC’s ”9-1-1: Nashville.”\n\n\tABC’s “9-1-1: Nashville” midseason finale, which aired Thursday, revealed the tragic backstory for Kimberly Williams-Paisley‘s 9-1-1 call operator Cammie — and set up a multi-episode emergency coming when the ABC drama returns in January.\n\n\tThe episode showed Cammie dealing with a choking victim over video chat, walking the woman through how to perform the Heimlich maneuver on herself. After that incident, Cammie revealed how the emergency hit very close to home for her: Her husband had died by choking in front of her as she looked on helplessly. At the time, when she tried to call 9-1-1 for help, the call went to voicemail.\n\t\n\n\tHer husband’s tragic death was what pushed Cammie to give up her career as a Nashville music producer to become a 9-1-1 dispatch operator, and give a large donation to the center. “9-1-1: Nashville” showrunner Rashad Raisani told Variety that Cammie’s backstory was born out of a real-life choking death he witnessed.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDisney/Jake Giles Netter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisney\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The first thing that inspired that was, director Brad Buecker and I were having dinner in Nashville in the early spring,” Raisani said. “We were still doing location scouting, and while we were there, unfortunately, a woman passed away at the table behind us from a choking incident. It happened in the dark, and her poor husband was there, just helpless. We didn’t even realize what was happening until it was already over. It was really mind blowing. While we were talking about Cammie’s character and what would make her unique — I still get goosebumps thinking about it, that poor family — I just thought, ‘well, that would be such an origin story for a character who had one life, and then that thing happens, then the second half of her life is going to be something very different.'”\n\t\n\n\tWilliams-Paisley said Raisani told her about what he had witnessed the “first time we talked” about the role of Cammie. It “definitely adds weight to what I’m doing in the performance” on “9-1-1: Nashville,” she said.\n\n\t“Because I know that these things have happened, it’s something I thought a lot about,” Williams-Paisley said. “Working on my character, I really dug into her backstory, emotionally, and what that must have felt like. I did also go visit a 9-1-1 call center. I think a lot about those operators, too, and how they keep their home life at home when they’re at work. They have to, in order to do a good job. But inevitably, sometimes your real life comes into your work life, and that’s what happens in this episode tonight — and in the following episodes that will be coming in January.”\n\n\tWhile Raisani noted this was the “the first time that we’ve done a deep cut with Cammie,” the episode is “just the tip of the iceberg for her” and her backstory. When the show returns in January, Williams-Paisley said episodes will showcase Cammie’s time working as a big-time music producer in Nashville.\n\n\t“Yes, in fact, that’s something I’m shooting right now. Today I’m on set, and yes, we’re definitely going to be exploring that more,” Williams-Paisley said. “That was a big part of Cammie’s life before everything changed and she lost her husband. But it’s still a big part of her, and it’s something that she spent years doing before she switched careers. There’s some very fun stuff coming up with that as well.”\n\n\tThe midseason return of “9-1-1: Nashville” will also feature a multi-episode arc that revisits the hackers that famously took over Los Angeles on “9-1-1” a few seasons ago, and where never caught. Now, they’ve set their sites on Nashville and take over the emergency operating system by the end of the episode.\n\n\t“‘9-1-1’ had a hack a few years ago, and what I always thought was that we left a little bit of money on the table about what that hack could have turned into,” Raisani said. “And since they never caught the hackers from ‘9-1-1,’ I thought, ‘Well, why did they stop? They got a lot of money, so maybe they are ready to attack a new city.’ They hit the other show, and they never got caught.”\n\n\tOne immediate effect of that chaos was Jessica Capshaw’s Blythe being knocked from her horse and thrown into a barbed wire fence, then left passed out and bleeding in the wild. The animal was startled due to the natural disaster alerts set off by the hackers, leaving Blythe unconscious and alone.\n\t\n\n\t“A lot of stuff is going to happen in the city in Episode 7, so part of I think our dramatic tension is going to be Blythe and that nobody even knows she’s missing,” Raisani said. He added that Blythe “has a lot of grit and toughness, and I wanted to put her through a crucible.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tChinese social media, games and video giant Tencent posted revenues of RMB192.9 billion ($27.1 billion) for the third quarter of 2025, marking a 15%",
    "body": "\n\tChinese social media, games and video giant Tencent posted revenues of RMB192.9 billion ($27.1 billion) for the third quarter of 2025, marking a 15% year-over-year increase as the company’s strategic AI investments continue to pay dividends across its gaming and advertising businesses.\n\n\tThe internet and technology company reported non-IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders of RMB70.6 billion ($9.9 billion), up 18% year-over-year, according to unaudited results released. Non-IFRS figures exclude certain one-time and non-cash items such as share-based compensation and acquisition-related costs, providing what management considers a clearer view of core operational performance compared to results prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards, the global accounting framework.\n\t\n\n\t“During the third quarter of 2025, we achieved solid revenue and earnings growth, reflecting healthy trends across games, marketing services, and fintech and business services,” said Ma Huateng, chair and CEO of Tencent. “Our strategic investments in AI are benefitting us in business areas such as ad targeting and game engagement, as well as in efficiency enhancement areas such as coding, and game and video production.”\n\n\n\tMa highlighted the company’s progress with its HunYuan foundation model, noting that its image and 3D generation capabilities are now industry leading. The company is also focusing on growing adoption of its Yuanbao AI assistant and developing agentic AI capabilities within its Weixin super-app.\n\n\tTencent’s gaming division delivered robust performance, with value-added services revenues climbing 16% year-over-year to RMB95.9 billion ($13.5 billion). Domestic games revenues reached RMB42.8 billion ($6 billion), up 15% year-over-year, driven by recently released titles including “Delta Force,” which ranked among the top three games industry-wide by gross receipts during the quarter. The mobile version of “Valorant” has become China’s most successful mobile game launch year-to-date, according to QuestMobile and Sensor Tower data.\n\t\n\n\tInternational games revenues surged 43% year-over-year to RMB20.8 billion ($2.9 billion), with Supercell’s “Clash Royale” achieving all-time highs for monthly daily active users and gross receipts in September. Newly released title “Dying Light: The Beast” has earned a “very positive” 87% player review score on Steam.\n\n\tMarketing services revenues jumped 21% year-over-year to RMB36.2 billion ($5.1 billion), benefiting from increased user engagement, higher ad load, and improved eCPMs driven by AI-powered ad targeting. The company introduced its automated ad campaign solution AIM+, which allows advertisers to automate targeting, bidding, placement and ad creation optimization.\n\n\tFinTech and business services revenues grew 10% year-over-year to RMB58.2 billion ($8.2 billion), with commercial payment volume accelerating compared to the second quarter as both online and offline payment trends improved.\n\n\tOperating metrics showed the combined monthly active users of Weixin and WeChat reached 1.414 billion as of Sept. 30, up 2% year-over-year. Tencent Video maintained its industry lead with 114 million subscriptions, while Tencent Music held 126 million subscriptions.\n\n\tOn a non-IFRS basis, operating profit increased 18% year-over-year to RMB72.6 billion ($10.2 billion), with operating margin expanding to 38% from 37% in the prior year period. Free cash flow remained flat at RMB58.5 billion ($8.2 billion), while the company’s net cash position totaled RMB102.4 billion ($14.4 billion), up 7% year-over-year.\n\n\tTencent repurchased approximately 35.4 million shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the quarter for aggregate consideration of approximately HKD21.1 billion ($2.7 billion).\n",

    "body": "\n\tCarin León and Kacey Musgraves delivered the first live performance of their Spanglish duet, “Lost in Translation,” at the 26th Latin Grammys on Thursday night.\n\n\tLeón began with a rendition of his song “Ahi Estabas Tu” before Musgraves appeared on the B-stage, where León joined her for “Lost in Translation.” Musgraves danced in circles with León as they switched between English and Spanish, bringing their duet to life for the Vegas crowd. Watch the performance here.\n\t\n\n\tMusgraves and León co-wrote “Lost In Translation” alongside Amy Allen and Shane McAnally, and had Julian Bunetta produce the song with Matt Zara. They debuted the song in August, blending country with ranchera on the romantic tune. \n\n\n\tMusgraves has covered songs in Spanish while on tour, including hits by the Queen of Tejano, Selena Quintanilla, and even featured her own rendition of Chilean folk singer Violeta Parra’s “Gracias a la Vida” on her album, “Star-Crossed.” \n\n\tAt her Mexico City shows in September, she joined Mariachi Oro de América to sing “Tú, Solo Tú,” showing love to Mexican music and culture. The 1949 song was written by Felipe Valdés Leal and has been recorded by artists like Selena and Linda Ronstadt.\n\n\tLeón was nominated across Latin Grammys categories for his album, “Palabra De To’s (Seca),” including coveted categories like album of the year, best contemporary Mexican music album and best regional song (for “Si Tú Me Vieras”). \n\n\tOther performers at the Latin Grammys included Gloria Estefan, Rauw Alejandro, Karol G, Alejandro Sanz, Danny Lux, Ivan Cornejo, Kakalo, Santana, Maluma, Grupo Frontera, Fuerza Regida and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix is gearing up for the sequel to hit action-comedy “Mission: Cross,” bringing back stars Hwang Jung-min and Yum Jung-ah for another high-stakes adventure.\n\n\tWriter-director Lee Myung-hoon returns to helm “Mission: Cross 2,” which centers on a national treasure heist recovery operation. The original film topped Netflix’s Global Top 10 Movies (Non-English) chart within three days of its 2024 release and ranked in the top 10 across 43 countries during its second week.\n\t\n\n\tHwang reprises his role as Kang-mu, a former special ops agent pulled back into action when the President tasks him with recovering a stolen national treasure. Yum returns as Mi-seon, a former Asian Games shooting silver medalist turned detective who finds herself demoted to a seaside provincial station before rejoining her husband for the new mission.\n\n\n\tThe ensemble cast includes several new additions: Yoon Kyung-ho (“The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call”) as Cheon In-hak, head of a shadowy organization targeting cultural treasures; Im Seong-jae (“Hellbound” Season 2) as Duchil, a black-market dealer; Cha In-pyo (“What Happened to Mr. Cha?”) as the President; and Kim Kuk-hee (“Sweet Home”) as the President’s Chief of Staff. Jung Man-sik, Cha Rae-hyung and Lee Ho-cheol round out the cast.\n\n\tNetflix has also set a Dec. 5 premiere for mystery thriller series “The Price of Confession,” marking Jeon Do-yeon’s first Netflix series. The psychological thriller follows Yun-su, a woman accused of murdering her husband, and Mo Eun, a mysterious woman she encounters in prison.\n\t\n\n\tJeon (“Kill Boksoon,” “Crash Course in Romance”) stars as Yun-su, whose unusual behavior during police questioning — including requesting coffee and smiling throughout interrogations — raises questions about her guilt or innocence. Kim Go-eun (“You and Everything Else,” “Little Women”) plays Mo Eun, a woman feared by other inmates as a witch and psychopath who offers to confess to Yun-su’s husband’s murder in exchange for an unspecified act.\n\n\tPark Hae-soo (“Squid Game”) appears as prosecutor Baek Dong-hun, while Jin Sun-kyu (“Aema”) plays Yun-su’s lawyer Jang Jeong-gu. The series is directed by Lee Jung-hyo, whose credits include “Crash Landing on You” and “Doona!”\n\n\tMeanwhile, Netflix Japan has unveiled release dates for two titles arriving in December: dance film “10Dance” and unscripted dating series “Badly in Love.”\n\n\t“10Dance,” premiering Dec. 18, adapts Inouesatoh’s manga about two competitive dancers both named Shinya. Ryoma Takeuchi makes his Netflix film debut as Shinya Suzuki, Japan’s Latin Dance champion, while Keita Machida stars as Shinya Sugiki, Japan’s Ballroom champion and the world’s No. 2-ranked dancer. The pair, reuniting onscreen for the first time in nearly eight years, navigate a romance that develops as Sugiki challenges Suzuki to enter the 10-Dance competition, which combines Latin and Ballroom styles.\n\n\tKeishi Otomo (“Rurouni Kenshin” series, “The Legend & Butterfly”) directs the adaptation, which won the “This BL Is Amazing! 2019” award in its original manga form.\n\n\t“Badly in Love,” launching Dec. 9, gathers 11 former delinquents for a 14-day dating experiment set at the Badly in Love Academy. The unscripted series concludes with a graduation ceremony where participants must confess their feelings to their chosen romantic interest. The series is produced by Megumi, a self-described former delinquent who developed the project as a counter to what she views as contemporary dating culture’s tendency toward overthinking and emotional guardedness.\n\n\tBoth titles close out Netflix Japan’s 2025 slate alongside the upcoming “The Boyfriend” Season 2.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n",

    "body": "\n\tBad Bunny was the biggest victor at the 2025 Latin Grammy Awards, taking home top honors for album of the year with “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” and marking his first win in a general category.\n\n\tThe Puerto Rican rapper and singer was dealt a mixed hand at the 26th annual ceremony, taking home a handful of his 12 nominated trophies. His additional wins came for tracks off his highly decorated album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” with the track “DtMF” scoring in best urban/urban fusion performance and best urban song, and “Voy A Llevarte Pa PR” winning best reggaeton performance. “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” also won in the category for best urban music album.\n\t\n\n\t“There are many ways to take pride in and defend our homeland, but we choose music,” Bad Bunny said in his acceptance speech, shouting out all the featured guests on his album — including Chuwi, whom he had performed “Weltita” with earlier that evening.\n\n\tBad Bunny came close to getting shut out of the top categories, as Karol G won song of the year for “Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido” and Alejandro Sanz took home record of the year for “Palmeras En El Jardín.” But he ended up scoring the final award of the night, closing the evening with a bang.\n\n\tOther big winners this year included Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso, who won best pop song for “El Día Del Amigo,” best alternative music album for “Papota,” best alternative song for “#Tetas,” best short form music video for “#Tetas” and best long form music video for “Papota.” Paloma Morphy also won top honors as best new artist.\n\n\tCheck out the full list of winners below:\n\t\n\n\tRecord Of The Year“Baile Inolvidable” – Bad Bunny“DtMF” – Bad Bunny“El Día Del Amigo” – CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso“#Tetas” –

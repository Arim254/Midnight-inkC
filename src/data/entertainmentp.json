    "body": "\n\tVidiots, the non-profit film organization that operates the historic Eagle Theatre and video rental store in Los Angeles, will commence 40th anniversary celebrations this November — beginning with screenings of a slew of movies from its flagship year, 1985, paired with special guests, additional programming and a one-night-only comedy show. The org intends to continue anniversary events throughout the coming year.\n\n\tThe 40th Birthday Bash and Benefit on Nov. 13. The 1985-themed event will feature Vidiots’ resident DJs, a silent auction and a comedy show Salute to Vidiots hosted by Paul Scheer at the Eagle in East L.A.

The evening will conclude with a dance party. Proceeds will help support the future of the organization.\n\t\n\n\tVidiots will continue its 1985 programming the following night with two screenings of Jonathan Lynn’s cult classic “Clue.” Cast members Colleen Camp and Michael McKean will make appearances. The following week, director Michael Schultz and cinematographer Ernest Dickerson will be present for the screening of their 1985 musical dramedy “Krush Groove” and Schultz’s musical martial arts picture “The Last Dragon” on Nov. 21. \n\n\n\tOther 1985 classics screening through the month include “Lifeforce,” “Tampopo,“ “The Breakfast Club,” “Thief,” “Ran,” “Return to Oz,” “To Live and Die in L.A.,” “Explorers,” “Police Story,” “Fast Forward,” “Back to the Future” and “Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to the birthday celebrations, Vidiots will also offer its regular line-up of diverse screenings and events throughout November.

    "body": "\n\tYouTube, the internet’s biggest video streaming platform, continues to flex its muscles as an advertising powerhouse, again delivering solid double-digit growth for the third quarter of 2025.\n\n\tYouTube advertising revenue for the period was $10.26 billion, a year-over-year increase of 15%. That beat analyst forecasts of $10.01 billion, per StreetAccount. The figure doesn’t include revenue generated by YouTube’s subscriptions business, but advertising represents the bulk of YouTube’s sales.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition, parent company Alphabet announced that it has more than 300 million paid subscriptions in total, led by Google One cloud storage and YouTube Premium.\n\n\n\tOverall, Alphabet’s Q3 results that came in above Wall Street forecasts. The company reported revenue of $102.35 billion, up 16%, and net income of $34.98 billion (up 33%), translating to earnings per share of $2.87.\n\n\t“Alphabet had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said in prepared remarks.\n\n\tAlphabet dodged a bullet last month after a federal judge rejected the U.S. government’s proposal to force Google to sell its Chrome browser, after the internet giant lost an antitrust case finding that it has a monopoly on search. The judge ruled that Google must share certain kinds of data with competitors and is prohibited from entering into exclusive distribution deals.\n\n\tIn other news, YouTube is undertaking a significant revamp of its product organization. Veteran exec Christian Oestlien is heading a newly created Subscriptions Products group, which includes YouTube TV, Music and Premium; Johanna Voolich, formerly YouTube’s chief product officer, will lead the new Viewer Products team; and YouTube is looking to hire an exec to lead a third separate product organization, Creator & Community Products.\n\t\n\n\tEarlier this month, YouTube began rolling out its “Second Chance” program that will allow some previously terminated creators the opportunity to request a new channel. That includes users who were previously banned over now-retired policies prohibiting misinformation about the 2020 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19.\n\n\tMeanwhile, in September, Alphabet agreed to pay a total of $24.5 million to settle President Trump’s lawsuit alleging “censorship” over YouTube’s suspension of his channel following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Of that, $22 million was paid to Trump, who designated that the money go toward the construction of his new White House ballroom.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn creating the world of Nia DaCosta’s “Hedda,” hair and makeup artist Sharon A. Martin created a new phrase to explain the aristocratic world of mid-century England. \n\n\t“I coined the phrase ‘classic modernity’ to it because it’s [a] very period [film], but then it could also be [a mix of] today and the period that we had to play with,” said Martin during a Variety Artisans Spotlight presented by Amazon MGM Studios, moderated by Senior Artisans Editor Jazz Tangcay. \n\t\n\n\t“Because we had the two groups of friends, it gave me a lot of scope to play around with the shapes and the looks because I decided that they could be influences of the day,” continued Martin. “George’s friends were a little bit more classic, and Hedda’s friends are looking more to the future. It gave us a good playground.”\n\n\tMartin was joined with fellow “Hedda” artisans, editor Jacob Schulsinger, costume designer Lindsay Pugh, and production designer Cara Brower. Based on Henrik Ibsen’s play of the same name, the film follows Hedda Gabler (Tessa Thompson) as she finds herself torn between her past with an ex-lover and her current life. While location scouting, Brower and DaCosta collaborated on creating the eccentric landscape that Gabler, Eileen Lovborg (Nina Hoss), and George Tasman (Tom Bateman).\n\n\t“Nia is very specific in how she writes the script and how she imagines the environment, the blocking, and how the rooms meet,” says Brower. “She had some specific ideas that she wanted, such as the ballroom with the balcony around and a grand staircase. We were both extremely open to what the style of the house was, and we knew that we wanted something that had some other worldliness to it, romantic qualities, and seemed a little bit eccentric that we hadn’t seen before. When I walked into Flint Hall, I just knew that was the right place because it had everything pretty much that she wanted.”\n\t\n\n\tIn her version, DaCosta flips the classic on its head by gender-switching Gabler’s ex-lover, Eilert into Eileen.\n\n\tIn the early stages of creating Gabler and Eileen’s looks, Pugh wanted their styles to be vastly different, highlighting the emotional journey both characters go through in the film. Pugh says, “There’s a script point that I had to work around that had to be built into the design. I had to think about that in a very subliminal way [but] in a very feminine way, [to] replicate a man’s suit and shirt. [Eileen] was in this world, and she was going to be in a world of men and without anybody ever noticing it.”\n\n\t“[Hedda] maneuvers everything. She manipulates everything, and I wanted the dress to be camouflaged,” says Pugh. \n\n\tThe costume designer also talked about finding the perfect green dress for the titular character. “I wanted her to be camouflaged so she could walk around the room and do whatever she wants to do with people. There was the green under, but on top of it, there was a brand silk tool and a brand laced top. It’s finding that balance because the wrong green could actually drain her. She has this mask that has to stay on, and that was the whole thing about the makeup and hair is that the mask is on, the hair is pulled together. It’s very tight, it’s very straight. She’s holding on to so much of it, and it has to always be just perfect.”\n\n\tMartin notably pointed out that Pugh found the perfect green that would compliment Thompson’s skin tone. She too, found the right shade of red for Thompson’s lips, which stayed the same all the way through. Martin explained how she found the right shade by mixing various lipliners and lipsticks and by seeing what Pugh created. “It’s finding that balance because the wrong green could actually drain her, and so having that green so perfect, then it just kind of added to what I wanted to do to keep her warmth, because she has this mask that has to stay on.” Martin continues, “That was the whole thing about the makeup and hair is that the mask is on, the hair is pulled together. It’s very tight, it’s very straightened. She’s holding on to so much of it. Her lipstick, you never see it being she needed to refresh it or anything. It’s always just perfect and always on.”\n\n\tIn the film, another sequence features a crashing chandelier. Originally it was meant to take place in the ballroom or entry hall, but neither of those spaces worked, especially for the location at Flintham Hall. Brower and DaCosta loved the idea of moving the scene into the glass conservatory — only Gabler would have something as wild as that. “It gave us a reason to use that space too.” Browser goes on to explain how they pulled it off. “We had an engineer come, and then we need to make sure that when it falls, it completely cascades down and doesn’t just fall.” In addition to working out the logistics, Brower and her team put down a full floor so as not to destroy the home. “We hung it very carefully…Everybody was standing behind the monitor in the producer’s room, just waiting. And (cinematograhper) Sean Bobbitt had two cameras set up to make sure we got it from both angles.” Brower continues, “It smashed beautifully.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tFusion Entertainment has added writer and director Elliot Tuttle to its roster of management clients. The move follows the debut of Tuttle’s provocative feature debut “Blue Film,” which premiered at The Edinburgh Film Festival and then screened at NewFest.\n\n\t“Blue Film” is a queer thriller starring Tony winner Reed Birney (“Mass,” “Succession”) and Kieron Moore (“Sex Education”). It follows a camboy named Aaron Eagle (Moore) over the course of one evening through an encounter with a client (Birney) who turns out to have ties to his past.\n\t\n\n\tTuttle is a graduate of Occidental College and is based out of Los Angeles. His narrative podcast, “Lina’s Song,” starred Hari Nef and Dylan Gelula and was executive produced by Mark Duplass. “Blue Film” marks his directorial debut.\n\n\n\tThe film, which Tuttle said was too controversial for many major festivals, earned raves when it debuted. Variety‘s Guy Lodge praised Birney and Moore’s work and wrote that the film is “is an unabashed provocation, but not a hollow one.”\n\n\tThe film was written and directed by Tuttle and produced by Bijan Kazerooni, Will Youmans, Waylon Sall and Adam Kersh, founding partner of Fusion Entertainment. Duplass served as a consulting producer on the project. “Blue Film” is currently seeking distribution, with Submarine Entertainment handling sales.\n\n\t“At Fusion, we’re passionate about championing bold new voices in independent cinema, especially those pushing queer storytelling into uncharted territory. Elliot Tuttle is a singular talent — fearless, provocative and deeply human in his filmmaking. ‘Blue Film’ announces the arrival of an artist unafraid to take risks in pursuit of emotional truth” said Kersh.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWes Bentley is reuniting with Ryan Murphy in the FX series adaptation of “The Shards,” Variety has learned exclusively from sources. \n\n\tBentley will appear alongside previously announced cast members Kaia Gerber, Igby Rigney, Homer Gere, Graham Campbell, and Hayes Warner. The show is based on the book of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis. \n\n\tAccording to sources, Bentley will play Terry, the father of Debbie, who will be played by Warner. \n\t\n\n\tReps for FX and 20th Television declined to comment.\n\n\n\t“The Shards,” a horror novel, centers a fictional serial killer in 1980s Los Angeles while incorporating semi-autobiographical details from Ellis’ upbringing. The novel’s official description via Penguin Random House imprint Knopf reads:\n\n\t“17-year-old Bret is a senior at the exclusive Buckley prep school when a new student arrives with a mysterious past. Robert Mallory is bright, handsome, charismatic and shielding a secret from Bret and his friends even as he becomes a part of their tightly knit circle. Bret’s obsession with Mallory is equaled only by his increasingly unsettling preoccupation with the Trawler, a serial killer on the loose who seems to be drawing ever closer to Bret and his friends, taunting them — and Bret in particular — with grotesque threats and horrific, sharply local acts of violence.” \n\n\tBentley has appeared in three seasons of Murphy’s “American Horror Story” franchise, with the most recent being the show’s sixth season in 2016. In television, he is best known for his starring role in the hit Paramount Network drama “Yellowstone,” in which he played Jamie Dutton across the show’s five seasons. Bentley is primarily known for his roles in films like “American Beauty,” “Interstellar,” and “The Hunger Games.”\n\t\n\n\tHe is repped by WME, Untitled, and Kopeikin Law P.C.\n\n\t“The Shards” was first reported to be in the works at FX back in May, with FX ordering it to series in July. As reported at the time, Murphy is executive producing via Ryan Murphy Productions, while Max Winkler is attached to direct and executive produce. Ellis is also an executive producer, as are Nick Hall, Kathleen McCaffrey, and Brian Young. 20th TV will produce, with Murphy under an overall deal at the studio. \n",

    "body": "\n\t“The Brutalist’s” Emma Laird and “Dunkirk” star Fionn Whitehead are British composers whose frail bond begins to unravel on a Greek island holiday in Alex Burunova’s “Satisfaction,” a psychological drama that has its Greek premiere Nov. 2 at the Thessaloniki Film Festival.\n\n\tThe film, which bowed earlier this year at SXSW, marks the narrative feature directorial debut of Burunova, who also wrote the script and shares a producing credit. Produced by Perfect Circle Films, Driven Equation, Carte Blanche and Constant Production, it will compete for the Golden Alexander in Thessaloniki’s main competition. U.K.-French sales-production outfit Alief is handling world sales, with UTA repping North American rights.\n\t\n\n\t“Satisfaction” follows the tumultuous relationship of Lola (Laird) and Philip (Whitehead), two musicians vacationing on a remote, windswept Greek island during the calm of the off-season. Gradually, a palpable discomfort in their relationship comes into focus, a troubling rift that the duo is careful to dance around. \n\n\n\tThat changes when the couple bears witness to a frightening scene of domestic abuse, followed by a chance encounter with a beautiful stranger, Elena, played by “Holy Spider” star Zar Amir Ebrahimi, that upsets the delicate balance of power between Lola and Philip. Old wounds are reopened, and the couple’s long-buried trauma threatens to finally emerge into the bright Mediterranean sunlight.\n\n\t“Satisfaction” had its genesis in a theater play Burunova directed a decade ago, which followed a couple on vacation “struggling to address the invisible weight between them,” she says. In the process of defining that unseen burden, the director realized “it was something I had buried in myself for years, something I wasn’t ready to face.” \n\t\n\n\tIt would take eight years and more than 100 drafts for Burunova to confront that trauma through “Satisfaction,” a film she calls “a letter to my younger self.” Saying that she felt compelled to write the script to “move through my own experience,” she describes it as an attempt “to take something painful and turn it into a story with a beginning, middle and end.”\n\n\t“Trauma happens to everyone. Everyone has pain,” Burunova tells Variety. “To truly heal from trauma, just facing it isn’t enough. You have to embrace it as part of your story. You have to embrace it as part of who you are and have this real acceptance and be able to say that this happened, and it made me who I am, and for that I am stronger.”\n\n\t“Satisfaction” is set between an unnamed Greek island and East London, where the young couple met two years earlier. There, up-and-coming composer Philip is captivated by the sight of Lola, a rising star at the Music Conservatoire, playing the piano at a house party. Their unexpected connection is complicated by the arrival of Lola’s girlfriend, Angela, played by Adwoa Aboah (“Too Much”). \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFionn Whitehead (l.) and Zar Amir Ebrahimi star in “Satisfaction”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Perfect Circle Films\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe intimacy between the duo nevertheless intensifies, with “Satisfaction” interweaving the heady whirlwind of their London courtship with their growing estrangement in Greece, picking up the thread at a point where Lola is trapped in an increasingly toxic situation — something Burunova compares to “Stockholm syndrome.”\n\n\t“Life is the stories we tell ourselves. Life is the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves,” she says. “And it’s easier to tell yourself that this is fine, and I’m okay, and this is how it should be, or this is what I deserve. And unfortunately, a lot of people who find themselves in situations like Lola, they tell themselves that they don’t deserve better. \n\n\t“It’s easier to stay in this unhealthy thing than to face the truth and face the pain and face the fact that you were wronged by someone you loved,” she continues. “It’s this process of self-erasure, where in order to protect the person you love, you’re willing to betray yourself and tell yourself, ‘I’m fine with this.’”\n\t\n\n\tLola’s growing estrangement — not only from Philip, but from herself — finds a fitting backdrop on the remote Cycladic island of Antiparos, whose “vast seascapes and empty landscapes,” says Burunova, “make you feel so small and insignificant.” The director “felt a really strong emotional and spiritual bond with the island” from the moment she arrived, she says, adding: “When I stepped off the ferry, I had this really strong [feeling of] déjà vu, like I’ve already been there, and I’ve already shot the film.”\n\n\tThe elements and the natural environment of Antiparos are pivotal to “Satisfaction,” with sound designer Javier Umpierrez (“Memoria,” “La Cocina”) recording hundreds of island sounds to help him craft the film’s rich auditory landscape. That’s paired with the lush photography of Hungarian cinematographer Máté Herbai (“On Body and Soul”), who captured the island’s raw natural beauty — including the dramatic churn of the Mediterranean, whose powerful ebb and flow, evoking as it does flux and transformation, offers a fitting metaphor for a film “whose DNA is change and evolution,” according to Burunova. \n\n\t“I think it’s a hopeful message for a story of trauma. We can get stuck in our trauma, but we don’t have to,” she says. “As human beings, we are constantly changing, evolving, shifting. And thank God, because we get to rediscover ourselves and rewrite our story. And then we write the story of who we are.”\n\n\tThe Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.\n",

    "body": "\n\tGuy Ritchie and Jason Statham‘s long-standing relationship is set to extend to a sixth feature film, with the two reuniting for the action-thriller “Viva La Madness,” Variety can confirm.\n\n\tThe film — the plot for which is being kept under wraps — is based on J.J. Connolly’s novel and the author’s sequel to “Layer Cake,” which was adapted into the acclaimed 2004 cult crime drama. However, the film is being billed as a stand-alone, original feature and not a sequel, spin-off or continuation of any previous adaptation of Connolly’s work.\n\t\n\n\t“Viva La Madness” was initiated by Statham and Thomas Benski (“Gangs of London”), who are producing via Punch Palace Pictures and Lumina Studios, alongside Toff Guy Films. Black Bear is also producing and handling international sales on the film, which it’s launching at the upcoming American Film Market. \n\n\n\tProduction is set to kick off in January 2026, with Statham currently the only cast member attached and Ritchie set as writer and director. Producers include Statham for Punch Palace, Benski for Lumina Studios, Ritchie and Ivan Atkinson for Toff Guy Films, John Friedberg for Black Bear. While nothing has been confirmed, the recent expansion of Teddy Schwarzman’s Black Bear into U.S. distribution would see the company a likely candidate to release the film domestically.\n\n\tThe darkly comic book “Viva La Madness,” following an anonymous London drug dealer known as X and filled with sex, scams, narcotics and dirty money, was originally published in 2011. \n\n\tThe original “Layer Cake” movie — based on Connolly’s 2000 novel of the same name — marked the directorial debut of Matthew Vaughn, who produced Ritchie and Statham’s hit gangland breakout “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and its spiritual successor “Snatch.” Critically acclaimed for its cool style and fast-paced editing, “Layer Cake” was led by Daniel Craig, in a role that reportedly helped lead to his casting as James Bond in 2005, and also served as a breakout for Sienna Miller.\n\t\n\n\tA “Layer Cake” sequel with Ritchie and Statham attached has been in talks for well over a decade, with Statham reportedly set to play Craig’s character in initial reports that date back to 2013. \n\n\tHaving launched his career with “Lock Stock,” Ritchie has recently returned to his British crime land roots in recent years with titles such as “The Gentlemen” and its Netflix spinoff series, the Paramount+ show “MobLand” and upcoming title “Wife & Dog.” Alongside “Lock Stock” and “Snatch,” his work with Statham spans the films “Revolver,” “Wrath of Man” and “Operation Fortune.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tYou’ve got… a new owner!\n\n\tAOL, the trailblazing internet company, is being acquired by Italian tech roll-up company Bending Spoons. Bending Spoons is buying AOL from private-equity firm Apollo Global Management, which in 2021 bought Yahoo (inclusive of the AOL brand) from Verizon for $5 billion. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\n\n\n\tDeal terms weren’t disclosed. Bending Spoons is buying AOL for about $1.5 billion, Axios reported. AOL generates around $400 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) with revenue of more than $500 million, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\t\n\n\tAOL currently has about 8 million daily active users and 30 million monthly active users for its news, content and games web portal and email services, according to Bending Spoons. An early leader in internet connectivity, AOL officially shuttered its dial-up internet business on Sept. 30.\n\n\tLast month, Bending Spoons announced a deal to acquire video-hosting provider Vimeo for $1.38 billion in cash. That deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to approvals.\n\n\t“AOL is an iconic, beloved business that’s in good health, has stood the test of time, and we believe has unexpressed potential,” said Bending Spoons CEO and co-founder Luca Ferrari in a statement. “We intend to invest significantly to help the product and the business flourish. Bending Spoons has never sold an acquired business — we’re confident we’re the right long-term steward for AOL, and look forward to serving its large, loyal customer base for many years to come.”\n\t\n\n\tAOL was founded in 1985 as Quantum Computer Services before being renamed America Online in 1989 (and then AOL in 2006). In the high-flying dot-com days, AOL also engineered what is widely considered among the worst mega-mergers ever with its deal for Time Warner to create AOL Time Warner, completed in January 2001, which was valued at a staggering $350 billion at the time. That merger was unwound in 2009.\n\n\tJim Lanzone, CEO of Yahoo Inc., said, “AOL and Yahoo share a great deal of history, and our new team has enjoyed the opportunity to return AOL to growth. This transaction will allow us to focus more deeply on the aggressive roadmaps we have planned for Yahoo’s core products moving forward, while ensuring AOL continues to thrive under new ownership.”\n\n\tReed Rayman, chair of Yahoo’s board and partner at Apollo, said, “Since Apollo Funds acquired Yahoo in 2021, we’ve helped the company drive transformational reinvestment in its digital media assets and consumer technology, producing strong performance across Yahoo’s properties. We believe this transaction positions AOL well for its next phase, while Yahoo accelerates investment in its flagship properties and AI-powered experiences.”\n\n\tTo finance the acquisition of AOL — as well as future M&A deals — Bending Spoons also announced the completion of a $2.8 billion debt financing package from banks including BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, J.P. Morgan, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole CIB and Wells Fargo.\n\n\tBending Spoons’ other digital businesses include Brightcove, Evernote, komoot, Meetup, Remini, StreamYard and WeTransfer. The company, based in Milan, Italy, claims its products have more than 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhile HBO hasn’t yet officially confirmed that Season 4 of “The White Lotus” will shoot in France, Variety has learned that the hit Mike White anthology will indeed next shoot in the country and has even been actively scouting swank locations in two iconic locations: Paris and the French Riviera. \n\n\tSimilar to Season 3 — which shot mainly on the island of Koh Samui with some episodes in Bangkok, where Rick Hatchett (Walton Goggins) prepares a doomed revenge plan — the story of Season 4 will likely unfold mostly in the South of France, with a subplot in Paris. At this point, no hotels have been locked for Season 4, which is still in development and won’t shoot until next year, according to sources.\n\t\n\n\tAlthough the last three seasons have taken place at Four Seasons properties across Hawaii, Sicily and Thailand, Season 4 will go a different route as HBO hasn’t renewed its marketing partnership with Four Seasons hotel chain. \n\n\n\tThe luxury hotels that have been visited in Paris include the iconic Le Lutetia, a five-star property on the Left Bank of the Seine, in the chic neighborhood of Saint-Germain des Pres. Built in 1910, Le Lutetia (now part of the Mandarin Oriental chain), was a second home to a number of iconic figures throughout history, including Charlie Chaplin, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso and Josephine Baker. The other Parisian palace that’s been considered for Season 4 is the Ritz Paris, another five-star hotel which opened its doors in 1898 and was a favorite hangout spot for the likes of Coco Chanel, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Marcel Proust.\n\n\tWhite, who enjoys cultivating some mystery and suspense around his show, gave some enigmatic cue about the location of Season 4 in the “after the episode” clip package that ran on HBO after the Season 3 finale. “For the fourth season, I want to get a little bit out of the crashing waves of rocks vernacular,” he teased. “But there’s always more room for more murders at the White Lotus hotels.” Locations with rocky beaches on the French Riviera include Monaco and Nice. \n\t\n\n\tAs in other seasons that featured wealthy Americans vacationing in idyllic resorts and mingling with local characters, Season 4 will likely showcase some French talent alongside American actors. While the cast is mostly different from one season to another, there’s been some returning characters, such as Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge), Greg (Jon Gries) and Belinda (Natasha Rothwell). It would certainly be amusing to see Charlotte LeBon, the French-Canadian actor who plays Chloé, return in Season 4.\n",

Johnson also said he's concerned the monkeys might end up in someone's backyard and bite a person trying to capture them.\n      \n    \n      \n        \n              \n    \n    \n          Meanwhile, Tulane University sent us an updated statement, saying 21 rhesus macaques were being transported from the Tulane National Biomedical Research Center when the truck crashed.\n      \n    \n          A Tulane spokesperson noted the monkeys were \"not being transported by Tulane, not owned by Tulane, and not in Tulane’s custody.\" The rep also said the \"primates in question were not carrying any diseases and had received recent checkups confirming that they were pathogen-free.\"\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Animals\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                          \n                News\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

That investigation has since been closed, with no arrest or charges.\n      \n    \n          Dan vehemently denied any involvement with child porn ... and says he believes Sia may have \"planted evidence\" in order to restrict his time with their kid.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          As for her sobriety, Sia says she's been sober for over 6 months and insists she has repeatedly agreed to drug testing for both her and Dan, claiming it was Dan who refused to get drug-tested on a regular basis.\n      \n    \n          She says it's true that she suffered from substance abuse 15 years ago, but recovery has been a \"cornerstone\" of her life.\n      \n    \n          She says, \"Dan's attempt to weaponize my past sobriety journey ... serves no legitimate purpose and is intended only to distort the facts and undermine my credibility.\"\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          We broke the story ... the \"Unstoppable\" singer pulled the plug on their marriage back in March, filing for divorce after only 2 years of marriage.\n      \n    \n          At the time, Sia listed \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split and asked for legal and physical custody of their kid. Sia said she was open to visitation for Daniel.Daniel's also been fighting Sia over spousal support ... a couple of weeks ago, he asked the judge to order her to pay him more than $250,000 per month.\n      \n    \n          This is Sia's second divorce. She previously split from Erik Lang back in 2016 after a little over two years of marriage.\n      \n      ",

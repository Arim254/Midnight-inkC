    "body": "\n\tGlen Powell is known for his confident charisma and star power, but early in his career, he found himself so starstruck by Dustin Hoffman that he bombed a script reading with the legendary actor.\n\n\tPowell recounted the humbling story during a recent appearance on “Hot Ones.” “My first week [in Hollywood], I found myself at a dinner sitting next to Dustin Hoffman,” he recalled. “He saw a movie I did called ‘The Great Debaters,’ and the fact that he saw this movie just blew my mind. I was like ‘This is the coolest moment of my entire life.'”\n\t\n\n\tHoffman complimented Powell on his acting and said, “I got something for you. Let’s keep in touch.” “The Graduate” actor followed through. “Literally a couple days later, I got a call at my house from Dustin Hoffman,” says Powell. “And I’m losing my mind. I’m like ‘This is the coolest thing,’ and [Hoffman’s] like ‘I’m gonna invite you to my office and I want you to read for something.'”\n\n\n\tPowell took up the invitation. He visited Hoffman and was presented with some pages to read with him, but the scene quickly turned sour. “I started reading them, but I was so in awe that Dustin Hoffman was sitting across from me,” said Powell. “He’s one of my favorite actors of all time. As I’m reading, I’m watching the life drain from his eyes, being like, ‘This guy sucks so bad.’ And I was like, ‘Oh no.'”\n\n\tThe situation progressed for the worse. “I’m watching him and I’m losing him,” continued Powell. “And then I’m being like, ‘Yeah, you’re losing him,’ and then I look back and I’m losing him even more. And I left so defeated.”\n\t\n\n\tPowell went on to explain that he was able to get over his starstruck tendencies in later auditions when he came to accept actors on all levels as players and performers in pursuit of something fun.\n\n\t“What you start to realize is that all this business is is play. You start looking at these guys as, like, legends, and then you start looking at them as collaborators who are just trying to make magic for audiences around the world, you know?” he said. “I think that’s the difference. I think the excitement of this business hasn’t worn off, but my perspective has.”  \n\n\tWhile Powell is yet to be in a movie alongside Hoffman, he became a recognizable face after sharing the screen with Tom Cruise in 2022’s “Top Gun: Maverick.” He has since starred in the hit romcom “Anyone But You” opposite Sydney Sweeney and the adventure summer blockbuster “Twisters.” He is currently starring in “The Running Man,” directed by Edgar Wright and adapted from a novel by Stephen King.\n\n\tWatch Powell’s full “Hot Ones” interview here:\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tDavid Zucker, who directed the first two “Naked Gun” films, recently told “Woman’s World” he was not impressed by the reboot led by Liam Neeson and Pamela Anderson. He said the film “totally missed” the now-classic spoof style of comedy pioneered by Zucker, his brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams.\n\n\t“My brother, Jerry, and our partner, Jim Abrahams, started doing spoof comedies 50 years ago, and we originated our own style — and we did that so well that it looks easy, evidently,” Zucker explained. “People started copying it, like Seth MacFarlane for the new ‘Naked Gun.’ He totally missed it.”\n\t\n\n\tMacFarlane was one of the leading producers on the project and contributed “additional literary material,” according to IMDb. Lonely Island co-founder Akiva Schaffer directed the film and penned the script with Dan Gregor and Doug Mand.\n\n\n\tZucker also took issue with the production costs of the 2025 “Naked Gun.” The reboot carried a $42 million price tag, while Zucker’s 1988 original cost $14.5 million, according to AFI. However, when adjusted for inflation, $14.5 million comes out to roughly $38 million in 2025, which is not far off from the budget of the new “Naked Gun.”\n\n\t“You shouldn’t spend too much money on comedies, and one of our rules is about technical pizzazz,” Zucker said. “Big budgets and comedy are opposites, and in the new ‘Naked Gun,’ you could see that they spent a lot of money on scenes full of technical pizzazz while trying to copy our style.”\n\n\tThe “Airplane!” director added that he feels the new “Naked Gun” was made exclusively for financial reasons. Zucker asserted, “Everybody’s in it for the money now, and that feels like the only reason why they wanted to do a new ‘Naked Gun.'”\n",

    "body": "\n\tDirector S.S. Rajamouli has unveiled the title and first glimpse of his highly anticipated follow-up to the Academy Award-winning “RRR.”\n\n\tThe filmmaker revealed “Varanasi” at a launch event in Hyderabad, introducing the project that stars Telugu cinema superstar Mahesh Babu alongside Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Prithviraj Sukumaran.\n\n\tThe cool night skies above Ramoji Film City were rent with the roar of 50,000 full-throated Mahesh Babu fans chanting “Jai Babu, Jai Jai Babu,” as the title reveal event got off to a rousing start. \n\t\n\n\tActor-musician Shruti Haasan rendered the already immensely popular “Sanchaari” track from the film on stage, composed by M.M. Keeravani, Oscar-winner for “Naatu Naatu” from “RRR.” \n\n\n\tKeeravani also provided a musical introduction to the character of the main antagonist Kumbha, played by Sukumaran. Chopra Jonas plays a character named Mandakini. Mahesh Babu plays Rudhra. \n\n\tThe footage revealed was played on a giant LED screen, which took a couple of tries to get going, while the fans waited patiently. The film spans thousands of years, from ancient times to the modern day. One of the sequences is inspired by a chapter from Indian epic “Ramayana,” Rajamouli said. \n\n\t“I think that will be one of the most memorable sequences of my films,” Rajamouli said. \n\n\tChopra Jonas and Sukumaran also spoke during the occasion.\n\n\t“This is Indian cinema’s biggest brand, flexing his ambition and the team of technicians and actors going all out to make sure that he reaches that pinnacle he’s aiming for,” Sukumaran said. “This is S.S. Rajamouli once again, taking Indian cinema to the world, this time bigger, hopefully better and definitely more audacious than ever before.”\n\t\n\n\tChopra Jonas added: “Rajamouli-sir, all I will say is you are truly the visionary that has brought Indian cinema to the globe like no one else has before. So I thank you so much for choosing me as your Mandakini.” \n\n\tThe loudest cheers were reserved for Mahesh Babu who said: “I’ll make everyone proud. Most importantly, I’ll make my director the most proud. The whole of India will be proud of us.”\n\n\tThe project is being produced under the banner of Sri Durga Arts and Showing Business.\n\n\tWatch the first footage of “Varanasi” here: \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tCristin Milioti insists she’s not thinking too much about the possibility of “The Penguin” getting a second season.\n\n\t“I feel like I have zero chill about it because every time I’m asked [about a Season 2], I’m like, ‘Sign me up!’” Milioti, who an Emmy for her work on the DC Comics show, told me while promoting her new animated Netflix movie “In Your Dreams.” “I love [series creator] Lauren [LeFranc] so much. I love our whole cast. It’s such an incredible group.”\n\t\n\n\t“The Penguin” star Colin Farrell has consistently maintained that he is in “no rush” for a sophomore run of the series. “I don’t want it. I don’t not want it,” he told me at the SAG Awards in February. “We all left it in the ring in those eight hours. … So I’m in no rush. I have no deep desire to do it.”\n\n\n\tHowever, in July, after the Emmy nominations were announced, HBO and Max boss Casey Bloys told Variety’s Michael Schneider that LeFranc and executive producer Matt Reeves have had discussions about Season 2. Reeves confirmed at the Emmys that conversations occurred, but his current priority is directing the second “The Batman” movie with Robert Pattinson.\n\n\t“In Your Dreams” tackles divorce as two young siblings meet the mythical Sandman in their dreams and ask him to help keep their parents (Milioti and Simu Liu) together as they move towards separating.\n\n\tMilioti first read the script in 2021. “It really moved me to think about how we deal with hardships and how we sometimes want things to be different, and the ways in which we navigate that,” she said.\n\t\n\n\tWhile marriage problems may seem too serious an issue for a family film, Milioti points to other animated movies that tackle deeper subjects.\n\n\t“If you go back and look at some of the Disney films like ‘The Lion King’ – it’s ‘Hamlet.’ And ‘Bambi’? Forget about it,” Milioti said. “That is one of the most special things about this movie and about animation, too. It sort of begins this nuanced conversation with kids like, ‘This can be really hard and scary. This can feel like your world is falling apart and it is changing. But it is not as scary as it might seem.’”\n\n\t“In Your Dreams” is available on Netflix.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tHold onto your oil rigs: “Landman” is back for a second season!\n\n\tThe first season of the Taylor Sheridan drama, which he created with “Boomtown” host Christian Wallace, introduced the world to Tommy Norris, the titular landman played by Billy Bob Thornton. Tommy works for oil company M-Tex, keeping drilling operations moving along — despite constant danger in the oil fields, trouble from the cartels and legal woes. Along the way, we get to know his family — ex-wife Angela (Ali Larter), son Cooper (Jacob Lofland) and daughter Ainsley (Michelle Randolph) — and the economics of the oil biz, from the treacherous West Texas fields to the cutthroat boardrooms. Family matters will take center stage in this second season, as we finally meet Tommy’s father T.L., played by Sam Elliott.\n\t\n\n\tVariety spoke with several members of the cast before the Nov. 16 Season 2 premiere on Paramount+ to answer burning questions about the show’s biggest changes, relationship shifts and that viral moment from Season 1 that shocked the internet.\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat challenges will Tommy face in Season 2?\t\n\n\t“You’re going to see who he really is at the end of the day,” Thornton says. “He’s so busy in Season 1 that there wasn’t much time to take a breath. There are some very human moments in the first season, but this has more. You’re going to see how he deals with family, business, his own mortality, just everything: All the thoughts that go through all humans, and things that you have to go through. First season, Taylor had to set the show up and explain the oil business to the audience. He had to introduce all the characters. Now, you can settle back and really get to know everybody, the family relationships as well as business relationships and the dangerous relationships, all of it.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat will Angela’s journey look like this season?\t\n\n\t“The first season of our show set up oil and the danger and cost to all the families,” Larter says. “The second season, Taylor wrote it about the family. What you realize is that we’re the heartbeat of the show and everything goes around that. With Angela, you go from these dinner scenes, which is how she shows her love and she puts pressure on it. She does it the best she can because she wants everyone to feel it so hard. Then there’s the antics: Tommy is always is going to do something that sets her off. But where we’re going is that we sit on the floor together and the question is, ‘Who are we if we don’t do this? Do we have a real chance at this working?’ Taylor also wrote some really beautiful scenes of connection between Tommy and Angela.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBilly Bob Thornton as Tommy Norris and Ali Larter as Angela Norris in “Landman.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmerson Miller/Paramount+\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow will Ainsley’s role change this season?\t\n\n\t“We meet her when she’s 17 and we are seeing her in her most formative years,” Randolph says. “We are watching her figure out who she is. She has come to the realization that her parents aren’t always perfect. They don’t always know everything. We get to see Ainsley figure out her own identity, her independence, navigate attention, figure out how she wants to be seen in the world. I find that extremely fulfilling as an actress, because I get to grow with her, and I’m not playing a fully-formed person yet. So I get to throw in these little hints of realizations in these scenes. I look through the scripts to try to find those moments as much as possible, so that I can foreshadow her growing up.”\n\t\n\t\tIs the cast already talking about next season, even though it hasn’t even been confirmed yet?\t\n\n\t“I’m looking past Season 2 already,” Elliott says. “We’re here talking about Season 2, but it’s all been done. I’m thinking about what’s to come, and I’m excited about what’s to come. The audience is excited about what’s to come right now. I’m excited about what’s to come next season that we haven’t even done yet. Just having the opportunity to work with all of these cast members, it’s that and the fact that we’ve got this incredible crew — a lot of them are people I worked with before on ‘1883.’ I love going back to Texas and working. There are just so many positive elements to this thing, and it makes it a joy to go to work.”\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s Billy Bob Thornton’s all-time favorite Tommy moment?\t\n\n\t“There are so many of them, it’s hard to remember,” Thornton says. “But I think one of my favorite moments is when Ainsley, we’re at the football game and she’s got the boyfriend there. I’m, of course, a father to a 21-year-old daughter in college right now. So when I hear her say some of these things to me, you don’t have to act much. You just react to it. [Editor’s note: This scene is from the pilot, when Ainsley tells her father about her sex life with her boyfriend, noting that, “As long as he never comes in me, he can come anywhere on me.” Needless to say, this moment went viral.] Plus, Michelle’s as sweet as pie. When we hear that come out of her mouth sometimes… But one way or the other, she’s telling me what she will or will not let the boyfriend do, which I don’t want to hear anything about any of it. And I think maybe my best quote was a stare, and all I can think of to say is, ‘I’m going to go get a Dr. Pepper — you want anything?’ Because I can’t even let myself think right then, you know?”\n\t\n\t\tHow did Michelle Randolph survive shooting that now-viral scene?\t\n\n\t“We filmed so out of order because we had all 10 episodes, so that was midway through the season,” Randolph says. “That day was freezing cold. There was a whole storm. We had 10 minutes to get that shot, and there was a whole group of people behind us in the bleachers. All I could think is these people are hearing this dialogue, and none of them know what this show is about. So I was just honestly kind of mortified as myself, saying these lines out loud to these people. Billy had it easy because all he had to do was walk away, I’d say.”\n\t\n\t\tDoes Sam Elliott do anything to take care of his signature voice?\t\n\n\tNo! “It’s all natural,” he says.\n\n\tWatch the “Landman” Season 2 trailer below.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Landman” airs on Sundays on Paramount+. This interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tNetflix’s latest animated feature, “In Your Dreams,” follows a pair of young siblings as they navigate a fantastical dream world, seeking the mythical Sandman in hopes that he can fix their family. Director Alex Woo, who previously worked as a story artist on Pixar’s “Cars 2” and “Incredibles 2,” makes his directorial debut with a story that is deeply personal.\n\n\t“When I was 6 or 7 years old, I woke up one morning and my mom had her bags packed,” Woo tells Variety of the film’s genesis. “She was at the front door, and I had no idea what was going on. She had to gently explain to me and my brother that she was going away to figure out things for our family. I didn’t really know what that meant, but I knew things were about to change.”\n\t\n\n\tWhen Woo left Pixar in 2016, “In Your Dreams” was one of the first ideas he had. While movies about the dream space have been successfully told (“Inception”), it hadn’t been done in the animated world. Woo was up for the challenge.\n\n\n\tIn the film (now streaming on Netflix), Stevie (voiced by Jolie Hoang-Rappaport) and Elliot (voiced by Elias Janssen), learn that their parents’ marriage is under strain. Mom (Cristin Milioti) wants to move to Duluth to become an assistant professor, while Dad (Simu Liu) wants to stay put. Stevie takes it upon herself to keep the family together, and with her younger brother, uses the dream world to find the Sandman and turn her dream into a reality.\n\n\tAs Woo worked with the creative team, he collaborated closely with production designer Steve Pilcher to bring the world of “In Your Dreams” to life. Flying beds, animated breakfasts, sand creatures and a floating river of ball pit balls were all part of the visual storytelling. While fantastical, everything was grounded in reality. Polly’s Pizzeria was inspired by Woo’s childhood visits to Chuck E. Cheese, and the floating river with animated beavers was inspired by Disney’s “It’s a Small World” ride. \n\t\n\n\tBelow, Woo and Pilcher speak with Variety about their process and how they grounded the animated feature in reality.\n\t\n\t\tAlex, where did “In Your Dreams” begin for you?\t\n\n\tIt coincided with the inception of our company. I left Pixar in 2016 and spent the first year or two dreaming up different ideas for movies and TV shows that we wanted to see. We realized it’s hard to give a dream movie stakes because anything can happen, so that was the big challenge. We knew we wanted to do something in the dream world, but we needed an emotional core to the story. That’s when I brought up this thing that happened to me when I was 6 or 7 years old. I woke up one morning, and my mom had her bags packed. She was at the front door, and I had no idea what was going on. She had to gently explain to me and my brother that she was going away to figure out things for our family. I didn’t really know what that meant, but I knew things were about to change. A lot of this movie was inspired by that experience.\n\t\n\t\tA lot of the stakes take place in the dream world. What conversations did you have about how it would look visually?\t\n\n\tSteve Pilcher: It was based in a real world, obviously, and then a dream world. I talked to Alex about where he grew up, and I went on Google and scoped out Arden Hills, Minnesota and the streets where Alex lived. We looked at all these different parameters to establish this world because when you go to the dream world, you’re going to associate with that and their lifestyle.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ball pit river.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe ball pit river seems very reminiscent of Disneyland’s “It’s a Small World” ride — but in your world, it’s a nightmare. What was the idea behind that?\t\n\n\tWoo: That was very deliberate. Everything in the dream world was based on something in the real world. In the film, they go to Polly’s Pizzeria. I used to go to Chuck E. Cheese a lot and spent a lot of time there as a kid. I loved it. But looking back, it’s janky and comical. That ball pit river is inspired by the experiences I’ve had at Chuck E. Cheese. As a kid, the first time I went to “It’s a Small World,” I found it quite scary because you’re in this dark tunnel. It’s really amazing — you’re seeing all these animatronics and all these set pieces — but as a kid, it can be terrifying because you have no idea where you’re going. That’s why I chose to set the nightmare version of Polly’s Pizzeria in that environment.\n\t\n\n\tPilcher: Whenever they go into the dream world, they’re going there for a purpose, and they’re trying to find the Sandman. We thought a ride was perfect, but let’s use ball pit balls. We took Elliot’s interaction with the “beat a badger” and used that as a motif because you could start with that and turn it into a nightmare.\n\t\n\t\tBreakfast Town is the opposite. It’s colorful and fun, filled with animated food. How did that idea come to life?\t\n\n\tWoo: It was part of the original pitch. The inspiration for it was that my mom used to make french toast for us on Sunday mornings. Stevie represented this perfect happy family time for her. We knew that if that’s what her happy place is, then of course she’s going to have this happy dream.\n\n\tPilcher: One of the things that we did come across early in the boards was that the castle was made out of waffles. We had the idea to turn it into a craft-based world. If a child played and made their own Breakfast Town with their food, Stevie might use milk cartons for buildings. Since it was french toast, the idea was, “Let’s make it a French medieval-themed Breakfast Town.”\n\n\tWoo: Our art director, Rachel Daniels, built a craft-based Breakfast Town using cardboard and milk cartons to get a sense of scale and how the materials would look. She’d take shots using her phone. So we did a lot of research, because that’s the only way you can make it feel authentic.\n\n\tPilcher: We also found that certain elements took us out of the film. What would a child use? White glue, popsicle sticks, construction paper — crudely cut out and stuck on a milk carton.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBreakfast Town\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetflix\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen they meet the Sandman, it’s an interesting visual. How hard is it to animate sand, especially in this world where you have sandcastles, sandling creatures and the Sandman himself?\t\n\n\tWoo: It was a huge challenge. It was, “How do you differentiate the Sandman, the sandlings and their environment, and not make it feel like one big brown mush?”\n\n\tPilcher: When you have characters like the Sandman and the sandlings, they’re curve-based characters. To complement that, you use straights, which we decided to build out of cubes. It’s cube-based everywhere. The design of the sandcastles was based on sand buckets — when you fill them with sand and turn them upside down, you get that pyramid shape.\n\t\n\n\tWoo: With the sandlings, they had an inner glow, so that helped separate them from the background. They’re live characters, whereas the castle was a dead object, so there was no light inside the castle.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tI feel there are a ton of Easter eggs in the film. Do you have one that sticks out for you?\t\n\n\tPilcher: In the pizza place, there are “Go! Go! Cory Carson” rides that the kids go on. We thought we’d include that because it’s Netflix.\n\n\tWoo: There are “Go! Go! Cory Carson” stickers on Elliot’s bed. The idea is that when he was 5, he watched that show and put the stickers all over his bed. Also, when we’re first introduced to Stevie and she’s getting ready, she high-fives a lucky cat. There’s a post-it on there that says, “Find your retainer.” She ends up finding it in Breakfast Town, behind the fridge.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrague-based sales outlet Filmotor has secured international sales rights to Ukrainian filmmaker Dmytro Sukholytkyy-Sobchuk’s documentary “Silent Flood,” ahead of its world premiere in IDFA’s International Competition.\n\n\tThe film focuses on a religious community based in a beautiful river canyon in Western Ukraine. It’s a sunny village filled with the laughter of children from large families. Yet, the community’s peaceful life is frequently disrupted by floods and war. Both are relentless forces that take lives. The community comes together to overcome the aftermath of floods. The floods alter community life, just as the country is reshaped by war.\n\t\n\n\tTogether with the community, we observe transformations, where the current war intertwines with the past ones, but the feeling of home can never be taken away from anyone.\n\n\n\t“I’ve always been drawn to the invisible connections between people and the places they inhabit,” Sukholytkyy-Sobchuk said. “ ‘Silent Flood’ grew out of that fascination — with a secluded riverside community that lives in deep harmony with nature, yet always at the mercy of its forces. I first discovered this hidden village years ago during my river expeditions, and it felt like returning to my own childhood, to a time that had somehow stopped. The people there welcomed me with such openness and sincerity that I kept coming back. Their world, shaped by floods and now by war, reflects how fragile and cyclical life can be — a reminder that nothing truly stays untouched.”\n\n\t“We have been following the ‘Silent Flood’ project since 2022, while it was in development, attracted by the subtle allegory behind the story, and the result is far beyond expected. It is a fascinating cinematic feast with a unique storyline and pace,” Petar Mitric of Filmotor said.\n\t\n\n\tThe film is produced by Karina Kostyna and Eugene Rachkovsky for Ukraine’s Tabor, and co-produced by Tanja Georgieva-Waldhauer for Germany’s Elemag Pictures. MDR Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk also co-produces, in collaboration with Arte.\n\n\tSukholytkyy-Sobchuk’s first feature, “Pamfir,” was developed by TorinoFilmLab, Midpoint and Cinefondation Residence and was selected for Directors’ Fortnight in Cannes in 2022. The film was nominated in the European Discovery category of the European Film Awards.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTodd Snider, a singer-songwriter who had been a leading light of the Americana music scene for three decades, captivating fans with songs like “Alright Guy,” has died at age 59, it was announced Saturday morning.\n\n\tThe news was announced on his social media accounts and confirmed by friends. No cause of death was given, although his family had announced on social media Friday that Snider had been hospitalized with pneumonia. \n\n\n\tFriends famous and otherwise quickly began to weigh in with shock and heartbreak. “Freak flags at half-staff for the Storyteller and all the songs he still had left to write. I sure did love him,” wrote Jason Isbell on Threads. “No. I refuse to accept the loss of Todd. I refuse,” wrote Adeem the Artist. Said Aaron Lee Tasjan, who recently produced a record for Snider, “I don’t know if anyone has ever been as good to me in my life as you were. … My music wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for you.”\n\t\n\n\tThat report of what the family called “walking pneumonia” followed a concerning series of headline-making events that had included an arrest in Utah as he tried to regain admittance to a hospital after being discharged, at what would have been his second tour stop. The tour was brought to a halt after just one date.\n\n\n\tA statement on Snider’s Facebook and Instagram pages read: “Aimless, Inc. Headquarters is heartbroken to share that our Founder, our Folk Hero, our Poet of the World, our Vice President of the Abrupt Change Dept., the Storyteller, our beloved Todd Daniel Snider has departed this world. Where do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases? Always creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.”\n\t\n\n\tThe statement continued, “He relayed so much tenderness and sensitivity through his songs, and showed many of us how to look at the world through a different lens. He got up every morning and started writing, always working towards finding his place among the songwriting giants that sat on his record shelves, those same giants who let him into their lives and took him under their wings, who he studied relentlessly. Guy Clark, John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, Jerry Jeff Walker…\n\n\t“How do we move forward without the one who gave us countless 90 minute distractions from our impending doom?” the statement concluded. “The one who always had 18 minutes to share a story. We’ll do it by carrying his stories and songs that contain messages of love, compassion, and peace with us. Today, put on one of your favorite Todd Snider records and ‘play it loud enough to wake up all of your neighbors or at least loud enough to always wake yourself up.’ We love you Todd, sail on old friend, we’ll see you again out there on the road somewhere down the line. You will always be a force of nature.”\n\n\tLess than 24 hours before his death was reported, a statement on his Facebook page from “Todd’s friends and family” reported: “We have some difficult news to share. After Todd returned home to recover last week, he began having trouble breathing and was admitted to the hospital in Hendersonville, TN. We learned from his doctors that he had been quietly suffering from an undiagnosed case of walking pneumonia. Our beloved brother’s condition has become more complicated, and he’s since been transferred for additional treatment. His care team and those closest to him are by his side and doing everything they can. Right now we’re asking everyone who loves Todd to hold him in your thoughts in whatever way feels right to you. Say a prayer, light a candle, roll one up, send strength, or just keep him close in your heart. You’ve carried him through so much over the years, and he needs that from all of us now more than ever.”\n\n\tPrior to recent events, Snider had openly discussed the difficulty of dealing with chronic pain resulting from spinal stenosis.\n\n\tOn Nov. 3, Snider’s team announced that his tour was being canceled, saying that before the planned Salt Lake City show, “Todd sustained severe injuries as the victim of a violent assault outside of his hotel. Todd will be unable to perform for an undetermined amount of time… We appreciate your understanding as Todd receives needed medical treatment.”\n\t\n\n\tSubsequently, it was revealed that Snider had been arrested and booked for disorderly conduct. Body cam footage of his arrest outside the hospital was released and shared on news accounts, showing Snider plaintively telling officers that he was in pain. When officers asked if he was homeless, Snider said that he was “famous” but that the band he was touring with had gone home without him following the cancellation of the tour date. Salt Lake police told local reporters that they did not have a police record of the assault referred to in the press release.\n\n\tSnider’s most recent album, the one he was due to tour behind, was “High, Lonesome and Then Some,” released Oct. 17 on his Aimless label through Thirty Tigers.\n\n\tAmong the many artists who championed Snider was Jimmy Buffett, who signed the singer to his Margaritaville label, with a debut album produced by Tony Brown and Mike Utley, “Songs for the Daily Planet,” coming out in 1994. The album included Snider’s first airplay success, “Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues,” which impacted the album-rock chart.\n\n\tAfter leaving Margaritaville and detours with Island and MCA, Snider was signed to John Prine’s label, Oh Boy Records, releasing his fourth album, the Paul Kennedy-produced “Happy to Be Here,” for the imprint in 2000. He realized what many considered his greatest success with the album “East Nashville Skyline” in 2004.\n\n\tIn 2006, on the heels of the album “The Devil You Know,” Snider was nominated for artist of the year at the Americana Honors & Awards.\n\n\tHe launched his own label, Aimless, in 2008 with the EP “Peace Queer,” which went to No. 1 on the Americana airplay chart.\n\n\tSnider was known to fans of the Adult Swim animated series “Squidbillies” for his frequent appearances in season 5, including playing both Lobster Freak and himself and singing the show’s theme song in one episode.\n\n\tIn 2014, through De Capo, he published a memoir, “I Never Met a Story I Didn’t Like: Mostly True Tall Tales.” A book about his work, “East Nashville Skyline: The Songwriting Legacy of Todd Snider,” was published by Texas A&M University Press earlier this year.\n\n\tHis most recent full-length album was the acclaimed “First Agnostic Church of Hope and Love,” issued in 2021. It debuted at No. 36 on Billboard’s album sales chart and was described by Rolling Stone as “a raw portrait of a world-class songwriter processing calamity and chaos in real time.”\n\t\n\n\tSnider’s themes were social even more than romantic, registered in titles like his early-2000s cult favorite of a tune, “Conservative Christian, Right Wing, Republic, Straight, White American Male.” He often dealt with themes of religion and hypocrisy in his work, clearly reflected in how the word “agnostic” made it into two album or EP titles, “First Agnostic Church of Hope and Love” and, earlier, 2012’s “Agnostic Hymns & Stoner Fables.” (On that record, Snider returned a favor to Jimmy Buffett by covering his “West Nashville Grand Ballroom Gown.”)\n\n\tWhen Snider released the nine-song “High, Lonesome and Then Some” a little less than a month before his death, he spoke in his artist bio of a harsh reality: “I sing about dead friends more than girls these days,” referring to songs about bygone friends like Neil Casal,\n\n\tHe was profiled in Rolling Stone in October, candidly discussing some of his challenges with both the pain that often kept him off the road and personal relationships. Josh Crutchmer wrote that the troubadour was “working through baggage, assessing broken relationships and confronting the notions of loneliness and desolation head-on.”\n\n\t“It’s all heartache,” Snider told Crutchmer. “I wouldn’t say I’m better, and I don’t think I’m going to get better, but the last decade was hard in my personal life. In the last couple of years, it’s gotten harder, and I felt like the title. I sat out here by myself and had, like, a dark night of the soul.”\n\n\tOf the tour that ended up only lasting for one date, Snider said, ““I told my team that I want this tour to be the funnest one. I at least want to do it one more time. After that, I may just have to do one show at a time, but that’s been coming for a while. I’ve got this arthritic shit they call stenosis, which makes it painful all over… I do a lot of things to try to help it, but I have to make peace with it, too. Which hasn’t been easy.”\n\n\tKen Tucker of NPR, one of Snider’s many critic fans, singled out what he felt was a telltale line from the album “Agnostic Hymns and Stoner Fables” 13 years ago. Said Tucker, “If one line could sum up the album, it’s ‘It ain’t the despair that gets you / It’s the hope.’”\n\n\n\tFor all the darkness that crept into his work, expressed seriously or in mordant wit, Snider was known for his high-spiritedness among the friends to whom he remained committed. Aaron Lee Tasjan wrote a touching tribute on social media:\n\t\n\n\tWhen I met you it was 2006. You were opening for Kevn. It was Thanksgiving and we were all in Athens.When you sang Train Song, you leveled the place. You were on stage all by yourself. I had listened to you for years but it was first time seeing you live. I saw what I wanted to do for the rest of my life that night. Because of you and Kevn, I am doing it.\n\n\tWhen I moved to East Nashville ten years ago, it was cause of you.I got to town and slept in your old bed.I wanted more than anything to be like you like how you were with Jerry Jeff.At first you didn’t like that. You told Larry I wasn’t allowed to open for you.But then you let me open for you after all.I cried when you sent me that email about Don’t Walk Away.You said I could come with you to Black Mountain. I would follow you anywhere. My heart breaks that I can’t go where you are now. \n\n\tYou came to be the one I turned to.When the label was doubting me you sent me an email and all it said was “you were made for this.”Later, you told me Jerry Jeff sent you a letter that said the same thing once.It made me cry when you told me that. You made me cry a lot.\n\n\tWhen I didn’t think anyone would wanna see me play solo you invited me on yet another tour to give me the chance to get better at my solo shows in front your audience.You never gave me advice but you always encouraged me.Do you have any idea how rare and special you were?\n\n\tWhen my van broke down last summer, your fans gave me the money to fix it.You let me share your world and had me up with you to sing Paradise.Your fans have been so nice to me because of you.You let me play for them and meet them and become friends with them.That makes me cry, too.\n\n\tLast year you wanted to get together and try to figure out how to sing country songs really slow.Those days you and I spent at the Purple just the two of us figuring out how to count the songs with all that space in them were some of the best days of my life.You threatened to record 12 Bar Blues but you didn’t. I never told you the original title of that song was ‘Owed To Todd Snider.’\n\n\tThen I came out to your house with Joe and Robbie and Stacie and Sterling and Brian and Erica and Brooke and we all made High Lonesome & Then Some.You got mad at me cause I had my prescription sun glasses on.I know its cause I was somebody you felt safe enough with to get mad at.You knew I loved you no matter what and knew you were safe.You felt bad about getting mad at me afterwards and apologized a million times.I have no idea what I’m gonna do without you, now.Are you back with Handsome John, now?Is Guy there, too?Remember at Blackbird when Guy said, “Where’s the guy we usually have?” That was hilarious. Remember when you handed me his guitar and I immediately dropped it?You just laughed. You had an Aaron Lee Tasjan t-shirt on.You were so good to me, man.I don’t know if anyone has ever been as good to me in my life as you were. I don’t know how to deal with not being able to talk to you anymore. I am so grateful I got to have you in my life for almost 20 years here on earth.Rest assured, you’ll be with me till the day I’m gone.My music wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for you.I miss you already. I love you forever. I know you’re laughing in your sleep, now.Goodbye, my brother. You’re still it for me. The best one.\n",

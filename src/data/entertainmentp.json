    "body": "\n\tMuch has been made in recent weeks about former Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes’ now-famous quip likening Netflix to Albania. \n\n\tIn 2012, Bewkes dismissed talk of Netflix challenging HBO’s dominance in premium TV as being akin to the potential for the “Albanian army to take over the world.” Well, Albania has risen. On Dec. 5, Netflix unveiled a megabucks merger agreement that many in the industry never thought they’d see. Netflix’s effort to takeover Warner Bros. and HBO Max is a vivid example of how dramatically the world has changed, and how quickly power dynamics can shift. \n\t\n\n\tNetflix will have to fight for its prizes. Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison will not go quietly; he launched a hostile takeover effort after being rebuffed by the Warner Bros. Discovery board in favor of Netflix. \n\n\n\tBut those of us with long memories can’t help wondering if it had to be this way for Warner Bros. Discovery — or WarnerMedia or Time Warner or AOL Time Warner, as the company has been variously known over the past 25 years. \n\n\tThe sale to Netflix marks the first time that Warner Bros. and HBO will be subsumed into an existing entertainment brand. In 2018, when Time Warner was acquired by AT&T, the parent company had no other significant entertainment assets. The same was true in 2001 when AOL swallowed up Time Warner in a $100 billion deal that was then the biggest corporate merger (and eventually, one of the biggest slayers of shareholder value) of all time. \n\n\tThe merger mania of the past 25 years has its roots in an earlier landmark deal — the 1989 pact that brought Time Inc. and Warner Communications together as what was then the world’s biggest media conglomerate. \n\t\n\n\tSteven J. Ross, the head of Warner who took the reins of the combined company, extolled the virtues of bringing Time Inc.’s unparalleled journalism brands and HBO together with a Hollywood studio. In each subsequent deal, the triumphant CEO has said basically the same thing: Bigger is better. One plus one will equal four, and oh, by the way, we can save money by eliminating overlapping operations (aka jobs). \n\n\tBut at this juncture, it seems like all that pressure on WB-HBO to be the biggest media concern and maintain its fearsome market share was what kept it from seeing the future — or recognizing that the Albanian army was starting to amass troops at the border. \n\n\tBy the mid-1990s, after it bought CNN and Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner became media’s equivalent of a financial institution that was too big to fail. The focus on maintaining that size and scale made it blind to innovation, even though each was meant to unlock wondrous new possibilities. HBO, to its credit, was a pioneer in making its shows available in an on-demand format on traditional cable, albeit with clunky technology. But both HBO and Warner Bros. were caught flat-footed by the consumer-friendly streaming revolution that Netflix ushered in more than a decade ago. \n\n\t“The media industry should be embarrassed for their lack of imagination, guts and strategic thinking,” recently wrote analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson, who worked at Time Warner in the early 1990s. “Time Warner had all the pieces to create the next great online business, the next great video streaming platform and even the next great streaming audio company,” Nathanson wrote. “What they had in world-class assets, they sorely lacked in managerial discipline, technology skills and an investor base willing to suffer deep losses to build these assets.” \n\n\tAs three big companies and one billionaire CEO go to war over this next chapter of the streaming wars, it’s high time to question the “bigger is better” model for media, given the track record. \n\n\tNetflix, consider yourself on notice.\n\n\t(Pictured: Former Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin and AOL chief Steve Case announce the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001)\n",

    "body": "\n\tYouTube TV’s base package currently costs $82.99 per month. But early next year, the streaming service will roll out a range of cheaper options for people who want only a subset of live TV channels — including packages centered on sports, news, kids and family, and entertainment.\n\n\tIn early 2026, YouTube plans to launch YouTube TV Plans, a collection of over 10 genre-specific packages. That will include the YouTube TV Sports Plan, which will include top broadcast networks, sports networks like Fox Sports 1, NBC Sports Network, all of the ESPN networks — as well as ESPN Unlimited. In addition, subscribers can purchase add-ons like NFL Sunday Ticket and NFL RedZone.\n\t\n\n\tBut YouTube isn’t yet offering pricing or full details of channels that will be in each of the YouTube TV Plans, which will be critical in determining how popular they prove to be.\n\n\n\tThe internet-TV service’s intent to introduce the cheaper plans was previously revealed last month after YouTube inked a carriage renewal with Disney after a bruising two-week blackout: According to Disney, “select networks” from the Mouse House will be included in genre-specific packages being devised by YouTube TV. Under that agreement, YouTube TV customers on the baseline plan will have access to ESPN’s full lineup of sports including content from ESPN Unlimited by end of 2026.\n\n\tThe slimmed-down YouTube TV Plans will include many features of the core service, including unlimited DVR recording space and a multiview option. The YouTube TV Sports Plan also will include the key plays rewatch feature and fantasy view.\n\t\n\n\t“TV should be easy, giving viewers greater control over what they want to watch,” Christian Oestlien, YouTube VP, head of subscriptions, wrote in a blog post about the new plans. “Our goal is to let you tailor your subscription with more options. Whether you stick with our main YouTube TV plan with 100+ channels, focus on sports, combine sports and news, or select a plan centered on family or entertainment content, subscribers will be able to easily choose the plan that works best for them.”\n\n\tYouTube TV isn’t breaking new ground with the skinnier genre packages. For example, DirecTV offers an array of “Genre Packs,” including less-expensive packages for sports, entertainment, kids, news and entertainment.\n\n\tIn addition, TV streaming provider Fubo — now majority owned by Disney, which is merging Hulu + Live TV operations with Fubo — sells cheaper sports and sports-and-news plans. The backstory here: Disney announced the deal with Fubo to form the live-TV joint venture in January 2025; under that agreement, Fubo dropped its antitrust lawsuit seeking to block Venu Sports, the sports-focused streaming venture from Disney, Fox Corp. and Warner Bros. Discovery. Those companies dissolved the Venu JV shortly thereafter.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCheryl Hines expanded on why she hasn’t spoken to “Curb Your Enthusiasm” co-star Larry David since the series finale in April 2024, saying, “I think he’s mad … because Bobby’s in the administration.”\n\n\tHines was referring to her husband, Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom, ironically, David introduced to Hines more than two decades ago. David, a loud and proud liberal, made it clear during Kennedy’s presidential bid that he did not support his policies. Then Kennedy joined the Trump administration, of which David has been a vocal critic. Hines, who played David’s wife (and then ex-wife) Cheryl on 12 seasons of “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” has previously said she hasn’t spoken to David in more than a year.\n\t\n\n\t“I actually think I would be fine talking to Larry,” Hines added, speaking in an interview with NewsNation. “Somebody asked me, ‘What would happen if you walked into a restaurant and he was there?’ I would be happy to see him and I’d say hi and we’d talk for a second.”\n\n\n\tHines then seemed to downplay her friendship with David, saying, “It’s not like Larry and I used to play pickleball and we don’t now. You know what I mean? I would really see him at work or things like that once in a while, have lunch, but I haven’t really been around in L.A. the same time he has, so I don’t know. I’m sure things would be fine with us. And at the same time, I’m sure he’s not happy about politics.”\n\n\tKennedy, who now leads the U.S. health department, has long been a skeptic of vaccine science. Throughout his tenure, he has cut funding toward medical research and eliminated thousands of full-time jobs. He has drawn harsh criticism from other members of the Kennedy family.\n\t\n\n\tHines, who released the memoir “Unscripted” earlier this year, was also asked about whether she feels “shunned” from Hollywood due to her husband’s political career. The actor, who also had roles in “RV” and “Bad Moms,” said there are many people in the entertainment industry who have privately supported her. \n\n\t“There are a lot of people who have been great to me, who reach out to me,” she said. “They range from, ‘Oh my gosh, this is crazy, are you OK?’ to ‘I love what your husband’s doing and I’m behind you guys 100%.'”\n\n\tShe continued, “Yes, I do have a few friends that I know are just very upset by even Bobby being in the administration. It’s very upsetting to them, and I understand that, I respect it. I haven’t had any falling outs. I haven’t had a moment of somebody storming out the door.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWho do you believe? The battle for control of Warner Bros. and HBO is coming down to an enormous bet on competing visions of the future of the entertainment industry. \n\n\tOn Dec. 5, Netflix landed a whale of a deal that sent shock waves through the community. The streamer that has upended traditional Hollywood is planning to join the ranks of studio owners with an $87.2 billion agreement to acquire Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Netflix had managed to outflank David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, which for nearly four months had been making increasingly rich offers for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including linear TV networks like CNN, TNT, HGTV and Food Network. \n\t\n\n\tEllison — angered by what he felt was an unfair sales process conducted by the Warner Bros. Discovery board and chief David Zaslav — played his next chess move on Dec. 8: Paramount announced a hostile takeover bid of $30 a share for WBD, a proposed pact with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. “We’re taking our offer directly to shareholders because they deserve transparency and the ability to make an informed decision,” Ellison told investors and analysts on a call, noting that WBD had not responded in any way to his company’s latest offer. “Our proposal is superior to Netflix’s in every dimension.” \n\n\n\tSarandos, at least publicly, was unruffled. “Today’s move was entirely expected,” he said at a UBS investor conference hours after Paramount made its move. “We have a deal done. We’re super confident we’re going to get it across the line and finish.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrian Stauffer for Variety\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe trenches have been dug, and it will likely be weeks or months before it becomes clear what will happen to Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD said its board will review Paramount’s competing proposal (as required by law) and will issue a recommendation in 10 business days, by Dec. 19. But for the time being, Warner Bros. Discovery is still officially supporting the Netflix deal. \n\t\n\n\tThe duel between Netflix and Paramount (and who knows if others will emerge) is shaping up to be the most contentious M&A brawl since the early 1990s, when John Malone and Barry Diller scrapped with Sumner Redstone over the acquisition of Paramount Pictures (with Redstone’s Viacom ultimately sealing the deal for the studio). \n\n\tIn the war for Warner Bros., against the swirling backdrop of egos, money and market power, there’s another X factor: President Donald Trump, who has exerted control over federal agencies. On Dec. 7, while making his way down the red carpet for the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump declared that “I’ll be involved” in the approval process for the Netflix deal. \n\n\tAccording to Trump, Sarandos visited the Oval Office last week. During the meeting, the Netflix co-CEO sought to reassure the president that his company would not amass anything close to monopoly power — and that other media conglomerates would still be bigger than Netflix com bined with WB and HBO Max. Sarandos is “a fantastic man,” Trump said at the Kennedy Center. “I have a lot of respect for him, but it’s a lot of market share.” He added, “It could be a problem.” \n\n\tMeanwhile, Trump is friendly with Ellison and his billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “They’re big supporters of mine,” Trump has boasted, and the president publicly praised David Ellison, saying, “He’ll do a great job” as CEO of the merged Skydance Media-Paramount. The Ellisons surely have been bending his ear in trying to persuade him to oppose Netflix’s WB gambit on anti-competitive grounds. \n\n\tBut in a surprise turn, the Ellisons faced Trump’s lash — a sign of the fickle environment in D.C. in which the megamerger will be evaluated. The president slammed Paramount over an interview that ran on the Dec. 7 episode of “60 Minutes” featuring Georgia politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump friend-turned-foe. “My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP,” Trump fumed in a Truth Social post. \n\n\tOn Monday, asked if he supported Paramount’s deal for WBD, Trump told reporters at a White House briefing, “I don’t know enough about it. I know the companies very well. I know what they are doing. But I have to see,” saying he has to look at how each proposed deal would impact market share for Netflix and Paramount Skydance.\n\t\n\n\tTrump added, “I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine. You know, I want to do what’s right.”\n\n\t\n\t\tInside the Auction \t\n\n\tEllison, chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, miscalculated in the fall when he triggered the bidding war for Warner Bros. by making an unsolicited offer to buy the company. \n\n\tEllison’s theory was that, fresh off Skydance Media’s completion of the Paramount Global acquisition in August, he could move fast to preempt rival bidders by offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety ahead of WBD’s planned split into two parts next year. He knew other parties — which ended up being Comcast and Netflix — would be interested in buying just WBD’s streaming and studio divisions, and Ellison believed his was the cleaner, more compelling offer. In addition to the Ellison family’s backing, Paramount’s offer included $24 billion in funding from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. \n\n\tBut Ellison’s gambit drew out other bidders. During the auction process, Netflix’s two CEOs, Sarandos and Greg Peters, played their cards closer to the vest. In public, they were noncommittal about their interest in Warner Bros., even as they were already in touch with WBD about a potential deal. \n\n\tPeters, at a conference in early October, downplayed the company’s desire to grow through a major acquisition. “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers — they don’t have an amazing track record over time,” he said. \n\n\tEllison, meanwhile, let it be known that going after Warner Bros. Discovery was all part of a master plan to scale Paramount to a global player. \n\n\tAfter chatter that Zaslav was leaning toward Netflix, Ellison and his team grew concerned they were losing the deal — and they were frustrated, as they felt they offered the higher premium and had been open about the importance of WBD to the larger strategic plan for Paramount Skydance. Paramount lawyers, in a Dec. 3 letter to Zaslav that was leaked to the press, alleged the board of Warner Bros. Discovery undertook a “myopic” bidding process “with a predetermined outcome” that favored Netflix. WBD’s lawyers responded that the board had “fully and robustly complied” with its fiduciary obligations. \n\n\tIn a last-ditch scramble, Paramount extended its $30/share offer to WBD on Dec. 4. It was the sixth offer Paramount made to Warner Bros. over a 12-week span. “It would be the honor of a lifetime to be your partner and to be the owner of these iconic assets,” Ellison had texted Zaslav that day, according to a Paramount SEC filing revealing details of the M&A campaign.\n\t\n\n\tEllison never received a reply.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2021\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArt Streiber\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn the end, the Warner Bros. Discovery board got what it wanted in Netflix: a pedigreed, market-leading buyer with a solid financial foundation and a clear strategic need to make the most of Warner Bros. and HBO. Netflix’s bid of $27.75 a share for Warner Bros.’ streaming and studios arms was deemed higher than Paramount’s final offer of $30 a share for all of WBD (inclusive of the TV networks). \n\n\tShortly after 5 a.m. PT last Friday, Sarandos jumped on a conference call with Wall Street analysts to tout the monster deal Netflix — once dismissed by the Hollywood establishment as a wannabe power player — had negotiated. “I know some of you are surprised that we’re making this acquisition,” Sarandos said on the predawn call, sounding exhausted but ebullient. \n\n\tThe blockbuster deal, Sarandos enthused, would combine Warner Bros.’ “incredible library of shows and movies” — ranging from classics like “Casablanca” and “Citizen Kane” to modern hit franchises like Harry Potter and “Friends” — with Netflix’s “culture-defining titles,” such as “Stranger Things,” “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Squid Game.” Under the pact, Netflix also would get the Warner Bros. Games division and the legendary Warner Bros. lot in Burbank. \n\n\tSarandos had been up late the night before, putting the final touches on the WB deal after several marathon days of phone and video calls, emails and text-message chains. Netflix buttoned up the agreement with WBD and Zaslav at around 7 p.m. PT on Dec. 4. \n\n\tAmong the final hurdles to securing the initial agreement was WBD’s insistence that Netflix commit to a record-setting $5.8 billion breakup fee should the deal run into resistance, regulatory or otherwise. \n\n\tNetflix said it expects to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations “and build on its strengths,” including maintaining theatrical releases for WB films. Currently, Warner Bros. has deals to release its movies in cinemas through 2029. In the near term, Netflix also will keep HBO Max as a discrete service. “Nothing is changing today,” the company told its millions of customers in an email sent Friday. \n\n\tBut anyone who has experienced a Hollywood merger in recent decades knows that no matter what is said in the moment, the long-term arc of any business leans toward streamlining and eliminating redundancies. Netflix expects to see $2 billion-$3 billion in cost savings annually by the third year after the WB deal closes. \n\t\n\n\tParamount said it saw upwards of $6 billion in cost synergies if it merged with Warner Bros. Discovery. And that, of course, signals looming layoffs on top of the thousands of job cuts the industry has seen in recent years. \n\n\t\n\t\tBacklash Against Netflix \t\n\n\tOpposition to the Netflix-WB deal assembled swiftly and fiercely across Hollywood, arising from unions, actors, directors, theater owners, consumer watchdogs and politicos on both sides of the aisle. Fueling the objections: In addition to the deal buttressing Netflix’s already formidable streaming lead with HBO Max and giving it control over the output of a major studio, Netflix has long shown an antipathy toward putting movies in theaters. \n\n\tEven if Netflix is derailed in its plans to swallow Warner Bros. — by Ellison’s rival bid or by regulatory agencies — the company has demonstrated a major flex. The fact that the 28-year-old streaming provider is now poised to own one of the biggest and oldest Hollywood studios cements the primacy of direct-to-consumer entertainment. \n\n\tNetflix, Sarandos suggested, can pull Warner Bros. and HBO into the future. “I think our more modern approach to the business model to connect people with these great stories is going to be a big win for all — every constituent involved,” he told investors. \n\n\tBut movie theater operators are not feeling as upbeat, to put it mildly. Some theater owners are openly rooting against Netflix’s chance to vacuum up Warner Bros. The proposed deal “poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business,” Michael O’Leary, CEO of trade group Cinema United, said in a statement. It will, he said, hurt theaters “from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world.” \n\n\tWarners has been on a roll this year. It has been No. 1 in movie market share after releasing hits like “Sinners,” “A Minecraft Movie,” “Superman” and “Weapons” in theaters. Netflix does release some movies in theaters, but on hundreds of screens (or fewer), not thousands as with a typical wide release. And Netflix mainly debuts original movies in theaters to qualify for Oscars. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNetflix CEO Ted Sarandos at The Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood in March\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArt Streiber for Variety Magazin\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSarandos didn’t exactly give a ringing endorsement of the theatrical experience — which he earlier this year dubbed “outdated” — even as he promised to honor Warner Bros.’ commitments to release upcoming films in cinemas. “I think, over time, the windows will evolve to be much more consumer-friendly, to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker,” he said Friday. \n\n\tDavid Ellison is trying to mine industry discontent over Netflix’s Warner Bros. play. On Monday Paramount pledged to release more than 30 films in theaters if it wins WBD — a swipe at Netflix. “Our focus is on expanding creative output, not dominating the sector, as Netflix envisions,” Ellison said. \n\t\n\n\tSEE ALSO: Paramount Claims WBD Is Overvaluing CNN, TBS and Other TV Networks — Alleging That Means Netflix’s Deal Is Worse for Shareholders\n\n\tIf the Warner Bros. deal with Netflix goes through as outlined, Zaslav will eventually lose his CEO perch. It’s not known what role he might have if Paramount’s bid prevails. \n\n\tBut if Zaslav does exit in the wake of a sale, he’ll gain many millions of dollars from stock and options and a bonus payout, as will senior WB and HBO execs. And if Netflix is the winning party, Zaslav also will have the satisfaction of having gone out on his own terms. Zaslav has been telling friends and colleagues that he’s focused on helping to get the Netflix merger to the finish line and to deliver a healthy Warner Bros. and HBO Max to Sarandos when it’s time to hand over the keys. \n\n\tWhat about Warner Bros.’ rank and file?\n\n\tZaslav told staffers in a town hall meeting last Friday that the pending sale to Netflix is unlikely to result in sweeping layoffs, as the streamer’s “intention is that they want to keep most people.” \n\n\tSarandos asserted that Netflix is “not cutting jobs,” whereas Paramount and Comcast have been “laying people off and cutting things.” As for handling movies, Sarandos emphasized that one of Warner Bros.’ strengths is its ability to distribute movies around the world. “We didn’t buy this company to destroy that value,” Sarandos observed. \n\n\tThere will be a lot of back and forth in the days ahead as Paramount presses its case to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders. Either deal would need to be approved by regulators. \n\n\tNetflix says it expects its deal to take 12-18 months, following WBD’s planned spinoff of its linear TV channels into Discovery Global in the third quarter. Paramount predicted it could complete a WBD takeover in 12 months. But Paramount’s challenge is likely to prolong the process for either buyer. \n\n\tNetflix’s WB-HBO Max deal represents a horizontal merger between rival streaming services as well as a vertical merger, adding a massive distribution pipeline for Warner Bros. content. “I don’t think this is a slam dunk for the companies,” says Spencer Weber Waller, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. That deal also would face scrutiny from European Union regulators and those in other countries, and Netflix may have to agree to restrictions or spinoffs to satisfy local regulators. \n\t\n\n\tNetflix execs voiced optimism that the WB acquisition will be OK’d. “[We are] really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,” Sarandos told analysts on Friday. \n\n\tEven if American regulators try to spike Netflix’s WB deal, that wouldn’t necessarily doom it. Recall that during Trump’s first term, the DOJ sued to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, claiming the merger constrained supply of “must-have” content, like CNN and TNT. (The lawsuit reportedly was motivated by Trump’s displeasure with CNN.) But a federal judge ruled in favor of the companies, and in February 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision. \n\n\tA key question will be how to define the streaming marketplace. The Netflix and WBD teams suggested the enlarged company would still be competing for consumer dollars against the likes of Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Peacock, Disney+, Hulu and traditional TV. Moreover, all of them are vying for watch time with internet-video powerhouses YouTube and TikTok. \n\n\tBut this may not be a convincing argument in an antitrust review. “The agencies do not believe that everything competes with everything,” Waller says. “There is not a general market for eyeballs.” \n\n\tAt this point, after losing the hearts and minds of WBD’s board, David Ellison seems to be placing his chips on the narrative — pitched to the Trump administration, regulatory bodies across the globe and Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders — that Netflix would run afoul of antitrust laws if it got hold of Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Paramount+ and HBO Max combined would have approximately 200 million global subscribers, “which puts us on par with Disney,” Ellison told investors. That’s significantly below Netflix and HBO Max, which together would clock in at more than 400 million. “Our deal is completely pro-competitive. It’s pro-creative talent, pro-consumer,” Ellison said. \n\n\tThe Warner Bros.-Netflix combination, he asserted, “would give them such a scale that it would be bad for Hollywood and bad for the consumer, and is anticompetitive in every way that you can fundamentally look at it.” In the coming weeks, Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is expected to come back to WBD with another formal takeover offer — one that would top its most recent $30/share bid.\n\n\tNetflix, of course, paints a different picture of its agreement with WBD. “We think it’s good for consumers. We think it’s good for creators,” Sarandos told investors. “We think it’s great for the entertainment industry as a whole, because we’re creating and protecting jobs in production.”\n\t\n\n\tSoon, Warner Bros. Discovery board members and shareholders will have to choose between dueling bids and dueling narratives.\n\n\tMatt Donnelly, Brent Lang, Cynthia Littleton, Jennifer Maas and Gene Maddaus contributed to this story.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJohnny Depp is set to star in the first-ever English-language film adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov’s Russian literature classic “The Master and Margarita.”\n\n\tThe project, which currently does not have a director attached, is being produced by Depp’s own IN.2 Film shingle in tandem with “Jeanne du Barry” producer Svetlana Dali and Grace Loh.\n\n\tDali and Loh will produce with Depp, Stephen Deuters and Stephen Malit. The project was announced at Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea Film Festival as part of its Red Sea Souk market, where Depp and the producers made a surprise appearance on Wednesday. The Red Sea Fund partly financed Depp’s 2023 film “Jeanne du Barry.” They are not involved in the financing of this project.\n\t\n\n\tProduction on “The Master and Margarita” is expected to start in late 2026.\n\n\n\tDali and Loh have been engaged in a legal battle with sales agent Luminosity Pictures over a recent Russian-language adaptation of the celebrated Soviet novel, directed by Michael Lockshin, which has been a hit in Russia and released in continental Europe, but not the U.S and U.K. In the dispute, Dali and Loh claimed to have exclusive legitimate ownership of the rights to the novel.\n\n\tBulgakov’s novel, which was published posthumously in the 1960s and is widely considered one of the great works of 20th-century literature, has never been adapted for the big screen in English despite attempts made by Roman Polanski, Federico Fellini, Terry Gilliam and Baz Luhrmann, among other filmmakers.\n\n\t“Set between 1930s Moscow, where the devil returns with his talking cat to cause havoc amongst its corrupt citizens, and Jerusalem during the time of Pontius Pilate, ‘The Master and Margarita’ tells a fantastical, satirical tale of love, artistic freedom and the eternal battle of good versus evil,” the synopsis for Depp’s film says. “A third intertwined story follows a struggling writer and his lover, Margarita, who is willing to do anything to save him from the totalitarian system. What follows is a darkly comic, wildly imaginative tale of inexhaustible energy, philosophical depth, and spiritual rebellion — a work that remains ferociously relevant today and a timeless reminder of art’s power to challenge, illuminate and endure.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy DDA\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe “Master and Margarita” project continues Dali’s collaboration with Depp’s IN.2 following her executive producer roles on the Depp-led “World Vision” and “Jeanne du Barry” (2023), as well as his directorial effort “Modì: Three Days on the Wing of Madness” (2024). Natasha Rogal also produces, with Robert MacLean producing for Tribune Pictures. Executive producers on “Master and Margarita” include Nevin Shalit, Andrew Fourman, World Visions’ Konstantin Elkin, Tribune Pictures’ Michael Paletta and the late Michael Lang.\n\n\tDepp is represented by Jack Whigham at Range Media.\n\n\tDepp is poised to make a comeback in Hollywood after his court battles following allegations of domestic abuse by his ex-wife Amber Heard. He is reportedly attached to play the title role of Ebenezer Scrooge in Paramount Pictures’s dark film adaptation of Charles Dickens’s classic novel “A Christmas Carol,” directed by Ti West. \n\n\tThe film would mark Depp’s first role from a major studio since 2018’s “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.” Depp is also attached to star with Penélope Cruz in Liongate’s upcoming action thriller “Day Drinker” to be directed by Marc Webb (“The Amazing Spider-Man). The project reunites the two actors, who have shared the screen in “Blow,” “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” and “Murder on the Orient Express.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter winning an award at Cannes where it premiered in competition, Hafsia Herzi‘s film “The Little Sister” has officially kicked off the French awards season, taking the Louis Delluc prize from critics. \n\n\tThe ceremony was hosted today (Dec. 10) at the Fouquet’s restaurant on the Champs-Élysées. A second prize, called Prix Louis Delluc for first film, went to Valentine Cadic for “Le rendez-vous de l’été,” which is set against the backdrop of the Paris Olympic Games and opened this year at the Berlinale. \n\t\n\n\t“The Little Sister,” which marks the third feature film helmed by Herzi, tells the coming-of-age story about a French-Algerian teenager exploring her sexuality while navigating her Muslim faith. The film was adapted from the novel by Fatima Daas which was brought to Herzi by Julie Billy who produced “The Little Sister” alongside Naomi Denamur through their banner June Films.\n\n\n\tNadia Melliti, who won best actress at Cannes, stars as 17-year-old Fatima, the youngest of three daughters, who grapples with her emerging attraction to women and her loyalty to her caring French-Algerian family. MK2 Films has sold it around the world, including in the U.S. where it was acquired by Strand Releasing. In France, where Ad Vitam is handling “The Little Sister,” the movie has struck a chord, selling more than 400K admissions — a healthy performance in a difficult theatrical market. \n\n\tSpeaking to Variety right after the ceremony, Herzi said receiving the Louis Delluc Prize was a “great source of great pride.”\n\n\t“I know that these are people who are knowledgeable, who see a lot of films, who are not easily influenced. It’s a very tough jury,” said Herzi, who is also a popular actress who picked up this year’s Cesar Award for her role in “Borgo.”\n\t\n\n\t“In my career as a director,” Herzi said, “the support of the press has been very important, considering the subjects I’m tackling in my films, including in the latest one.” \n\n\tWhen Herzi set off to adapt Fatima Daas’ book, she said she “immediately knew it was going to be complicated.” She was also warned. “I was told clearly: Homosexuality, religion, forget it.” \n\n\tBut she boldly pursued the project. “I really wanted to take on the challenge and I believed strongly in the character and the story,” she said, before revealing that the production had to pause and relocate at some point. “During filming, we got into trouble, some people threw stones at part of the crew because they didn’t want a lesbian film, so we had to stop for everyone’s safety,” Herzi said. Once the film was released, she said she also “received quite a few threats and insults.” But while she acknowledged the fact that making the film was “complicated” due to the backlash she had to overcome, she also felt that “received a lot more kindness all around” through the journey. \n\n\tBilly, who discovered Fatima Daas’s book and thought of Herzi to bring it to the big screen, told Variety that when she first read the novel she “felt it was unadaptable and at the same time, a masterpiece of emotions, led by a character who is truly missing in literature, but also in cinema.”\n\n\tHaving seen Herzi’s debut feature “Tu merites un amour” (“You Deserve a Lover”), Billy felt that Herzi could make it her own if she adapted “The Little Sister.” “In Hafsia’s films, there is life, there is freedom, there is a liveliness in her mise-en-scene that was very similar to the liveliness in Fatima’s language, and I wanted these two to come together.”\n\n\tIn adapting the novel, Herzi “achieved something quite crazy,” Billy said, “because the book is very fragmented, covering many stages of the character’s life, and she made some very strong choices.”\n\n\tThe Louis-Delluc jury is presided by former Cannes president Gilles Jacob, and comprises Sophie Avon Alex Vicente, Ariane Allard, Ava Cahen, Charlotte Lipinska, Élisabeth Franck-Dumas, Jean-Marc Lalanne, Jean-Michel Frodon, Gérard Lefort, Mathieu Macheret, Pierre Murat and Sophie Grassin.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJane Fonda isn’t waiting for election season to heat up — she’s kicking it off herself. On Wednesday, the Hollywood icon is headlining a star-studded fundraiser in Los Angeles, using her platform to push Democrats toward what organizers say is the defining issue of the next election cycle: affordability.\n\n\tThe event, Stand Up for a Living Wage — a special night of comedy, activism and community power — will take over The Three Clubs the same evening the DNC Winter Meeting lands in L.A. And Fonda won’t be alone. Comedian Nikki Glaser is joining her onstage, bringing a dose of sharp and timely political comedy to a night designed to send a very specific message to national Democrats: if you want to beat Trump in 2026, raising wages has to be front and center.\n\t\n\n\t“I joined the Living Wage for All Coalition because we are in an affordability crisis, and no democracy can survive when millions of families cannot afford to live,” Fonda says. “Democrats need to deliver bold vision and action on affordability and living wages to succeed. For years, we have watched politicians make promises about affordability while avoiding the one solution that truly lifts people up, which is raising wages.”\n\n\n\tFonda has been addressing economic workers’ issues for a long time and even turned her interest into a film with “9 to 5.”  She has also traveled the country with SARU on behalf of One Fair Wage. “This campaign is focused on real material change, not slogans,” she says. “I wanted to lend my voice to something rooted in dignity, fairness and the belief that every worker deserves the chance to build a stable life and that is critical to saving democracy right now.”\n\t\n\n\tFonda adds, “Low wages are not distributed equally. They fall hardest on women and especially women of color who make our restaurants, hospitals, and service industries function every single day. When we raise wages, we directly address gender inequality, racial injustice and the economic barriers that have held entire communities back for generations. A living wage is one of the most powerful tools we have to create a fairer society, and if we are serious about equality then we must ensure people are paid enough to live with security and dignity.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis whole effort is powered by the team behind New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s widely discussed “$30 by 2030” pledge. Now they’re scaling up, taking their message national and betting on Los Angeles as the next proving ground for a major living-wage push.\n\n\tOrganizers see the DNC Winter Meeting as a rare, high-visibility moment when Hollywood energy and Democratic Party decision-making will collide — and they intend to make it count. The fundraiser is designed not just as an L.A.-style night out, but as a pressure point. Their goal is to get DNC members fully committed to centering affordability and wage increases as the party’s unifying rallying cry going into the midterms.\n\n\t“I have spent much of my life listening to people tell their stories, and the hardest ones to hear are from workers doing everything right yet still falling behind,” Fonda shares. “No one should work full time and still have to choose between rent, food or childcare. For me, this is not abstract policy. It is about honoring the humanity and labor of people who keep this country running and insisting that their lives matter, especially if we want them to join the fight to save democracy.”\n",

Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” picked up the top prize of best feature, while Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident” picked up three statuettes.\nIn London, Cate Blanchett, Lily Allen and Sharon Stone appeared at The Fashion Awards at Royal Albert Hall.\nThe following night, Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried stunned on the red carpet at the premiere of their new Paul Feig thriller, “The Housemaid.”\nAt the same time, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo wowed at a Los Angeles reception for “Wicked: For Good” with performance of “For Good” and the Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland-inspired medley of “Happy Days Are Here Again” and “Get Happy.” Baz Luhrmann flew in from Japan to host the evening with Colleen Camp.\n“Look, it’s easy to come from Tokyo and do this because it’s so hard to make a live-action musical,” Luhrmann said. He praised director Jon M. Chu for making films that “can touch the youngest audience member, an older audience member and be both incredible classical but so pop … that are so about inclusiveness, so about what brings us together [and] not what pushes us apart.”\nMake sure to keep check back all month long for more red carpet photos from December 2025.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Ben Rosser/BFA.com\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tLily Allen stuns in Chanel at the Sotheby’s Creators & Collectors Dinner at The Breuer Building in New York City on Dec. 9.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMarcus G.

Last month, TMZ exclusively reported authorities were eyeing carbon monoxide as a possible cause of death and now it's official.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          Scholtes made national headlines in July 2024 after he left his baby daughter, Parker, asleep in his car and went into his house in Marana, a suburb of Tucson, to reportedly play video games and watch porn.\n      \n\n          Parker was left in the vehicle for 3 hours in sweltering 109 degree heat, causing her to end up in a hospital where she was pronounced dead, according to the Pima County Attorney's Office.\n      \n    \n                  \n          \n                          \n                \n                  \n      \n    \n          In October 2025, Scholtes pleaded guilty to Parker's murder and child abuse under a plea agreement that required him to serve up to 30 years in prison. He was supposed to surrender to authorities the same day he died by suicide ahead of his November 21 sentencing.\n      \n    \n          Schlotes' other daughter, who is 18, filed a lawsuit against him for emotional distress before his death.\n      \n    \n          Tragic story.\n      \n    \n          If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

    "body": "\n\tSigourney Weaver recently told The New York Times that she once stood up to James Cameron during their first movie together, 1986’s “Aliens.” The science-fiction action movie marked Weaver’s return as Ellen Ripley after the success of Ridley Scott’s “Alien.” Cameron was new to the franchise and was butting heads on set with a young female actor who was struggling with some of the props.\n\n\t“I sort of trundled up to him and I said, ‘You know, when you yell at an actor, you yell at all of us, so understand that what she was doing actually was very hard. Maybe shoot something else while she gets used to doing this stuff the way you want it,’” Weaver remembered. \n\t\n\n\tCameron took her advice, she added. Weaver said: “He’s a good guy. I really do think Jim has mellowed.”\n\n\tThe actor also remembered getting dinner with Cameron after the two wrapped production on “Aliens” and “he hadn’t been like that directing. He was wildly funny, witty. I can understand why that guy couldn’t come out during ‘Aliens,’ because that was a tough shoot, especially for him. Let’s put it this way: I’m glad I wasn’t shooting ‘The Abyss’ with him.”\n\n\tWeaver is referring to Cameron’s 1989 thriller starring Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The film’s production was fraught, to say the least, with the cast and crew’s health and safety constantly in jeopardy. As recounted by SyFy: “Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on set, and Harris admitted he broke into a fit of sobbing while driving home one day because of the stress. At one point, a lightning storm ripped a hole in the black tarp covering the tank, and since repairing it took too much time and production was already running over, they started shooting at night. Too much exposure to chlorine burned divers’ skin and turned their hair white.”\n\t\n\n\t“We were guinea pigs, in a way,” Harris once told Entertainment Weekly. “Jim wasn’t quite sure how this was all gonna go down… [in the drowning scene I was] screaming at her to come back and wake up, and I was slapping her across the face and I see that they’ve run out of film in the camera — there’s a light on the camera — and nobody had said anything. And Mary Elizabeth stood up and said, ‘We are not animals!” and walked off the set. They were going to let me just keep slapping her around!”\n\n\tWhatever Cameron was like on past sets did not deter Weaver from reuniting with him on the “Avatar” franchise. She’s starred in all three “Avatar” movies so far. Her co-star Stephen Lang told The Times that “a part of Jim that has leavened and lightened much over the years,” adding: “I think he embarked upon a course of self-improvement, and I don’t say that this is actually necessarily a conscious thing that he did; I just think that he’s kind of geared that way.”\n\n\t“Marinating, maybe, is a good term, right?” Cameron himself told the publication. “It’s not like I was a screamer all day long. But every once in a while. Everybody’s entitled to a bad day. If you’re not doing the job, then get out of my way.”\n\n\tCameron’s latest, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” is now playing in theaters nationwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPerry Bamonte, best known as guitarist and keyboardist in the Cure, has died at the age of 65 after battling a short illness at home over Christmas.\n\n\tThe Cure confirmed Bamonte’s death on the band’s website on Friday, remembering his contributions to the group during his two stints in the band, first from 1990 through 2005, and then from 2022 until now.\n\n\t“Quiet, intense, intuitive, constant and hugely creative, ‘Teddy’ was a warm hearted and vital part of the Cure story,” the statement reads. “‘Looking after the band’ from 1984 through 1989, he became a full time member of the Cure in 1990, playing guitar, six string bass and keyboard on ‘The Wish,’ ‘Wild Mood Swings,’ ‘Bloodflowers,’ acoustic hits and the Cure albums, as well as performing more than 400 shows over 14 years. He rejoined the Cure in 2022, playing another 90 shows, some of the best in the band’s history, culminating with ‘The Show of a Lost World’ concert in London 1st November 2024. Our thoughts and condolences are with all his family. He will be very greatly missed.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in London in 1960, Bamonte entered the Cure’s world as part of its road crew in 1984 through his brother Daryl, who served as the band’s tour manager. Bamonte became lead singer Robert Smith’s personal assistant and guitar technician before officially joining the Cure lineup in 1990 following the departure of keyboardist Roger O’Donnell.\n\n\tDuring his tenure with the band, he performed on tour and on several of the group’s albums beginning with 1992’s “Wish” through 2000’s “Bloodflowers.” He left the group in 2005 after Smith reconfigured the Cure as a trio, and in 2012 joined the band Love Amongst Ruin before reuniting with the Cure for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\t\n\n\tOn the Cure’s most commercially successful album “Wish,” Bamonte played six-string bass and keyboards on songs including the hit “Friday, I’m in Love,” “A Letter to Elise” and “High.”\n\n\tBamonte officially rejoined the Cure in 2022 for the global “Shows of a Lost World” tour, which kicked off in Latvia in October and continued through December 2023. He played with the Cure their most recent show at London’s Troxy in November 2024, and was slated to perform at international shows through 2026.\n\n\tBamonte’s playing on the tour is captured in the concert documentary following the “Shows of a Lost World” tour, which is currently in theatrical release. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJosh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme,” now in theaters, is filled with ‘80s bangers, including Tears for Fears’ “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” and Peter Gabriel’s “I Have the Touch.”\n\n\tBut Safdie’s latest film — starring Timothée Chalamet as a young man from New York’s Lower East Side who dreams big and aspires to conquer the world of table tennis — is set in the 1950s.\n\n\n\tIt’s an intriguing juxtaposition that totally works because it’s not an ordinary period piece.\n\t\n\n\tSafdie, who also edited the film and wrote the screenplay alongside Ronald Bronstein, was inspired while watching a video of a 1948 British Open table tennis event. “This wiry young guy was bouncing all over the place, couldn’t stand still, cocky, but also totally vain,” he recalls. The guy was much like Marty.\n\n\n\tAround the same time, he became obsessed with Gabriel’s 1982 song, which he says he listened to over 1,000 times. “I decided to set the footage to that song, and it just worked. Something was happening there; it felt mythic,” Safdie explains. He adds, “There was a contemporary quality to seeing the anachronistic music paired with the ‘40s or early ‘50s.”\n\n\tSafdie explains how the new wave-flavored music actually makes sense with the film’s themes. “President Reagan was nostalgically in that first era of postmodernism, actively trying to recall the ‘50s. In the face of defeat from Vietnam, culture was really just starting to redo itself in the vein of the ‘50s. You saw it in style. You saw it in movies. ‘Back to the Future’ is literally going back to the ‘50s. But on a very simple level, what happens when you do that is the past starts to feel like it’s haunting the future, and the future feels like it’s haunting the past.”\n\t\n\n\tAt one point, Safdie had written a version of the film where Marty was shown in the 1980s. It was an alternate ending. Safdie says, “He’s at a Tears for Fears concert with his granddaughter, listening to the lyrics of ‘Everybody Wants to Rule the World,’ and reflecting on his youth.”\n\n\tThat scene was ultimately removed. But Safdie stayed committed to the 1980s tunes including New Order’s  as “propulsive, energetic, and fun” while still exploring the concept of the past and future in conversation.\n\n\tFor the score, Safdie turned to composer Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never), who scored both “Good Time” and “Uncut Gems.” Lopatin, known for inventing vaporwave — a genre of electronic music from the 2010s that offers a nostalgic, surreal take on 1980s music — was the perfect choice to tie the film’s needle-drop moments together. Lopatin says there was no real differentiation between the game of table tennis that Marty plays and his spirit. “He’s buoyant and energetic, and no one believes in him. There’s an energy to him, a buoyancy and a lightness that is mirrored in the game itself,” he says.\n\n\tLopatin used fast, percussive strikes to keep the score melodic, incorporating mallet strikes to mirror the ping-pong balls. He notes, “Those mallet sounds are also really prominent in new wave music and synth-pop of the ‘80s.”\n\n\tLopatin was inspired by the concept of memory and time, as well as that original ending. “The score goes back to, what would it be like to think back on your coming of age in the 1950s while hearing Tears for Fears blasting in your ears, and maybe you’re side by side with your children, but somewhere else in your mind?” The result, in Lopatin’s words, was “an abstraction of that Tears for Fears concert.” He describes it as what happens when the present dissolves, and memory and the present converge. “The score is a kind of abstraction or an undercurrent — a symbolic wave of what was in the script.”\n\n\tTo align with the songs, which also include New Order’s “The Perfect Kiss,” Lopatin used digital synthesizers from the 1980s, including the Yamaha DX7 from 1983. He also incorporated flutes, saxophones, and string arrangements on top.\n\n\tHis score became was an expression of Marty’s youth, energy and ambition. If Marty is a builder and a bridge between worlds — past, present, and future — so too is the score and its accompanying songs. Safdie concludes, “I think all those things coming together in sync with one another — the synchronicity — has that additive effect of like, ‘Oh my god, this movie’s teeming with life.’”\n",

    "body": "\n\tA new documentary reveals that Chevy Chase was put into a coma for around eight days after he experienced heart failure during the pandemic. It was reported in 2021 that the now-82-year-old comedian spent five weeks in the hospital due to undisclosed heart issues.\n\n\t“[He] has basically come back from the dead. He had heart failure,” Chase’s daughter, Caley Chase, said in the documentary, “I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not,” premiering Jan. 1 on CNN.\n\t\n\n\t“Something was wrong, and he couldn’t explain to me what was wrong. So, we go to the ER. His heart stops,” Chase’s wife, Jayni Chase, said. “During those years he was drinking, he got cardiomyopathy; when the heart muscles get weaker, and they can’t pump as much blood out with each beat.”\n\n\n\tCardiomyopathy is a chronic disease that can lead to heart failure and other serious conditions.\n\n\t“They decided to put him into a coma for maybe eight days,” revealed Chase’s longtime friend, Peter Aaron. “That’s pretty rough on the body.”\n\n\t“The doctor had warned us: ‘We might not get him back. We don’t know how present he’ll be. Prepare yourselves for the worst.’ He woke up, all he could do was use his voice,” Caley continued, imitating disoriented noises.\n\n\tShe knew her dad was the same old Chevy Chase when a nurse came in to rearrange some medical equipment: “She said, ‘I’m going to have to put this in here.’ And he said, ‘That’s what she said.'”\n\n\tAaron said it took a while for Chevy to “reorient himself” after the coma. He had some “cognitive disability” and played cards and chess to get his “head back together.” (“I can only say how happy I am to now be back with my family,” Chase said in a statement to the press in 2021. “I’m feeling good. I was in the hospital five weeks. A heart issue. So, for now, I’m around the house. Not going anywhere.”)\n\t\n\n\tIn the documentary, Aaron said, “I feel like his memory gaps come from that incident.”\n\n\tChevy concurred, “According to the doctors, my memory would be shot from it. That’s what’s happened here.”\n\n\tThroughout the doc, when confronted with uncomfortable moments from his past, including on-set disputes from “Saturday Night Live” and “Community,” Chevy said he did not remember many of the incidents.\n\n\t“Heart failure is what it is. I’m fine now,” he said. “It’s just that it affects your memory, the doctors have told me that. So, I have to be reminded of things.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tElsewhere in the documentary, the comedian discussed being “hurt” by his exclusion from the “SNL” 50th anniversary special.\n\n\t“It was kind of upsetting, actually,” he said. “This is probably the first time I’m saying it. But I expected that I would’ve been on the stage too with all the other actors. When Garrett [Morris] and Laraine [Newman] went on the stage there, I was curious as to why I didn’t. No one asked me to. Why was I left aside?”\n\n\tHe added, “I did bring it up once in a text to Lorne [Michaels] and then took it back. I said, ‘Okay, I take it back, silly.’ But it’s not that silly. Somebody’s made a bad mistake there. I don’t know who it was, but somebody made a mistake. They should’ve had me on that stage. It hurt.”\n",

    "description": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains details about the finale of “Heated Rivalry” Season 1, now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” star Connor",
    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains details about the finale of “Heated Rivalry” Season 1, now streaming on HBO Max.\n\n\t“Heated Rivalry” star Connor Storrie knew early on he wanted to be an actor.\n\n\tHe made that perfectly clear in YouTube videos he made when he was 12 years old under the name Actorboy222. The adorable videos were discovered by rabid “Heated Rivalry” fans shortly after Storrie became an instant star when the first two episodes of the queer hockey romance series premiered on HBO Max just a month ago.\n\t\n\n\t“He was on to something,” Storrie says looking back at his pre-teen self. “He got me here. He was part of it.”\n\n\n\tWhat would 25-year-old Storrie say to his younger self now? “I would say, ‘Cut that damn hair,’” he cracks, before pausing to give it a think. “I would tell him to make more stuff sooner, make more of his own stuff sooner. Just be more diligent about not just being an actor, as in trying to get cast in something and waiting for opportunities. I would be like, ‘Try putting yourself in your own things.’”\n\n\tStorrie continues, “I love that little guy. I love him. I used to not like him.”\n\n\tIt wasn’t easy for a kid like him growing up in Odessa, Texas.\n\n\t“I was this artist, sissy boy in West Texas that didn’t want to play football,” he explains. “I wanted to play pretend and play dress up and disappear into weird worlds and entertain and try to connect with people that way, and that was just not the norm out there.”\n\n\tThat kid is now one of Hollywood’s hottest young talents.\n\t\n\n\tStorrie stars in “Heated Rivalry” as Ilya Rozanov, a Russian hocky champion having a steamy sex-filled years-long affair with his Canadian counterpart Shane Hollander (played by Hudson Williams). The show — an adaptation of the “Game Changers” novels — chronicles Rozanov and Hollander’s relationship as it goes from something purely physical to to being a deeply romantic and emotional relationship.\n\n\tThe sixth and final episode of Season 1 finds Rozanov visiting Hollander at his cottage. They finally admit to each other that they’re in love. But then Hollander unexpectedly comes out to his parents as not only being gay but also in a relationship with his career arch-nemesis as his father walks in on the couple kissing after making an unannounced trip to the cottage.\n\n\tI spoke to Storrie over Zoom video from his Los Angeles-area home ahead of the season finale.\n\n\tWere you surprised Ilya was the first to say, “I love you”? He said it in the Russian monologue in Episode 5 but this was different because he says it in English and in person.\n\n\tYeah, but I think this shows Ilya is in it for the long haul and he’s enthusiastic about that.\n\n\tHe’s also the first to refer to them as boyfriends.\n\n\tThat’s the thing about these eastern Europeans. They don’t let you in on it. But once you’re in, you’re in for life.\n\n\tWhat was it like walking into the cottage for the first time?\n\n\tThat was the element of the story that I was most excited to get to because it’s really cool the way that Jacob Tierney wrote it. There’s this kind of cool crescendo where it was so fast and rapid — the editing, the writing – with so much energy upfront, and then it kind of lands and we’re just two people in a house for a few days. As an actor, that’s where a lot of the cool acting moments are, where we really get to sit in some of those scenes for a long, long time. It’s kind of the episode where there’s officially a catharsis. People don’t realize because of all the intimate scenes but this story really is about people falling in love at a distance. To finally see that come together, there’s a catharsis.\n\n\tI think viewers may go into Episode 6 thinking it’s going to be a sex fest because Shane and Ilya will be by themselves. There’s some sex, but the episode is about much more than that.\n\t\n\n\tYou get to kind of breathe. They get to be normal on some level, which is what Jacob talks about when he says the “happy ending.” I think what he’s referring to is being emotionally regulated, emotionally aware enough to look each other in the eyes and be like, “I love you, let’s do this.” And then whatever that looks like afterwards, they’re like, “We’re going to sign up for it. We’re signed up and we’re locked in.”\n\n\tAnd then you literally ride off into the sunset when Shane and Ilya get in the car and leave Shane’s parents’ house.\n\n\tWe filmed that twice. I don’t know which take they ended up using, but the first take, because we sit there for three or four minutes — we do the full length of that song, which I fucking love — Hudson and I just kind of rode in silence and just cried during that whole scene. As actors, we were like, “We’re killing. We’re in it. This is real, we’re so in love.” Then the music stops and Jacob comes around and is like, “Alrighty, let’s do one where you guys don’t look like you want to kill yourselves. Let’s start over.” He was like, “Be cute. This is happy. This is fun.” We interpreted it in a very dramatic way. But, yeah, we literally get to ride off into the sunset.\n\n\tI think Shane and his mom’s talk outside is going to resonate so much with people. Every kids wants to hear their parents apologize for something they had or hadn’t done.\n\n\tThey’re both accepting the truth of the matter, and that lets them actually heal from it, rather than it just being a placate-y kind of thing to each other.\n\n\tMy friend Ben texted me this morning and said the show has “rewired” his brain and he feels he can now finally be able to pursue a relationship.\n\n\tWow. It’s all about love, baby and realizing the stuff we internalize from the outside world hurts and it affects us. But at the end of the day, you gotta do your thing — whatever that is.\n\n\tYou’ve talked about being ostracized in high school when some classmates found those Actorboy222 videos. What would you say to those people now?\n\n\tI don’t feel any sort of way about it. I don’t really villainize anyone no matter how nasty they get because I fully do believe that people are doing their best. I think that people are hurt. I think everyone is so insecure and sad, and we all have these things that are so tender to us, and I just feel blessed to be to have had a human experience that’s been just rugged enough to give me that perspective, to be like, “I don’t really give a shit what words you use to describe me, or if you try to embarrass me because I’ve embarrassed myself a million fucking times. I don’t give a shit anymore. So bring it on. I don’t feel bad about it because, especially how visible everything is now on the internet, if you’re a nasty person, I think that just makes you look nasty. I don’t need to try and make you look nasty. I just try to hold myself with grace and understanding. If you’re trying to belittle someone, it’s probably because you feel pretty small yourself because I know when I’ve been mean in the past — we’ve all done things — it’s because I felt this big [he pinches a thumb and finger together]. I felt itty bitty.\n\t\n\n\tBefore we go, I have to ask – do you actually like tuna melts?\n\n\tI don’t think I’ve had a real legit tuna melt. Maybe I had one from Subway once. We didn’t eat the best when I was growing up.\n\n\tThis Q&A has been edited and condensed.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAmos Poe, the New York underground filmmaker who chronicled the punk scene and directed films including “Blank Generation” and “Alphabet City,” died Thursday of cancer. He was 76.\n\n\tHis wife Claudia Summers posted on his Instagram account on Dec. 25, “Amos took his last breath today at 3:33 pm, surrounded by loved ones. ‘Adios’ — AP.”\n\n\tFriends including Kim Gordon and Jim Jarmusch paid tribute on his Instagram, with Jarmusch writing “love you so very much.”\n\t\n\n\tBorn in Tel Aviv, Poe got started with the short music film “Night Lunch” with Roxy Music and David Bowie. The 1976 “Blank Generation” was his second film, co-directed with guitarist Ivan Kral, and was one of the first to chronicle the burgeoning punk rock movement in New York. Filmed partly at CBGB, it featured appearances from Patti Smith, Talking Heads, Television, Richard Hell and Wayne County.\n\n\n\tBut Kral took control of “Blank Generation” and several of Poe’s other films after a disagreement, reediting them and removing Poe’s name.\n\n\t“I’m trying to be grown up about it. But they’re trying to rewrite history,” Poe told the New York Times when he discovered what had happened.\n\n\tAs the No Wave music movement was getting started in the city, he pioneered the concept of No Wave filmmaking, directing films such as “The Foreigner” with Debbie Harry and “Subway Riders” with Susan Tyrell, Robbie Coltrane and Cookie Mueller. \n\n\t“Our whole esthetic, or the way we approached it, was that you didn’t necessarily have to have the professionalism or the understanding of making films, you had to have the inspiration and the will to put yourself completely into it,” Poe told Reuters in 2011.\n\t\n\n\tPoe also directed music videos for acts including Anthrax and Run-DMC, as well as the public access TV show “TV Party,” hosted by Blondie’s Chris Stein and Glenn O’Brien.\n\n\tHis other films include Steve Earle documentary “Just an American Boy,” “Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole” with Philip Seymour Hoffman and 2012’s “A Walk in the Park.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tZack Snyder marked the Christmas holiday with a special gift to fans in the form of photos of Henry Cavill wearing Christopher Reeve’s original Superman suit. The images are what Snyder showed to Warner Bros. executives when he was trying to cast Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman in his new DC Universe, which kicked off with 2013’s “Man of Steel.”\n\n\t“Henry Cavill. The original Superman suit. This photo. It was undeniable,” Snyder wrote in one caption, while adding in another: “With the last image I shared, and this one, we showed WB [and] everyone agreed: Henry Cavill was Superman. That’s where the journey began.” \n\t\n\n\tCavill played Superman across three movies in Snyder’s DC Universe: “Man of Steel,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Justice League.” Then things got complicated. After a five-year hiatus that left fans wondering about Cavill’s Superman future, he popped up as the Man of Steel in the post-credits scene of 2022’s “Black Adam.” Cavill’s reappearance coincided with reports that a standalone Superman sequel for him was finally in development with the studio soliciting pitches from writers. The post-credits scene teased the DC Universe would then be heading toward a battle between Cavill’s Superman and Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam.\n\n\n\t“I am back as Superman,” Cavill wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “Thank you for your support and thank you for your patience. I promise it will be rewarded.” \n\n\tTwo days later, Cavill spoke publicly for the first time about his Superman return during a live recording of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast at 92NY in New York City and said: “There is such a bright future ahead for the character. I’m so excited to tell a story with an enormously joyful Superman.”\n\t\n\n\tCavill’s return was not long for this world, however. Just a day after the announcement, news broke that James Gunn and Peter Safran were taking over DC Studios and launching a new DC Universe. This would effectively end Snyder’s DC Universe, in which Cavill had been front and center. Gunn said on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast earlier this year that an “unfair” situation was created when his deal to take over DC Studios closed just as Cavill was announcing his return. Gunn had planned on rebooting Superman from the start, which he successfully did this summer with his David Corenswet-starring “Superman.”\n\n\t“The day our [DC] deal closed, all of a sudden, they were announcing that Henry was back,” Gunn said. “And I’m like, ‘What is going on?’ We know what the plan is. The plan was to come in and do ‘Superman.’ So it was really unfair to him and a total bummer… That was really unfortunate. So Peter and I [thought] the right thing to do was to sit down with [Cavill] and talk to him. And we sat down and we talked to him. He was an absolute gentleman, a great guy about it. He said, ‘The only thing I ask is that I’m able to reveal it myself as opposed to it coming from you guys.’”\n\n\tThrough all of the presumable drama, Gunn and Snyder stayed in touch. Gunn revealed on X shortly after taking over DC Studios that he had touched base with Snyder and there were no hard feelings between them. Gunn told Fandango earlier this yea that he even consulted with Snyder when it came to designing the new Superman suit and whether to add the red trunks.\n\n\t“One of the biggest questions was, ‘Were we gonna have trunks, or were we gonna not have trunks?’” Gunn said. “I talked to Zack Snyder, who was like, ‘I tried a billion different versions with the trunks, and at the end of the day, I tried it, but I just couldn’t get there.’ And I was feeling exactly the same way. … Theoretically, I liked the idea of trunks because it’s the Superman I grew up with.”\n\n\tGunn’s DC Universe continues in summer 2026 with “Supergirl” and then the “Superman” sequel film “Man of Tomorrow.”\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs per tradition, Netflix is kicking off the New Year with a new Harlan Coben mystery thriller — in this case, it’s “Run Away.” Adapted for television by Danny Brocklehurst, who was also at the helm of 2024’s “Fool Me Once,” the eight-episode limited series follows a desperate father determined to find his vanished, drug-dependent daughter. Full of shocking twists and turns and gruesome violence, which are par for the course with all of Coben’s works, the show is an entertaining maze from its opening scene until the close. “Run Away” reminds audiences that one secret is typically just the tip of the iceberg; as you begin to dig into it, more mysteries often reveal themselves.​Set in the U.K., “Run Away” follows financier Simon Greene (James Nesbitt), whose life appears picturesque on the surface. He’s happily married to his pediatrician wife, Ingrid (Minnie Driver), and he has three lovely children, Paige (Ellie de Lange), Sam (Adrian Greensmith) and Anya (Ellie Henry). Unfortunately, the Greene household is in disarray. Sam and Anya are thriving at university and high school, respectively, but Paige has gone missing. After a troubling start in college and becomin g dependent on drugs, she has now disappeared completely. While Ingrid insists on letting their eldest child hit rock bottom, Simon is driven to bring her home.​With his tenacity and a wealth of financial resources, Simon discovers Paige’s whereabouts after six months of no contact. Unfortunately, the father/daughter reunion turns sour quickly, as Simon violently pummels Paige’s volatile boyfriend, Aaron Corval (Thomas Flynn), in front of a park full of spectators. When Aaron is found slaughtered a short time later, Simon becomes the prime suspect for Detectives Isaac Fagbenle (Alfred Enoch) and Ruby Todd (Amy Gledhill). Desperate to clear his name and find Paige again, Simon joins forces with private investigator Elena Ravenscroft (Ruth Jones), who connects Paige to a separate missing person’s case she has been hired to work on.​Fans of Coben’s frequent adaptations, including Netflix’s “Fool Me Once,” “Missing You,” and “The Stranger,” know his series are tapestries of riddles, and “Run Away” is no different. The mystery around Paige’s disappearance stands at the center of this story, yet it is only one component of the tale. Shocking revelations, horrifying cruelty and complex lies engulf the narrative itself, even when it leans toward the preposterous. Still, the stellar cast, taut pacing and inventive storylines keep the show engaging, even when it could’ve very well fallen apart.​From the Greene family to Elena’s personal life and the biases of Inspector Fagbenle, there is a wealth of information embedded in the series. However, what’s most compelling, as is the theme in many of Coben’s works, is how little we really know about our loved ones. As human beings, we all have secrets, things we’ve tried to forget or instances we’re ashamed of. These are fragments of our beings we are scared to confess, for they could alter how others perceive us or how we see ourselves. “Run Away” does an exquisite job at honing in on why we choose to bury traumas and destructive behaviors, both past and present.​Fascinating and intensely detailed, “Run Away” is an astonishing web involving an array of seemingly unrelated characters and circumstances that all weave themselves together in the end. The show puts a spotlight on the secrets we keep from those we love most, and how, once exposed, those skeletons can alter who we are and how we view our loved ones forever. Amid the vast array of clues that slowly reveal themselves, to shootouts and haunting flashbacks, the show is as expansive as it is intense. Moreover, just as viewers believe they’ve grasped the truth, the plot shifts, moving the narrative into a different direction. In the end, the series reminds us that digging into other people’s lives may bring you answers, but you may not want to face these truths when they come to light.\n\t\n\n\t“Run Away” premieres on Netflix Jan. 1.\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristmas proved to be a merry time at the box office, with moviegoers heading back to Pandora and also picking up their ping-pong paddles for the holidays.\n\n\tJames Cameron’s “Avatar: Fire and Ash” made $24 million on Christmas Day, securing the No. 1 spot and powering it through the end of the year as it hopes to reach the billion-dollar heights of its predecessors. Timothee Chalamet’s ping-pong dramedy “Marty Supreme” had a strong $9.5 million opening day to land in second place.\n\t\n\n\tDisney’s “Fire and Ash,” which opened to $88 million last week, is projected to make $75 million to $80 million over the four-day Christmas holiday weekend. In comparison, “Avatar: The Way of Water” made $29 million on Christmas Day in 2022, though the holiday fell on a Sunday, and $90 million over its four-day frame. Even though it’s behind Cameron’s previous film, the sci-fi threequel “Fire and Ash” should have a strong hold through the end of the year to offset its large budget. It cost a huge $350 million to produce and $150 million to promote. So far, it’s made $153 million domestically and $544 million globally.\n\n\n\tDirected by Josh Safdie, A24’s “Marty Supreme” is expected to open above $20 million in its holiday debut. Last week, it set a record by making $875,000 from just six theaters in its limited release, marking the best per-screen-average of the year and of all-time for A24. Propelled by Chalamet’s star power and promotional antics (like appearing on top of the Las Vegas Sphere and flying a giant orange blimp), “Marty Supreme” could snag A24’s biggest box office opening ever. The current record holder is Alex Garland’s “Warfare,” which debuted to $25.7 million last April. “Marty Supreme” will need to ride its good reviews and word of mouth to make up its $70 million budget.\n\t\n\n\t“Marty Supreme” narrowly beat Sony’s disaster comedy “Anaconda,” starring Paul Rudd and Jack Black, which had a $9.1 million Christmas opening day for third place. It’s expected to slither to $22 million to $24 million this weekend and has a $45 million budget.\n\n\tDisney’s “Zootopia 2” made $5.2 million to land in fourth place, while Focus Features’ “Song Sung Blue,” another Christmas newcomer, made $4.4 million on its opening day. The musical, starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in a Neil Diamond cover band, is on track to make $12 million in its opening, and it carries a $30 million budget. Lionsgate’s thriller “The Housemaid,” starring Amanda Seyfried and Sydney Sweeney, made $3.5 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tLawyers for Justin Baldoni appeared in court on Thursday hoping to persuade a judge to dismiss Blake Lively‘s lawsuit against him, in which she alleges sexual harassment and retaliation during and after the making of their 2024 film “It Ends With Us.”\n\n\tBaldoni’s team argued that the allegations involve improvisation during filming of sexually charged scenes — which does not amount to gender-based harassment.\n\n\n\t“I don’t know if the court is familiar with the show ‘Heated Rivalry,'” attorney Jonathan Bach said at one point. Laughter spread throughout the courtroom as U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman indicated that no, he was not familiar.\n\t\n\n\tBach went on to explain that the series — a gay romance drama that recently concluded its first season on HBO Max — featured several “explicit” scenes. He was rebutting a point made earlier by one of Lively’s lawyers: Esra Hudson argued that Baldoni’s choice to improvise on set was not an excuse for kissing and nuzzling that Lively had not consented to, therefore providing basis for a claim of gender-based discrimination. Bach countered the argument, saying that if male actor on “Heated Rivalry” improvised during an intimate scene with another man, could there be a complaint of gender-based discrimination?\n\n\tBach frequently returned to the idea that any touching that occurred between Baldoni and Lively came from the relationship between their characters in the film and had nothing to do with Lively herself being a woman. \n\n\tHe was the first attorney to speak at the podium during the hearing, and opened his argument by saying that Lively signed onto “It Ends With Us” knowing that it would feature “hot and sexy scenes” that would become “steamy and turbulent.”\n\t\n\n\tLiman was quick to push back, indicating that Bach was surely “not suggesting” that the film’s sexual subject matter gave Baldoni license to touch Lively as he pleased. Bach agreed. “So maybe you can actually help me understand where the lines are,” Liman said, leading Bach to emphasize that “context matters.” If anything “awkward” arose, he argued, it was in pursuit of a certain aesthetic. He insisted multiple times that Lively’s complaints were “small potatoes” that did not rise to the level of sexual harassment.\n\n\tHudson was the first to speak from Lively’s side. She first made clear her team’s position that key facts were in dispute between the two parties, necessitating the input of a jury. As an example, she offered the differing perspectives on a particular interaction between Lively and “It Ends With Us” executive producer Jamey Heath during which he entered a room while she was nude from the waist up. Heath says he heard someone tell him to come in, whereas Lively and her hair and makeup artists recall saying, “Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.” \n\n\tHudson then focused her time on the issue of Lively’s consent. Lively was “kissed, nuzzled and touched” in ways she hadn’t consented to while shooting one scene, Hudson said, regardless of knowing she would be acting in intimate scenes. Liman pressed Hudson about the exact meaning of consent in the context of intimate scenes, asking whether and how improvisation may come into play.\n\n\tHudson clarified that she wasn’t saying improvisation should be off-limits or that an actor must give consent for every individual motion in a scene, but that for improvisation to be considered consensual, there should be a conversation about what kind of touching can be expected — hence the advent of nudity riders and intimacy coordinators.\n\n\tThough Liman continued to question whether every touch-related decision could be for a jury to decide — “That can’t be right,” he said — Hudson maintained that in this scenario, there was a subjective standard they needed to look at: Lively was uncomfortable, surprised and leaned back, indicating that her consent had not been given. Whether or not another generally reasonable person would have reacted similarly, Hudson said, should be up to a jury.\n\n\tLiman took the arguments under submission and will rule on the motion at a later point. The case is scheduled for trial in May. Liman could opt to narrow the scope of the allegations that a jury will consider.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” rode its way to an impressive start in the ratings. \n\n\tThe “Game of Thrones” prequel has pulled in 6.7 million viewers across all platforms in its first three days of availability. Per HBO, that makes it one of the top three series launches in the history of HBO Max. \n\n\tFor comparison, Season 2 of the Emmy-winning medical drama “The Pitt” nabbed 5.4 million viewers over three days when it premiered earlier in January, while the Season 4 premiere of “Industry” pulled 800,000 viewers in the same time frame. \n\t\n\n\t“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” has already been renewed for a second season at HBO. It is one of two “Game of Thrones” prequels currently at HBO alongside “House of the Dragon.” The third season of that show is expected to launch later this year. \n\n\n\t“A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” is based on George R.R. Martin’s novella series “Tales of Dunk and Egg.” Peter Claffey stars as Ser Duncan “Dunk” the Tall, with Dexter Sol Ansell as his diminutive squire Egg. The cast of the series also includes: Daniel Ings, Bertie Carvel, Danny Webb, Sam Spruell, Shaun Thomas, Finn Bennett, Edward Ashley, Tanzyn Crawford, Henry Ashton, Youssef Kerkour, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor and Daniel Monks\n\n\tMartin co-created the series with Ira Parker. Both serve as executive producers, with Parker also serving as showrunner. Sarah Bradshaw, Owen Harris, Ryan Condal and Vince Gerardis executive produce, with Owen Harris and Sarah Adina Smith directing. Season 1 will consist of six episodes. \n",

    "body": "\n\tOver 30 years after Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie for his novel “The Satanic Verses,” the author traveled to Chautauqua, N.Y., in 2022, for a speaking engagement. Rushdie was about to give a talk about artistic freedom when Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old New Jersey man, rushed the stage and stabbed Rushdie in the face, neck, and abdomen multiple times with a knife. The author survived the attack and wrote a memoir about the event titled “Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder,” which was published in 2024.\n\t\n\n\tBefore Rushdie wrote the book, he met with veteran documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney about making a film about the ordeal.\n\n\n\tRushdie’s wife, Rachel Eliza Griffiths, shared never-before-seen footage with Gibney that she shot in the days and weeks following the attack. This material was graphic, unflinching, and deeply intimate. It also traced Rushdie’s physical and spiritual recovery, including the challenges he continues to face, from losing an eye to the reduced use of one hand.\n\n\t“I think the idea of this visual record of his recovery from this brutal attack was something that was really interesting to Salman and Rachel,” Gibney says. “The idea of making a record of this event and (showing) what terror looks like and is literally scarred into the flesh of Salman Rushdie, I think they felt strongly about.”\n\n\tGibney spent two years making the doc. The result is “Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie,” which debuts at Sundance on Sunday.\n\n\tInspired by Rushdie’s 2024 memoir, “Knife” blends reportage with fictionalized dialogue to explore the attacker’s mindset, probing the “why” behind the violence. At its core, the film is a portrait doc about Rushdie’s resilience and strength.\n\t\n\n\t“The simple plot of the story is that Salman gets attacked, and he recovers from his injuries and gets better,” Gibney says. “But along the way, Salman reflects on his own life, and that’s very much the structure of the film. There was one cut of the film where it was more of a record of the recovery. There wasn’t much about writing in there, and we thought, ‘Well, that’s not right. He is a writer. An artist. We needed to show in some fundamental way how he was reckoning with his own art as a means to recover.”\n\n\tVariety spoke to Gibney ahead of the Sundance world premiere of “Knife.”\n\t\n\t\tAnimation, blurry recreations, and, eventually, video footage are used to illustrate the violence inflicted upon Rushdie in August 2022. Why did you decide to wait and show the video footage at the end of the film instead of the beginning?\t\n\n\tIt was a little bit organic, and part of it had to do with the fact that when we started out, we didn’t have the footage of the actual attack. We only got that later from the district attorney as part of the legal proceedings. That said, I felt strongly that the whole film is about recovery. And part of recovery is mental recovery. It’s not just physical recovery. How does one perceive that kind of attack? Memory’s a tricky thing. That kind of memory that comes out of some sort of PTSD is tricky. So the idea was to create a kind of impression. We shot something that was intentionally impressionistic of the attack. It feels real, but it wasn’t a record. The idea is that over time, Salman works through the attack and probes his memory, and then comes back to the scene of the crime and literally stands in the place where he was attacked and reconstructs it as a way of working through what actually happened so that he can move on.\n\t\n\t\tHadi Matar is not in the film. Did you reach out to him for an interview?\t\n\n\tI did. I tried to talk to him, and he wasn’t interested. But I certainly would have been interested in talking to him.\n\t\n\t\tDo you think audiences will be surprised to learn that Hadi Matar never even read  “The Satanic Verses”?\t\n\n\tHe wasn’t even born when the fatwa happened. He was just living in New Jersey. He was somewhat radicalized by the videos he was watching online. He chose to kill Salman to express that purpose and mission, even though he never read “The Satanic Verses,” because I think most of the people who objected to “The Satanic Verses” never read it. (The book,) became this convenient foil. ‘You are attacking us. You are assaulting our identity, therefore you must die.’ It’s a powerful comment on the moment that we live in, where you can become radicalized and just see people as the other, because you believe that they are somehow insulting your religion or your culture, or your identity, and that gives you license to assault or kill someone.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWe are living in a tumultuous time. People are bombarded by news about violence every day. Has that made it hard to find a distributor for this film? Or was it intentional to make this film independently?  \t\n\n\tFor various reasons, we decided to produce this independently. I hope distributors will be interested because, I mean, obviously, it includes a lot of violence, but it’s really about recovery. And as much as we see the reports of these attacks, and sometimes the moment of the attack is shared online, what happens after the attack is almost never talked about. The pain and suffering that the families of the victims endure, or the pain and suffering that the victims themselves endure if they survive. The hope is that by investing in that idea of recovery, we take (the doc) to a different kind of place. Salman says in the film, something to the effect of I wanted to go from an act of hate to a place of love.\n\t\n\t\tThe doc marketplace is unpredictable, but Salman Rushdie is a celebrity. As we both know, streamers like celeb content. Do you think the film will sell?\t\n\n\tHe is a celebrity, and he’s a world-famous author, and deservedly so. This was an event that happened, and it was extremely public. In some ways it’s also a true crime story. So, it’s a true crime story with a celebrity component. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJames Cameron appeared on a recent episode of “In Depth with Graham Bensinger” and spoke bluntly about relocating to New Zealand, where he both lives and spent years working on the “Avatar” movies. \n\n\t“After the pandemic hit… [New Zealand] had eliminated the virus completely,” Cameron said about his reason for getting out of the U.S. “They actually eliminated the virus twice. The third time when it showed up in a mutated form, it broke through. But fortunately, they already had a 98% vaccination rate. This is why I love New Zealand. People there are, for the most part, sane as opposed to the United States where you had a 62% vaccination rate, and that’s going down – going the wrong direction.”\n\t\n\n\t“Are you kidding me? Where would you rather live?” Cameron continued. “A place that actually believes in science and is sane and where people can work together cohesively to a common goal, or a place where everybody’s at each other’s throats, extremely polarized, turning its back on science and basically would be in utter disarray if another pandemic appears.”\n\n\n\tWhen Graham Bensinger noted that the United States is still “a fantastic place to live,” Cameron questioned him by saying: “Is it?”\n\n\t“But New Zealand is just stunningly beautiful,” Bensinger noted, to which Cameron replied: “I’m not there for scenery, I’m there for the sanity.”\n\n\tCameron appeared on the “The F—ing News” podcast one year ago and revealed that his New Zealand citizenship was “imminent” at the time. He also criticized what America had become under Donald Trump, saying: “I see a turn away from everything decent. America doesn’t stand for anything if it doesn’t stand for what it has historically stood for. It becomes a hollow idea, and I think they’re hollowing it out as fast as they can for their own benefit… There’s an innate respect and a demand for respect [here]. Everybody has this kind of equal status in terms of person-hood. And I love that – that’s what I wanted my kids to experience.”\n\t\n\n\tThe Oscar-winning director added that he feels “safer” in New Zealand these days, noting: “I certainly feel like I don’t have to read about [Trump] on the front page every single day. And it’s just sickening. There’s something nice about the New Zealand outlets — at least they’ll put it on page three. I just don’t want to see that guy’s face any more on the front page of the paper. It’s inescapable there, it’s like watching a car crash over and over and over.”\n\n\tWatch Cameron on “In Depth with Graham Bensinger” in the video below.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked: For Good” failed to cast a spell over Oscar voters. When the Academy Awards nominations were unveiled on Thursday, the musical found itself completely shut out of this year’s race. What makes the omission a major surprise is that just a year ago, “Wicked” received a dazzling 10 nods, including one for best picture.\n\n\tNot only did the adaptation of the second half of the Broadway sensation miss out in the top category, but stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande as well as the below-the-line artisans who brought Oz to sparkling life on screen were also overlooked. So what went wrong with this trip back down the Yellow Brick Road? Here are six reasons that “Wicked: For Good” was snubbed at the Oscars.\n\t\n\n\t1) The musical’s second act has always been a problem\n\n\n\tPerhaps the biggest issue with “Wicked: For Good” is the source material. As Broadway fans know all too well, Act One of “Wicked” has earworms like “Popular” and “What Is This Feeling?” before the ending on the electrifyingly high note of “Defying Gravity.” When the curtain rises on the second part, things get… messy. It’s much darker than the fizzy first act, with way too much breathless exposition and wrapping up of loose strands that don’t totally make sense in the context of “The Wizard of Oz.” On Broadway, “Wicked” famously lost the Tony for best musical to “Avenue Q” — and a lot of that probably had to do with its lackluster finale.\n\n\t2) Reviews weren’t there\n\n\tWhile “Wicked” was praised by critics, some reviewers excoriated the follow-up. Just look at the headline of the New Yorker’s blunt assessment of the film, which reads: “‘Wicked: For Good’ is Very, Very Bad.” Yes, the sequel was still certified “fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes, with 66% of reviewers recommending the film. However, that’s a far (battle) cry from the first film’s 88% “fresh” rating. In the end, the sequel just couldn’t recapture the infectious charms of “Wicked,” making it too much of a good thing.\n\t\n\n\t 3) Sequels don’t often score at the Oscars\n\n\tYes, some sequels have triumphed at the Academy Awards. Follow-ups to “The Godfather” and “The Lord of Rings” both captured best picture, and other recent sequels such as “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Avatar: The Way of Water” were nominated for the top prize. But, in general, there’s a sense that follow-up films are money grabs. (Although “For Good” isn’t technically a sequel, some were critical about whether Universal needed to split the film into two parts.) Franchise entries ranging from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” to “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Creed” also failed to score best picture nominations despite the fact that the first films in their respective series were all recognized. Yet, many of those films were nominated in below-the-line categories, whereas “Wicked: For Good” was given the coldest of shoulders. Maybe they felt like having given “Wicked” 10 nominations, they’d already given the movie musical its due.\n\n\t4) Box office grosses were less magical\n\n\tAlthough “Wicked: For Good” was more popular than its predecessor in terms of opening weekend ticket sales, the second film didn’t enjoy the same kind of staying power in theaters. While “Wicked” became the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation in box office history with $758 million, “For Good” ran out of steam with $523 million globally. That’s still a strong tally for a musical (a genre that tends to struggle in cinemas) but it’s clear that audiences didn’t have as much enthusiasm for the Ozian finale. It seems like Academy voters were equally lukewarm.\n\n\t5) New songs weren’t memorable\n\n\tUnlike the first film, which wasn’t eligible in the best original song category (all the songs were written over two decades ago for the Broadway show, of course), the second installment was up for the two new tunes, Erivo’s “No Place Like Home” and Grande’s “The Girl in the Bubble.” Maybe voters held those ballads to higher standards since they were comparing them to musical theater classics like “For Good” and “No Good Deed.” But unlike those numbers, nobody left the theater humming “No Place Like Home” or remembered the lyrics to “The Girl in the Bubble.” \n\n\t6) Campaigning matters\n\n\tGrande and Erivo were everywhere for the first film, including a stop at the Paris Summer Olympics, a number of magazine covers and an ultra-viral press junket that cemented the phrase “holding space” in the cultural lexicon. Universal, worried about inundating the public for the sequel, decided to separate the two leading ladies for promotional commitments. Plus, Erivo missed several major events while she prepares for “Dracula” on the West End. But just like Elphaba and Glinda, the witchy best friends at the center of the Ozian saga, Grande and Erivo need each other — and the campaign didn’t fly as high while they were in separate corners of the world.\n",

Pre-orders are available on her official website, which shows that the project will feature 17 tracks including the already released single “Where Is My Husband!”\n\n\n\tDescribing the album in a statement, Raye says, “Music is medicine, I’ve always said that. I guess I’m in the process of making medicine for myself that I can share with the world. I want us all to say to ourselves that it’s going to be all right, and I’m going to have faith in the seeds that I’ve planted beneath the snow. I wanted to create something that is a hug, bed or soft place for that person who needs it.”\n\t\n\n\tThe British singer-songwriter is currently riding high on the success of “Where Is My Husband!,” which hit No. 1 in the United Kingdom and was nominated earlier this week for two BRIT Awards, including song of the year and best pop. Tonight, Raye is kicking off her 51-date sold-out arena tour, “This Tour May Contain New Music,” with shows planned for Europe, the U.K. and the United States. The U.S. leg of the tour begins on March 31.\n\n\tIn addition to her own tour, Raye was announced as a guest on Bruno Mars’ “The Romantic Tour,” kicking off in April and scheduled for stadium shows through the summer.\n\n\tCheck out the official cover art for “This Music May Contain Hope.” below:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAidan Zamiri is a good hang. I just met the 30-year-old photographer, director and creative polymath — but we already have an inside joke. The table at the lobby bar of London’s Soho Hotel where we’re seated is inexplicably made of Hot Wheels, and we spend the first few minutes of our interview making cracks at its expense. It’s the first Saturday in January, and a dreary one at that, but there’s something about Zamiri’s energy that zaps me out of a winter funk. He’s endlessly expressive, rattling off thoughts a mile a minute as if there are too many to fit in his brain, and it’s infectious. \n\t\n\n\tNo wonder Zamiri has found himself in the inner circles of some of the world’s most interesting and sought-after stars, and not just as the visionary behind their music videos or press campaigns, but also as a friend and confidant. Just ask Charli xcx, who enlisted the Scotsman to direct the videos for “360” and “Guess” at the height of the hype over her massive 2024 album “Brat,” or Timothée Chalamet, who collaborated with him on the deliciously deranged press tours for “A Complete Unknown” and “Marty Supreme.”  \n\n\n\t“Don’t know if you’ve seen any of it!” Zamiri teases, knowing full well that Chalamet’s latest stunts — including shouting from the top of the Sphere in Las Vegas and coordinating ping-pong orange outfits with his mother and girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, on the red carpet — have been seen by everyone.  \n\n\t“I love working with people who have a really clear point of view, and Timmy is an insane force,” he says in a Glaswegian brogue between sips of peppermint tea. “When he is geared into doing something, it’s just super inspiring. I feel like I’ve, by osmosis, locked in.” \n\t\n\n\tCreating pop culture moments for big stars has prepared Zamiri well as he embarks on his own press tour for “The Moment,” his directorial debut starring Charli that follows a fictionalized version of the pop star as she launches her “Brat” tour. The A24 film is one of the splashiest titles premiering at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. Until this point, Zamiri has been mysterious — the hype man behind the camera helping the coolest celebrities look even cooler with his unique blend of grunge and high-fashion aesthetics. Now that he’s mastered viral videos, will his talents translate to the big screen? \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAidan Zamiri works with Timothée Chalamet to come up with viral moments for his films.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA24\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOur sit-down marks one of Zamiri’s first profiles, but he doesn’t seem nervous. He shares the same effortless cool of his collaborators — after we settle in, he shrugs off a worn-in leather jacket to reveal a blue-checked Ralph Lauren shirt, and a braided rattail pokes out from the bottom of his brunette mop. He just returned from L.A. two days ago — where he was working with both Charli and Chalamet — but Zamiri shows no sign of jet lag, his blue eyes bright as he talks about the whirlwind year that culminated in making his first film. \n\n\t“This time last year, I knew almost nothing about the process of filmmaking,” Zamiri admits. “So it’s kind of like having a condensed education in all of it. And thank God it was so cool and one of the most intense things I’ve ever done in my life.” \n\n\n\tZamiri met Charli right before “Brat’s” world domination. He directed the music video for the bouncy single “360,” which was released a month before the album’s debut and starred a Rolodex of style icons: Chloë Sevigny, Julia Fox and Rachel Sennott, to name a few. That’s also when he wrote his first “script” — a page and a half for the video’s nearly two-minute opening scene. \n\n\t“I remember having a really quick table read, and it was the most nervous I’d ever been. I was like, ‘Oh God, what if this is terrible? I respect all these people so much!’” Zamiri recalls. “And they read it and we all laughed, and that was one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done. Just literally that table read.” \n\n\tThough Charli had been bubbling just below the mainstream for years, the electro-pop music of “Brat” paired with its I-don’t-give-a-fuck lyrics and unapologetic debauchery turned the album into a mindset — and a massive success. It wasn’t long before the term “brat summer” was coined and the adjective was given new meaning: Instead of a moniker for a petulant child, it was a rallying cry for bad bitches with nothing to lose. “Brat” even crossed over into politics when, in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, Charli tweeted: “Kamala IS brat.” Soon, brands from Kate Spade to Hydro Flask were capitalizing on the trend by working the word “brat” or the album’s signature shade of green into their marketing. It was a once-in-a-generation hit.  \n\t\n\n\t“How cool and rewarding that that was the most successful thing she’s ever done — something that she felt was such a true expression of her,” Zamiri says. “And then it’s interesting to see something like that become so global and so mass consumed that it became a commercial output for various brands. It felt like a really perfect analogy.”\n\n\tAfter the “360” video, Zamiri and Charli started throwing around ideas for a future narrative project, maybe five years on. But things accelerated that fall when the pop star was approached several times about making a “Brat” tour documentary or concert film. \n\n\t“She was like, ‘Well, that feels like the opposite of what I’ve tried to do with ‘Brat,”’ Zamiri says. “That feels like the expected route of capitalizing on something which has been successful, whereas the bigger swing would be to take a format like that and disrupt it.” \n\n\tEnter “The Moment.” Filmed mockumentary style with handheld cameras and several fourth-wall breaks, it takes place from September to November 2024, just as “brat summer” is coming to an end. Charli, as an exaggerated version of herself, begins to shoot a concert film with a sinister director (Alexander Skarsgård) and is caught between honoring her artistic vision and crossing over to the commercial dark side. Zamiri’s style is well suited for the project, with parts of it reading like an extended music video, while the more documentary-like scenes have an unpolished feel. Clocking in at an hour and 43 minutes, “The Moment” mixes scripted scenes with real-life footage, including from rehearsals leading up to Charli’s November 2024 London show. \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharli xcx in “The Moment.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA24\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe movie is also boldly funny — Charli’s many brand deals with the likes of Aperol and Magnum are the butt of several jokes, which was “a real feat for A24’s legal team,” Zamiri says. At the same time, it addresses the crisis that comes when you’ve finally made it. Much of that central theme came from an original piece of writing by Charli that was given to Zamiri and his writing partner Bertie Brandes, known for her essays on fashion and feminism. \n\t\n\n\t“[Charli] identified how it felt to achieve everything you’d ever hoped for, something you’d worked for 15 years — and then all you can feel is this dread of knowing that it’s slipping through your fingers immediately,” Zamiri says. \n\n\tThe initial draft of “The Moment” poured out of Zamiri and Brandes in just 10 days. Then they pitched it to A24, which greenlit the film in early 2025 with a $4 million budget. By March, “The Moment” was filming in London. Just as impressive as the movie’s rapid production is its ensemble cast: alongside Charli and Skarsgård, the call sheet includes Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant and Kylie Jenner, whose role may have come to fruition through Zamiri’s connection with a certain A-list actor. \n\n\t“Kylie and I crossed paths,” Zamiri says with a nervous laugh, not wanting to give too much away. Chalamet and Jenner have been dating for three years and have appeared arm in arm on the red carpet this awards season but remain tight-lipped about one another in the press. “Then we ended up writing a scene with Kylie in mind, and it really became a very pivotal scene in the film. This was Kylie’s first-ever acting role, and I was really surprised that she was so willing and so down. She, like, got it. I think she’s incredible in it.” \n\n\tWhat is it about Zamiri that has made Charli trust him with a mockumentary about her? And how did he get Jenner to agree to grace the silver screen? Brandes says it all comes down to Zamiri’s vision. “He’s so good at communicating with people — every single person, from the actors to the lighting guy to me, we all think we have Aidan’s ear and his full attention,” she says. “Everyone wants to work with him because it’s so inspiring and fulfilling. But at the same time, you feel so comforted — you just know he’s going to create something genius.”  \n\n\t“The Moment” will hit theaters on Jan. 30, a week after its Sundance premiere, and has set its European debut at the Berlin Film Festival next month. As a first-time feature filmmaker, Zamiri feels lucky to be getting a nationwide rollout from A24. \n\t\n\n\t“To write something, get it made, shoot it, feel proud of it, have everyone feel excited about it, and then be able to have it go into theaters immediately is such a luxury,” he says. “I have friends who have made incredible films, and it’s taken so long to get funding, to get it made and then to get distribution for it.” \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCharli xcx in “The Moment.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA24\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBut that doesn’t mean he’s cocky.  \n\n\t“I’m terrified, of course. Are you kidding me?!” Zamiri exclaims, momentarily losing his cool and nearly spilling his tea. \n\n\t“I’m very conscious that there is so much stuff made all the time, and I don’t want to ever contribute to noise in general,” Zamiri continues, taking a more serious tone. “There’s also the responsibility of communicating something which feels true and correct and meaningful. And I feel good about that. I’m sure there will be a mixed reception to it, or maybe everyone will love it! Who knows. But I feel really confident that it feels like me and it feels like Charli and it feels like us.”\n\n\tBy the time “The Moment” premieres at Sundance, it will have been a year and a half since the birth of “Brat.” Should the movie be considered its death knell?\n\n\t“We’re sort of hoping this is almost… I don’t want to say a thesis statement, but it feels like a reflective thought on ‘Brat,’” Zamiri says. “Having it premiere in January feels thematic in some way. There’s something nice about perhaps nodding to the feeling of, this again?”\n\n\tEven if “Brat” summer may be finally coming to an end, Zamiri’s collaboration with Charli is just getting started. Though nothing is set in stone, as the singer continues to further her acting career, there’s been talk of second feature ideas along with Brandes.\n\n\t“The hope is that we try to jump into something quickly,” he says. “’The Moment’ was so based in the real world, it would be cool to perhaps do something that feels like the opposite.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s tough to describe John Wilson’s new documentary, “The History of Concrete,” premiering on opening night at Sundance. On one hand, it’s as promised in the title: An examination of the building block of cities and societies that often goes unnoticed, and how its usage and degradation can stand as a metaphor for human nature. There’s a strong meta-element, as Wilson turns the camera on during the process of finding financing for the project, often unable to close the deal when the topic is, by design, dull. Along the way, his creative tank is fueled while talking with unique people he meets along the way, which recalls his work over three seasons of his HBO series, “How To With John Wilson.”\n\t\n\n\tWilson says that the genesis of “Concrete” came from home repairs, which he also documents in the film.\n\n\n\t“It started fairly innocently when I was trying to figure out how to fix the foundation to my house,” he says. “I try to involve the audience with the very beginning of the creative process in this film, just by showing you where the germ of the idea originates, and then expands outward into this larger portrait of this substance and the people that use it. I really like the subject matter because it seemed extraordinarily hard to make it funny. That’s a challenge that I always like to take on.”\n\n\tA challenge Wilson didn’t anticipate was the feedback he received about how his comedic voice, so sharpened and idiosyncratic on “How To,” might not be seen as fresh when pitching a new feature-length project.\n\n\t“There was a lot of conversation when we first started taking this out to pitch it, from my agents or other industry professionals, who were telling me people want the new,” Wilson says. “They don’t want the exact same thing as the show. I initially resented that, because I felt like this was the best way to do things for me. This was something I had thought about a lot, and I felt it was like the most complete way to express this idea I was exploring.”\n\t\n\n\tYet Wilson was able to reconfigure how he paced his storytelling in a way that created a fresh canvas. Whereas episodes of “How To” were restricted to 28 minutes to examine issues such as “How to Make Small Talk” and “How To Be Spontaneous” through a roundabout series of interviews and excursions, Wilson changed the tempo for “Concrete.”\n\n\t“Transitioning from a hard format to this other kind with no real time constraints, you don’t want to punish the audience,” he says. “But I got really excited, just like trying to think about how to tease out these storylines over a longer period of time. For the show, I would spend maybe a couple of weeks with a main character. With this, I was able to spend a couple of years, witnessing a longer character arc over the course of the production. I think materially it’s very similar to the show, but it also took a lot of effort to let the subject matter speak for itself.”\n\n\tThe scale of the project’s raw material ballooned as Wilson shot 140 hours in several countries, unsure about how the final version of his film might unfold. While it’s touched upon in the film, Wilson says that his fulfillment in life and in the project were inextricably tied together.\n\n\t“My self-worth kind of plummeted, and that’s where I was living for most of the beginning of this project,” he says. “I tried to surround myself with people who were much more confident and assured in what they were doing. I feed off that energy in a way, but it’s isolating when you’re making something like this. It was usually just like me and one other person just driving to and from these shoots and, I don’t know … I’m still unpacking a lot of it, honestly.”\n\n\tOne kindred spirit who helped Wilson push through and complete his vision was Jack Macco, a gigging musician in Long Island whom Wilson met at a liquor store. With a wild mane of hair and a love of rocking out on local stages, Macco is a true character, but what makes him a focal point of the last stretch of the film are unexpected layers we won’t spoil here. But Wison was energized by Macco’s commitment to art and creativity.\n\n\t“You could see him as a mundane example of ambition, which is nice, because he seems genuinely content in a lot of ways,” he says. “It’s something I wasn’t feeling at all when I was making the film. I was trying to absorb some of his enthusiasm and inner peace by spending time with him and getting to understand what motivates him. We see the rooms that he plays in Long Island’s dive bar scene. These places are really valuable. At a point in the film, Jack was the only thing keeping me going. He almost felt like my swimming buddy, and was one of the only bits of continuity I have in my life or with this project right now, creatively.”\n\t\n\n\tThis theme of people finding joy and happiness through their art often appears in the film, as Wilson interacts with an enthusiastic short film crew, extreme ultramarathoners and even the head of GumBusters, a New York City specialty cleaning company founded by a man who loves blasting old gum stains out of concrete.\n\n\tAs he’s gearing up for the “Concrete” premiere, Wilson says he’s put down his “big camera” for a minute, but is always documenting life in his native New York City. While the process of wrapping this film is still fresh, he is excited for future projects.\n\n\t“I have a couple of ideas right now that I’m figuring out how to shop around, but I think none of them are as unsexy as concrete,” he says. “That’s also relative.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tBritish singer-songwriter James Blake has announced that his seventh solo album and his first as a fully independent artist, “Trying Times,” will be released on Friday March 13 via Good Boy Records.\n\n\tThe album is Blake’s first since he took the helm of his business affairs, including booking his own tours and attempting to find as equitable a way as possible to release music — a situation that is reflected in the new album’s cover, which shows Blake spinning multiple plates.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHe spoke with Variety at length about it all a few months ago. “Before last year, I was an artist who very much buried my head in the sand in terms of business,” he said. “And when I really looked into the machinations of what was going on behind each part of the industry, getting all the statements, I saw that there are unethical parts of the model that are responsible for a massive transfer of wealth away from the artist.\n\n\n\t“It’s not that there’s no money there,” he stressed. “It’s just being diverted to the wrong places, and the system is set up to not give you that information.”\n\n\tThe album is preceded by the single and live video for “Death of Love,” which was directed by creative duo Harrison & Adair and shot with the London Welsh Men’s Choir.\n\n\n\n\n\tOver the years Blake has collaborated with Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, SZA, Rosalia, Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott and many others. Most recently, heBlake collaborated with British rapper Dave on his album “The Boy Who Played The Harp,” and with Oscar-winning composer Ludwig Göransson on “Séance,” from the soundtrack from Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” — which today became the most-nominated film in Academy Awards history.\n\t\n\n\tThe album tracklist appears below:\n\n\tWalk Out Music\n\n\tDeath Of Love\n\n\tI Had A Dream She Took My Hand\n\n\tTrying Times\n\n\tMake Something Up\n\n\tDidn’t Come To Argue (ft.

    "body": "\n\tThe first thing I noticed was the quiet. The beautiful pillowy snowbound quiet. The day I arrived in Park City for my first Sundance Film Festival in January 1995, there was much to take in: the awesome mountains, the homes wedged like miniature ski lodges into the hills, the slope of Main Street, with its chic-but-not-yet-so-upscale turquoise-jewelry boutiques (in the thin mountain air, that street could leave you winded as you hiked from the bottom of it up to the Egyptian Theatre), the whole spangly welcoming vibe put out by this former mining town turned ski destination. \n\t\n\n\tBut the quiet! I expected buzz and excitement from America’s premier film festival. Instead, the snowy hush enveloped everything. \n\n\n\tThe buzz would arrive soon enough. Wearing my new Lugz boots, I walked up Main Street to the festival headquarters, located in the lobby of a steakhouse called the Claim Jumper (how quaint!). Inside, it was gloomy and mostly empty. I took a shuttle to the Holiday Village for my first screening, and it made me an instant Sundance believer. The movie was “Party Girl,” starring a then-unknown Parker Posey, though you could already feel an aura gathering around her. (It’s what would come to be known at Sundance as the “It” girl thing.) I loved the film, which was brash and funny and just underground enough in its attitude. \n\n\tDays later, back at the Claim Jumper, I looked up and noticed someone with a shy downward glance seated kitty-corner from me. I realized that it was Kim Cattrall, whom I thought of, at the time, as the title character from “Mannequin.” She was at Sundance co-starring in a movie called “Live Nude Girls,” and as we began to chat, it was clear that she was a deeply serious person, trying to reinvent herself. That’s part of what the Sundance Film Festival was and is about: openness, adventure, art that dares to dream. \n\t\n\n\tIt often felt like the enchanted backdrop of Park City is what made that possible. Ever since 1981, when the Utah/US Film and Video Festival moved there (it was rechristened Sundance in 1991), Park City has been more than a locale. It has been a mythology wrapped in a history tucked inside a vision of what Hollywood was, and what it might become. The frontier trappings, the sunlit spaciousness, the mountains — it was a winter-wonderland reverie of the New Old West, which is part of why Robert Redford moved to the area in 1961. \n\n\tRedford was an ambitious actor whose leap to stardom would be launched by a Western, “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (1969). And in that star-making role, he looked back (to the legends of Old Hollywood) and also forward (to the New Hollywood he was now one of the kings of). Redford had both Hollywoods in his DNA. And that made him the perfect leader-messenger for the next Hollywood, which was incarnated by Sundance. Redford’s presence there, set against the reconfigured Western backdrop of Park City, made a statement that I wouldn’t hesitate to call romantic. It said, “Independent film isn’t separate from the larger-than-life side of movies. It’s a continuation of it.”  \n\n\tNow that Sundance is leaving Park City and heading to Boulder, Colorado, I’ll miss so much about the place. I’ll miss the quiet, which reached its apex in 1997, when there was an epic snowstorm every day. I’ll miss the platonic ideal of a party space on the second floor of the Riverhorse Café. I’ll miss the condo parties in Deer Valley (at one, I got to talk to Brian Wilson). I’ll miss the antique intimacy of the Egyptian, where I watched movies with Paul Schrader when we were jurors in 1998, and I’ll miss the majesty of the Eccles Theatre, which could elevate the smallest film into a séance and turn a major one — like “In the Bedroom” or “Fruitvale Station” or “Manchester by the Sea” — into a movie-world-shaking event. I’ll miss the shuttle buses, which took too long but were a place where you could decompress and meditate, especially after seeing something amazing. I’ll miss the toasty propane heat lamps at the shuttle stops. I’ll miss my favorite restaurants, which were not the “fancy” fusion places on Main Street (salmon with a rosemary pineapple crust accompanied by tomato quinoa? No, thanks) but the places that offered luscious comfort food, like Burgie’s in the ’90s or Taste of Saigon or Grub Steak or Davanza’s, with its high wall of beer cans, and where the thin-crust pizzas are divine. \n\t\n\n\tAnd I’ll miss something that now feels like it’s about the era (the ’90s and 2000s) as much as the place: the chance I had in Park City to meet actors and directors in the most casual of settings, the conversations elevated by the feeling that Park City gave us — that we were all in this together. I had memorable encounters, which occasionally turned into friendships, with so many filmmakers, like Mary Harron and Terry Zwigoff and the Hughes brothers and Catherine Hardwicke and Kevin Smith and Michael Showalter and Lee Daniels. Often, they were there with their first films, which meant that you saw something special: the newness of what they were dreaming. \n\n\tAs it happens, the first years I was at Sundance (1995-98) proved to be pivotal when it came to how technology would impact the art, commerce and karma of independent film. In 1997, for the first time, Hollywood insiders walked up and down Main Street barking into cellphones, these elite early adapters offering an initial glimpse into the new normal. And you could feel — and hear — the vibe shift in 1996 and 1997 with the introduction of internet culture. The quiet was no longer so quiet. The Claim Jumper was still the headquarters, but now it was abuzz. \n\n\tThanks to technology, it would now be possible to shoot an independent film for less money. To this day, the greatest movie I’ve ever seen at Sundance is “Chuck & Buck” (2000), the film that put Mike White on the map. It was shot on utilitarian digital video that didn’t look good even at the time. Yet as a vision, as filmmaking, it was an indie miracle. What my time in Park City has always brought home to me is the yin and yang of indie film: It’s tradition, and it’s change. Here’s hoping that Boulder becomes the rock Sundance now stands on to embrace both.\n",

It's about the harassment she faced on the set of \"It Ends With Us.\"\n      \n    \n          As you know ... earlier this week, court documents came out containing a text Taylor sent to Blake referring to Baldoni as a \"bitch.\" We heard Taylor would be called as a hostile witness in the trial -- though the Baldoni team later said they probably won't need her.\n      \n    \n          Bottom line ... celeb superfans may want all the tea about Blake's famous friends -- but her team says the court system just needs to focus on Lively herself.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Blake Lively\n              \n                          \n                Justin Baldoni\n              \n                          \n                Taylor Swift\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                Movies\n              \n                          \n                Music\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",

    "body": "\n\tIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n\tWes Anderson’s meticulously curated worlds are heading offscreen and into the home with “Live Like Wes,” a new interiors book that translates the filmmaker’s signature visual language into practical design inspiration.\n\n\tAuthored by writer Jessie Atkinson, “Live Like Wes: Home Decor Inspired by Wes Anderson Movies” pairs the director’s most beloved films with contemporary interior design aesthetics, offering readers a room-by-room guide to recreating Anderson’s distinct blend of symmetry, color and nostalgia in real life. The hardcover coffee-table book hits shelves Jan. 13, published by Hachette Mobius.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tEach chapter anchors itself to a specific Anderson film — from a “Fantastic Mr. Fox”-inspired cottagecore kitchen to “Asteroid City”-style Americana — and explores how its visual themes can be translated into livable interiors. Alongside style-focused film analysis, the book features photography from the homes of 25 interior designers. \n\n\tBeyond décor inspiration, “Live Like Wes” also leans into experiential living. Each chapter includes an illustrated DIY craft project and a film-themed party plan, complete with playlists, dream guest lists and  cocktail recipes inspired by the auteur. Projects range from gallery walls and garlands to a skull-and-crossbones trinket box and knitted table favors.\n\n\tAtkinson’s newest release follows a slew of book and merch to come out in recent years, extending the filmmaker’s obsessively curated aesthetic far beyond the screen. Titles like “The Wes Anderson Collection series” — from “The Grand Budapest Hotel” and “The Royal Tenenbaums” to “Isle of Dogs” — have become must-own coffee-table books for cinephiles, blending set photography with deep dives into production design. Meanwhile, design and lifestyle offshoots such as “The Wes Anderson Cookbook”  have translated his visual language into recipes, room layouts and craft projects. Dozens of merch collaborations have also spun off from his theatrical releases — from Moleskine notebooks and stationary to collectible figures, and even hand-blown glass pipes.\n\n\n\tPurchase Atkinson’s newest design book here, and more Wes Anderson merch here. \n",

    "body": "\n\tJ.J. Abrams’ next movie is coming to Imax theaters this fall, Warner Bros. announced Friday.\n\n\tThe film, starring Glen Powell and Jenna Ortega, is officially titled “The Great Beyond” and will launch into theaters on Nov. 13. Abrams wrote and directed the movie, which marks his return to big-screen blockbusters after helming 2019’s “Star Wars: Episode IX -The Rise of Skywalker.” He also produced the project alongside Tommy Gormley. Emma Mackey, Sophie Okonedo, Merritt Wever and Samuel L. Jackson round out the film’s starry ensemble cast.\n\t\n\n\tWarner Bros. also announced release dates for a couple of 2027 releases: Sam Esmail’s “Panic Carefully,” starring Julia Roberts, will debut in Imax theaters on February 26, 2027; meanwhile, Tim Miller and Keanu Reeves’ yet-to-be-titled team-up will premiere on August 13.\n\n\n\t“Panic Carefully” marks the latest collaboration between Esmail and Roberts, following their Prime Video series “Homecoming,” the Starz show “Gaslit” and the Netflix movie “Leave the World Behind.” Starring alongside Roberts are Eddie Redmayne, Brian Tyree Henry, Ben Chaplin, Aidan Gillen, Joe Alwyn, Naledi Murray and Elizabeth Olsen. Esmail and Roberts produced the new movie with Scott Stuber, Chad Hamilton, Marisa Yeres Gill and Lisa Gillan. \n\n\tDetails about Miller and Reeves’ sci-fi film have been kept largely under wraps, but an early logline teased that the plot focuses on “a smuggler caught in a mysterious time loop must survive both bloodthirsty mercenaries and sharks in Caribbean waters, repeating the same deadly day until he finds a way out.” Miller directs from a script by Ian Shorr; Matthew Vaughn, Aaron Ryder, Andrew Swett and John Zaozirny are producing. \n\t\n\n\tNew Line Cinema’s next installment in “The Conjuring” franchise, “First Communion,” is dated for September 10. The prequel movie — directed by Rodrigue Huart from a screenplay by Richard Naing and Ian Goldberg — further expands the $2.7 billion-grossing “Conjuring” universe. The most recent film, “The Conjuring Last Rites,” is the highest-grossing installment to date, earning nearly $495 million worldwide.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOscar voting is about to come to an end, and the question about which films and performances will dominate this year’s Academy Award nominations is still up in the air. The Variety Awards Circuit Podcast Roundtable team gathered to dissect the state of the race, how the Golden Globes results affected voting, and whether any snubs or surprises are lurking in the wings.\n\n\tAfter kicking off the conversation gushing about Apple TV’s hit drama series “Pluribus” with Rhea Seehorn, we got into the night at the Globes. “One Battle After Another” led the night with four wins, including best picture (comedy or musical). At the same time, Chloe Zhao’s “Hamnet” took home a high-profile award for best picture (drama) and Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” walked away with the box office and cinematic achievement category.\n\t\n\n\t“I went 25 for 28, and it feels so anticlimactic,” Clayton Davis, chief awards editor, said. “You could have been ‘Joe Schmo’ from the street and predict the globes and nail like 85 percent of them.”\n\n\n\tThe podcasters agreed that the only real shocks came from Michelle Williams winning for “Dying for Sex” on the TV side and Teyana Taylor’s supporting actress victory for “One Battle After Another.” And if those are considered surprises, we shouldn’t be too hard on the group for following the appropriate tea leaves of the fall and winter awards season.\n\n\tIn addition to delivering what the group agreed was the “speech of the night,” Jenelle Riley, associate features editor, also called Taylor the “star of the BAFTA tea party,” which took place the day before the Golden Globes.\n\t\n\n\tThe group also analyzed how both female acting categories, have a potential for “fluidity” between who makes the cut and who does not. Some of those discussed include Ariana Grande’s chances of a supporting actress nomination for “Wicked: For Good,” and uncertainty about whether both Emma Stone and Kate Hudson could secure best actress nominations for “Bugonia” and “Song Sung Blue.”\n\n\tAnd there are the populist choices that could be lurking within the fray.\n\n\tApple’s high-stakes race car drama “F1” is feeling more like a best picture contender by the day. Jazz Tangcay, senior artisans editor, noted the film’s packed Q&A events and strong guild support, while Michael Schneider, executive TV editor, who has watched the film twice this year, praised it as “a classic sports movie” with “all the beats that you want.”\n\n\tTangcay also noted that Autumn Durald Arkapaw’s cinematography on “Sinners” seems like a slam-dunk for a nomination, calling it “by far the best of the year” and predicting the Filipino cinematographer will make history with her nomination. However, she does acknowledge that “Train Dreams” by Brazilian Adolpho Veloso is a potential candidate for the win.\n\n\tThe group also discussed potential surprises in makeup and hairstyling, such as the unibrow and acne-detailed “Marty Supreme” and the potential for legendary musician Billy Joel to nab his first career nomination for his documentary “Billy Joel Should be Dead.”\n\n\tOscar nominations will be announced Jan. 22, with the ceremony scheduled for Mar. 15.\n\n\tVariety’s “Awards Circuit” podcast, hosted by Clayton Davis, Jazz Tangcay, Emily Longeretta, Jenelle Riley and Michael Schneider, who also produces, is your one-stop source for lively conversations about the best in film and television. Each episode, “Awards Circuit” features interviews with top film and TV talent and creatives, discussions and debates about awards races and industry headlines, and much more.

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from “If You’re Gonna Come for Me, I’ll Finish You,” the fifth episode of “The Traitors” Season 4, now streaming on Peacock.\n\n\tMichael Rapaport is under fire for his latest comments on “The Traitors.” During the fifth episode of Season 4, which was released on Thursday night, the actor called out Colton Underwood during the roundtable.\n\n\tEarlier in the day, Underwood and Rapaport got into a yelling match as the former Bachelor claimed his opponent was a Traitor and tried to convince the rest of the cast that was the case. However, since Underwood had previously led the troops incorrectly when targeting “Big Brother” star Tiffany Mitchell, Rapaport claimed that in fact he was the traitor, trying to throw everyone off. Once at the roundtable, the argument boiled over.\n\t\n\n\t“I am angry, I’m pissed off, and I am isolated because of him, and nobody in this room would be better at holding a secret than you,” Rapaport said, to which Underwood responded, “There it is.”\n\n\tA quick backstory: Underwood appeared on “The Bachelorette” and “The Bachelor,” both showcasing his relationships with women. He spoke often (and wrote in his book) about being straight despite people questioning his sexuality throughout his life. In 2020, Cassie Randolph, who won his season of “The Bachelor,” filed a restraining order against him for stalking and placing a tracker on her car, which he eventually admitted to. The following year, Underwood came out as gay.\n\n\t“You think it was fun for 29 years of my life?” Underwood asked Rapaport while at the roundtable. Quickly, Rapaport said, “No, no, no, that has nothing to do with this. I think you came into this game loving the idea of being a Traitor.”\n\t\n\n\tMultiple other cast members then chimed in. Olympian Johnny Weir said, “You can’t blame somebody being forced intoa closet for the majority of their life,” to which Rapaport replied, “I’m not talking about closets… His behavior is of a Traitor, his behavior is secret, it’s conniving… It’s cowardly.”\n\n\tWhen “Love Island” star Maura Higgins called the remarks “a very low blow,” Rapaport replied, “I don’t think it was, it wasn’t intended to be,” before adding, “I apologize if he took it that way.” \n\n\tWhile the point of the rountable is to banish Traitors, many members of the cast took this chance to oust Rapaport — and didn’t care whether he was a Traitor or Faithful. “Today, the way you spoke to Colton, for me, it’s enough to write your name down. So I think we should just get together and vote him out of here,” said “Survivor” star Natalie Anderson.\n\n\tWith that, 11 out of 16 cast members voted to banish him. When revealing his name, Weir added, “I don’t give a shit what you are. I just want you out of my castle.”\n\n\tAfter his banishment, Rapaport apologized in his confessional. “It sucks, but I felt backed into a corner, and I tried to fight my way out of it. Maybe I fought too hard. I meant what I meant within the context of the game. It had nothing to do with his sexuality,” he said. “I really sincerely apologize if I offended Colton or anybody in the house. That absolutely wasn’t my intention.”\n\n\tAfter the three-episode “Traitors” premiere on Jan. 8, the audience immediately seemed to hate Rapaport as one, and he continually took on fans on X. In response to one tweet making fun of him, he wrote, “They/Them opinions don’t mean sh*t. They Them ain’t even real THEY or THEMS.” He ended up locking his account, going private on X, but has since unlocked it again.\n\n\tAfter the Jan. 15 episodes aired, he posted on X, “I played a hard game, I played a real game & I had a fun. Never wanted to offend anyone watching or the cast.” He has continued to tweet through it, arguing with those posting about him; on Friday, he replied to one “Traitors” viewer on X and mocked them for having pronouns in their bio. He also canceled his exit interviews that were scheduled for Friday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJimmy Kimmel has an offer that he thinks President Donald Trump is “gonna find difficult to refuse.”\n\n\tJoking about Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado’s White House visit on Thursday, during which she presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize, Kimmel proposed a way to one-up her.\n\n\t“If and only if you agree to pull ICE out of Minneapolis and put them back at the borders where they belong, I am prepared to offer you one of the following trophies that I have been honored with over the years,” Kimmel said during his monologue on Thursday as his sidekick Guillermo Rodriguez wheeled out a cart full of trophies.\n\t\n\n\t“The Daytime Emmy I won for best game show host in 1999: That could be yours,” Kimmel continued. “Or perhaps you would prefer my Clio Award for my work selling crap to people. Or my Webby Award, the most prestigious award the internet can give. Or my Writers Guild Award. This is a good one; you can see it looks nice.”\n\n\n\t“Or best of all, I’m willing to hand over my 2015 Soul Train Award for White Person of the Year,” Kimmel concluded as the camera cut to a close-up of the placard. “The choice is yours. I will personally deliver any or even all of these to the Oval Office in exchange for leaving the people of Minneapolis alone.”\n\n\tKimmel spent much of his monologue on Thursday focused on ICE’s escalating presence in Minneapolis and Trump recent comments on it, including his threat to invoke the Insurrection Act. “The Insurrection Act would allow President Trump to send troops to Minneapolis to stop the civil unrest that started when President Trump sent ICE into Minneapolis to start the civil unrest,” Kimmel said near the beginning of the episode. “I don’t know, I guess you have to look at it from his perspective. Poor guy, he hasn’t been able to get an insurrection for years.”\n\t\n\n\tKimmel is one of Trump’s most outspoken critics, perhaps even more so since the fall of 2025, when “Jimmy Kimmel Live” was removed from the air temporarily due to the late night host’s comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk. The suspension incited nationwide conversations about censorship under the Trump administration.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIf you’re a fan of “Heated Rivalry,” you might just have Ontario’s Guelph Storm ice hockey team to thank. Last year, the team missed the playoffs, leaving their facility, the Sleeman Centre, unusually vacant. \n\n\t“We normally don’t book anything into April and May,” said Ryan Giles, who manages the multi-purpose arena. “[But] once they missed the playoffs, I had all this availability. We get inquiries all the time from different shows and films or commercials that are like, ‘Hey, we need an arena for this,’ and we happened to be available. We actually had removed our ice for the season and then put it back in for the film shoot.” \n\t\n\n\tWhile it may have been a bummer for the team, it worked out well for the facility — the “Heated Rivalry” cast and crew shot every hockey sequence at the facility’s rink over the course of just 10 days, transforming the 5,000-seat space into the fictional home of Shane Hollander’s Montreal Metros, Ilya Rozanov’s Boston Raiders and Scott Hunter’s New York Admirals. And while the MLH (the show’s version of the NHL) might be fictitious, that’s not stopping dedicated fans of the series from venturing to the Sleeman Centre to see the rink for themselves. \n\n\n\tCreated by Jacob Tierney, “Heated Rivalry” follows the relationship between closeted gay hockey players Shane and Ilya. To say it’s taken the world by storm would be an understatement; since the show’s premier on Nov. 28, 2025, the Crave original series has accumulated more than 600 million streaming minutes. It makes sense that fans are eager to see where the show was filmed: In the past six weeks, there’s definitely been an uptick in visitors who are “more quick to snap their camera” and a “little more wide eyed around the space” than the typical Guelph Storm spectator, said Giles. \n\t\n\n\tAt this point, he estimated he’s seen hundreds of fans swing by to take selfies or purchase Sleeman Centre merchandise. However, since the hockey games tend to sell out (it is winter in Canada, after all), it’s impossible to know how many onlookers might be in attendance solely to get a glimpse at where the show was shot. “They could easily discreetly come in and we not notice with 5,000 people at a game,” said Giles. \n\n\tOne way he does know fans are visiting is from the facility’s social media mentions, which are in the thousands, he said. “We’ve seen the TikToks,” said Giles. “There’s a lot of them, of people that are just showing up and wanting to take pictures around the building.” Luckily for them, the rink’s team is happy to provide a quick tour, though devotees to the show probably won’t need one: “Once you enter the space, you can see where they were,” said Giles. “If you’ve really watched the show, you’re like, ‘Oh, I know what this is and that is.’” \n\n\tThe rink’s lower bowl is general admission, so anyone is able to purchase a ticket and enjoy a game if they’re interested in getting a closer look. The one spot that’s tricky to access is the suite level, which requires a VIP ticket (that’s where Shane and Ilya have their tense exchange at the Sochi Olympics). “We have had a couple of individuals who did approach us and say, ‘Hey, can I see the space?’ And with our staff, we were able to provide them with a quick tour and then take them back down to the general admission space,” said Giles.   \n\n\tGiles had no idea how popular the show would become (the extent of his knowledge pre-shooting was that it was a “hockey based production”), but it’s been exciting for him to see how it’s sparking an interest in the sport from a new demographic. “There’s been so many individuals that generally don’t follow hockey, or aren’t interested in hockey, that this is exposing them to,” said Giles. The Sleeman Centre isn’t the only place this is happening — interest in hockey tickets on StubHub increased 40% during “Heated Rivalry’s” run, the company reported earlier this month. Plus, amongst the typical “boys club” culture of the sport, the show is “opening doors,” said Giles. “It’s pushing those boundaries to say, ‘It’s 2026, let’s all be inclusive’… We want to support it all we can.” \n\t\n\n\tThe “Heated Rivalry” effect isn’t exclusive to the Sleeman Centre. Other filming locations like Relay Coffee Roasters, which stands in as the Straw+Berry smoothie shop in the third episode, have also seen a steady stream of fans coming to their cafe in Hamilton, Ont.. \n\n\t“The response has been really fun,” said Rachel Hofing, who co-founded Relay Coffee Roasters with her husband, Jason. “People have been kind of making a plan to come see it, whereas they may not have heard of my cafe otherwise… There’ve been quite a few people coming in and then posting about it, always with some little joke about the ‘Blue Moon Over Brooklyn’ smoothie.”  \n\n\tAnd while Relay Coffee doesn’t actually offer smoothies, they are experimenting with ways to get a “Heated Rivalry” drink on the menu — right now, they’re working on a banana brulee syrup and are hoping to add a banana blueberry coffee to their offerings (both nods to Scott and Kips’ relationship in the episode). The cafe is even set to host a sold-out fan meet up later this month. \n\n\tOther filming locations in Ontario include Mansion Nightclub, the rooftop bar Lavelle, Le Tambour Tavern and Dundurn Castle, which acts as Moscow during Ilya’s jogging scenes, to name a few. \n\n\tNaturally, speculation around Season 2 has already begun. But Giles isn’t able to provide any insight into when that shooting might take place: “We haven’t heard from the production company for Season 2,” said Giles. “However, I could move a few things around if the opportunity came up.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe term Gold Star Family refers to the immediate family of a U.S. service member who died in the line of duty. It’s a term Oscar-nominated actor Virginia Madsen was all too familiar with even before she signed on to the film “Sheepdog,” which hits theaters today.\n\n\tWritten, directed, produced and starring Steven Grayhm, “Sheepdog” tells the story of Calvin Cole, an Army veteran battling with PTSD. He is helped on the road to recovery by his unlikely friendship with a recent parolee and Vietnam veteran (Vondie Curtis-Hall) and Dr. Elecia Knox (Madsen), a VA trauma therapist-in-training.\n\t\n\n\tHer nephew, Hudson, was a young serviceman who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2022. Hudson’s father was actor Michael Madsen, who passed away last year. Madsen recalls how she struggled to help her family upon Hudson’s passing. “You have this feeling of, ‘What can I do? How do we help each other?’”\n\n\n\tNot long after, she received the script for “Sheepdog,” and the story resonated with her, particularly as Calvin is a young soldier. While she says she was “blown away by the beauty” of the script, she still wanted to clear it with her family. “I needed to go to them individually and ask for their blessing,” she reveals. “I told them, ‘I think this is right. I think this is a way that I can honor him. I think they’re talking about it in the right way.’” It helped knowing Grayhm had spent 10 years talking to veterans and their families to get the script right. There were also 17 military veterans and five Gold Star family members working on the set and in post-production of the film.\n\t\n\n\tWhile shooting the film was a great experience, Madsen also knows that “once my job is done, you don’t know what they’re going to do with it.” So when she was finally able to see “Sheepdog,” she was overwhelmed. “It was so incredible,” she recalls. “They did it right, and it affected me on such a deep, personal level.” That feeling only increased when she began to travel with the film to festivals and attend screenings with Gold Star families.\n\n\tSpeaking with so many people — both in preparing for the film and after screening it — has been deeply moving. It’s also been rewarding to open conversations about PTSD, a term that might initially “make people squeamish to hear.” Says Madsen, “We all know the term Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but I learned a new term, which is Post-Traumatic Growth. Recovery can lead to growth, and people need to know the helpers are out there. I wanted to see the good side of this story and show that it’s possible.”\n\n\tThough the film deals with serious subject matter, it is ultimately hopeful. In addition, war is never shown on screen. And the audiences have been appreciative: “You meet so many people who say, ‘This is our voice. You heard us. Nobody is talking about these things.’”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAllen Media Group Motion Pictures\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPlaying Dr. Knox has also helped Madsen in her own life as she learned more about how therapists help process grief with such methods as EMDR, a process depicted in the film. “This experience and being able to talk to other people has really helped ground me,” she says, adding that it was helpful when her brother passed away. “I’m not saying that I didn’t fall apart because I really did, but I had some tools, and I was able to speak to others about it and be supportive. It helped me feel I wasn’t alone in all of this.”\n\n\tSeveral of the family members she sought permission from have also seen the film and have been very supportive. “I was open about how I was going to be talking about the film and wanted to be able to name him, so I checked in with them again,” she says. “Most people know someone who has been through something like this, and I hope it leads to more conversation and people connecting with one another because we are losing a lot of human interaction behind our screens. And the smallest gestures can matter.”\n\t\n\n\tTo that end, Madsen recalls asking a veteran how he really felt when people say, “Thank you for your service.” She reveals, “He said, ‘If there is meaning behind those words, it feels really good.’ If you mean it and you give someone that moment, you could make someone’s day.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Brooklyn Nine-Nine” co-creator Dan Goor and executive producer Luke Del Tredici have secured a pilot order from NBC for an untitled detective comedy.\n\n\tPer the cheeky logline, the project “continues the proud tradition of Los Angeles private eyes that began with Philip Marlowe and will end with this show.”\n\n\tThe pilot will be executive produced by Goor and Del Tredici, and the studio is Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group. No additional details about the pilot, including who might be cast in it, were revealed. \n\t\n\n\tThis is one of many pilots ordered by NBC in the past week. On Thursday, the network announced a drama pilot from Dean Georgaris and John Fox, inspired by the real-life FBI research of Dr. Ann Burgess. Earlier this week, the network announced a drama pilot order from Josh Safran, Jenna Bush Hager and Ben Spector called “Protection,” about a family of law enforcement agents becoming the target of a mysterious assassin. Plus, NBC gave a pilot order to a “contemporary update” on “The Rockford Files” from Mike Daniels (“Sons of Anarchy”).\n\n\n\tThe network also announced a comedy series in development called “Last Chance Lawyer,” starring Henry Winkler as an unorthodox criminal defense attorney who is a fierce advocate for his underdog clients, believing, according to the logline, “that no matter what they are accused of, the system is always guiltier.”\n\n\tAlso on the NBCUniversal comedy front is “Dig,” a series from Michael Schur (“The Office,” “Parks and Recreation”) and Amy Poehler about four archaeologists who are pulled into an international conspiracy. That show is set to debut on Peacock.\n",

    "body": "\n\tTeresa Palmer has been cast in the “God of War” series adaptation at Amazon Prime Video, Variety has confirmed with sources.\n\n\tPalmer is the latest cast member on the show, following the announcement that Ryan Hurst will star as Kratos. Amazon did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment on Palmer’s casting, but sources say she will star as Sif. In the games, Sif is the wife of Thor and one of the chief Aesir. Interestingly, Hurst voiced Thor in the game “God of War: Ragnarok.”\n\t\n\n\tPalmer is primarily known for her work in film, having starred in features like “The Fall Guy,” “Hacksaw Ridge,” “The Grudge 2,” “I Am Number Four,” and “Knight of Cups.” In television, she has been in shows such as “A Discovery of Witches,” “The Clearing,” and “Mix Tape.” She will next be seen in the Australian series “The Family Next Door.” \n\n\n\tPalmer is repped by CAA, Management 360, Shanahan Management in Austalia, and Sloane Offer. \n\n\tAs previously reported, the series will pick up with the story of the two most recent “God of War” games, in which Kratos must raise his ten-year old son Atreus. Per the logline, “Father and son Kratos and Atreus embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.”\n\n\tAmazon’s adaptation of “God of War” has had a long road to the screen already. The show was originally greenlit at the streaming arm of the e-commerce giant back in 2022. Original showrunner Rafe Judkins exited the show in October 2024, with Ronald D. Moore joining as the new showrunner not long after.\n\t\n\n\tMoore is the writer, executive producer, and showrunner on “God of War” under his Tall Ship Productions banner. Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes. Maril Davis of Tall Ship also executive produces alongside Cory Barlog, Naren Shankar, Matthew Graham, Asad Qizilbash, Jeff Ketcham, Hermen Hulst, Roy Lee, and Brad Van Arragon. Joe Menosky, Marc Bernardin, Tania Lotia, and Ben McGinnis serve as co-executive producers on the series. The series is co-produced by Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios in association with PlayStation Productions and Tall Ship Productions. Tall Ship is under an overall deal at Sony TV.\n\n\tDeadline first reported Palmer’s casting. \n",

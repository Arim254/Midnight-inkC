    "body": "\n\tAs Forum, the industry program of documentary festival IDFA, launches today, Adriek van Nieuwenhuijzen, the festival’s head of industry, and its artistic director Isabel Arrate Fernandez, talk about the shifts in the business landscape, and how the festival is responding to those changes with modifications to its industry program.\n\n\tReflecting on the challenges that face documentary filmmakers in the market, Van Nieuwenhuijzen observes that there is a disconnect between what broadcasters and streamers consider to be documentaries worthwhile investing in and IDFA’s view.\n\t\n\n\t“Often their definition of what a documentary is is not the same as what we consider as an interesting, important creative work,” Van Nieuwenhuijzen says. “So, it’s a matter of definition. At IDFA, we stand for artistic, bold filmmaking, and that is not always what is, let’s say, celebrated at some television stations or streamers. The filmmakers aiming to make these kind of films often face difficulties in finding their finance, and these opportunities can often be found when they co-produce with local, often European producers, also some transnational funds. But it is not a very positive outlook if you look at financing opportunities in total.”\n\n\n\tVan Nieuwenhuijzen adds that there are “different realities” for filmmakers. “We still get films with a budget close to a million euros, whereas others are making a feature film for 300,000 euros,” she says. “They all exist next to each other, and both types of projects are programmed next to each other at Forum.”\n\n\tFernandez adds that IDFA has often, in previous editions, looked at how tough it is for filmmakers to survive financially, especially as the market seems to be in a continuous cycle of change. “The steps that we have taken now with these changes [to Forum] are related to that, in the sense of trying to keep adapting the model of the market so that it suits the reality of the people that are making the films,” she says, “or, at the very least, we have tried to create more opportunities and a space where different ways of making the films, different ways of collaborating can exist.”\n\t\n\n\tVan Nieuwenhuijzen underscores the festival’s desire to “elevate” artistic documentaries, and for those the priority was to find co-producers rather than chase commissions from broadcasters and streamers, she explains.\n\n\tThis led to the formation four years ago of Producers Connection Presentations, which aimed to connect the producers of artistic documentaries with co-producing partners. Meanwhile, those projects that did want to target broadcaster and streamer buyers were focused on the Forum Pitch sessions.\n\n\tThis year, in a further move to boost the prospects of artistic docs, Producers Connection Presentations and the Forum Pitches will run alongside each other at ITA on Monday and Tuesday mornings, allowing Forum guests to attend both, and Van Nieuwenhuijzen says the integration will ensure the artistic projects “get far more visibility.”\n\n\tFernandez adds that the aim of the changes is to burst the different bubbles that professionals exist in and “create crossover so that people are triggered by something that is happening in a sphere where they normally would not work in, or films they normally would not see.”\n\n\tAnother change is that the Forum will introduce thematic panels to replace the post-pitch feedback from buyers. The thematic panels will be “curated around specific financing models, aiming to provide filmmakers with practical insights on navigating the current documentary financing landscape,” IDFA says.\n\n\tOne-on-one meetings with potential buyers and co-producers will remain a core element of Forum, IDFA adds, “allowing for in-depth conversations around artistic intent, financing plans, and potential collaborations.”\n\n\tThe thematic panels will be “quite small scale and informal presentations” by industry representatives “laying out their formats, their strands and their strategies,” Van Nieuwenhuijzen says. Among examples of questions that could be posed, she says, are: How do I find a broadcaster or funding in France? How do the transnational funds work? What are the opportunities with Eurimages? Or, what are the co-production opportunities with the Nordic countries?\n\n\tFernandez comments that the festival and Forum work together to create a “meeting place” for filmmakers, producers and buyers, and host a broad spectrum of documentaries. All parts of IDFA, including the Bertha Fund, are “interconnected, but at the same time also operate separately,” and while the Forum is aimed at professionals who differ in their interests to the public attendees of the festival, there are “overlapping circles.”\n\t\n\n\tIt should be noted that IDFA’s reputation for inclusivity was challenged last month, when several media outlets, including Variety, claimed that IDFA was not selecting films from Israel or allowing Israeli filmmakers to apply for accreditation.\n\n\tThe festival rejected the assertion but admitted that films and filmmakers that had received funding from the Israeli government had not been accepted and conceded that it had signed up to a cultural boycott of Israel (see here), in line with its existing guidelines.\n\n\tIDFA said in a statement, “If filmmakers and films have demonstrable ties to governments that contribute to serious human rights violations, these films are generally not selected.”\n\n\tIsraeli film professionals see the matter differently, as you can read in Variety’s report on the issue, here.\n",

    "body": "\n\tBarcelona-based studio Filmax, behind a brace of new titles at the American Film Market – survival thriller “Balandrau,” time loop comedy-thriller “Five More Minutes,” Spanish women’s soccer origins tale “Another League” – has secured world sales rights outside Spain to “A Son” which bows Nov. 15 in main International Competition at the Cairo Film Festival.\n\n\tAs already announced, Filmax has domestic distribution rights to “A Son” in Spain and will release it in Spanish cinema theaters during the first half of 2026.  \n\t\n\n\t“A Son” adapts a Spanish publishing phenomenon, Barcelona writer Alejandro Palomas’ illustrated novel “Un Hijo,” translated into over 20 languages. “Un Hijo” also won Spain’s National Prize for Children’s and Young Adult’s Literature. \n\n\tA world premiere at Cairo, “A Son” also marks the live action feature debut of well-respected Seville and Madrid-based writer-producer-director Nacho la Casa, who co-penned and directed 2016 animated feature “Ozzy.” \n\n\tLa Casa is best known afterwards for producing two more toon pics, 2014’s “Superklaus” and this year’s “Norbert.” “A Son,” which he also co-wrote, remains in the world of children, not as a target audience but rather as its subject. \n\n\tCo-written by Juan R. Apolo (“When Brooklyn Met Seville”), “A Son” kicks off when María, an inexperienced school psychologist, begins to suspect that something is very wrong with Guille, 8, new to the school, who seems simply immensely and suspiciously happy, hiding maybe a dramatic situation with potentially terrible consequences. She determines to decipher Guille’s drawings, as well as overcome his father’s aggressive resistance to any investigation.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA Son\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Filmax\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“The book is for no specific age. I had’t read anything about an ‘emotional’ detective of children. Something’s wrong with Guille and what’s wrong is very deep,” Palomas said when the novel appeared in 2016. \n\n\t“This powerful film explores fear, silence and the fragile bond established between a child and the only adult who dares to listen to him, the school psychologist,” Filmax said in a statement.  \n\n\t“A Son” stars Macarena García (“La Mesías,” “House on Fire”), fast emerging as one of the top actors of her generation, and Hugo Silva (“Un amor”) who demonstrated his range in Movistar Plus+ hit series “Marbella.”\n\n\t“My favourite kinds of films are those that stir up your emotions, and if there’s one quality that ‘A Son’ has, it is precisely that,” said La Casa. “When I finished reading the novel, I knew I had to make it into a film. ‘A Son’ challenges us as grownups, as well as taking us back to that innocence of when we were children. A childhood that is, unfortunately, becoming increasingly endangered in our society.”\n\n\t“This is a project we’ve been following for a long time. We know how deeply so many people were touched by the novel and the expectation around its film adaptation is huge,” added Ivan Díaz, Filmax head of international. “Its recent selection at the Cairo Film Festival is a wonderful recognition and proves that it is a film capable of moving people around the world over.”\n\n\t“A Son” is produced by Capitán Araña and Guion Alto, La Casa’s  Madrid and Seville labels, as well as Veleta Films AIE. It is backed by Spanish public broadcaster RTVE, pay TV/SVOD dinar Movistar+ and Andalusian state TV Canal Sur, and supported by the Andalusian Regional Government, the Madrid regional government, the Provincial Council of Álava in the Basque Country and the E.U. Media Program, receiving funding from Spain’s Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO).\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Egypt Film Commission aims to increase foreign shoots in Egypt, in the wake of recent high-profile productions, including Guy Ritchie’s “Fountain of Youth,” shot at the Giza Pyramids, Neil Burger’s espionage thriller “Inheritance,” shot in Cairo, Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked: For Good,” and Mr Beast’s online video, “I Spent 100 Hours Inside the Pyramids.”\n\n\tLine production in Egypt for these projects was handled by ASAP Productions, Hama Film Productions, Misr International Films and Filmedia LLC, respectively.\n\t\n\n\tASAP Productions also serviced part of season one of the Paramount series “The Agency,” which filmed in Cairo in 2024, and the company’s executive producer, Amin El Masr, says he is actively seeking new productions.\n\n\n\tFilmedia serviced “Wicked: For Good,” with a four-day shoot in Egypt’s White Desert National Park and previously line produced part of the prologue for Colin Trevorrow’s “Jurassic World: Dominion” in 2020, overseen by VFX supervisor, Pablo Helman.\n\n\t“We’re immensely grateful to Universal for their continued trust and support,” says Ahmed Kardous, Filmedia’s CEO and co-founder, adding that he is currently in discussions on several international projects.\n\n\tThe EFC secured special access to the Giza Pyramids for Mr Beast’s 21-minute internet show, which clocked up 43 million views in its first 24 hours and generated over 200 million views on YouTube.\n\n\tSince its launch in 2019, the EFC has assisted over 90 international productions. “This momentum reflects the country’s unparalleled historical landscapes, diverse urban backdrops, and highly capable production services,” says Ahmed Badawi, EFC’s managing director.\n\t\n\n\t“A growing number of production companies from the United States, as well as leading studios and independent producers from Italy, India, China, Kuwait, and other countries across Europe, Asia, and the Gulf region, have expressed strong interest in filming here. This reflects Egypt’s unique combination of cinematic landscapes, world-renowned heritage sites, experienced local crews, and our competitive facilitation environment.”\n\n\tThe EFC’s activity is set against a broader government strategy to augment international awareness of Egypt’s cultural assets, encompassing recent initatives such as the opening of the $1 billion megaproject, the Grand Egyptian Museum.\n\n\tThe EFC is a subsidiary of the Egyptian Media Production City, which was founded 25 years ago, and covers an area of 2 million square meters (12.5 million square feet). It is considered to be the largest media and production entity in the Middle East, including sound studios and extensive backlots.\n\n\tThe EMPC offers a 30% cashback scheme for eligible on-site expenditure in its facilities and services. Badawi says that the EFC is currently in active discussion with relevant government authorities to introduce new broader production incentives for off-site and location-based spending in the country.\n\n\tThe EFC positions itself as a one-stop shop for filming in Egypt, including facilitating shooting permits and liaising with local line producers.\n\n\tOther recent international shoots include Barbara Schulz’s “Treasure Hunters: On the Tracks of Khufu,” part of the climate change documentary “Groundswell,” and part of the Belgian eight-episode crime caper series “The Big Fuck-Up,” starring Willem De Schryver and directed by Wim Geudens.\n\n\tTo reeinforce collaboration with Asian and African film markets the EFC recently signed Memorandums of Understandings with China’s Ory Group and the African Film Finance Forum, with the stated goal of strengthening Egypt’s positioning as a central hub for regional co-productions. The EFC also met with India’s Joint secretary minister of information, and United Media Services in March 2025, to discuss how to enhance media and film collaboration between Egypt and India.\n\n\tRecent productions from Asia include Korean TV show “Hit and Miss Tour 3,” and Chinese film “Welcome to Dragon Restaurant,” by Wen Muye (“Dying to Survive”).\n\t\n\n\tAs part of its campaign to attract foreign productions, in Cannes this year the EFC teamed up with Cairo Intl. Film Festival and El Gouna Film Festival to present a unified Egyptian Pavilion, and went on to win the Best Pavilion Design Award.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPrime Video is marking the Indian women’s cricket team World Cup triumph with a special episode of its unscripted series “Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle,” featuring championship-winning players Jemimah Rodrigues and Shafali Verma.\n\n\tHosted by Bollywood actor Kajol and author Twinkle Khanna, the installment will explore the team’s journey to the title, focusing on the athletes’ experiences representing India on the global stage.\n\n\n\t“Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle,” a Banijay Asia production, has become Prime Video’s most-watched unscripted original series in India. \n\t\n\n\t“Team India’s World Cup victory is a landmark moment and a source of immense national pride that will propel women’s cricket in India, inspiring generations of aspiring sportswomen,” said Nikhil Madhok, director and head of originals at Prime Video India. “At Prime Video, we take pride in celebrating real-life stories that move and inspire. It’s a privilege to host Jemimah Rodrigues and Shafali Verma from the World Cup winning team on ‘Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle’ for a candid, heartfelt conversation that celebrates their unwavering spirit and the historic win that captured the entire nation’s heart.”\n\n\tMrinalini Jain, group chief development officer at Banijay Asia and Endemol Shine India, described the World Cup victory as “not just a sporting milestone — it’s an emotional, cultural and landmark moment for India that will be etched in history forever.”\n\n\tKajol emphasized the cultural significance of the team’s achievement. “When India won the 2025 Women’s Cricket World Cup, history was made in a way that went far beyond the sport,” she said. “After playing the match of their lives for every woman who’s ever been told to stay in her lane, these girls look like they’re in no mood to hold back — not in their words, and definitely not in their shots.”\n\t\n\n\tCo-host Twinkle Khanna added that the cricketers’ World Cup performance demonstrates how they “break the glass ceiling and every barrier of convention, charting a path for other women in their tow.”\n\n\tThe special episode extends the series’ run as Prime Video continues expanding its unscripted programming slate in India. The streamer’s original content library includes scripted series such as “Panchayat,” “Mirzapur,” “The Family Man” and “Citadel: Honey Bunny,” alongside unscripted formats and post-theatrical film releases.\n\n\tBanijay Asia, launched in 2018 as a joint venture between Banijay Group and Deepak Dhar, produces both scripted and unscripted content for Indian platforms. The company’s unscripted portfolio includes “Temptation Island,” “MTV Roadies,” “The Voice” and “Into the Wild with Bear Grylls.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tLive on stage at BravoCon in Las Vegas Friday night, “Real Housewives” executive producer Andy Cohen offered Vicki Gunvalson her old job back for the upcoming 20th season of “The Real Housewives of Orange County.” During a taping of “The Bravos” — BravoCon’s biennial awards show, which will air on Nov. 16 — Cohen told Gunvalson he wants her as a full-time cast member on the show for its historic Season 20. “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” which premiered on Bravo on March 21, 2006, was the inaugural series in the franchise that would change Bravo, and popular culture writ large.\n\t\n\n\tGunvalson, seemingly surprised when Cohen handed her the show’s symbolic orange, immediately said yes to the offer.\n\n\n\tGunvalson — who in her Season 10 tagline iconically declared, “I’m the OG of the OC, and everyone else is just a copy” — helped create the template for “Real Housewives” cast members. As the owner of a successful insursance company in Orange County, she’s a professional woman with two kids and an incredibly messy personal life. \n\n\tSeason 19 of “The Real Housewives of Orange County” is set to conclude on Nov. 20, with the third of its reunion episodes. As the first of the “Real Housewives” shows to reach a 20th season, a rarely achieved milestone for any television show, Bravo is expected to plan celebrations around this landmark. After an inwardly focused 19th season — during which the cast argued excessively about off-screen events, such as illicit conversations with Bravo “bloggers” — “RHOC” is expected to have a shake-up of its lineup.\n\t\n\n\tEnter, Vicki Gunvalson. At the start of “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” Gunvalson was married to Donn Gunvalson (her second husband), but after she told him that her “love tank was empty” (due to his lack of romantic gestures) they split, and divorced in 2014.\n\n\tGunvalson’s divorce set the stage for one of the best seasons in “Real Housewives” history: Season 10 of “RHOC,” which showed that the series could go from being a docusoap about women’s lives to being a riveting true crime thriller. Brooks Ayers, Gunvalson’s boyfriend, faked a cancer diagnosis, and it took a village of women to expose Brooks, led by Detective Meghan King, with assists from Officers Shannon Beador, Tamra Judge and Vicki’s own daughter, Briana Culberson (who hated Brooks most of all).\n\n\tRarely has there been a more satisfying mystery on television, as the truth about his faked diagnosis of stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma — including him forging medical records and bills — unfolded as the season came to a head. Gunvalson never broke, though, and never spilled exactly what she knew, and when she knew it. As another real-life “Dirty John” narrative, Brooks-faking-cancer forever expanded the pleasures of what “Real Housewives” can do.\n\n\tGunvalson was a fulltime cast member through Season 13, but was demoted to “friend” status the next season, after Cohen said they wanted to “freshen” the show. She’s appeared occasionally since, since she and Beador remain close (though the erstwhile “tres amigas” — Beador, Judge and Gunvalson are no more).\n\n\tBravoCon, the fourth edition of the NBCUniversal network’s fan convention, is taking place in Las Vegas from Nov. 14-16.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This article contains major spoilers for Osgood Perkins‘ “Keeper,” now playing in theaters.\n\n\tDirector Osgood Perkins has given us not one, but two twisted horror movies this year that are vastly different but equally chilling: “The Monkey,” a gory Stephen King adaptation that dropped in February, and “Keeper,” a haunted cabin thriller releasing in theaters this weekend.\n\n\n\tMuch like Perkins’ past horror movies “Longlegs” and “The Blackcoat’s Daughter,” there’s more going on in “Keeper” than just a couple camping out in a creepy cabin in the woods. The nature getaway soon takes a terrifying turn for Liz (Tatiana Maslany) and and her boyfriend Malcolm (Rossif Sutherland), as Liz begins seeing visions of undead spirits and Malcolm’s true intentions are revealed.\n\t\n\n\tNear the end of “Keeper,” it’s revealed that Malcolm isn’t actually a hard-working doctor, he’s really an immortal manipulator who lures women to his cabin to sacrifice them in order to prolong his life. In a flashback 200 years ago, a young Malcolm and his cousin capture a mysterious pregnant woman who was trespassing on their land. She turns out to be some kind of witch who gives birth to a horde of monsters. In the years that follow, the creatures grant Malcolm and his cousin eternal life in exchange for the lives of women they bring to the cabin for them to feast on. That explains why Liz sees the visions of undead ghouls roaming the property, like a woman with a bloody bag over her head, a long-necked spirit and a white-faced monster spewing gunk from its mouth.\n\n\tBut Liz doesn’t succumb to Malcolm’s evil plans for her. After revealing his true intentions, he locks her in the basement, where the monsters actually embrace Liz and don’t tear her apart. In a twist, the pregnant woman 200 years earlier looked exactly like Liz, so the creatures view her as their mother. The monster with the bag over her head reveals her creepy face, which has multiple eyes and mouths, and calls herself Liz’s child. \n\t\n\n\tWhen Malcolm wakes up the next morning, he suddenly has aged decades overnight. Liz, with the power of her spooky brood behind her, flips the script and captures him. She ties him upside-down and hangs him by his feet from a tree to dunk his head into a pot of honey. In the final shot, we see Liz’s face, which has the same jet-black eyes as her newfound monster children. In the end, it wasn’t the grotesque ghouls causing harm, it was actually the people inside the cabin.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe “Now You See Me” franchise’s reappearing act is landing on the top of box office charts, debuting ahead of the weekend’s other new releases “The Running Man” and “Keeper.”\n\n\tLionsgate’s “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” heisted $8.4 million across Friday and preview screenings from 3,403 locations. The PG-13-rated threequel is looking at a three-day opening between $21 million and $24 million — about in line with pre-weekend projections and in the ballpark of the prior 2016 entry, which opened to $22 million.\n\t\n\n\tCritics turned in mediocre marks for “Now You Don’t,” but it is the best-reviewed of the trilogy. Meanwhile, audiences lean positive at a “B+” grade from moviegoer pollster Cinema Score (though lower than the “A-” grades for both prior entries). Lionsgate shelled out north of $90 million to revive the franchise, which is directed by Ruben Fleischer and sees Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco return as a quartet of Robin Hood-like illusionists. Both prior entries scored a majority of their grosses overseas and, notably, Lionsgate typically sells off international rights to limit its financial exposure, at the cost of capping upside.\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, Paramount’s “The Running Man” starring Glen Powell will have to vie for second place against the sophomore weekend of “Predator: Badlands” (funnily, another stab at resurrecting a property that was first introduced to moviegoers via an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle in the ’80s.) The R-rated “Running Man” racked up $6.4 million across Friday and preview screenings from 3,534 locations. That puts the film on track to land behind projections for a debut north of $20 million, now forecast for the $17 million to $19 million range.\n\t\n\n\tIt’s an inauspicious kick-off for the Stephen King adaptation, which carries a hefty $110 million production budget co-financed by Domain Entertainment. Reviews have been lukewarm, though audiences are kinder at a B+ grade from Cinema Score. But with a crowded November slate ahead, including “Wicked: For Good” and “Zootopia 2,” “The Running Man” likely could’ve used some much stronger initial buzz to propel it through the coming weeks.\n\n\tAlso opening this weekend, Neon’s “Keeper,” the latest indie horror effort from writer-director Osgood Perkins, earned about $1 million from 1,950 locations across Friday and previews. It’s headed for a fifth-place debut. The opening doesn’t compare to the last two Perkins efforts — last year’s summer breakout “Longlegs” ($22 million) and this past spring’s “The Monkey” ($14 million). Reviews are worse than those last two movies too, and Cinema Score turned in a dismal “D+” grade.\n\n\tDisney’s “Predator: Badlands” earned $3.5 million on its second Friday, down 68% from its opening day total a week ago. The science-fiction sequel’s domestic gross is now at $56 million and looks to go north of $66 million through Sunday. It’s gunning to pass “Alien vs. Predator,” which, though a crossover, is the biggest domestic box office hit ever for the franchise with $80.2 million in North America.\n\n\t“Regretting You” will round out the top five, earning $1.2 million on Friday and projecting a 39% drop for a $4 million fourth weekend and another strong hold. Paramount’s release of the Colleen Hoover adaptation will hit a domestic total of $45 million through Sunday.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe cable outlet known until Saturday morning as MSNBC has long been known for newsy hot takes. Now it’s putting some emphasis on reporters’ news breaks.\n\n\tYes, that was MSNBC in September touting a dispatch from reporters Carol Leonnig and Ken Dilanian, who found the FBI in 2024 allegedly recorded current White House border czar Tom Homan accepting a paper bag containing $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as business executives. After President Trump took office, however, the probe was shut down, they reported. Suddenly, MSNBC had kicked off a news cycle, instead of just weighing in on it later in the evening.\n\t\n\n\tThe network, which just changed its name to MS NOW as it splits from NBC News and NBCUniversal, has gained some notice recently, but not necessarily always tied to the latest rhetorical zingers from Lawrence O’Donnell, insights from Rachel Maddow or inside-the-government analysis from Jen Psaki or Nicolle Wallace. Where the network once relied entirely on the journalism apparatus of NBC News to inform its programming, it now has dozens of its own journalists trying to break stories about the White House, the Department of Justice, heck, maybe even Taylor Swift if it’s something about which viewers might care. The network was first to secure Senator Alex Padilla in June for a live interview after he was forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security press conference. The network has even landed appearances by newsmakers who might not typically come on MSNBC, including U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\t\n\n\tThere are ambitious plans in place for a newly built journalism team. “We are planning to have our reporters talking to individuals in communities to understand their view, what America looks like now, and it will be, you know, it will be honest,” says Joey Cole, who has joined MS NOW as vice president of planning after working as a producer for NBC News. “We’re going to be raw.”\n\n\tCould the infusion of home-grown journalism dim some of MS NOW’s blue leanings? Facts, after all, can sometimes get in the way of a good primetime soliloquy. And what if some of the findings of MS NOW’s news staff clash with what the network’s primetime partisan die-hards want to hear?\n\n\t“I think it’s important to note that we are a news department. And in our jobs the news and the facts will take us to whatever conclusion — the facts take us to in the story. And that is what we are here to do, what we focus on,’[says Scott Matthews, senior vice president of newsgathering for MS NOW. “We never really worry at all about, you know, who is going to like the story and who is going to not like the story,” he adds. There is an expectation that the work of his staff will appear on both MS NOW’s opinion program as well as its daytime news hours, and across TV and digital as well.\n\n\tUnder Rebecca Kutler, named president in February, the network has touted new editorial hires like David Rohde, Jacob Soboroff and Leonnig and Dilanian, as well as newsgathering alliances with AccuWeather and Sky News. It has also parted ways with some of its more vociferous left-leaning personalities, including Joy Reid and Katie Phang.\n\n\tStill, no one managing MS NOW, at least, sees a purple tinge. “ I think our hosts are just as aggressive in their thoughts of what they think about the news as they have ever been,” says Kutler. “I am incredibly proud of the lineup we have.”\n\n\tThere is good reason for MS NOW to seek a jolt from the headlines. While the network lures more audience overall than CNN, it lags both CNN and Fox News Channel among the viewers advertisers want most in news programming, people between 25 and 54. In the third quarter of 2025, MS NOW’s viewership among that demographic was down 59% across the programming day, while CNN’s fell 45% and Fox News’ slipped 26%.\n\t\n\n\tCNN has already begun to play up its daily newsgathering. The Warner Bros. Discovery outlet recently launched a new “All Access” subscription streaming service that burnishes feet-on-the-ground reportage from around the world. MS NOW, which aims to give its viewers news of the world along with opinion, will need to compete.\n\n\tBesides, MS NOW is one of the biggest assets in the portfolio of its new corporate parent, Versant, which is being spun off from Comcast and NBC over the next several weeks. The new company faces ongoing declines in its main lines of revenue, according to a recent research note from Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson.\n\n\t Affiliate fees tied to Versant’s networks fell 6.6% in 2024, according to research from the analyst, while ad revenue slipped 7.2%. MS NOW is projected to see ad sales fall by 11% in 2025, to $653.9 million, according to Kagan, a market-research unit of S&P Global Intelligence.\n\n\tBut an uptick is forecast for MS NOW in 2026, when the network will gear up for a long run to pivotal national midterm elections. There are already signs viewers have new interest. On Election Night, with Democrats winning pivotal seats in an off-year election cycle. MSNBC’s coverage drew an audience nearly on par with that of Fox News Channel, which typically dominates the cable-news audience.\n\n\tThe newly convened newsgathering staff aims to get inside the Beltway and out, with Sudeep Reddy, the network’s new Washington Bureau chief, organizing teams devoted to the White House, Congress, national security, legal affairs and more. Meanwhile, other parts of the team want to dig in to scenes across the nation to demonstrate the effects of national policy. During the government shutdown, some reporters were sent to talk to people on line at food pantries,  showing what the end of SNAP benefits meant to citizens who depend on them  “We are taking all of these things that are being decided in Washington, and we’re showing the real world impact,” says Erin Zimmerman, vice president of newsgathering ”And it’s not just our linear viewer, but it’s our digital viewers. We’re doing a lot of digital packages, a lot of TikTok’s, trying to cover the whole realm.”\n\n\tThey are doing it all without much time for idle thought. The bulk of the team has been assembled over the last several months, with many coming over from NBC News. And while MS-Old and MS-New are naturally driven by the news cycle, more headlines in days to come will be generated by a team that continues to coalesce. No pressure, folks!\n",

    "body": "\n\tESPN, ABC and other Disney TV networks are coming back to YouTube TV. \n\n\tGoogle and Disney finally ended their standoff, announcing a multiyear agreement Friday on pricing and terms for a renewed carriage deal for YouTube TV. Disney’s nets went dark on the internet TV service just before midnight ET on Thursday, Oct. 30, after the two sides remained far apart on a deal before the expiration of the previous contract.\n\n\n\tUnder the new agreement, ESPN’s full lineup of sports — including content from ESPN Unlimited — will be made available on YouTube TV to base-plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026. In addition, access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited will be available inside YouTube TV.\n\t\n\n\tThe deal also lets YouTube include the Disney+ and Hulu bundle as part of “select YouTube offerings.” According to Disney, “select networks” will be included in various genre-specific packages that YouTube TV expects to launch in the future. \n\n\t“This new agreement reflects our continued commitment to delivering exceptional entertainment and evolving with how audiences choose to watch,’’ Disney Entertainment co-chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in a joint statement. “It recognizes the tremendous value of Disney’s programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice. We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football.”\n\n\tIn a statement, a YouTube spokesperson said Friday, “We’re happy to share that we’ve reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers. Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we negotiated on their behalf. ”\n\t\n\n\tThe deal supersedes their prior distribution agreement, inked in December 2021 after a two-day blackout.\n\n\tOn Sunday (Nov. 9) YouTube began issuing one-time $20 credits to YouTube TV customers for the loss of Disney’s programming, in the hopes it would help stave off user cancelations.\n\n\tMany YouTube TV subscribers dropped the service in frustration. According to a survey fielded last week, 24% of YouTube TV users said they had canceled or intended to cancel their accounts over the Disney blackout. A YouTube rep said that “while subscriber churn is always regrettable, it’s been manageable and does not align with the findings of this survey.” Disney took a hit, too, losing more than $4 million per day during the blackout, according to an estimate by Morgan Stanley analysts.\n\n\tGoogle had said Disney was asking for an unprecedented fee increase for the full suite of ESPN channels, ABC local stations, FX, Disney Channel, Freeform, Nat Geo and more — while Disney claimed the tech giant was “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.” According to Google, Disney was trying to “reset” the market pricing for its programming (so it could charge similarly higher rates in upcoming renewals with other pay-TV distributors) and that Disney was insisting YouTube TV take the Mouse House’s full lineup of networks. The negotiating teams were led by Disney Platform Distribution EVP Sean Breen and YouTube chief business officer Mary Ellen Coe.\n\n\tThe removal of Disney’s networks from YouTube TV came a day before a busy Nov. 1 Saturday slate for college football as major marquee teams face pivotal contests, many of them aired on ESPN and ABC. In light of the blackout, ESPN made its “College GameDay” football pregame show available free to watch via a livestream on X. YouTube TV customers also missed two airings of “Monday Night Football” on ABC and ESPN. (YouTube pointed out to users they could catch all of ESPN’s programming on the ESPN Unlimited subscription service.)\n\n\tAlong with Disney’s live channels, YouTube TV customers’ DVR recordings of the media conglomerate’s programming were removed, as is standard in such disputes. With the deal renewal, YouTube TV subscribers will regain access to recordings that were previously in their library, according to YouTube.\n\t\n\n\tOn Thursday, Disney CEO Bob Iger told analysts that the company had been “working tirelessly to close this deal” but said, “It’s also imperative that we make sure that we agree to a deal that reflects the value that we deliver, which both YouTube, by the way, and Alphabet, have told us, is greater than the value of any other provider.”\n\n\tDisney Entertainment’s Walden and Bergman and ESPN’s Pitaro had previously addressed the impasse in several memos to staffers. “YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us,” the execs wrote in an Oct. 31 email. “Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.”\n\n\tMeanwhile, ahead of this year’s Election Night (Nov. 4), Disney asked Google to restore ABC on YouTube TV for one day to serve the “public interest.” Google declined — and instead suggested that Disney allow YouTube TV to make ABC and ESPN available while the two sides continued talks because those are “the channels that people want.” Disney didn’t go for the idea.\n\n\tThe Disney-Google clash became public Oct. 23, when Disney began alerting viewers that its networks could be removed from YouTube TV.\n\n\tDisney has faced other tough negotiations with distributors amid the transition to ESPN Unlimited — the standalone streaming service launched in August that includes everything on the sports programmer’s lineup — and its continued investment in Disney+ and Hulu.\n\n\tIn 2023, Disney’s networks had a 10-day blackout on Charter Communications cable systems in a similar fight over price. To settle the Charter deal, Disney allowed Charter’s high-tier TV subscribers to access Disney+ and the ESPN+ streaming app. In 2024, ESPN and other Disney nets went dark on DirecTV for nearly two weeks before they reached a new deal. In October, Disney and Comcast quietly reached a carriage renewal deal.\n\n\tGoogle has encountered no small amount of friction in deal-renewal talks this year for YouTube TV. Other programmers that have fought with the internet company include Paramount Global (now Paramount Skydance), Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal — each of which reached a new deal without a blackout. At the end of September, YouTube TV dropped Univision, with Google alleging the price increases sought by parent company TelevisaUnivision were drastically out of line with viewership on the platform.\n\t\n\n\tYouTube TV is the biggest internet-TV service in the U.S., estimated to have more than 10 million subscribers. Next is Disney, which last week closed a deal to merge its Hulu + Live TV business with Fubo; together, those have almost 6 million subs in North America. Google had asserted Disney’s hardball tactics over a YouTube TV deal was “benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.”\n",

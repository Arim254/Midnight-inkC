    "body": "\n\tIndian filmmaker Kanu Behl is developing “Loving Anais,” a star-crossed romance set between India and France, as his follow-up to Cannes Directors’ Fortnight title “Agra,” which opens theatrically in India.\n\n\t“It’s kind of like star-crossed romance mixed in with noir,” Behl tells Variety. “It’s essentially about an Indian guy who goes looking for someone from Gurgaon to Bordeaux, and in his search for that someone, life takes a different turn, and he falls in love with someone else, but they don’t speak each other’s language.”\n\t\n\n\tThe project, currently heading toward first draft, has secured CNC Development Fund support. William Jehannin (“Agra”) is producing.\n\n\n\tBehl’s sexually charged drama “Agra” will receive a limited theatrical release in India via distributor Mantra Luminosity, marking a significant milestone for the director who has long hoped to reach local audiences.\n\n\tThe film follows Guru, a young single call center employee who still lives with his parents. Consumed by frustration, he plunges into a fever bordering on insanity, between pathetic fantasies, dating apps and hysterical self-harm. The film also explores the role property can play in a young man’s emancipation.\n\n\tDebutant Mohit Agarwal stars as Guru, with Priyanka Bose, Ruhani Sharma, Vibha Chibber, Sonal Jha and Aanchal Goswami in pivotal roles. Rahul Roy, known for his romantic lead roles in 1990s films including blockbuster “Aashiqui,” plays Guru’s father.\n\n\t“Making a film for independent filmmakers is not really about going to a festival,” Behl, whose debut feature “Titli” bowed at Cannes’ Un Certain Regard strand, says. “We wanted our own Indian audiences to see the film. Finally, my happiest moment is, however small the release is, however limited the marketing is, it’s out there in the world for an Indian audience to see, because really it’s an Indian story.”\n\t\n\n\tThe film will launch with a platform release strategy across 100 screens and approximately 150 shows, with plans to expand in subsequent weeks based on audience response.\n\n\tBehl expresses frustration with the infantilization of Indian audiences by mainstream cinema. “Ninety-five to 96% of the stuff we see on Indian screens… is just Disneyfied, third class, fourth class, third grader, fourth grader, kids friendly content,” he says. “I have a deep faith that people want to see more complex content. They are actually now more starved than ever before.”\n\n\tFor “Agra,” Behl is aiming to reach beyond converted arthouse audiences. “Our whole attempt with ‘Agra’ has been to try a more organic, ground up approach, rather than a top down approach,” he explains. “Even if it’s slightly inauthentic to the film, to broad base, because you’re fighting competition that is grabbing eyeballs at a different rate.”\n\n\t“What I’m trying with ‘Agra,’ knowing the kind of film it is, is to even lose authenticity, maybe to 5 or 10% but try to fight the bigger monster in a slightly more guerrilla and different way,” he adds.\n\n\tThe film explores themes of sexual repression, desire and transactionality in contemporary India. “It’s a film that functions in the margins between sexuality, sexual repression, the idea of spaces, how sexuality affects the spaces that we live in, and how the spaces in turn affect our sexual lives,” Behl says.\n\n\tHe believes audiences who give the film a chance will find it resonates deeply. “The people that are inhabiting the film are pretty much a mirror to who we are now,” he says. “I think for people who might not conventionally be interested in a film like this, it’s an opportunity to feel again and to reach that point that we used to know, that state of slightly enhanced existence.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\t“Agra” releases in cinemas across India Nov. 14. \n",

    "body": "\n\tAs Millennials hit the age where classic rock channels now include their music, it’s no surprise that acts are striking while the nostalgia iron is hot. And what better way to recall your youth than through emo music, the genre best-equipped for obsessing about love and death and hope and all of life’s big questions?\n\n\t2025 has been a big year for emo milestones — My Chemical Romance headlined a stadium tour! Rilo Kiley reunited! The Academy Is… announced a 20th anniversary “Almost Here” tour! — but it hasn’t yielded much new music from the genre’s A-list.\n\t\n\n\tLuckily, there’s a new generation of pop punkers who were heavily influenced by the bands of yesteryear, and among the best is Michigan-based Hot Mulligan, whose ambitious fourth album “The Sound a Body Makes When It’s Still” dropped in August. Filled with tight riffs, sharp songwriting and lead singer Tades Sanville’s unique screams, it’s the kind of album that could sound more dazzling in a studio compared to a live setting. But unlike so many of their forebears who abandoned chops in order to focus on energy, Hot Mulligan amped things up while sounding great during their Nov. 8 headlining show at the Fillmore Philadelphia.\n\n\n\tThe band charged through the first side of “Sound a Body Makes” to start the set, with drummer Brandon Blakeley and bassist Jonah Kramer creating a twisty, moving foundation to anchor even the fastest pop-punk moments. The interplay of rhythm guitarist Chris Freeman and lead Ryan Malicsi was impressive, with fast riffing and tapping that evoked midwest emo heroes like American Football. Additionally, Sanville and Freeman’s co-mingling vocals were, depending on the moment, complementary in their harmony or shredded in their screaming, without screeching into off-key territory. It’s an impressive feat to see the band’s complex elements all lock in together, especially when many genre legends were eager to step aside and let the audience sing the high notes live.\n\t\n\n\tDespite the band’s focus on craft, they were also there to have a good time and pass those vibes onto the audience. Sanville’s lengthy hair was flying as he stalked the stage, occasionally stopping to scream wildly, his body contorting as if struck by lightning. New album highlights “And a Big Load,” a breakneck dance party about the challenges of sobriety, and “Monica Lewinskibidi,” a hooky yet mournful tribute to missing a sick loved one on tour, were as sharp and blistering as anything in the band’s early work.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the hugely energetic crowd was constantly crowdsurfing and smushing against the front rail. Electricity ran through the fans, with circle pits opening during older favorites like “Shhhh! Golf Is On,” “Equip Sunglasses” and “BCKYRD.”\n\n\tUltimately, for elder Millennial emo fans whose necks get tired from headbanging and feet get sore after standing (let alone moshing!) for a 90-minute set, it’s heartening to know bands like Hot Mulligan inspire the next generation of punks to get sweaty and crazy in the GA section.\n\n\t(Pictured above: Hot Mulligan on the Nov. 7 Brooklyn stop of their tour.)\n",

    "description": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Tuesday, Nov. 11 episode of “Dancing With the Stars.”\n\n\tIt’s official: “Dancing With the Stars",
    "body": "\n\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers from the Tuesday, Nov. 11 episode of “Dancing With the Stars.”\n\n\tIt’s official: “Dancing With the Stars” is in its 20s. Tuesday’s episode of Season 34 celebrated the anniversary of the reality competition series with returning favorites — from longtime host Tom Bergeron joining as guest judge to both original pros and past winners taking on the ballroom floor for the first time in years. Plus, the episode received the most votes of all time. \n\n\tThe show opened with a routine, choreographed by Derek Hough and set to a reimagined live version of the “Dancing with the Stars Theme.” Six original professional dancers from Season 1 joined the troupe: Alec Mazo, Ashly DelGrosso, Louis van Amstel, Jonathan Roberts, Charlotte Jorgensen and Edyta Śliwińska.\n\n\tThe show also honored performers lost with an emotional number choreographed and performed by Ezra Sosa and Rylee Arnold, set to “Always Remember Us This Way” by Lady Gaga.\n\n\tAmidst it all, the competition continued with two rounds. First, the couples danced a new style to a song inspired by a past iconic freestyle routine. Robert Irwin and Witney Carson earned the first perfect 40 of the season with a routine dedicated to his late father. Ahead of his routine, his video package revealed that Prince William FaceTimed him during rehearsal. At the end of his routine, a video played of him as a little boy with his father, causing him to fall to his knees and begin to cry.\n\n\tDylan Efron and Daniella Karagach blew the judges away with his Argentine Tango; Carrie Ann Inaba mentioned that Giles Marini (who was in the audience) used to hold trophy for her favorite Argentine tango routine — but now that title goes to Dylan. He landed the second perfect score.\n\n\tAlix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy also impressed the judges with a perfect 40, as did Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas.\n\n\tThe second round marked the return of the Relay Dance competition — with a twist. This time, instead of dancing with their professional dance partner, each celeb was partnered with a former mirrorball winner. For the challenge, one couple performed one half of a song and a different couple completed the second — the judges then chose the winner of the relay, which meant three teams received two bonus points each.\n\n\tJordan Chiles and Apolo Anton Ohno kicked off the relay, dancing against quickstep against Elaine Hendrix and Rashad Jennings. Jordan and Apolo won the round.\n\n\tAndy Richter and Kaitlyn Bristowe danced the viennese waltz against Dylan and Rumer Willis — and Andy brought out the “sex appeal,” as Carrie Ann put it. Ultimately, Dylan won the extra points. \n\n\tLastly, Robert and Xochitl Gomez danced the jive against Alix and Joey Graziadei. Although Xochitl never had done a jive before and both teams had some hard falls in rehearsals, you’d never know from the performances. Val had trained both women, so it wasn’t a surprise that both dances were so strong. The judges gave the extra points to Robert. \n\n\tIn the end, Dylan, Robert and Whitney tied at the top of the leaderboard, with Andy at the bottom. After combining the judges’ scores with the audience votes, Andy was sent home. \n\n\tScroll down for all of the scores from the night.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAlix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Foxtrot to “Singin’ in the Rain” by Matthew MorrisonScore: 40/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tRobert Irwin and Witney Carson\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Foxtrot to “Footprints in the Sand” by Leona LewisScore: 40/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWhitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Argentine Tango to “Cell Block Tango” from “Chicago The Musical”Score: 40/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tDylan Efron and Daniella Karagach\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Argentine Tango to “Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill WithersScore: 40/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAndy Richter and Emma Slater\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Quickstep to “Puttin’ on the Ritz” by Robbie WilliamsScore: 29/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tElaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Salsa to “It Takes Two” by Rob Base & DJ EZ RockScore: 36/40\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tJordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Disney\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tDance: Cha Cha to “Get Up” by Ciara featuring ChamillionaireScore: 37/40\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSINNERS, Li Jun Li, 2025. © Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Cinematography Commentary (Updated Nov. 11, 2025): The men and women behind the lens are showing this will be one of the most competitive races at the Oscars ceremony.\n\n\tFor the first time in Oscars history, the best cinematography category will utilize a shortlist. The Cinematographers Branch will announce between 10 and 20 titles for consideration. Voting for all shortlist categories — which now include casting, sound, visual effects, makeup and hairstyling, documentary feature, international feature, and all three shorts — will run from Dec. 8–12. \n\n\tLeading the pack — and the conversation — is Autumn Durald Arkapaw, whose luminous work on “Sinners” bathes every frame in unease and tragic beauty. Set in the 1930s, the film’s glow evokes a timeless sense of dread and longing. Known for her dazzling compositions in “Teen Spirit” and her Emmy-nominated work on TV’s “Loki,” Arkapaw may be on the verge of making history. Only three women have ever been nominated in this category: Rachel Morrison (“Mudbound”), Ari Wegner (“The Power of the Dog”), and Mandy Walker (“Elvis”). Skeptics often wonder whether we’ll ever see a woman win best cinematography in our lifetime. After watching “Sinners,” I’m inclined to believe the answer might finally be yes.\n\n\tSeveral overdue names are hoping to gain traction this season.\n\n\tDan Laustsen’s lush, gothic camera work in Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” continues to build momentum. Having earned previous nominations for Del Toro’s “The Shape of Water” (2017) and “Nightmare Alley” (2021), Laustsen remains a clear contender, and overdue for some Oscar love.\n\n\tAnother strong bet is Polish master Łukasz Żal, whose collaboration with Chloé Zhao on the emotionally moving “Hamnet” delivers some of the year’s most striking imagery. A two-time nominee for black-and-white gems “Ida” (2014) and “Cold War” (2018), Żal’s embrace of color here — and his ability to hold a moment, asking the audience to sit with it — adds layers of depth to an already devastating story.\n\n\tThis season is sure to welcome a few exciting newcomers.\n\n\tAdolpho Veloso’s camera work in Clint Bentley’s “Train Dreams” channels the quiet majesty of Terrence Malick and Bruno Delbonnel, pairing natural light with meditative pacing. Then there’s Michael Bauman, a rising name in the field. While he’s served as a longtime collaborator with Paul Thomas Anderson previously, including on “Licorice Pizza” (2021), Bauman is now stepping into the spotlight with “One Battle After Another.” He’s primed for his first official bid, especially with the film emerging as a major awards frontrunner.\n\n\tNominations voting will take place from Monday, Jan. 12, through Friday, Jan. 16. Final nominees will be revealed Thursday, Jan. 22. Final voting begins Wednesday, Feb. 26, and closes on Wednesday, March 5.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited artisans are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: A24\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Filmes da Ermida, Cannes Film Festival\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Artisans (Cinematography)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Neon\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOrwell: 2+2 = 5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Neon\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOscars Best Documentary Feature Commentary (Updated Nov. 11, 2025): As the documentary race comes into sharper focus with DOC NYC ahead, and the Critics Choice Documentary Awards just announced, it’s clear this year’s lineup is as politically charged and emotionally resonant as ever.\n\n\tAt the top of the field, Geeta Gandbhir’s “The Perfect Neighbor” has established itself as the early frontrunner. Fresh off its CCA triumph — where it claimed best documentary feature, director, editing, archival documentary and best true crime documentary — the Netflix release has cemented its status as both a critical and popular favorite. Gandbhir’s gripping exploration of “stand your ground” laws through police bodycam footage has positioned the film as the kind of urgent, socially conscious storytelling that the branch tends to reward.\n\n\tNot far behind is Laura Poitras’ “Cover-Up,” another Netflix acquisition, and a cerebral and fiercely investigative work examining journalist Seymour Hersh’s lifelong pursuit of truth. Poitras, an Oscar winner for “Citizenfour,” is no stranger to the Academy, and this latest effort could easily return her to the winner’s circle.\n\n\tPBS is in strong contention with Mstyslav Chernov’s “2000 Meters to Andriivka,” a harrowing follow-up to his Oscar-winning “20 Days in Mariupol.” The film’s inclusion in DOC NYC’s Short List section, where 13 of the last 14 Oscar winners have appeared, only strengthens its case.\n\n\tHBO’s “The Alabama Solution,” from Andrew Jarecki, brings another socially conscious angle, examining systemic failures in the American justice system. A CCA winner for best political documentary, helps bolsters its campaign as one of the year’s most urgent entries.\n\n\tApple is betting big on “Come See Me in the Good Light,” a tender and deeply human portrait from director Ryan White and producer Tig Notaro chronicling the love and resilience of two poets facing terminal illness. It continues to build quiet but meaningful momentum after positive receptions that began at Sundance.\n\n\tWatch out for Neon’s “Orwell: 2+2=5,” directed by Raoul Peck and co-produced by Alex Gibney. The philosophical essay film — which won CCA honors for best score and narration — merges historical insight with contemporary urgency, drawing parallels between Orwell’s warnings and today’s modern political doublespeak.\n\n\tAs DOC NYC kicks off its 16th edition, the race for best documentary feature feels a bit wide open. With heavyweights from Netflix, PBS, HBO and Neon all in play, the question may not be which film wins — but which kind of film, Academy voters will choose to honor this year.\n\n\tNOTE: All titles, release dates, studios and listed and credited producers are subject to change.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Apple TV/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy of Independent Lens\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Brian Hamill \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tEligible Films (Documentary Feature)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Bayerische Staatsbibliothek/Bildarchiv\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tSales veteran Pia Patatian has used this year’s American Film Market to launch production and sales banner Noora Films.\n\n\tAlongside unveiling her new company, Patatian has come onboard to handle international rights on alternative period drama “Madfabulous” from BAFTA Cymru winner Celyn Jones (“The Almond and the Seahorse”). Jones directs from the debut feature script by Welsh writer Lisa Baker.\n\n\n\tInspired by the life of the fifth Marquess of Anglesey, “Madfabulous” stars Callum Scott Howells (“It’s A Sin,” “The Beautiful Game”), Ruby Stokes (“Lockwood & Co,” “Rocks”), and Rupert Everett (“Napoleon,” “The Serpent Queen”).\n\t\n\n\t“Madfabulous is a fun, yet inspiring ensemble cast film with a meaningful message,” said Patatian. “Along with our superb partners at Mad as Birds Films and the director Celyn Jones, we look forward to introducing this incredible film to international distributors at AFM. They will love it,” said Patatian, who serves as Noora CEO.\n\n\tFrom Jones’ Mad as Birds production company, the film is produced by Nadia Jaynes (“Marcella,” “The Responder”) and Sean Marley (“Poms,” “Six Minutes to Midnight”). Nicola Pearcey (“Military Wives,” “The Almond and the Seahorse”) executive produces for Picnik Entertainment, alongside Paul Baker. Jay Cohen at Gersh will handle U.S. rights.\n\n\t“With its humour, heart, and sense of irreverence, Madfabulous is a rare gem,” said Cohen. “It’s a film brimming with personality and anchored by exceptional performances. We’re proud to bring it to U.S. buyers.”\n\t\n\n\tPatatian was recently president of Cloud 9 Studios (formerly Concord Studios), which she launched last year, and led sales on titles including Paul Schrader’s Cannes competition title “Oh, Canada,” Renny Harlin’s “Deep Water” and the romantic comedy “Under the Stars” starring Toni Collette and Andy Garcia, which she also produced. Prior to that, she served as senior vice president of sales for Capstone Pictures, running the company’s operations in London, and previously served as director, international sales at Blue Box International (a label of Red Granite International). She began her career at Universal Pictures in Madrid, where she worked on “Mamma Mia” and “Inglorious Basterds.”\n\n\tNoora Films, which has offices in Europe and the U.S., aims to develop, produce and finance content for film and TV.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Alien: Earth” has been renewed for Season 2 at FX, Variety has learned. In addition, series creator Noah Hawley has signed a new overall deal with FX and Disney Entertainment Television. \n\n\tAccording to an individual with knowledge of the situation, Hawley’s overall deal is valued in the nine figure range. Production on Season 2 of “Alien: Earth” will begin in London in 2026, whereas the first season was shot in Thailand. \n\n\n\t“It has been our great privilege to work with Noah for more than a decade on some of FX’s best and biggest shows, and we are thrilled to extend our partnership well into the future,” said John Landgraf, chairman of FX. “Noah never stops surprising us with truly original stories— and his unique ability to bring them to vibrant life as a director and producer as well as writer makes him extraordinary. We can’t wait to get to work on the next season of ‘Alien: Earth,’ as well as some equally exciting future projects in advanced development.”\n\t\n\n\t“Alien: Earth” serves as the TV extension of the “Alien” film franchise. It debuted on FX back in August to strong reviews from critics and audiences alike. The cast includes Sydney Chandler, Alex Lawther, Timothy Olyphant, Essie Davis, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay, David Rysdahl, Adrian Edmondson, Adarsh Gourav, Jonathan Ajayi, Erana James, Lily Newmark, Diem Camille, and Moe Bar-El. \n\n\tThe official logline for the first season states, “When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat. \n\t\n\n\t“I’m thrilled that this expanded deal opens the door to new opportunities across all of Disney Entertainment Television,” said Hawley. “FX has always supported bold, character-driven storytelling. From the very beginning with Fargo, they’ve encouraged me to take creative risks and follow the story wherever it leads. I’m grateful to continue exploring the world of ‘Alien: Earth’ alongside our partners, cast, and crew as we begin the next chapter.”\n\n\tHawley is the creator and executive producer “Alien: Earth.” Ridley Scott, David W. Zucker, Clayton Krueger, Emilia Serrano, Bob DeLaurentis, Peter Calloway, Monica Macer, John Campisi and Simon Emanuel also serve as executive producers. The series is produced by FX Productions.\n\n\t“I learned first-hand that Noah was a unique talent while we worked on ‘Fargo’ at FX,” said Eric Schrier, president of Disney Television Studios & Global Original Television Strategy. “He has gone on to make many of the best shows in television, and I couldn’t be more excited that Noah will continue his FX partnership and broaden it across Disney Entertainment Television.”\n\n\tHawley first came to FX with the anthology series “Fargo” in 2014. Five seasons of that series have aired to date, with the show collectively winning seven Emmy Awards out of 70 nominations, as well as three Golden Globes out of 14 nominations. Hawley also created the FX-Marvel series “Legion,” which aired for three seasons at the network. \n\n\tHawley is repped by WME, Untitled Entertainment, Sunshine Sachs Morgan & Lylis, and McKuin Frankel Whitehead.\n",

    "description": "\n\tEddie Murphy recently joined Entertainment Weekly to promote his Netflix documentary “Being Eddie” and looked back to when he presented best picture",
    "body": "\n\tEddie Murphy recently joined Entertainment Weekly to promote his Netflix documentary “Being Eddie” and looked back to when he presented best picture to Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Last Emperor.” Murphy deliberately used his time at the Oscars podium to call out the Academy for failing to recognize Black actors over the years. He thought the bit would generate headlines in the Hollywood press, but Murphy says in the doc that he was surprised to discover there were barely any the next day.\n\t\n\n\t“I remember being with Robin Williams backstage,” Murphy recalled to EW about that Oscars night. “I was like, ‘I’m gonna say this.’ And he goes to me, like, ‘But why go there?’ I was like, ‘Oh, you don’t think it’s funny?’ It was more, ‘Is it funny?’ Rather than, ‘It’s controversial.’ I was trying to be funny and say a little something, but be funny too. Have a little edge to what I said.”\n\n\n\tIn his introduction to announcing the best picture nominees, Murphy recounted how his manager told him the Academy was inviting him to present at the Oscars and that he originally wanted to decline.\n\n\t“I’m not going because they haven’t recognized Black people in motion pictures,” Murphy told the Oscars audience. “And I’ll probably never win an Oscar for saying this, but hey, what the hey, I gotta say it. Actually, I might not be in any trouble because the way it’s been going is about every 20 years we get one, so we ain’t due to about 2004. So by that time, this will all be blown over.” \n\n\tAt the time, only three acting winners in the Oscars’ 60-year history were Black performers (Hattie McDaniel, Sidney Poitier and Louis Gossett Jr.). Denzel Washington would join the group two years later by winning best supporting actor for “Glory.”\n\t\n\n\t“So I came down here to give the award. I said, ‘But I just feel that we have to be recognized as a people. I just want you to know I’m gonna give this award, but Black people will not ride the caboose of society, and we will not bring up the rear anymore. And I want you to recognize us,” Murphy’s speech concluded.\n\n\tMurphy told EW that he “wasn’t thinking of the ramifications” of calling out the Oscars’ lack of diversity among its winners when he gave the speech, adding: “I was just trying to be funny in the moment and I wanted what I was saying to be relevant.”\n\n\tThe comedian was right about one thing, though. He has yet to win an Oscar despite being a frontrunner for the best supporting actor prize in 2007 for “Dreamgirls.” Alan Arkin ended up winning in a surprise victory for “Little Miss Sunshine” after Murphy took home prizes from the Golden Globes and Screen Actors’ Guild Awards. Some have speculated that “Norbit,” Murphy’s disastrously-reviewed comedy that opened just a week after he received his Oscar nomination. Murphy has defended “Norbit” in various interview of the years.\n\n\t“I love ‘Norbit,’” Murphy said earlier this year on Complex’s “360 With Speedy Morman” series. “‘Norbit’ came out right after I got that Oscar nomination. There were articles like, ‘How can he get an Oscar, he did this?’ They’re two different movies. I wrote ‘Norbit’ with my brother, Charlie [Murphy], and we think ‘Norbit’ is funny. Here’s the thing with ‘Norbit,’ it came out and they gave me a Razzie Awards for worst actress, worst actor and worst actor of the decade. And I was like, ‘Come on now, shit ain’t that bad.’”\n\n\t“Being Eddie” premieres on Netflix on Nov. 12.\n\n\n\n",

Few films in recent memory have generated this kind of sustained affection from festivalgoers across continents.\n\n\tBut the bigger question is what that affection means for Oscar season. “Hamnet” looks destined for an awards-season tug-of-war with Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” which also shows no signs of slowing. Beyond those two juggernauts, only a handful of other contenders — like Ryan Coogler’s gothic horror film “Sinners” and perhaps Josh Safdie’s high-octane sports film “Marty Supreme” — could spark passion among industry voters. \n\n\tElsewhere, Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Hikari’s “Rental Family” have each picked up their share of regional honors. “Frankenstein” claimed the top prize at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival, while “Rental Family” tied with “Hamnet” at Middleburg and earned runner-up status at SCAD.\n\n\tLet’s see where it all ultimately settles. \n\n\tThis week’s updates are below, and the first official charts for international feature, documentary feature and cinematography have been released.\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (films): “One Battle After Another” (14); “Sinners” (13); “Hamnet” (12); “Wicked: For Good” (10); “Sentimental Value” (7)\n\n\tTop 5 projected Oscar nomination leaders (studios): Warner Bros.

    "body": "\n\tEmmylou Harris and Buddy Miller seem like birds of an eternal feather, having played together frequently over the decades, but there is a first time for everything. And for these two, that first time was the tour Harris did with Miller supporting her on guitar that is commemorated on a live album, “Spyboy,” that is being reissued with substantial bonus material this weekend. Variety has the exclusive streaming premiere of the newly expanded album (check it out via the playlist below).\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tHarris and Miller sat down together in Nashville and hooked up with Variety via Zoom to discuss what makes the “Spyboy” live album an essential adjunct to the studio album that came right before it, “Wrecking Ball,” which many fans consider Harris’ best. That latter album was about as dramatic a turning point as any artist has experienced mid-career, made with a serious sonic assist from producer Daniel Lanois. He helped form the band that Harris took out on the road to support “Wrecking Ball” — with quite a different sound than the bluegrass-oriented Nash Ramblers she’d just been on the road with — and when he was only able to play a short time with them, someone with serious chops and an even more serious sensibility was needed to step in. That ended up being Miller, now a legend in his own right but a bit more of an unknown quantity at the time. As “Spyboy” proves, it was a musical marriage made in the heavens.\n\n\n\tIf you want to sensibly own a copy of “Spyboy” and not just stream it, find the links to order it through New West Records here or via Bandcamp here. The 2025 edition includes five bonus tracks — covers of Tom Petty’s “Thing About You,” Bob Dylan’s “Every Grain of Sand,” Bill Monroe’s “Get Up John” and Lucinda Williams’ “Sweet Old World,” as well as the Harris/Kate & Anna McGarrigle co-write “All I Left Behind” — and also features updated artwork plus new liner notes written by Harris and Miller. Meanwhile, here are highlights from our conversation.\n\t\n\n\tWho was it that was championing the idea that the “Spyboy” album needed some 21st century love, and that there needed to be a proper reissue? Was it the two of you, or the record company, or…?\n\n\tHarris: We realized we don’t know. However, Buddy was transferring some tapes, and because there was more that we could have put on the original “Spyboy,” Buddy sent me the extra tracks. I was just blown away. I mean, there was a track that we didn’t even remember, that we probably just did one night — a Tom Petty song called “Thing About You.” We must have just thrown it out one night on a lark. Yo have that was like this gift from the universe, this great version of this Tom Petty song where Buddy takes the lead, sets it up and becomes this great kind of conduit between the two of us.\n\n\tSo it was the idea of having extra tracks that had never been heard, combined with the fact that I always hoped that “Spyboy” would get a second chance. I was really proud of that record, that band and that period of time in the music we made. And then New West came along, who would put it out, so I guess it was the stars coming together at just the right time before this for it to happen.\n\n\tBuddy, had you thought much about the album in the intervening years or wanted people to have a chance to hear it again?\n\n\tMiller: Well, I hadn’t thought about the album, but I loved the band so much. That’s why I wanted to record it while I was in it. I recorded it on these little DATs, if you know what those were. They came and went very quickly, for good reason, but they arrived just in time to make “Spyboy.” And I just loved the band so much that I wanted to document it as proof, so that when I couldn’t remember anything, I could play it and go, “Yeah, I was in that thing,” because I got to play with Emmylou Harris, which was a big deal for me.\n\n\tWhen you were recording so many shows on the tour, you weren’t necessarily thinking, “Hey, I am recording a live album here,” right?\n\n\tMiller: Oh, no, no, no. I wasn’t thinking about a record or anything like that, and that’s nice. If you’re just recording one show for a live album, you’re thinking about that recording while you’re playing, which isn’t a good thing. I recorded over 20 shows and was just doing it for fun because I loved the band. It was for posterity. Our posterity.\n\t\n\n\tHarris: I think that’s what kind of makes it special in a way.\n\n\tMiller: Getting to play with that voice every night, that was a big deal for me. And it was my first real gig…\n\n\tFirst real gig? You were already accomplished by that time, at least in inner circles…\n\n\tMiller: By “real,” I guess, I mean bus gig — we actually were on a bus instead of a van! You know you reached new heights as a professional musician when you actually get on that bus. First gig with the toilet on the road. And I couldn’t have had a better gig. It’s still my best. The best gig I’ve had.\n\n\tHarris: He was always on time to get on a bus. We never had to wait for him.\n\n\tAnd no memory of doing the Petty song that is now on the album?\n\n\tMiller: It was so strange when I was transferring those tapes over; it was such an out-of-body experience, almost. That sounds like me, but what is this? I didn’t recognize anything about it. Emmy sort of encourages musicians to go out on a limb, to a certain extent, and so every night was different, and you don’t want to play the same show. Of course, it’s a different audience every night, but we are the same band every night. And it helps me to just know that there’s something that maybe we haven’t played in a while. A lot of the material was from “Wrecking Ball,” and you encouraged us to go where the music leads. It wasn’t just learning the licks off the record and playing it like that.\n\n\tHarris: Oh no, because every musician is unique. You have a blueprint for a song when you may do it for an album, and live, you follow it up to a point, but I think it’s important to not limit yourself and put a musician in a box, like a guitarist who has a completely different style. I think they should be free to make it their own.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTalk about what it was like having Buddy come in as the guitarist after Daniel Lanois had done a few shows with you to set it up and then had to drop out.\n\n\tHarris: Well, during the recording of “Wrecking Ball,” I knew something different was happening sonically that I was very happy that it was happening. It is true that I had met Buddy. I’d sung on his record and his wife Julie’s records. I’d heard his playing. I thought, “When it comes time to take this on the road, I’m pretty sure that Buddy Miller might be a part of it.” It was Daniel who graciously actually put the first incarnation together with Brady Blade and Darrell Johnson. Brady had not been on the record. His brother, Brian, had been; Darrell had been on the record. So the four of us went out playing, knowing that this was temporary (with Lanois). And so I thought, “Well, let’s plug in Buddy.” And it was never a period of “Oh, he’ll eventually get it.” Buddy was bang-on from the first note. It’s like Spyboy was born fully formed, and a lot of it had to do with the blueprint that Daniel put together.\n\t\n\n\tLet’s talk for a minute about “Wrecking Ball” itself. It’s such a touchstone for musicians; Brandi Carlile has repeatedly referenced it as a partial model for how she wanted to approach her latest album. You must be hyper-aware of how it has become that in the music community.\n\n\tHarris: Well, not at the time. I mean, really, I was just at a crossroads. I had sort of been constantly playing Daniel’s “Oh Mercy,” the Dylan album he produced, and I love Dylan, but he sort of brought me back to Dylan with whatever he did on that record. And then, Daniel’s solo record at the time, too,there was something about the sound. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I knew that country radio had decided I was too old or whatever. My record company just said, “What do you wanna do?” And I said, “Well, I’d like to work with Daniel.” And we had no idea what kind of record we were gonna make. We didn’t sit down and say, “This is going to be life-changing,” or “career-changing.” We just wanted to work together. And it’s always very subjective, isn’t it? For me, it’s always sort of one song at a time, and I just wanted to work with somebody who might inspire me to new heights. You just go into the studio to make a record because that’s what you do with songs that excite you. I suppose I was very excited about what we came up with, and whether or not anybody else was, I had no control over that.\n\n\tBuddy, when you were hearing “Wrecking Ball,” did you have any first impressions, even though you weren’t in the band yet?\n\n\tMiller: At that point, Emmy had come over to my house to sing on my first record on Hightone Records. And on “Wrecking Ball,” they recorded a song of my wife, Julie’s “All My Tears,” on “Wrecking Ball,” and she brought that over to play for me. It was a completely different take on the song, and it sounded otherworldly, and it was nothing like what we were used to. I was completely enthralled and couldn’t wait to hear the whole record. It made total sense to me. I didn’t know you well at that time. You know, I was a fan since the first record, and this was a departure musically, but every step of it, every track, it was so beautiful and musical and framed your voice in just a whole different way, I was drawn in. I loved everything about it. And you know, what I kind of come from, playing-wise, is just basically being a simple country guitar player. But I got it musically and fell in love with it.\n\t\n\n\tWhen it came time to do this tour that we hear on the “Spyboy” album, it was going to naturally mix “Wrecking Ball” songs with catalog material that felt more comparatively traditional. Did you think that it all needed to feel of a piece, live, the way these different eras of music were performed?\n\n\tHarris: You know, I don’t think there was any thought put into it, as I recall… and of course this is a long time ago… Obviously we had older material because we were doing an hour-and-a-half show, so you had to do a lot more than just the songs that were on “Wrecking Ball” when we were out touring. So we did have songs like “Boulder to Birmingham” and “Tulsa Queen” and “Green Pastures” as well as songs that we had done with Dan. And then when Buddy came into the band… Whatever the reason, I think that putting in the older material and giving those songs a different feel …  made “Spyboy” a more interesting record than if it had just been “Wrecking Ball Live.”\n\n\tMiller: I think it feels like a band. At the same time, I had so much respect for and knew all of Emmy’s records, from the first record on, that I felt that a lot of the guitar parts on those records needed to be honored and part of a song, or at least alluded to. I would certainly never tell the (other two) guys what to play, because they’re so creative. But I would just want to respect the songs and those parts that were on the record, or always give a nod to every lead guitar player. Because I’ve worked with James Burton, Albert Lee, Daniel … I mean, I respect their styles, so I want to have that in there when I’m performing live. You can allude to how it was created, how the song was born in the studio, but live, there’s always room for it to go someplace else, you know?\n\n\tSo there would be a partial reinvention of the songs, but with a lot of respect paid for how people knew the songs and how they were played originally, somehow mixed in there.\n\n\tMiller: Right. Although the rhythm section probably never heard those records!\n\n\tHarris: That’s true. Which is interesting, because it added a whole different feel which inspired me as a singer to… I don’t know, not to to sing differently, but it was just exciting every night. I wouldn’t say I tried to bring it back to earth a little bit, but I would be the anchor, with those parts, at least referencing them. And I did want to reference the vocals. I mean, harmonies had always been incredibly important since my first record. Because I kind of came into my own voice as a harmony singer with Gram, and so harmonies were always important, and Buddy’s voice harmony, singing along with Daryl… Daryl Johnson had this extraordinary head voice that was so beautiful, like, straight out of heaven, but strong. He could sing higher than me. He would sing the part above you while playing bass pedals with his feet… With three combinations (voice, hands and feet), he would play while singing this incredibly beautiful high harmony part, completely in tune.\n\t\n\n\tAnd then just thinking overall about the period this represents, I think, in some ways, people think of “Wrecking Ball” as Emmylou Harris 2.0, so maybe following that line of thinking, and then the “Spyboy” album and tour is like “Wrecking Ball 2.0” in its way. But, Emmylou, you’ve said “Wrecking Ball” was something like a rocket booster for you.\n\n\tHarris: Yeah. It gave me another 30 years.\n\n\tIs that how it feels?\n\n\tHarris: Yeah, I mean, I hadn’t thought about it, but when I was doing a Q&A for something and they asked me about “Wrecking Ball” and said, “So what did it give you?” I just thought, another 30 years, really, because I think it it is hard to sustain a career, and you can’t have all high points. Most of the time you have these high points and then you’re sort of treading water, but doing the best you can, you know? So I don’t know where I would’ve been if I hadn’t done “Wrecking Ball,” but I don’t have to think about that because I did.\n\n\tYou’ve said when you were on this tour, you were cognizant that maybe a few people who were fans dropped out with the “Wrecking Ball” album and that you had picked up some newer, younger faces too. So you’ve got people who’ve been with you from the beginning, like Buddy. And then you’ve got some people who maybe hopped on in the mid-‘90s and have stayed for those 30 years. So, yeah, it’s a pretty good accumulation of different kinds of fans to have, probably.\n\n\tHarris: Oh yeah. I mean, you can’t please everybody, so you have to be excited about what you’re doing. I think it was Neil Young who talked about following the muse and, like he said, you’re traveling along making music and then all of a sudden what’s happening in the ditch is much more interesting, so that’s where you go. What you owe your fans, really, is to go where you are to do what you’re excited about. It doesn’t happen all the time. And you’re grateful when you say, “Well, I may never sell another record, but it’s really important that I do this.” So I felt like I had no choice but to do “Wrecking Ball.” Once it got started, I was excited about it, and then eventually it led to my putting on the writing hat and doing a little more writing later on.\n\n\tMiller: And I will say, your audience did change over that first year, year and a half. I mean, it just expanded, and you took everybody with you on that journey. You know, everybody by the end of the night loved everything you were doing. They didn’t know what to think, maybe, when they saw the band on stage at the beginning of the night…\n\t\n\n\tHarris: Early on, this was when Dan was in the band, I think we were playing some kind of royal theater in Glasgow, I can’t remember. And somebody yelled out, “It’s bloody heavy metal!,” and walked out. And there were other times when people said, “It’s too loud, you can’t hear the guitar anyway.” You take those chances. And it worked out, thankfully, you know.\n",

    "body": "\n\tCarol Burnett has been brewin’ something big with the Bruins. The UCLA alum and Hollywood icon has announced two major gifts to the school: An endowment to establish a scholarship at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, as well as a donation of the more than 140 industry awards and honors that Burnett has received over her seven-decade career.\n\n\tAmong those awards are seven Emmys — ranging from outstanding performance in a variety or music program in 1962 (“The Garry Moore Show”) to outstanding variety special—pre-recorded (“Carol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter+Love”) in 2023. She’s also won six Golden Globes, a Grammy, a Tony, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Kennedy Center Honor, multiple Peabody Awards, a Stephen Sondheim Award, a 1976 Creative Circle Award (shaped like a golden typewriter), the SAG Lifetime Achievement Award, the Globes’ first Carol Burnett Lifetime Achievement Award for Television and much more. \n\t\n\n\tAs part of the donation, Burnett also included ephemera such as hand drawings of her in costume from “The Carol Burnett Show,” a still-boxed doll of her in the CBS variety show’s iconic Scarlett O’Hara curtain hanger costume, and other photos and memorabilia. A rotating display of Burnett’s honors will be shown in the lobby of UCLA’s Freud Playhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAlso included (above) is another award that is appropriate to the UCLA donation: A “Spotlight Award” from June 1952, honoring Burnett as “most outstanding newcomer” in the UCLA one-act program during the spring 1952 semester.\n\n\tThe timing of the donation coincides with the announcement Thursday of the Carol Burnett Endowed Undergraduate Scholarship in Music Theater. Under the scholarship, one undergraduate student each year in the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television’s Ray Bolger Musical Theater Program  will receive what’s described as a “substantial award” to help cover the cost of tuition and fees. \n\t\n\n\t“I am so pleased that, with this endowment of the Carol Burnett Scholarship to the UCLA School of Theater, Film & Television, students will be given an opportunity akin to what UCLA gave me when I enrolled fresh out of high school,” Burnett said in a statement. “I found my true passion at UCLA, and in this scholarship lies the hope that it will do the same for many others for many years to come.”\n\n\tThis year’s grantee is first-year theater major Alexa Cruz, a member of the class of 2029. Cruz’s community theater experience includes performing songs connected to past Burnett roles, including “Little Girls” (from “Annie”) and “Shy” (from “Once Upon a Mattress”). Burnett made her Broadway debut as Princess Winnifred the Woebegone in “Once Upon a Mattress,” which landed her a Tony nom in 1960, and starred as Miss Hannigan in the 1982 film version of “Annie.”\n\n\t“As a first-generation college student, this scholarship will help me pursue my dreams of becoming an actress and make my goals feel more attainable,” Cruz said. “This financial assistance will greatly support my educational expenses. I’m truly humbled by this opportunity and excited to continue pursuing my degree at UCLA and my passion for musical theater.”\n\n\tMost recently, Burnett has been seen in “Better Call Saul,” “Hacks” and “Palm Royale,” which was created by another UCLA alum, Abe Sylvia.\n\n\tBurnett and Sylvia will visit UCLA on Thursday to introduce a Season 2 premiere screening of “Palm Royale” in the James Bridges Theater.\n\n\t“Carol Burnett has led one of the most visionary, joyful and prolific careers in the history of multiple entertainment industries,” said UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television dean Celine Parreñas Shimizu. “She created new paths every time something blocked her way. She created new forms within the industry for herself and others to thrive. Her approach to craft is completely aligned with the spirit of what we teach our brilliant students at TFT. Carol Burnett’s voice has always been, and will always be, part of our story as we train upcoming generations to follow her bold and tenacious example.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tTimothée Chalamet opened up in a new Vogue cover story about his disappointment when it comes to losing awards. The 29-year-old has lost two Oscars, four Golden Globes and four BAFTA Awards, although he did take home the SAG Award for best actor in February thanks to his performance as Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” A week later, Adrien Brody (“The Brutalist”) beat him for the Oscar for best actor.\n\n\t“If there’s five people at an awards show, and four people go home losing, you don’t think those four people are at the restaurant like, ‘Damn, we didn’t win?'” Chalamet told Vogue about being disappointed when he lost at the Oscars. “I’ve been around some deeply generous, no-ego actors, and maybe some of them are going, ‘That was fun.’ But I know for a fact a lot of them are going, ‘Fuck!’ ”\n\t\n\n\t“People can call me a try-hard, and they can say whatever the fuck,” Chalamet added. “But I’m the one actually doing it here.”\n\n\tLast year, Chalamet touched on what it’s like to lose at awards shows when he told SiriusXM that it’s “uniquely hilarious” to go home empty handed and then have to rip up the awards speech you wrote before the ceremony. He added: “You think to yourself, ‘You narcissistic arrogant prick. On what planet did you think you were gonna use this?'”\n\n\tWhile Chalamet has always looked up to actors who “keep things tight-lipped” by avoiding the press and remaining enigmas, he has started to become a lot more forthcoming when it comes to publicity. As Vogue recounted: “When he was promoting ‘A Complete Unknown,’ Chalamet sat down with manosphere podcast hosts and met YouTube stars. He attended his own look-alike contest. He has no interest in making prestige films for a vanishing population.” \n\t\n\n\tFor the upcoming “Marty Supreme,” in theaters this Christmas from A24, Chalamet has kicked off the press tour with viral videos featuring men wearing giant ping pong helmets. These mascots even followed Chalamet to a surprise screening of the film in New York City. When he won the SAG Award earlier this year, Chalamet told the room that he is in “pursuit of greatness.” He is not hiding that he cares anymore.\n\n\t“You don’t want to risk being too declarative,” he told Vogue. “But I also don’t want to look back on life and things I’ve put out and go, ‘Oh, little old me. Hey, see the movie if you want. It is what it is.’ No. At worst, you’ve rubbed people the wrong way. And at best, someone will get pulled in and go, ‘Hey, this guy really thinks this thing’s worthy.’ ”\n\n\tChalamet is already earning Oscar buzz for “Marty Supreme,” with Variety calling him a best actor frontrunner. This means his future slate likely includes many of the awards shows he’s become a regular at in recent years. He’s also developing a motocross movie, “High Side,” with his “A Complete Unknown” director James Mangold, plus he’s filming “Dune: Part Three” with Denis Villeneuve. One thing Chalamet is not planning on doing next is TV, despite getting his start as a young actor on Showtime’s “Homeland.” He’s never gone back to television despite many of his A-list peers taking on buzzy limited series. Asked about making another TV show, Chalamet bluntly responded: “No.” \n\n\tHead over to Vogue’s website to read Chalamet’s cover story in its entirety.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe legal drama “Reasonable Doubt” has been renewed for Season 4 at Hulu, Variety has learned. \n\n\tThe Onyx Collective series debuted its third season in September, with the season finale set to premiere on Nov. 13. Emayatzy Corinealdi leads the series along with series regulars McKinley Freeman, Tim Jo, Angela Grovey, and Joseph Sikora. \n\n\tThe official description of Season 3 states: \n\n\n\t“The tumultuous season follows Jax (Corinealdi) fighting to acquit her latest client, former child star Ozzie Edwards (Kyle Bary), who was once loved by millions but is now accused of murder and brings with him a whole entourage of enablers and a mess only Jax can untangle. As America gathers to watch his trial, Jax must contend with an ambitious new colleague, Bill Sterling (Sikora), and coworkers questioning her worth. The more complicated the trial becomes, the more Jax finds herself fighting both in and out of the courtroom and learning that winning can often come with unexpected consequences.” \n\t\n\n\tRaamla Mohamed created “Reasonable Doubt” and serves as executive producer. Kerry Washington and Pilar Savone executive produce via Simpson Street along with Larry Wilmore of Wilmore Films as well as Anton Cropper and Lena Cordina. Shawn Holley, Jon Leshay, Tamara Gregory, Erika Harrison and Zahir McGhee serve as co-executive producers. The series hails from Onyx Collective and is produced by 20th Television. \n\n\t“Reasonable Doubt” was the first scripted show to debut for Onyx Collective and is one of only two current scripted series under the Onyx Collective banner. The other is the comedy “Deli Boys,” which was renewed for a second season in August. Onyx recently made a pilot order for the drama “Southern Bastards,” which is based on the graphic novels of the same name. \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe already tense relations between Condé Nast and the union representing many of its editorial workers hit a new flash point this week.\n\n\tThe media and publishing company said it fired four employees “due to conduct that violated company policies.” In addition, Condé Nast said it filed a complaint Thursday with the National Labor Relations Board against the NewsGuild of New York, the union that reps the employees, for its “repeated and egregious disregard of our collective bargaining agreement.”\n\t\n\n\tThe NewsGuild-affiliated Condé United union blasted the terminations as “illegal” and said the four employees had a right to “demand answers on this week’s abrupt layoffs at multiple brands” including the consolidation of Teen Vogue under the main Vogue site.\n\n\n\tThe flare-up came after Condé Nast on Monday announced that Teen Vogue’s website would be folded into Vogue.com and that Teen Vogue’s top editor, Versha Sharma, would be exiting. Chloe Malle, the recently hired head of editorial content at Vogue U.S., is now overseeing what’s left of the Teen Vogue brand. The company had discontinued the print edition of Teen Vogue in 2017.\n\n\tAccording to the union, late Wednesday night, Condé Nast’s VP of labor relations notified the NewsGuild that the company was “immediately terminating four Condé United members for engaging in the protected concerted activity of gathering in their 1 World Trade Center office to demand answers on this week’s abrupt layoffs at multiple brands including Wired and the consolidation at Teen Vogue.” According to the company, there were no layoffs at Wired this week.\n\t\n\n\tThe union continued, “These egregious terminations are a flagrant breach of the Just Cause terms of our contract and an unprecedented violation of their federally protected rights as union members to participate in a collective action. Through these illegal terminations, Condé Nast management is attempting to intimidate and silence our members’ advocacy for the courageous cultural and political journalism of Teen Vogue, as well as diverting attention away from the obvious lack of corporate leadership at the company.”\n\n\tCondé Nast characterized the sequence of events differently. The company said in a statement, “Extreme misconduct is unacceptable in any professional setting. This includes aggressive, disruptive, and threatening behavior of any kind. We have a responsibility to provide a workplace where every employee feels respected and able to do their job without harassment or intimidation. We also cannot ignore behavior that crosses the line into targeted harassment and disruption of business operations. We remain committed to working constructively with the union and all of our employees.”\n\n\tThe Condé Nast employees, who the union says were illegally fired, are: Alma Avalle, writer and digital producer at Bon Appetit, as well as NewsGuild of New York first vice president, trans activist and union leader; Jake Lahut, Wired senior reporter covering the Trump White House; Jasper Lo, senior fact checker at the New Yorker, as well as a U.S. Army veteran and outgoing first vice chair of the New Yorker Union; and Ben Dewey, videographer at Condé Nast Entertainment and former vice chair of the CNE unit.\n\n\t“Management’s attempt at union-busting, using intimidation and grossly illegal tactics to try to suppress protected union activity, will not stand,” Susan DeCarava, president of the NewsGuild of New York, said in a statement. “The NewsGuild of New York has zero tolerance for bad bosses who harass, target and disrespect our fellow Guild members. We represent nearly 6,000 media workers across the tri-state area and we stand firmly in solidarity, ready to fight for the rights of our members illegally fired from their jobs at Condé.”\n\n\tOn Monday, the NewsGuild of New York and Condé United said they “strongly condemn” Condé Nast’s consolidation plans for Teen Vogue, “a move that is clearly designed to blunt the award-winning magazine’s insightful journalism at a time when it is needed the most.” According to the union, the company laid off six of its members, most of whom are “BIPOC women or trans,” including Teen Vogue politics editor Lex McMenamin.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSarah Paulson is reuniting with Ryan Murphy, this time in “Monster.”\n\n\tVariety has learned from sources that Paulson is nearing a deal to appear in the upcoming fourth season of Murphy and Ian Brennan’s Netflix anthology series, in which she would play notorious serial killer Aileen Wuornos. As previously reported, Season 4 will focus on Lizzie Borden and the axe murder of her father and stepmother. Production is now underway in Los Angeles.\n\t\n\n\tGiven that Wuornos is not the focus of the season, it stands to reason that Season 4 will examine Borden’s impact on the perception of and connection to other female killers, much like how Season 3 explored the impact of Ed Gein’s crimes on popular culture.\n\n\n\tReps for Netflix declined to comment. \n\n\tElla Beatty will star as Lizzie, while Charlie Hunnam — who just played Gein in “Monster” Season 3 — will play her father, Andrew Jackson Borden. In addition, Rebecca Hall will star as Lizzie’s stepmother, Abby, with Billie Lourd as Lizzie’s sister, Emma Borden. Jessica Barden will play the actress Nance O’Neill, who was Lizzie’s friend, and Vicky Krieps will star the Borden family’s maid, Bridget Sullivan.\n\n\tWuornos was convicted of the murder of seven men in Florida, where she was ultimately executed in 2002. She has been the subject of numerous documentaries and books since then, with Charlize Theron winning the Academy Award for best actress for playing Wuornos in the 2003 film “Monster.” Other actresses who have portrayed Wuornos onscreen include Peyton List, Jean Smart, and Lily Rabe. Rabe played Wuornos in the fifth season of “American Horror Story,” another Murphy production.\n\t\n\n\tThis marks the latest collaboration between Paulson and Murphy. Paulson has famously appeared in nearly every season of “American Horror Story,” for which she has received five Emmy nominations. It was announced just last week that Paulson will return to the franchise for its upcoming 13th season.\n\n\tShe also starred in both “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story” and “Impeachment: American Crime Story,” on which Murphy is an executive producer and director. Paulson won the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a limited series for “People v. OJ.” Additional collaborations include the Netflix series “Ratched,” the first season of “Feud,” and the Hulu legal drama “All’s Fair.”\n\n\tOutside of the Murphy-verse, Paulson is known for roles in shows like “Mrs. America” and “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip” as well as films like “12 Years a Slave,” “Glass,” and “Ocean’s 8.” She is also an accomplished stage actress, with Paulson winning the Tony and Drama Desk Award for best actress in a play for “Appropriate.” \n\n\tShe is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, Hansen Jacobson, and Birch Public Relations.\n",

    "body": "\n\tColleen Atwood is no stranger to creating dazzling costumes for musicals, counting such spectacles as“Nine” and “Chicago” among her credits. \n\n\tNow, she can add Bill Condon’s “Kiss of the Spider Woman” to that list. In Condon’s adaptation of the Broadway musical, Atwood crafted a wardrobe for Jennifer Lopez’s dual characters of Ingrid Luna and Aurora/Spider Woman that ranges from an elite working woman’s ward- robe (Aurora is head of a fashion glossy) to movie star looks, calling back to the Golden Age of MGM musicals.\n\t\n\n\tAtwood was familiar with Manuel Puig’s 1976 book, and subsequently saw Héctor Babenco’s 1985 film adaptation and the Broadway musical.\n\n\n\tAtwood’s designs reference those pre- vious iterations. In one sequence, Lopez wears a cream suit with a hat. “That outfit really is an homage to Chita from the musical because she wore a white suit,” she says, referring to Chita Rivera, who won a Tony playing the character on Broadway and the West End, and passed away just as Condon began filming. “We started with more of a white suit, like [Marlene] Dietrich, and then it became white shorts and then it became just the jacket,” Atwood says. The costume designer says the look evolved because once the choreography “came into the equation,” it was easier for Lopez to dance in just the chic jacket. Atwood adds, “It was simpler just to do, go for the legs and the jacket look. It was classic, Broadway.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA navy-blue suit consisted of a skirt and jacket, and nods to the working girl. Atwood added chiffon to the hem for movement. “It runs up the back, but when she starts moving in it, you can see it swirl around her.” The jacket was loosely inspired by a photo of star Rosalind Russell.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEarly on, Ingrid dons a gold dress. Atwood points out all the beads were sewn on by hand and made from glass. “It lights like glass,” she says. “It’s like her armor.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAs for Aurora’s/Spider Woman’s finale look, Atwood says that, for years, she had a swatch of fabric that the character would play with. “You could pull it and it was like a web. But it was less rigid, and I was waiting for the opportunity to use it.” When she got the job on “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” Atwood knew she had to make a costume with it. She ordered the fabric but added touches to make the black pop off the screen. “I didn’t want it to also be black and not be able to be seen,” Atwood says, “so I did a silver base behind it to reflect the light in the room. But you could still get light coming off it, rather than just a black shade.”\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tSean Astin came into his new role as president of SAG-AFTRA with a big agenda. Days after he was elected in September, his to-do list got even longer when the Jimmy Kimmel-ABC crisis erupted, followed by the arrival of AI ingenue Tilly Norwood and the Sora 2 flap involving Bryan Cranston.\n\n\tPlus, in his first weeks of discussions with the union’s staff, Astin became more aware of problems involving auditions and casting directors. And the perennial issue of access to the union’s health care plan has only become more acute for members, particularly older members, given the turbulence in Hollywood’s job market.\n\t\n\n\tIn his first extended interview since taking the SAG-AFTRA reins from Fran Drescher, Astin dove in with candid responses to questions including the overarching question about next year’s negotiations on a master contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Highlights from the interview are also featured on today’s episode of the “Daily Variety” podcast.\n\n\tThe last time around, in 2023, those bargaining sessions cratered into a five-month strike that marked SAG-AFTRA’s first industry-wide work stoppage since 1980. Nearly three years later, Astin brings the can-do energy of a working actor. He was born into the thespian life as the son of actors Patty Duke, who served as president of what was then the Screen Actors Guild from 1985 to 1988, and John Astin of “The Addams Family” fame.\n\t\n\t\tWhat has impressed upon you in this last month or so as the most pressing issues right now for actors?\t\n\n\tWell, my approach coming in was going to be to spend a month or two looking inward and really try and understand from the president’s office things that you don’t necessarily have access to, even if you’re on the board. It’s just amazing how quickly world events and industry-wide events seem to grab a hold of my focus. Jimmy Kimmel was fired from his job…\n\t\n\t\n\t\tI have to correct you. He was he was benched. It looked like he was in danger of getting fired.\t\n\n\tWell, yes, I suppose that’s an important legal nuance, but if you’re Jimmy Kimmel or anyone on that show, it sure feels like a firing when the government threatens you and then you are treated by your affiliates in a manner that is less than cordial or consistent with your contract. So in other situations like that, we haven’t spoken up as much because the rationale given by the producers or the companies or whatever have been somewhat more credible, but this was a situation where the government had specifically intervened with a threat.\n\t\n\t\tWe’ve seen an extraordinary ratcheting of federal power as expressed by the FCC. We know the quick and vocal reaction from the creative community, including the guilds, had an impact on Disney and on Jimmy Kimmel. Did you feel right away that SAG-AFTRA needed to have a voice as this issue blew up?\t\n\n\tHe’s working under a SAG-AFTRA contract, on a SAG-AFTRA set. We were very careful not to level our comments at the very beginning above the affiliates. The affiliates were ones that were making the decisions they made and they were improper. So we tried to focus our comments on that. I think our union has a slightly different posture when it comes to speaking out on these issues, because we are very recognizable to the public, and so when we say things and when our organization makes public commentary, we have to make sure that our reputation can stand behind it, and it did in that scenario. People were out in the streets, and individual members were protesting as well. That was just the first week! Then the Tilly Norwood thing comes out. It was almost a helpful moment in articulating why there should be such strong pushback against industry and and tech, because it was framed as though this artificial construct, this fictional character that was created was going to cause some sort of uproar in the agency business, and whether or not the agents were going to be representing her. Because it’s an old school narrative. It’s a great trope, you know, a young ingenue is discovered and becomes a big star, and all this stuff. And it was, but it’s all fake. It was all fake, and it was all engineered. So I just thought it was a fantastic opportunity to be able to see that the public was focusing its attention on this, and help direct that attention from the perspective of performers who are not going to be displaced.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t“All About Synthetic Eve.” I would imagine a lot of the guild’s work on policy and looking for the cutting edge of the next contract is about trying to imagine the impossible. A few years ago, we would have said that a Tilly Norwood situation is not possible. Now it is. That’s got to be daunting.\t\n\n\tIt requires absolute focus to protect our workforce. You know, it wasn’t a threat in the way that it was being marketed, that agents were all of a sudden going to begin, I guess, moving out of the talent representation business and into the synthetic data management business. But the actual technology itself, the idea of artificial intelligence and synthetic creations that are lifelike and seem real — that’s an absolute threat. We’ve seen that coming for a long time, but I really appreciate what you said, because at SAG-AFTRA, we are in the vanguard. We are the absolute industry leaders at helping to shape policy in this space, at least in the entertainment space. Our lawyers help draft the language that’s in some of these AI protection bills.\n\t\n\t\tSAG-AFTRA has definitely been up in Sacramento fighting for guardrails.\t\n\n\tAnd Governor [Gavin] Newsom came to our building, 5757 Wilshire, to sign a couple of pieces of legislation that we were influential in helping to move into law. I’m proud of it because I’ve seen it in action. But I also did a congressional round table with [House member] Darrell Issa in downtown L.A. They had one of those mobile congressional hearings, and I was the only labor representative at a table that was filled with general counsels. And it was interesting that when I was speaking about human-centered performance and the need to protect not just our name, image and likeness, not just our right of publicity, but our very dignity, our humanness — that which makes us us. These lawyers who are very skilled people at keeping a poker face, they were nodding yes. There’s a lot of overlap in what it means to protect our information, our data, their libraries, our identities. And so in bargaining I’m sure there will continue to be a very robust exchange about what next steps there are to take.\n\t\n\t\tCan I press you for any specifics? Because next year, you are going to go into another [AMPTP] contract negotiation situation. Can I press you for specifics in terms of what you’ve learned in the last few years about where more teeth needs to be put into legislation to protect your members?\t\n\n\tData tracking. Data tracking. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tThat’s the new frontier?\t\n\n\tI mean, listen, I’m just one person, and my role as president is to help guide a team to a great conclusion about whatever proposal packet we want to bring across. But I’ll be in the room arguing very vigorously for whatever is the most up to date. You used to hear about watermarking. You hear about blockchain technology. The basic premise of what I want to see as a lay person is [to address] the lie that when things are ingested into their large models, they can’t track them. That’s a lie. They lied about it before. If they lie about it again, we’re going to call them on that lie. I don’t generally like calling people a liar, but we absolutely know now that data can be tracked. They may not want it to be tracked, because once they realize on the other side, when a digital creator is put together, they may realize that there are a number of, I don’t even know how many performers’ work, that has been ingested and spit out, so that just seems to me like the lowest hanging fruit in terms of, conceptually, what we want to be able to do. But I am not the expert in knowing how we’re going to attack the AI argument. What I do know is that I’m going to help manage a team of experts so that when we get to that moment, there shouldn’t be any surprise when we walk into that room, everybody should know exactly what’s at stake. And I hope that we can work together, that we can work together to design something, because we all know what’s needed.\n\t\n\t\tIt seems to me that fundamentally, this is a copyright-based business. Studios and creatives should be aligned on whatever it takes to protect the sanctity of copyright protection. But, of course, the devil is in the details.\t\n\n\tOpen AI, we had one of our members, Bryan Cranston…\n\t\n\t\tI was just about to ask you about the Sora 2 situation. Can you give me the backstory about how that came together and how Cranston happened to be the spokesperson for the push that you made for [OpenAI] to make the adjustments that they did?\t\n\n\tSo we did not invent this moment, but we are living in it. And when the Tilly Norwood thing happened, and we saw the pushback, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, our national executive director and chief negotiator, and I penned a letter to our members. It took a lot of time. But we felt that it was important to really invest the right kind of time and energy to compose a communication that level-set to our members, where their leadership sees this moment, and it got a wonderful response. Members really seem to appreciate the time we took and what we said, the positions we laid out. I’m sure some would feel that it doesn’t go far enough, but the response was really wonderful. I had just made a movie with Bryan Cranston in the summer called “Chili Finger” with John Goodman, Judy Greer and myself, and we just had a great time. It’s gonna be a great little movie.\n\t\n\n\t[Cranston] called me or sent me a text or something like that. Right after he read that, he said that letter is incredible, Sean, that’s really, really great. Thank you so much for writing. Is it gives me so much comfort. And I said, “Oh, thanks, man, how are you?” His next email came back saying, “I just got contacted by a reporter” because Walter White, his famous character from “Breaking Bad,” appeared on a street corner with Michael Jackson in some amusing [AI-created] way. And he put the link in there, and I looked at it, and I was like, I thought, Wow. He said, “I don’t want to answer the questions until I’ve talked to my union and I know that whatever our approach is, and that I’m working in concert with what the union’s approach is.” It makes me want to cry because for someone of his level of success and familiarity with the public, his voice carries very far and for his first instinct to be check with the union. I just thought, man, I hope that a lot of the other union members that we have think about that.\n\n\tSo we were ready to fight. But then our policy making team said, “Well, actually, OpenAI has said that they they’re going to change their opt-out to opt-in.” The opt-out thing is the most ludicrous piece of garbage I had ever heard in my life. This is where if you somehow happen to find somewhere in the ether that your likeness has been used, you can try and find a phone number for somebody at whatever company is using it, and say “Would you please mind not using my image,” and that just seemed criminal to me. But apparently, [OpenAI CEO] Sam Altman and OpenAI had said previously that they’re going to change that to an opt-in process, which is they won’t use it unless they’ve asked you and you’ve agreed to use it, which essentially is what we have in our contract right now. You just have to notify us and get our permission and pay us. But we were unsure of some of the language that was used. But at this moment, they were really indicating to us that they wanted to cooperate, and it just became clear to me that it’s in their interest to cooperate with us.\n\t\n\t\tIt seemed like you seized on a moment to educate the general public as to the issues for performers and creatives with generative AI content. \t\n\n\tSome of the public has a discerning curiosity about what it is that they’re being exposed to. And nobody likes to be tricked. Nobody likes to have an experience that they have an emotional relationship to and then be told, Oh yeah, by the way, that was a construct that you didn’t know was operating on you. So I feel like you know. They were willing to support our [proposed federal] No Fakes legislation. I mean the whole industry, not just SAG-AFTRA. Everybody’s trying to get this No Fakes Act through. And when they said they would support it I said “Let’s do a joint statement then.” And everybody got excited about it. So I don’t want to over-praise the moment, but the fact that they took it down and said they didn’t want to do that in the future, and would support the AI safety legislation we were pursuing, that seemed like a good way to find collaboration with them. I hope there’s a lot more of that in the future.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn terms of the AI terms put into the last contract, particularly for the backgrounds and extras. Have you seen meaningful developments from that? Are people getting checks? Are people getting explicit requests for consent to use their likeness? Are you getting anecdotal information from members?\t\n\n\tLots of anecdotal information. I’m unsatisfied with that. I want to see analytics. You know, they want an AI waiver from us. Our lawyers talk to me about the importance of focusing on usage, and I honestly don’t know how many claims have been made in this space yet, or where that process is. I’m not sure what the disclosure protocols are for talking about that. But I fully expect that it will be tested, that all these things that we have put into place will be tested. Again, it’s just the start.\n\t\n\t\tSAG-AFTRA was very early to come out with a low-budget vertical content contract. Variety has been writing about microdramas. They’re definitely big overseas and we’re starting to see the format pop up here. Why was it important for SAG-AFTRA to be early in this arena? Do you have a sense that it will be significant for your members?\t\n\n\tPersonally, I do. I think the issue in doubt is whether it will, in fact, scale in this country the way it did in China. But our members were working in this space, and it was really important for us to create the same safety mechanisms for them that people have working elsewhere, because it’s professional work. It was not an easy thing to organize the verticals space. Our folks are experts, and they work a lot of elbow grease to identify the different producers who are doing this content and helping them understand what a union contract is, helping them understand what it’s like to function in a production space, conforming to certain basic kind of reporting and payment and other things that you got to do if you’re a signatory company. So hats off to our group for recognizing how important it was to get that contract out as quickly as possible. It’s a promulgated contract, which means that it’s a one-off.\n\t\n\t\tSean, anything else you want to share in terms of looking ahead, or super-big priorities for you in the foreseeable future?\t\n\n\tWell, we have this big contract negotiation coming up, which is that matter, they’re going to take a lot of passion and hard work to make sure that we that we function as responsibly and with as much strength as the moment warrants. In the casting space, there’s a lot of bad practices that happen, including finding ways to charge our performers or their representatives. They and the companies would have our union believe that there’s no relationship between the companies and the casting directors. That’s not true. The companies pay the casting directors for their work, so we just need to address this unholy triangle between the representatives, the casting agencies and the companies. I want to do whatever I can working with our team to help create a smoother roadmap, which I think will be in everyone’s interest, frankly.\n\t\n\n\tI would say the two things I hear about the most from members is AI, but the other is health and pension. We still have a dreadful situation, based on the changes that were made in the health plan four or five years ago, when a lot of seniors were pushed off the plan.\n\t\n\t\tThat was done at a moment of a real squeeze for the health plan, as I recall.\t\n\n\tWell, the whole country. The cost of healthcare in America is just out of control. But, you know, we make certain moral commitments to our members, and to the extent that it’s possible we would like to try and live up to those, he says with 47,000 exclamation points on the end of it.\n\n\tI do want any of our members who are reading this to know that their leadership knows that there’s a problem and is focused on it so and you know, I think that’s probably true of most unions around the country, frankly, because we’re all existing in an environment where the cost of healthcare and pharmacy drugs and stuff is just out of control. But to the extent where we can, I’ll try my best to have as positive an impact on the situation as I can.\n",

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tNearly 30 years after its Broadway debut, Terrence McNally’s acclaimed “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/ragtime/\">Ragtime</a>,” a panoramic look at a tumultuous historical moment, is returning to the Great White Way for a new era.</p>\n<p>\n\t When the musical adaptation of E.L. Doctorow’s 1975 novel was unveiled in 1996, it grappled with social issues that continue to plague Americans today. From upward mobility to racism and class stratification, the production highlights what it means to pursue progress in an ever-evolving nation.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tWith the United States once again at a turning point in its history, Tony Award-nominated director <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/lear-debessonet/\">Lear deBessonet</a> knew it was the perfect opportunity to bring the sweeping musical to Lincoln Center.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“You can watch a film at home that just rattles you to your core, but you’re by yourself,” she says. “That’s different than feeling those things and being with over a thousand other people that are also having feelings. There is something deeply restorative about it. And restorative is different than hopeful, but it is healing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tDeBessonet’s revival opened last year at New York City Center to raves. Now she’s bringing her cast — anchored by Tony nominee <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/joshua-henry/\">Joshua Henry</a>, Grammy nominee <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/caissie-levy/\">Caissie Levy</a> and Tony winner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/brandon-uranowitz/\">Brandon Uranowitz</a> — to a new stage with McNally’s book, Stephen Flaherty’s music and Lynn Ahrens’ lyrics.</p>\n<p>\n\t“What’s beautiful about Lear and her team is they have from the outset made it very clear that this is a ‘Ragtime’ for now,” Levy says.</p>\n<p>\n\tSet in the early 20th century, the play weaves together the stories of three distinct groups— Black Americans, Eastern European immigrants and white Americans — as they attempt to achieve the good lives that the country has promised them during a period of political and economic transformation.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“In a moment when there are so many questions about this country’s history, there’s also just a lot of really human personal moments in this show that I think people will resonate with in different ways,” deBessonet says. “It just feels like the perfect way to fulfill what theater’s here to do in the first place. And I do think ‘Ragtime’ is an American masterpiece.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the musical, Levy portrays Mother, the matriarch of a wealthy white family, who discovers her self-confidence and independence. “She’s so strong and open and vulnerable at the same time,” Levy says. “I think that her superpower is her ability to connect with people and see everyone’s humanity and allow herself to be changed by others. It’s definitely opened me up and reminded me of the places that I’ve maybe shut down that I do need to reexamine. The beautiful thing about Mother is that she doesn’t make it about herself. She follows her gut instincts and sometimes makes choices that are difficult or messy, but she allows the people around her to broaden her horizons.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Henry’s part, his role as Coalhouse Walker Jr., a Black musician living in Harlem, carries a lot of the play’s anguished moments. Coalhouse is a popular performer, but his ambitions are thwarted by the prejudice he faces. It’s a struggle that ultimately ends in tragedy. However, the actor credits deBessonet with creating a space for him to throw himself into the part completely. “I love roles that require a lot,” Henry says. “I like the idea of living at the edge of your comfort bubble, and Coalhouse forces me to lean into extreme joy, hope and resilience and then in the second act, sacrifice and what it means to be aware of your place in a community and what it means to be aware of your service beyond yourself. It’s a big plate to eat every night. And I’m hungry.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThough the ensemble is vast, perhaps more than any other character, Uranowitz’s Tateh, a Jewish immigrant newly arrived in New York, represents an idyllic version of the American dream. “I think what makes doing this show so special now is that we as a culture are asking ourselves new and different questions than we were asking ourselves in the 1990s,” Uranowitz says. </p>\n<p>\n\t“I hope that people see the promise of America in Tateh. They see that idealistic version of what can happen. But I hope that they ask with a sense of curiosity and with a sense of how we are going through growing pains as a society and a culture right now.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/disney/\">Disney</a> is in the process of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/\">winding down Hulu’s standalone app and service</a>. But at the same time, the Mouse House is doubling down on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hulu/\">Hulu</a> brand — including taking it global.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs of Oct. 8, Hulu will become the global general entertainment brand on Disney+ in non-U.S. markets, replacing the Star tile. With the change, and in preparation for what <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/\">Disney is promising will be a “fully integrated unified app experience”</a> in 2026, Disney+ customers “will begin to see further integrations of Hulu across the Disney+ app as part of an ongoing and iterative slate of product updates on the homepage and beyond,” the company announced Thursday.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tSwapping out Star with Hulu will help increase awareness outside the U.S. that Disney+ has a large catalog of content that appeals to adults, according to Disney — and it also means that the company’s investment in marketing and social media promotion for Hulu will now be applied worldwide.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Disney, the Star-to-Hulu rebranding isn’t just about a brand-tile switchover: The company says it is also making it even easier to discover Hulu content and more on Disney+.</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney+ over the next few weeks will introduce “a more visual home screen,” as well as more intuitive navigation and more personalized recommendations. “These enhancements are just the beginning, with additional updates planned in the lead-up to the launch of a unified app experience next year,” Disney said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe changes come after Disney completed the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/disney-closes-hulu-deal-comcast-price-tag-1236423903/\">full acquisition of Hulu in a deal with Comcast</a> this June. In 2026, Disney expects to shut down Hulu as a standalone app and service and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/\">fully merge Hulu into Disney+</a>. According to Disney, in the U.S. you will still be able to purchase Disney+ and Hulu as standalone plans.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tHere’s a rundown of new features coming to Disney+ on TV devices:</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>A new navigation bar is being added to the top of the homepage. The new “For You” tab is the first screen subscribers will see when they click into Disney+, which will be “the new home base for recommended viewing,” powered by an updated algorithm that learns user preferences over time. There are also tabs for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN, depending on each user’s subscription.</li>\n<li>The Live hub in the main vertical navigation takes viewers to the latest live news, sports and events, as well as the 24/7 Streams on Disney+.</li>\n<li>The Disney+ user interface will feature a “more modern design that brings our characters and stories front and center,” according to Disney. That includes a new video display in the topmost “hero” carousel and a more dynamic brand row, showcasing the latest titles from each brand. In addition, content sets on Disney+ are being updated to showcase “more cinematic, poster-style artwork.”</li>\n<li>The UI will add new badging tags like “Season Finale,” “New Series” and “New Movie” to show what’s unique and timely right now.</li>\n<li>Disney+ will make Profiles more prominent across the UI. From there, users will find titles personally recommended for them based on their unique viewing habits.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the updates on connected-TV devices, Disney said it is “putting a lot of thought into enhancing the mobile experience.” For example, the Disney+ iOS app is launching Widgets, which will “add another front door to take users directly into our programming with one click,” the company said.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the U.S., <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-plus-hulu-price-increases-october-2025-1236527241/\">Disney has set price hikes that will take effect Oct. 21</a> for most of its Disney+, Hulu and ESPN plans and bundles. For example, the standalone Disney+ with ads tier is rising from $9.99 to $11.99/month while the Disney+ Premium (without ads) is going from $15.99 to $18.99/month. The Hulu standalone plan with ads is increasing from $9.99 to $11.99/month as of the same date; the premium version of Hulu with no ads will remain at $18.99 per month.</p>\n<p>\n\tDisney released an animation showing the new Disney+ UI integrated with Hulu in action:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tCommunications platform <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/discord/\">Discord</a> is launching a new ad format called Arena Quests, which will allow brands to sponsor games and offer users rewards based on their length of time spent playing.</p>\n<p>\n\tPer Discord, “With Arena Quests, brands can now sponsor real gaming moments on Discord by rewarding users for playing games within a curated selection of titles or themed bundles sponsored by the advertiser. As players participate in the Quest, they choose a game from a pre-curated list and play for a specified time. Once they have completed the Quest requirements, players earn rewards like Orbs or Discord avatar decorations. Brands naturally become part of the Quest experience by surrounding the gameplay in an authentic and engaging way.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tAlong with Arena Quests, Discord currently offers two other Quests products: Video Quests and Play Quests. As of Thursday, Discord is also launching Video Quests on mobile devices, which will mark Discord’s first non-PC-based advertising product.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Discord’s Video Quests are focused on driving awareness and consideration, a format Discord says is ideal for trailers, new season announcements, downloadable content (DLC) drops, and other video content, Play Quests, like Arena Quests, are designed to drive gameplay. Play Quests require users to play or stream a game to unlock rewards, getting players directly into the game.</p>\n<p>\n\tArena Quests are available in Alpha testing now with “limited slots available for select partners.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to an internal survey of approximately 1,000 Discord users, more than 50% of users who have seen or interacted with a Quest in the past month say that Quests improve their experience on Discord, with players proactively seeking out new Quests to complete.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Our ad platform was only a year and a half old when I first got here; it was very early days,” Discord’s vice president of sales Adam Bauer told <em>Variety</em>. “And I think in the year and a half since, from a product standpoint, we have completely transformed what’s available to partners.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBauer says the Discord sales team took a cautious approach “because we really want to be sensitive about how we use data, how we apply data, really to protect not only the platform, but our partners as well.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“We started lightly with just a lot of application of first-party data. Taking a look at what games do people like to play? Do they like to play action games? Do they like to play shooters, or play strategy games, which is very native to Discord. Then we launched a partnership with Kantar to measure brand lift earlier this year, really to measure favorability, intent and traditional brand lift metrics, and now we’re starting to move into deeper levels of measurement and attribution through integrations with MMPs, taking a look at third-party data partnership and things like that. A lot of what traditional studio advertisers are looking for is either in our immediate roadmap or in early 2026.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, Discord announced its partnering with Gamesight to provide server-to-server events API integration, and with AppsFlyer as its first mobile measurement platform (MMP) to provide advertisers with “trusted, privacy-safe” campaign measurement.</p>\n<p>\n\tPer Discord, “Early results of the partnership demonstrate how the AppsFlyer integration can supercharge campaigns on Discord. Second Dinner recently ran two Video Quests on Mobile featuring fan favorites Venom, Thor, and Spider-Man facing off in a superhero battle. The second campaign leveraged AppsFlyer and Discord’s player-based mobile targeting and server-to-server MMP, driving a 30% performance lift over the first Quest.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/peaky-blinders/\">Peaky Blinders</a>” is coming back to the small screen with a new generation of Shelbys.</p>\n<p>\n\tA sequel series from the beloved show’s writer and creator Steven Knight, set in 1953 Britain, has received a two-season order at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/netflix/\">Netflix</a> and the BBC. The cast is being kept under wraps for now, but original “Peaky Blinders” star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/cillian-murphy/\">Cillian Murphy</a> is on board as an executive producer.</p>\n<p>\n\t“After being heavily bombed in WWII, Birmingham is building a better future out of concrete and steel,” the plot description reads. “In a new era of Steven Knight’s ‘Peaky Blinders,’ the race to own Birmingham’s massive reconstruction project becomes a brutal contest of mythical dimensions. This is a city of unprecedented opportunity and danger: with the Shelby family right at its blood-soaked heart.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new series will be produced by Kudos (“SAS Rogue Heroes,” “House of Guinness”) and Garrison Drama (“Peaky Blinders” Seasons 1-6 and the upcoming “Peaky Blinders” film). It’s set to film in Birmingham at Digbeth Loc. Studios.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“I’m thrilled to be announcing this new chapter in the ‘Peaky Blinders’ story,” Knight said in a statement. “Once again it will be rooted in Birmingham and will tell the story of a city rising from the ashes of the Birmingham blitz. The new generation of Shelbys have taken the wheel and it will be a hell of a ride.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two new seasons will consist of six 60-minute episodes each. Beyond Knight and Murphy, the new “Peaky Blinders” era is executive produced by Karen Wilson and Martin Haines for Kudos, Jamie Glazebrook for Garrison Drama, Jo McClellan and Danielle Scott Haughton for the BBC and Mona Qureshi and Toby Bentley for Netflix.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFans won’t have to wait too long for more “Peaky Blinders,” as there is also an upcoming film expected to release in early 2026. Entitled “The Immortal Man,” the feature is thought to pick up where the series left off, and stars Murphy in the lead alongside an ensemble cast including Stephen Graham, Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Roth and Barry Keoghan. Written by Knight, it was directed by Tom Harper, whose credits include “This Is England ’86,” “The Woman in Black: Angel of Death” and several episodes of “Peaky Blinders.”</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\tFor young Italian-Greek actress <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/fotini-peluso/\">Fotinì Peluso</a>, landing the lead role in high-end TV series “The Great Chimera” — based on one of the most important Greek novels of the 20th century — has been a great way “to make contact with my homeland,” she says.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe six-episode 1930s-set show, which is among the highlights of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/beta-film/\">Beta Film</a>‘s upcoming <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/mipcom/\">Mipcom</a> slate, stars Peluso as Marina, an Italian beauty fraught with family trauma who falls in love with a seductive Greek sea captain played by Andreas Konstantinou (“Milky Way,” “Cloudy Sunday”). She decides to join him to start a new life on the idyllic island of Syros. There, enchanted by her surroundings, Marina becomes fascinated by her husband’s erudite younger brother played by Dimitris Kitsos (“The Beach”). This leads to her descent into a vicious vortex narrated with Greek tragedy tropes.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“The Great Chimera,” which is based on the eponymous novel by M. Karagatsis, is directed by Vardis Marinakis (“Silent Road,” “Zizotek”), written by Panagiotis Iosifelis (“The Beach”), and produced by Beta Film and Athens-based Foss Productions.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of the show’s Mipcom launch, Peluso speaks to<em> Variety</em> about how “The Great Chimera” allowed her to connect with her Greek roots and why the show’s sex scenes were important “on an artistic level.” </p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxFfQCK8owo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>What attracted you to playing Marina? Had you previously read the book?</strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’m Italian-Greek; my mother is Greek and my father is Italian. The book is a must-read in contemporary Greek literature. I was really drawn to the figure of this woman, in those years [the 1930s], probably because of the position women had in the world then. I was very interested in her constant search for freedom. She searches for freedom throughout the entire story, failing to do so probably due to the limitations imposed by society but also due to self-imposed limitations. So what interested me was definitely the complexity of this character, who is presented not as being all peaches and cream, but as a character with very dark, even toxic, aspects of her personality. But also the fact that there are so many themes that I would want to be outdated today, but are not. Specifically, the position women have in society today and how they still have to fight for their own freedom.\n\t</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>How important was it for you, having grown up in Italy, to land this lead role in a Greek classic? </strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI’ve worked in Greece before, but not in a purely Greek production. I worked on the TV series “Greek Salad” by Cédric Klapisch, which shot in Athens but wasn’t a Greek production. The actors were all French and I did not speak Greek. So for me it was super important, at this point in my career, to make contact with my homeland. Greece isn’t just a secondary country for me — my childhood is tied to Greece. So it was very important for me to somehow maintain these roots and work with a director and a crew that have a Greek mentality. This professional and human aspect really interested me. And then, obviously, I think Greek cinema, despite having less funding and probably being less developed than Italian cinema, has some unique talents especially among youths. And there are directors — aside from Yorgos Lanthimos, obviously — that are really exciting and are breaking out on the festival circuit. So I’ve always been very eager to tap into this world.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Let’s go back to Marina, a bold woman who in the 1930s embarks on a non-conventional journey. What makes her relevant today? </strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI agree with you that she’s clearly a woman who does extraordinary things for her time and for its mentality. At the same time, I also like to see her as an ordinary woman. I think it’s important not to cast her apart from all the other women one might encounter. Let me explain: It’s clear that she had a unique life and that she rebelled against society. And this was rare compared with how women behaved at the time. Nowadays, women do this a lot more. But that doesn’t mean that some of these issues have changed. What’s changed, I believe, is that Marina’s hunger for freedom has become a necessity and a desire of ordinary women. In this sense, I was very struck by how scandalous it was that she was searching for her sexuality and that she didn’t understand it. Or that she wanted to show off her body. Or that she wanted to celebrate herself in some way.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong>Talk to me more about her sexuality, which plays an important part in the story</strong>.\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tThis aspect will always cast her apart, even today, in the sense that a woman’s naked body is still perceived by audiences as something that stands out for some absurd reason, unfortunately. I wish this were something old-fashioned, but it’s not. So I find the show cross-generational, and I find it very interesting that the character is presented in her complexity. That is, without any sugarcoating. What I mean is that she thinks things that are also ugly and dark, that are sometimes scary. You think, “Oh my God, is she a monster?” When in reality, deep down, perhaps we also have trouble accepting certain aspects of ourselves that are swept under the carpet. I think this is universal, extemporaneous and evergreen.\n\t</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<p><img srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Great-Chimera1.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Great-Chimera1.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Great-Chimera1.jpg?resize=300,203 300w\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Great-Chimera1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\t</p>\n<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Beta\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t<h5>\n\t\t<strong><strong>Was doing the sex scenes a challenge?</strong></strong> <strong>Did you have an intimacy coordinator on set? </strong>\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tI find it very interesting that this started out as a TV series for Greek public television, then its horizons broadened with a whole host of other negotiations going on. What’s always been important to me is that Marina’s sexuality was a central theme of her life. This is written in the book exactly the same way it’s presented on screen. For me, it was important that this aspect wasn’t diminished or covered up in any way. It would have bothered me a lot, if we’d had to do things halfway. Having said that, do the sex scenes really stand out? I don’t know. Probably not. I have no idea. But I know how we worked. </p>\n<p>\n\tI know that it was a completely protected environment and a lot of attention was paid to this. We had an intimacy coordinator, who was amazing. At the beginning, I was pretty ignorant about all this. I thought, “OK, if I’m at peace with myself and I talk things through with the director and the actors, I don’t really need a mediator.” When in truth, it’s crucial. Not because of your physical appearance, or because someone might do something you don’t like. But simply because sometimes you need a mediator who sets the limits and rules between what can be done and the artistic side. And strangely enough, the act of setting these limits, or rules, makes you feel much freer. I mean, once the boundaries are set, you feel free to express yourself as you want within those boundaries. Especially when it comes to having [physical] contact with others, because it’s not that simple. After all, we are talking about bodies, human beings, people. So I found this very important; we worked on it a lot. There are lots of [sex] scenes, I remember them. I haven’t seen them yet. I don’t really know. But I think we did what we wanted to do, and that was important for me on an artistic level.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>\n</div>"

All agreements include theatrical releases. World sales are handled by M-Appeal.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tNegotiations are also advancing in several other territories, including North America, while I Wonder Pictures in Italy had already secured the title prior to its Venice debut. Additionally, the film will soon premiere at festivals in Warsaw and Morelia, and it is also booked for several other film events.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t“On the Road” combines a tender love story with the structure of a thriller, offering different layers that broaden its appeal. Its cinematography captures both the vast landscapes and the authentic world of Mexico’s long-haul truckers.</p>\n<p>\n\t“On the Road” follows Veneno, a rebellious young drifter who frequents roadside diners where he sleeps with truck drivers. Desperate for a ride, he meets Muñeco, a hard-edged driver who keeps to himself. Convincing him to take him along, Veneno is drawn into the hyper-masculine world of long-haul trucking across northern Mexico. As the journey progresses and an unexpected intimacy develops between them, Veneno’s past resurfaces, threatening both their lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe film stars non-professional actor Victor Miguel Prieto and Osvaldo Sánchez (“Pedro Páramo”).\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tFilmware’s recent acquisitions include “It Was Just an Accident” (Cannes winner) by Jafar Panahi, “Enzo” by Laurent Cantet and Robin Campillo, “Kokuho” by Lee Sang-il, “A Useful Ghost” by Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke, and “Love That Remains” by Hlynur Pálmason.</p>\n<p>\n\tCommenting on the company’s latest addition, Jeffrey Chen, managing director of Filmware, said: “‘On the Road’ is a powerful, emotional, and visually striking movie – a heartfelt journey that will resonate deeply with audiences in Taiwan through its unforgettable storytelling by David Pablos.”</p>\n<p>\n\tFestival Films, a leading Spanish distributor specializing in high-quality independent and auteur-driven cinema, has added “On the Road” to a lineup that includes “Mongol” by Amarsaikhan Baljinnyam, “Ghostlight” by Kelly O’Sullivan and Alex Thompson, “Amal” by Jawad Rhalib, “The Owner” by Yuri Bykov, and “Wilding” by David Allen.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We are truly proud to collaborate with M-Appeal World Sales and bring ‘On the Road’ (‘En el camino’) by David Pablos to Spanish audiences. The film’s poetic storytelling and emotional depth perfectly align with our vision of showcasing bold and authentic voices in contemporary cinema,” Juan Marsal Fernández, CEO of Festival Films, said.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Germany, Salzgeber will release the film theatrically, continuing its tradition of championing distinctive auteur cinema. The distributor’s 2025 acquisitions include “Enzo” by Laurent Cantet and Robin Campillo, “Love Me Tender” by Anna Cazenave Cambet, “Drunken Noodles” by Lucio Castro, “Peter Hujar’s Day” by Ira Sachs, “Night Stage” by Filipe Matzembacher and Marcio Reolon, and “Dreamers” by Joy Gharoro-Akpojotor.</p>\n<p>\n\tBjörn Koll, CEO of Salzgeber, commented: “This film ranks among the very best that queer cinema has produced in recent years – very sexy and very honest.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPablos’ credits include “Dance of the 41” and “The Chosen Ones,” as well as directing the first four episodes of Amazon’s western series “The Head of Joaquín Murrieta.” “The Chosen Ones” screened at major international festivals including Cannes (Un Certain Regard) and San Sebastián (Horizontes Latinos), and received a Goya nomination for Best Ibero-American Film.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tPayán’s previous work includes “The Golden Dream” (“La jaula de oro”), winner of 81 international awards including the Un Certain Talent Award at Cannes 2013. Other credits include “Devil’s Freedom” (“La libertad del diablo”), which premiered at the Berlinale in 2017, and the family drama “Los Lobos,” which won the Generation KPlus Grand Prix at Berlinale 2020.</p>\n<p>\n\t“On the Road” is produced by Payán’s Animal de Luz in co-production with La Corriente del Golfo (headed by Luna and Gael García Bernal), The Maestros Cine, EFD Studios, Terminal Films and Producciones Año Bisiesto. The film was supported through Mexico’s Eficine tax incentive and by the CNC.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/squid-game/\">Squid Game</a>” creator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/hwang-dong-hyuk/\">Hwang Dong-hyuk</a>‘s Firstman Studio has made a $3 million investment in entertainment-focused AI tech company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://variety.com/t/twelvelabs/\">TwelveLabs</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tCo-founded by Jae Lee and Soyoung Lee, the San Francisco-based TwelveLabs is partnering with studios, streamers, creators and broadcasters to offer a system that “indexes and enriches video metadata down to the scene level, enabling editors, directors, and producers to work with unprecedented speed and precision while maintaining creative control.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Storytelling is becoming more global, more visual, and faster-paced,” Hwang said in a statement Thursday. “The creators who can adapt will shape the future of entertainment. I believe technology like TwelveLabs will be essential for turning ideas into finished stories at the speed audiences now expect.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHwang added: “AI tools are opening up new ways to create the power of cinema that we couldn’t have imagined just a few years ago. For me and Firstman Studio, it’s about giving filmmakers more time to focus on the art, the emotion, and the magic only they can bring to life.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTwelveLabs differentiates itself from companies using generative AI to “create entirely new content,” and emphasizes its product’s “focus on enhancing what already exists.”</p>\n<p>\n\tPer TwelveLabs, “Film and television archives contain billions of dollars’ worth of untapped footage. In many studios, less than 5% of that material is ever reused, largely because finding and preparing it for production is slow, manual, and fragmented. TwelveLabs’ video foundation models can search across hours of footage by visual, audio, and contextual cues simultaneously — making it possible to locate a specific scene, verify rights, and deliver usable files in a fraction of the time.”\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t“Some of the most valuable footage in the world goes underused because it’s too time-consuming to search, retrieve, and prepare for production,” TwelveLabs co-founder and head of GTM Soyoung Lee said. “We make video instantly searchable and ready to use at scale, so media companies, enterprises, and creators across industries can unlock more value from every frame they own.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSee below for <em>Variety</em>‘s Q&A with TwelveLabs CEO and co-founder Jae Lee about the company’s mission and partnership with Hwang.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow did Director Hwang get involved in the company? What led to the investment?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tDirector Hwang has always been drawn to innovation, whether in the way he tells stories or in the tools that help him bring them to life. When we connected, he was curious about how video AI could actually understand the emotional and narrative flow of a scene, not just surface-level cues like objects or dialogue. That depth of understanding resonated with him as a filmmaker. As he explored what our technology could do, he saw clear value for creators like himself, who want to spend less time bogged down in technical friction and more time focusing on the heart of the story. That alignment of vision is what ultimately led him to invest through his production company, Firstman Studio.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat is the long-term mission for TwelveLabs?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tAt the core, our mission is to index every video in the world and make it as easy to understand as text. More than 90% of the world’s data today is video, yet most of it remains locked away– whether in Hollywood archives, sports vaults, or corporate libraries. We want to change that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy giving machines the ability to understand not just what’s in a video but also the context — the tone, pacing, or emotion, we make it possible for humans to focus on what really matters: the creative decisions. Over time, we believe this shift will turn video from a passive archive into an active, living resource that fuels storytelling, discovery, and entirely new kinds of experiences.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tHow do you see this technology benefitting creators like Hwang?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tFor filmmakers like Director Hwang, time is the scarcest resource. Hours are often lost cataloguing dailies, restoring archival shots, or verifying rights before an idea can move forward. TwelveLabs’ technology uniquely reduces that friction, surfacing the right scene faster, flagging potential issues earlier, and clearing the path so creators can focus more of their energy on emotion, framing, and story arcs.\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is supercharging the creative process. It’s giving storytellers more time for the magic only they can bring– things like deciding what moves people, what lingers in memory, and what defines a story. For someone like Director Hwang and his production company, that means less overhead and more freedom to focus on what he does best.</p>\n\t<h5>\n\t\tWhat are you doing to quell any fears about creators working with AI-focused companies?\t</h5>\n<p>\n\tMost of the fear comes from generative AI tools that try to replace human creativity by making net-new content from scratch. That’s not what we do.</p>\n<p>\n\tTwelveLabs is about working with the material creators already have. We build models that index, search, and understand footage so editors, directors, and producers can move faster and smarter. The decisions about what to use, how to frame it, what story to tell, that’s still all human.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "\n\tEgo Nwodim is sharing her feelings about her time on “Saturday Night Live” and her decision to leave the late-night series just before its 51st season.\n\n\tOn Wednesday’s episode of “Sherri,” Sherri Shepherd pointed out that there are no longer any Blasck women in the “SNL” cast asked Nwodim if she felt “the weight of all of that representation” during her time on the show.\n\n\t“I don’t know that I would call it weight. I felt honored to be the seventh Black woman in that cast,” Nwodim replied. “I hope that there will be more Black women. Punkie Johnson came on the show after me. Who knows who else they’ll find as they explore and seek out other talents?” (Johnson the cast in 2020 and departed in 2024, a year before Nwodim’s exit.)\n\t\n\n\t“I do believe I represented a myriad of characters, different types of characters,” she continued. “Some people didn’t always catch that nuance, but I do feel like I got the chance to represent and that was really important to me.”\n\n\n\tNwodim joined “SNL” as a featured player in 2018’s Season 44 before being promoted to the main cast for Season 48 in 2020, performing in a total of seven seasons. Speaking about her exit, she said, “It’s like being in a marriage. I’ve never done it before, but that show was my longest relationship ever. I’m not a commitment-phobe, but I heard when you’re married, you get the seven-year itch. And it’s like, I wanna date other people! I wanna see some other privates!”\n\n\t“It felt like the time to make space for something else for me,” Nwodim added.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Christy,” a sports drama about Christy Martin, has drawn rave reviews for Sydney Sweeney’s transformative performance as the former professional boxer who endured triumph and tragedy in her barrier-breaking career. But it’s also a chance for Votiv, a scrappy production company that helped develop the film, to take its place in the center of the ring. \n\n\t“We are trying to intersect art and commerce,” says Brent Stiefel, Votiv’s founder and CEO. “We founded this business to support artists and let them realize their visions. That’s important, because it’s really hard to build a career in the arts. If we can help with that while operating a sustainable business, we’ll be a success.”\n\t\n\n\t“Christy,” which opens on Friday, is the highest-profile film in the company’s history and exemplifies the kind of artist-driven stories that Votiv hopes to keep making.\n\n\n\t“This was a project that we had the opportunity to buy the life rights on some years ago,” says Justin Lothrop, head of film and television at Votiv. “Christy is an amazing human being and her story is incredible. We knew it would make a compelling movie and it’s so exciting to be able to share it with the world.” \n\n\tMartin held the WBC female super welterweight title, rising to the top of her chosen sport and earning a reputation for her toughness and endurance. But her personal life was equally dramatic — she overcame addiction, survived a murder attempt by her estranged husband, recovered and went on to marry Lisa Holewyne, a former boxing rival. Votiv managed to outmaneuver other companies to convince Martin to let them dramatize her life on screen. They then partnered with other production entities like Anonymous Content, which brought together Sweeney and director David Michôd, and Black Bear, which helped finance the film and will distribute it in theaters.  \n\t\n\n\t“There aren’t a lot of companies that do development quite as as deeply as we do,” says Lothrop. “We engage on things at the earliest stages, as opposed to trying to track down spec scripts and doing rewrites very far down the line. We want to shape things. If there’s a secret sauce, that’s it.” \n\n\tVotiv began life in 2011 as a management company for musicians, but after Steifel connected with Lothrop, an indie veteran, it moved more aggressively into the feature space. The company has released more than a dozen features, ranging from comedies (“Obvious Child” with Jenny Slate) to dramas (“Between Us” with Julia Stiles) to documentaries (“Alt Right: Age of Rage”). It hopes to release between three to four movies annually and has several projects on the horizon, including “Wicker,” a comedy with Olivia Colman and Alexander Skarsgard, and “Patricia Wants to Cuddle,” a horror-comedy that will be directed by Sophia Takal (“Black Christmas”). Earlier this year, the company premiered “Tow,” a drama about a homeless woman that stars Rose Byrne, at Tribeca.  \n\n\tIn the case of “Christy,” the duo is thrilled that the movie will get a run in cinemas, as opposed to winding up on streaming. \n\n\t“Being creative at heart, we’d love for every one of our films to make it into theaters,” says Stiefel. “That’s not the reality, but it’s our preferred pathway.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tNearly half of Gen Z say that YouTube or social video platforms are their preferred entertainment platforms over traditional TV or paid streaming.\n\n\tAccording to Activate Consulting’s Technology & Media Outlook 2026, which was unveiled by CEO Michael Wolf at the WSJ Tech Live event on Wednesday, 43% of Gen Z are opting for YouTube and TikTok for their media and news consumption. \n\n\tPer the same survey, the popularity of “microdramas” — one of the latest trends on those platforms, consisting of 1-2 minute scripted episodes of an ongoing storyline — has been increasing at a fast rate with 28 million U.S. adults (52% aged 18-34) reportedly watching that new form of content.\n\t\n\n\tAdditional findings include projections for global internet and media revenue to increase by $388 billion by 2029, while average daily time spent streaming video will climb to 4 hours and 8 minutes as time spent watching traditional TV is set to collapse to just 1 hour and 17 minutes. \n\n\n\tActivate estimates that, as a result, streaming revenues (from ads and subscriptions) will grow 18-19% annually while traditional TV revenues will fall 4-6% year to year.\n\n\tAccording to the consulting firm’s report, people are currently living a “32-hour, 17-minute day” by multitasking throughout their daily routine online, and consumers spend over 13 hours on media daily by utilizing various social media platforms like Instagram, X, and TikTok. To capitalize on this trend, companies like Amazon are moving into creating more video content, alongside streaming services like Spotify moving to creating audiobooks.\n",

    "body": "\n\tHuntr/x will return to the screen… but the girl group’s reunion tour might take a while.\n\n\tNetflix and Sony have finalized a deal for another “KPop Demon Hunters” movie, with plans to release the animated musical sequel in 2029, as first reported by Bloomberg. Animated films can take a long time to make, hence the potential four-year gap between installments. Of course, release date plans could change depending on the film’s production schedule. \n\t\n\n\tNetflix and Sony declined to comment.\n\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters,” a fantasy adventure about a fictional K-pop girl group who protect the world from demons with their music, was developed and produced by Sony Pictures Animation. As part of Sony’s licensing deal with Netflix, “KPop Demon Hunters” landed directly on Netflix and became the streamer’s most popular movie of all time. Meanwhile, three of its original songs — “Golden,” “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop” — have been mainstays on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and could land nominations at the upcoming Grammy Awards.\n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters” has been such a phenomenon that the theatrical-averse Netflix decided to bring a sing-along version of the film to theaters for fan events in August and October. During the first go-around, “KPop Demon Hunters” topped the box office with roughly $18 million over two days. Then around Halloween, the movie collected $5 million to $6 million, which is noteworthy considering it’s been widely available on streaming for months. \n\n\t“KPop Demon Hunters co-director Maggie Kang, who helmed the film with Chris Appelhans, has long expressed her desire for a sequel.\n\t\n\n\t“We’ve set up so much for potential backstory,” Kang told Variety in July. “Obviously, there’s a lot of questions that are left unanswered and areas that are not explored. We had to do that because there’s only so much movie you could tell in 85 minutes.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Wicked” and its sequel, “Wicked: For Good,” might be two movies, but in Jon M. Chu’s mind “it was just part of one giant arc.”\n\n\tWith “Wicked: For Good” set to be released on Nov. 21, Chu explained how the movie follows Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande) growing in their complicated relationship.\n\n\tChu was speaking with Variety’s senior artisans editor Jazz Tangcay at the Middleburg Film Festival, where he was honored alongside his go-to cinematographer Alice Brooks and editor Myron Kerstein with the Creative Collaborators Award.\n\t\n\n\tHe went on to explain that “Wicked: For Good” dives deeper into the characters and explores the consequences of choices. It puts Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship to the test as they embrace their new identities as the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch of the North, and how the consequences of their actions will change all of Oz. \n\n\tChu said, “Choices are easy, but sticking with them, how lonely that feels, how you start to question your own choices. In Glinda’s point of view, what happens when you weren’t ready to make the right choice at first? Can you have the courage to pop your own bubble of privilege when you see injustices?”\n\n\tWith the film about friendship, Brooks and Chu shared how they first met while studying at USC. Back then, Chu was working on his musical thesis and had heard about Brooks. “I chased her down and forced her to help me on this,” Chu recalled.\n\n\tThe two worked together, and at the end of shooting, Brooks told the audience how they too have known each other for “more than half our lives.” And as a memento of that first collaboration, she shared a story with the audience: “One of my treasures is actually something Jon gave the entire crew when we finished, ‘When the Kids are Away,’ and it’s this little music box.”\n\t\n\n\tBrooks had brought her own prop, that very music box that plays “When You Wish Upon a Star” that Chu gave her all those years ago. She went on to say, “For the last 25 years, I’ve been carrying this around with me because it’s a reminder of where my dream started. All we wanted to do was grow up and make musicals, and no one was making musicals. At the time, the Hollywood musical was dead, and we bonded over our love of musicals. And here we are, 20-something years later, having made this musical that’s impacted the world in such a major way.” Chu teared up seeing the gift he had given her.\n\n\tAs a symbol of their lifelong friendship, Brooks returned the sentiment. Chu said, “On the first day of shooting ‘Wicked,’ she got me a music box and she had engraved ‘unlimited’ on it.”\n\n\tThe story of friendship in “Wicked” resonates deeply with Chu and his collaborators. He likened it to the “Michelangelo Effect,” where two people give life to one another because they believe in each other and help uncover the best versions of themselves. “I think that’s the power of when you’re trying to reach for the moon and build a rocket ship to space, and you just have never done it before, and you look to that power.” Chu added, “We expect more from each other. We can argue and find our way through it. That takes years and years of trust… and there’s nothing better than looking back at the journey.”\n\n\tThe trio also talked about Elphaba’s “No Good Deed” and Erivo’s performance. For Kerstein, who has worked with Chu since “Crazy Rich Asians,” he recalled watching the footage for the first time. At the time, he was in his home in Altadena, cutting it before the L.A. fires. “That was just me crying in my house alone, looking at this footage.”\n\n\tChu praised Kerstein, likening the art of editing each musical number to a different puzzle. “Every structure is different depending on what you need emotionally. ‘No Good Deed’ could be edited in an action piece. And we actually had those versions. We like to do all these different versions, but when you have as much empathy as Myron and you see the world differently, you’re looking for the little things in this giant number. When the little things build up, that’s where it cracks, and so every number is engineered in a new way.”\n\t\n\n\tHaving worked together for as long as they have, Chu said the trust and friendship mean they can be hard on one another and relentless with each other. “When we’re working with friends, it’s not because it feels comfortable. It’s because we can feel comfort in the unknown. That means we can walk into that scary place together and know we’re going to trust each other to find it.”\n\n\tWatch the video above.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Cocomelon: The Movie” will toddle its way onto the big screen in 2027. \n\n\tUniversal Pictures has dated the CG animated film, based on the blockbuster children’s show, for theatrical release on Feb. 26, 2027. “Cocomelon: The Movie” is produced by Moonbug Entertainment, Flywheel Media, Prime Focus Studios, DreamWorks Animation, with animation by the DNEG Group.\n\n\n\t“Cocomelon” is a children’s series designed to teach life skills through music, and the new film follows the show’s lead character, JJ, and his friends as they set off on a brand-new adventure. The “Cocomelon” franchise has become a global kids’ entertainment phenomenon, available in more than 80 countries and more than 20 languages, with more than 4 billion average monthly views on YouTube. \n\t\n\n\tSince joining Moonbug Entertainment in 2020, the brand has also expanded into consumer products, streaming music, games and live entertainment. “Cocomelon” launched on Netflix the same year, where it was a consistent draw for young viewers, and the show will officially head to Disney+ in 2027. The brand has also spawned spin-offs like Netflix’s “CoComelon Lane,” “CoComelon Classroom,” “Cody Time,” “Nina’s Familia” and “JJ’s Animal Time.” Plans for the big-screen adaptation with Universal and Dreamworks were announced in May.\n\n\n\tFlywheel Media and Prime Focus Studios are currently in production on “The Angry Birds Movie 3” for Paramount, which hits theaters on December 23, 2026. Prime Focus Studios recently co-produced “The Garfield Movie” with Alcon Entertainment for Sony and is currently in production on the live-action/animation hybrid feature film “Animal Friends” with Legendary Entertainment and Ryan Reynolds’ production company Maximum Effort.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAs a film reviewer and obsessive follower of the Academy’s international feature category, I’m willing to bet that several films from Middle Eastern countries will make the shortlist. And even posit that one will triumph on Oscar night.\n\n\tEven though only 10 Middle Eastern countries are fielding titles, the region is yielding its most competitive lineup in years. The submissions encompass work from a former nominee (Tunisia’s Kaouther Ben Hania), a former short-listed helmer (Morocco’s Maryam Touzani), a winner of the prestigious Cannes Golden Camera (Iraq’s Hasan Hadi), as well as high-profile selections of the region from Sundance, Cannes, Venice, Toronto and Tribeca.\n\t\n\n\tThe trend of Middle Eastern stories submitted by other countries in the Oscar race continues. Last year, Germany received a nomination for “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” from Iran-born Mohammad Rasoulof. This year, France, looking for its first international winner since “Indochine” in 1992, is championing “It Was Just an Accident,” from dissident Iranian helmer Jafar Panahi. It has a strong chance of going all the way: The film won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, where savvy distributor Neon bought it. Its early October release saw strong box office.\n\n\n\tTwo other Iran-born directors represent countries outside of their homeland this year: Alireza Khatami with Canada’s entry, the Turkish-language psychological drama “The Things You Kill,” and Shahram Mokri, with the Tajikistan entry, the enigmatic “Black Rabbit, White Rabbit.” Given the surprising proliferation of Iranian directors in this year’s race, it’s ironic that Iran’s submission, “Cause of Death: Unknown,” a debut feature directed by Ali Zarnegar, lacks awards buzz pedigree.\n\t\n\n\tMeanwhile, another former international Oscar short-listed director, Sweden’s Tarik Saleh, represents his Scandinavian homeland again with “Eagles of the Republic,” the gripping final chapter of his Cairo trilogy. A Cohen Media Group 2026 release, it follows a charismatic Egyptian superstar, coerced by the government into playing President El-Sisi in a propaganda film, who finds himself embroiled in dangerous conspiracies.\n\n\tEven discounting any “alumni effect,” there’s no denying that Tunisia’s Ben Hania (an international feature nominee for “The Man Who Sold His Skin” in 2020 and a documentary nominee with “Four Daughters” in 2023), brings a strong contender with the hot-button docudrama “The Voice of Hind Rajab.” The film uses the real voice of a panic-stricken Palestinian child trapped in a vehicle under fire from Israeli tanks as she phones the Palestinian Red Crescent pleading to be rescued, but taps actors to play the increasingly hysterical workers who handle her call. It unspooled in Venice and Toronto festivals.\n\n\tAfter being shortlisted with “The Blue Caftan” in 2023, Morocco’s Touzani provides another formidable entry in “Calle Malaga.” The sweet dramedy nabbed the Audience Award of the Venice Film Festival’s Spotlight section and should pleasantly challenge society’s views of aging, agency and sexuality. Slotted for a 2026 rollout from Strand Releasing, it centers on María Ángeles (Spanish screen legend Carmen Maura), an 80-year-old resident of the titular Tangier street, whose bond with her colorful coastal hometown is rich and complex; she’s Spanish while also somehow being Moroccan.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘The President’s Cake’\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnother audience-pleasing, plausible contender is the Iraqi submission “The President’s Cake.” One of the hits of this year’s Cannes Film Festival, helmer Hadi’s poignant feature debut follows an impoverished girl living with her grandmother in the Mesopotamian marshes during the Saddam Hussein regime. When she is assigned to bake the dictator’s birthday cake for her school’s annual celebration, it proves to be a near-impossible burden for both girl and granny. At Cannes, the film claimed the juried best first feature award as well as the People’s Choice award of the Directors’ Fortnight. Sony Pictures Classics is distributing.\n\t\n\n\tEgypt, too, chose an accomplished and likeable debut feature about the difficult life of a young girl with Sarah Goher’s “Happy Birthday,” a title which could land the country on the shortlist for the first time. The film illuminates disparities of wealth and class in contemporary Cairo through the story of a resourceful 8-year-old maid whose devoted friendship with the daughter of the household she works for is discouraged by her employers. At its Tribeca premiere, it nabbed best international narrative feature, best screenplay and best director. At press time, the film still lacked an American distributor, but it shouldn’t be homeless for long. As a writer-producer previously known for Marvel’s “Moon Knight,” Goher should already have supporters in Hollywood.\n\n\tIt’s difficult to predict how world politics will influence the international feature race, but they may have helped last year’s Palestinian entry, “From Ground Zero,” to a place on the shortlist. The continued groundswell of support for Palestine, plus the younger and more international cohort invited to join the Academy could also impact a pair of Palestinian period films from well-respected female writer-directors that share both cast members and themes.\n\n\tAnnemarie Jacir’s sweeping epic “Palestine 36” is the Palestinian entry. It’s her fourth feature and her fourth to represent the country. Set in 1936, it delves into the territory’s developing unrest as rising numbers of Jewish immigrants flee European antisemitism and find new homes in the region while the Palestinian population unites in the largest and longest uprising against Britain’s 30-year rule. Watermelon Films is releasing in the U.S.\n\n\tWhile Jacir’s film boasts a large cast of characters and a concentrated timeline, in contrast, Jordan’s entry, “All That’s Left of You,” from Palestinian-American actor-writer-director Cherien Dabis, looks at some similar issues, but within the more intimate context of a single family over three generations. Dabis plays a mother contextualizing the fate of her son through the tribulations of his grandfather. It’s also a Watermelon Films release; Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo have signed on as exec producers.\n\n\tMeanwhile, political trends are currently less favorable towards Israel’s cinema. This year, the country submitted a Palestinian story, albeit one written and directed by a Jewish Israeli, Shai Carmeli-Pollak, working with a Palestinian producer and a mixed crew. Distributed by Menemsha Films in the U.S., “The Sea” follows the perilous journey of a 12-year-old boy from a Palestinian village determined to visit the sea for the first time despite being denied entry at an Israeli checkpoint.\n\t\n\n\tSince 2013, Saudi Arabia has made eight international feature submissions, with two each from female helmers Haifaa al-Mansour and Shahad Ameen. Both Ameen’s current “Hijra” and her mermaid fable “Scales” contain strong feminist themes and striking visual elements. “Hijra’s” saga of a grandmother and granddaughter whose pilgrimage to Mecca turns into a road trip of another sort confirms Ameen as a talent to watch.\n\n\t“Hijra” premiered in Venice, as did the alluringly titled Lebanese submission “A Sad Beautiful World” from narrative feature debutant Cyril Aris. In a category that traditionally favors serious dramas, this rom-com unfolding against the backdrop of 30 years of Lebanese tragedies plays like a breath of fresh air and piques anticipation for Aris’ next feature.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe race for the documentary feature Academy Award spotlights quality filmmaking, but also requires a whole lot of money and the support of international doc branch voters. This year’s crop of top contenders includes films about investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, America’s corrupt prison system, George Orwell, the Israel-Hamas war, racism in America and Leni Riefenstahl. While docs about boldface names are in the mix, this year’s Oscar race includes very few celebrity-driven films. Here’s a run-down of the top contenders.\n\t\n\n\t2000 Meters to AndriivkaDIRECTOR Mstyslav Chernov PRODUCERS Mstyslav Chernov, Michelle Mizner, Raney Aronson-Rath, the Associated PressDISTRIBUTOR FrontlineThe film, which follows a Ukrainian platoon’s mission to liberate the occupied village of Andriivka from Russian troops, is also Ukraine’s Oscar entry in the international feature category and Chernov’s follow-up to his Oscar-winning doc “20 Days in Mariupol.” After debuting at Sundance 2025, the film won Chernov the best directing award in the World Documentary program.\n\n\n\tThe Alabama SolutionDIRECTORS Andrew Jarecki, Charlotte Kaufman PRODUCERS Jarecki, Kaufman DISTRIBUTOR HBOA powerful exposé of the inhumanity of the American prison system, the doc, which bowed at Sundance, is built from footage that incarcerated men secretly recorded with contraband cell phones. Jarecki (“The Jinx”) and Kaufman’s ability to penetrate the walls of secrecy results in an unfiltered view of prison privatization, inmate slave labor, abuse of power, government corruption and extreme violence. It’s a deeply disturbing yet vital watch that should appeal to voters.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t‘The Alabama Solution’ exposes the U.S. prison system.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCome See Me in the Good LightDIRECTOR Ryan WhitePRODUCERS White, Jessica Hargrave, Tig Notaro, Stef WillenDISTRIBUTOR Apple TV+The film follows poets Andrea Gibson and Megan Falley as their love deepens, and the couple finds newfound appreciation for the preciousness of life after a terminal illness diagnosis. The doc has won several film fest audience awards, including the coveted Sundance 2025 Festival Favorite kudo. White’s film also won the audience award at the Boulder Film Festival, Cleveland International Film Festival and Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.\n\n\tCover-UpDIRECTOR Laura Poitras, Mark Obenhaus PRODUCERS Yoni Golijov, Poitras, Obenhaus, Olivia StreisandDISTRIBUTOR NetflixThis urgent political thriller about Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Seymour Hersh opened the 2025 Venice International Film Festival before moving on to Telluride, Toronto, New York and London. With freedom of the press in jeopardy and self-censorship by major media prevalent, the doc, co-directed by Oscar-winner Poitras (“Citizenfour”), serves as a critical reminder of the importance of hard-hitting investigative reporting in a democracy.\n\n\tCoexistence, My Ass!DIRECTOR Amber FaresPRODUCERS Rachel Leah-Jones, Fares DISTRIBUTOR Selfd-distributedDisillusioned with politics, Noam Shuster Eliassi pivots to stand-up comedy to share her “radical” message that Palestinians and Israelis deserve equal human rights. The film, described by Variety’s Tomris Laffly after its Sundance premiere as an “urgent, eye-opening and enormously compassionate documentary,” won the Golden Alexander in the international competition section of the 27th Thessaloniki Intl. Documentary Festival in March.\n\n\tCutting Through RocksDIRECTORS Sara Khaki, Mohammadreza Eyni PRODUCERS Khaki, EyniDISTRIBUTOR Self-distributedWinner of the Grand Jury Prize in the World Cinema Documentary Competition section at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, the doc follows Sara Shahverdi, the first elected councilwoman of her Iranian village, as she challenges entrenched patriarchal norms by combating child marriage, and training teenage girls to gain independence by learning to ride motorcycles. The directors spent over eight years tracking Shahverdi’s efforts to subvert economic systems and transform local attitudes. In October, the doc garnered the top documentary prize at the 2025 Woodstock Film Festival.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAndrea Gibson and Megan Falley star in ‘Come See Me in the Good Light.’\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHolding LiatDIRECTOR Brandon KramerPRODUCERS Darren Aronofsky,Lance Kramer, Yoni Brook, Ari Handel, Justin A. GonçalvesDISTRIBUTOR Self-distributed via the Film CollaborativeWinner of the 2025 Berlinale Documentary Award, the feature follows an Israeli family fighting for the return of loved ones following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. The nuanced film gives a voice to critics of the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while remaining sympathetic to the victims of a massacre. The Berlinale jury said the film “creates a space where the complexity of violence and justice and the contractions of history are not silenced, but brought forward.”\n\n\tOrwell: 2+2=5DIRECTOR Raoul PeckPRODUCER Alex Gibney, Peck, George Chignell, Nick Shumaker DISTRIBUTOR NeonThis chilling cinematic essay on power, propaganda and “1984” author George Orwell’s prophetic warnings could not be more timely. Peck, who was nominated for an Oscar for his 2016 doc “I Am Not Your Negro,” interweaves archival footage from adaptations of “1984” with 21st century images, while dissecting Orwell’s genius and his vital lessons for our future. The film debuted ear- lier this year at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\tThe Perfect NeighborDIRECTOR Geeta GandbhirPRODUCER Alisa Payne, Gandbhir, Nikon Kwantu, Sam BisbeeDISTRIBUTOR NetflixComposed almost entirely of police body-cam and dash-cam video, the doc, which won the Sundance 2025 U.S. Documentary Directing Award, delves into America’s complexities around race, policing and gun laws via the fatal shooting of Ajike Owens by her neighbor Susan Lorincz. A hit with critics and audiences alike at film festivals worldwide, the doc is a major player in the awards race.\n\n\tRiefenstahlDIRECTOR Andres Veiel PRODUCERS Enzo Maass, Sandra Maischberger DISTRIBUTOR Kino LorberThe debate about filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, who was the favorite documentarian of the Nazi’s Third Reich, has been parsed in books, articles and television interviews, but Veiel uses never-before-seen documents from Riefenstahl’s estate, including private films, photos, recordings and letters, to indict the infamous filmmaker. While Ray Müller’s 1993 three-hour-long doc “The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl” was a comprehensive look at Hitler’s go-to propagandist, Veiel’s doc, which debuted at the Venice Film Festival earlier this year, is not just a film about the Nazi propagandist; it also serves as a warning for the future.\n\t\n\n\tThe Tale of SilyanDIRECTOR Tamara Kotevska PRODUCERS Kotevska, Jean Dakar, Anna Hashmi, Jordanco Petkovski DISTRIBUTOR National GeographicAfter being abandoned by his family, a Macedonian farmer takes a job at a landfill, where he encounters an injured white stork. The farmer and the bird find comfort and companionship in each other’s solitude. The film, directed by Oscar-nominee Kotevska (“Honeyland”) is also North Macedonia’s Academy Award entry for the international feature.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAlexandre Desplat and Edgar Ramírez will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award during this year’s GuadaLAjara Film Festival (GLAFF XV), set to take place at the Opening Night Gala on Nov. 6 at the United Theater in Los Angeles. \n\n\tThe Árbol de la Vida Award honors artists whose “work transcends borders and inspires cultural dialogue through cinema, paying tribute to outstanding individuals who have made a lasting impact in film, entertainment, and culture.” \n\t\n\n\tDesplat has composed scores on projects such as “The Imitation Game,” “The King’s Speech,” “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and “The Shape of Water,” winning the Academy Award for Best Original Score, Golden Globe, and a BAFTA Award in 2018. Desplat composed the score for Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” the festival’s opening night selection, starring Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi and Mia Goth. \n\n\n\tRamírez’s credits include the Academy Award-nominated “Emilia Pérez,” “American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” and “Dr. Death.” Ramírez produced and stars in “It Would Be Night in Caracas,” a thriller set during the 2017 protests in Venezuela, which will screen at the GuadaLAJara Film Festival this year. \n\n\t“The Árbol de la Vida Award is about celebrating artists whose vision and talent bridge cultures and generations,” said Festival Director Ximena Urrutia in a statement. “Alexandre Desplat and Edgar Ramírez each represent excellence in their respective crafts — one through the universal language of music, the other through deeply human storytelling that resonates around the world. It is an honor to celebrate them both at GLAFF’s fifteenth anniversary.”\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to the Lifetime Achievement Award, the GuadaLAjara Film Festival in partnership with the Art Directors Guild (ADG, IATSE Local 800) Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Committee (ADG DEI) will present a Production Designer Award & Mentorship for a narrative short film during GLAFF’s 2025 Shorts Block on Nov. 8 at Vidiots in Los Angeles. \n\n\t“The Art Directors Guild Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee is proud to reaffirm its commitment to fostering connection and collaboration among diverse filmmakers while celebrating the crafts and cultures that inspire their work,” said Alexander Stamm, Co-Chair of the ADG DEI Committee. “We are honored to expand our partnership with GLAFF through the introduction of this new award, further strengthening our shared mission to inspire, empower, and unite creative communities across the industry.”\n\n\tThe festival is presented by University of Guadalajara Foundation USA, Guadalajara International Film Festival, Grodman Legacy and University of Guadalajara.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Season 4, Part 2 of “Bridgerton,” now streaming on Netflix.\n\n\tThe Ton is no stranger to scheming mothers with an agenda.\n\n\tAs Lady Araminta Gun in “Bridgerton” Season 4, Scottish actress Katie Leung has delivered one of the Shondaland universe’s most compelling antagonists to date — a twice-widowed mother who is revealed to have quietly pocketed her stepdaughter Sophie Baek’s (Yerin Ha) dowry to fund her own daughters’ debuts. The secret comes crashing down in the finale when Sophie finally confronts Araminta in front of the whole family. A reckoning long overdue, it leaves Araminta’s relationship with Sophie further fractured and her standing with the Bridgertons in ruins — and as Benedict (Luke Thompson) and Sophie ride off into their happily ever after, there is no redemption arc waiting for Lady Araminta Gun.\n\t\n\n\tThe role marks a triumphant pivot for Leung, known for her role as Cho Chang in the “Harry Potter” franchise and, more recently, as the voice of Caitlyn in Netflix’s animated series “Arcane.” In the Cinderella-inflected fourth season of “Bridgerton,” based on Julia Quinn’s novel “An Offer From a Gentleman,” Leung commands every scene she’s in, communicating volumes with a single (terrifying) look. The internet has taken notice: Audiences love to hate her. But Leung thinks they’re hating the wrong person.\n\n\n\t“Nobody blames her husband,” she says of the late Lord Penwood, whose secret illegitimate daughter set the whole conflict in motion. “Everyone else is just like, ‘Araminta is terrible.’ And I’m like — that’s really unfair.” \n\t\n\n\tIt’s a question worth sitting with: If a man’s hidden betrayal created the crisis, why does the woman left to manage the fallout become the villain of the story?\n\n\tLeung spoke with Variety about embodying a woman the world is quick to villainize, why new motherhood made her a better actor and the very specific power of surrounding yourself with people who look like you.\n\t\n\t\tThis is “Bridgerton”‘s first real season-long antagonist. Was there any pressure stepping into that?\t\n\n\tIf anything, there was less pressure. She was always going to be unlikable from the very beginning, so I wasn’t worried about whether audiences would resonate with her. I’ve spent a huge part of my life and career trying to please other people, and I think that had a lot to do with me as Katie — whereas with Araminta, and where I am in my life right now, that just wasn’t something I cared too much about. My main goal was to make sure she was still human in spite of playing the wicked stepmother. There’s a lot of trauma and darkness in her story that we get to explore. That actually made it quite easy to step into.\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve talked about Araminta being “formidable” — and you’ve described yourself as the opposite. How did you bridge that gap?\t\n\n\tI was maybe slightly worried about maintaining the status she carries, because people are genuinely afraid of her. I would say I’m the opposite — nobody is afraid of me. So I was like, I don’t know how I’m going to do this. But whatever I was doing, I think it worked. A lot of people have mentioned the eyes. I guess there’s a lot you can say with your eyes that you can’t put on paper. And that probably comes from seeing women in my life who have been so repressed that the eyes become their only real means of communication.\n\t\n\t\tThe costume and hair clearly helped too.\t\n\n\tEnormously. Once I was in all of it — the wig, the gowns, everything — I just felt like I inhabited Araminta and her dominance. I didn’t have to do much else. She’s a classy lady, and I certainly feel that when I’ve got the clothes on.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMichelle Mao as Rosamund Li, Katie Leung as Lady Araminta Gun, Isabella Wei as Posy Li\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou came onto set alongside Isabella Wei, Michelle Mao and Yerin Ha, who play your daughters. How did those relationships develop?\t\n\n\tWe had too much fun. Isabella and I kept talking about the fact that we were expecting to feel anxious — waiting for that moment where insecurity would crop up — and it just never came. I think part of it was that I’m a new mom. When I started on this job, I had a one-year-old, and that takes up so much of your energy that I genuinely didn’t have the capacity for overthinking. I had just enough to do my work to the best of my ability, and beyond that, the usual nerves just weren’t an option. It really served me.\n\t\n\n\tBut I also think a big part of it was feeling safe. Being surrounded by people who looked like me — for Asian women, not just one, but multiple in the same scene, in the same show — that’s unheard of. You’re not conscious of it until you look back in retrospect and ask yourself, why was that so different? And that’s why.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYerin Ha as Sophie Baek, Katie Leung as Lady Araminta Gun\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLet’s talk about Araminta’s arc with Sophie. She keeps Sophie’s dowry secret, uses it for her own daughters — and genuinely seems to believe she’s justified. How did you interpret that?\t\n\n\tIt’s quite complex. I think she felt she deserved Sophie’s portion because she was raising a child that wasn’t her own. And when she originally offered to take Sophie in — at the funeral, putting her under her roof — I don’t think Araminta believed she was being manipulative. She was sincere about it. In her mind, she was doing Sophie a favor.\n\n\tAnd then when the truth comes out, I think the real crack is her daughters’ reactions. Up until that point, Rosamond and Posy were always at her beck and call. Seeing them — especially Posy — disagree with her, respond to the situation with their own moral compass, that’s what exposes her. She felt exposed.\n\t\n\t\tDoes she feel shame? Does she think she was wrong?\t\n\n\tThere’s definitely a transition, even if nothing is concrete. The way I played that final scene is that there’s something like hope, or the beginning of remorse — amplified by Sophie, who comes to her not with anger but with genuine calm and kindness. She tells Araminta: They love you, my father loved you. Araminta expected Sophie to match her energy, to blow up. And she doesn’t. Sophie kills her with kindness, essentially. And Araminta is taken aback.\n\t\n\t\tWhere do you see her going after that — with Sophie, with her daughters, with the Bridgertons?\t\n\n\tThere would be too much shame to stay in close proximity to any of them. She does the walk of shame on her way out. I can’t imagine she’d want to face them again. But I do think the relationship that would most need mending — and that she would eventually come around to — is the one with Posy.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tArthur Lee as Lord Penwood, Katie Leung as Lady Araminta Gun\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve said you don’t think of Araminta as a villain. Is that still your position?\t\n\n\tAs Katie, her behavior was despicable. There’s no excusing it. But as the actress playing her, I had to find empathy, and that was genuinely easy to find. When you think about that era — what it was like to be a woman, a single mother with two teenage daughters, and no male financial support — she was left to fend for herself. And nobody blames her husband. Nobody calls him out for what he did to her. Everyone else is just like, “Araminta is terrible.” And I’m like — that’s really unfair. Beyond Sophie being a symbol of his betrayal, if the truth had gotten out, their entire reputation in the Ton would have collapsed. Her daughters would have had no prospects. She had spent years rebuilding. The stakes were everything.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tYou’ve now done “Harry Potter,” “Arcane” and “Bridgerton” — three massive universes. How has your relationship with that scale of work changed?\t\n\n\tThe more confident I’ve become about who I am as a person, the more I’m able to enjoy the work. That’s come with age and experience. My first job — “Harry Potter” — I had never acted before in my life, and suddenly I was in front of 20 cameras and 100 people, completely lost, still figuring out who I was. I can’t say I had the time of my life. But with “Arcane,” with “Bridgerton” — I felt like I deserved to be there. I never questioned it. And once you stop questioning it, you can actually focus on bringing your best work.\n\t\n\t\tWill we see Araminta in Season 5?\t\n\n\tNever say never. As of now, I haven’t heard anything. But as long as she makes you feel something — love her, hate her, whatever — then I’ve done my job. And honestly, I love that people love to hate her. That makes me very happy.\n\n\tThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe nation’s biggest TV newsrooms scrambled on Saturday morning to cover strikes by the United States and Israel against Iran.\n\n\tAfter weeks of threats from President Donald Trump, the United States and Israel launched a significant assault on at least nine major targets early Saturday, including Tehran, Tabriz, Urmia, Kermanshah, Qom, Isfahan, Shiraz, Minab and Chabahar, according to the New York Times. The outlet also reported that Israel targeted a gathering of Iranian leaders. Trump posted a video on Truth Social Saturday morning claiming that negotiations to curb Iran’s nuclear capabilities and avoid war had fallen through, which led the nations to engage.\n\t\n\n\tKaitlan Collins, Wolf Blitzer and others led coverage for CNN at different times of the day. During Collins’ conversation with on-site correspondent Jeremy Diamond, he explained that the United States “focused largely on military sites and locations.” Israel also targeted key military resources, but was also “clear in taking responsibility for the strikes on senior Iranian leaders.”\n\n\n\t“We have not heard the United States take any part of responsibility or credit in that effort,” Diamond added. “We’ll see whether or not that changes, should an announcement be made that, for example, the Iranian supreme leader has been killed, which we do not yet know at this stage. We do know that he has been targeted and so far it’s been described to us as purely the Israeli part of these strikes, not the United States, which has stressed so far a focus on military structures inside of Iran.”\n\n\tFox News tapped Bret Baier, among others, to cover strikes on Saturday morning. He sat down with Democratic Rep. Adam Smith to discuss the Trump administration’s intentions with the strikes, as well as what the next few days of conflict could look like. Rep. Smith described the situation as a “full-scale Middle East War” that is likely to go on for “several more days.” He also said “we are not clear” on what Trump’s intentions were with the strikes.\n\t\n\n\t“Most of the talks have been about Iran’s nuclear program,” Rep. Smith said. “That raises all kinds of concerns about why this approach to deal with that nuclear program. But also, the President has talked about Iran’s ballistic missile program, and he’s frankly talked also about regime change. So I don’t know that he’s clearly stated that this is a full-on war for regime change, but it certainly seems to be that way.”\n\n\tRachel Maddow spearheaded coverage for MS Now for an hour, following stints by the “Morning Joe” team. Maddow was largely critical of President Trump, and warned that “the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is not the kind of force that’s going to go poof.”\n\n\t“If they do kill the Supreme Leader, which appears, maybe, to be what they tried to do earlier today, then what will happen?” Maddow said. “I mean, this isn’t Venezuela. There’s no vice Ayatollah who’s going to step in and take over the top job, except she’ll take calls from Marco Rubio. What will happen then? If you voted for Donald Trump for president because you believed the hype, that he was America first, that he was against foreign wars, that he was definitely against regime change, wars in foreign countries, well, again, good morning. I hope you slept well.”\n\n\tWhile Tom Llamas will anchor a special edition of “NBC Nightly News,” Peter Alexander and Laura Jarrett led the morning coverage of the strikes for NBC. They were joined by Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, who claimed that the situation in Iran is “under control” and that the United States and Israel “failed to hit their targets.” He also faulted the United States for starting a negotiation to avoid conflict, “and then in the middle of the negotiation, attack.”\n\n\t“We made big progress two days ago,” he said. “On Thursday, we had a very good meeting in Geneva, together with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, and we were able to address serious questions related to Iran’s nuclear program. We obviously have differences, but we resolved some of those differences.”\n",

There is a healthy mix of international stories, American directors, docs with big-streamer support and docs with smaller theatrical distribution.\n\n\tThis year’s feature nominees are: David Borenstein and Pavel Talankin’s “Mr. Nobody Against Putin” (Kino Lorber), Geeta Gandbhir’s “The Perfect Neighbor” (Netflix), Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman’s “The Alabama Solution” (HBO), Sara Khaki and Mohammadreza Eyni’s “Cutting Through Rocks” (self-distributed), and Ryan White’s “Come See Me in the Good Light” (Apple).\n\t\n\n\tAll but one of the nominated documentaries is about a current event that tackles urgent and timely subject matters, like Russia’s ongoing descent into oppressive authoritarianism (“Mr. Nobody Against Putin”), the inhumanity of America’s current prison system (“The Alabama Solution”), women’s rights in Iran (“Cutting Through Rocks”) and the implications of Florida’s Stand Your Ground laws and gun regulations (“The Perfect Neighbor”).\n\n\n\tCurrent event docs have historically appealed to voters, who in the last two years have awarded Academy Awards to a film about Palestinian activists’ resistance to forced displacement (“No Other Land”) and a documentary about the war in Ukraine (“20 Days in Mariupol”).\n\n\tThat said, Apple’s “Come See Me in the Good Light,” which profiles poets Andrea Gibson and Megan Falley as they navigate Gibson’s cancer journey, has been a hit with audiences and critics alike since debuting at Sundance in January 2025. In addition to winning the Sundance Festival Favorite Award, “Come See Me in the Good Light” also garnered an Indie Spirit nom in December.\n\t\n\n\tAll five of the 2026 Oscar-nominated feature docs made their world premieres in Park City last year. Since 2016, six documentaries that debuted at Sundance have gone on to win the Academy Award.The last time Netflix won the doc feature was in 2021 with “My Octopus Teacher.” With Gandbhir’s “The Perfect Neighbor,” the streamer has a good shot at once again garnering the trophy in the category. The film, which follows the murder of a young Black mother of four who was shot and killed by her neighbor, has been nominated for all the major guild awards as well as a BAFTA and an Indie Spirit award.\n\n\tIn the doc, Gandbhir reconstructs an escalating dispute between neighbors from video recordings made by 911 responders, revealing a white citizen’s attempt to leverage the police against people of color.“Mr. Nobody vs. Putin,” which follows a teacher in Russia secretly filming his school’s grim transformation after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, also garnered BAFTA and PGA nominations.\n\n\tCarlos Aguilar’s Variety review stated: “Through the eyes of its delightfully brave, yet utterly relatable subject, this terrifying, revelatory and poignant exposé offers an unseen human angle on an ongoing conflict that continues to be widely addressed in documentary cinema.”\n\n\t“The Alabama Solution” is also up for a PGA honor alongside “Mr. Nobody vs. Putin,” and “The Perfect Neighbor.” Variety’s chief film critic Owen Gleiberman said that the HBO film “lays bare the rotten guts of this system with enough sobering evidence, and enough filmmaking force, to make a difference.”“Cutting Through Rocks,” about Sara Shahverdi, who challenges Iran’s entrenched patriarchal norms by training teenage girls to ride motorcycles and combating child marriages, earned a DGA nod.\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Scream 7” easily slashed its way to the top of the Friday box office, knocking off last week’s champion, “Wuthering Heights.”\n\n\tThe seventh installment in the long-running slasher franchise grossed $28.8 million on Friday from 3,540 North American locations. Paramount and Spyglass are hoping for $60 million through opening weekend, which would mark the best debut in series history.\n\n\n\t“Scream 7” sees the return of Neve Campbell’s Sidney Prescott, who relocates to the small town of Pine Grove for a quiet life with her daughter, only to have Ghostface try to burn it all down. Campbell stars alongside fellow original cast members Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Matthew Lillard, as well as Isabel May, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, Anna Camp, Joel McHale and Mckenna Grace.\n\t\n\n\tWhile Paramount is poised for a major payday, it wasn’t easy getting “Scream 7” off the ground. Preproduction was plagued by a myriad of major setbacks, including the exit of stars Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega and a major shakeup on the creative team, which saw original “Scream” writer Kevin Williamson take the directing reins from Christopher Landon. On top of all that, Paramount and Spyglass had to shell out $7 million for Campbell’s return after a pay dispute caused her to bow out of “Scream 6.”\n\n\n\tSony’s “GOAT” landed at No. 2 on Friday with $2.6 million domestically. The animated family film about professional animal athletes should score $11.7 million by Sunday. Through three weekends of release, “GOAT” should reach a North American total of $73 million.\n\t\n\n\tThird place went to Emerald Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights,” which earned an estimated $2.2 million on its third Friday in North American theaters. The steamy literary adaptation should make $7 million by Sunday for a domestic total of $72 million.\n\n\tFourth place went to “Twenty One Pilots: More Than We Ever Imagined,” which grossed $2.1 million on Friday from just 770 North American theaters, according to rival estimates. The concert film, which captures the group’s Mexico City show in front of a crowd of 65,000 fans, should hit $3.5 million by Sunday. \n\n\tIn a distant fifth was “Crime 101,” which heisted just $920,107 domestically on Friday. Amazon MGM is hoping for $3.34 million by Sunday, which would bring the film’s domestic total to $29.9 million.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOn the latest episode of Variety‘s “Strictly Business” podcast, Bill O’Dowd, founder and CEO of Dolphin Entertainment, offers a deep dive into the art and science of the creator economy. \n\n\tThe leader of the parent company of PR heavyweights 42West, Shore Fire Media and a host of boutique firms explains how the heat among social media personalities is changing everything about marketing and advertising, and how it has bulldozed traditional barriers to launching consumer products.\n\t\n\n\tDolphin Entertainment began in the mid-1990s as a production company behind such Nickelodeon series as “Zoey 101” and “Ned’s Declassified.” A decade later, as O’Dowd saw the power of online communities and the emergence of social media platforms, he repositioned the company to focus on celebrity and influencer marketing, the creator economy and the development of consumer products.\n\n\n\t“The first 20 years of Dolphin, we were a production company and we’re probably most known for a long, great relationship with Nickelodeon. We were putting clips of our kids shows on online. We were making original content for AOL and Yahoo and Facebook, long before streaming. I only say that to put in context what led us to to bet on what’s now called the creator economy — back then was called mommy bloggers,” O’Dowd says. “We were in the kids business and we were in the young adult business, and we saw how they interacted with this medium. The mobile internet democratized the launch of consumer products. You no longer needed to have tens of millions of dollars of a paid media campaign to launch a consumer product.”\n\t\n\n\tO’Dowd points to the success story of beauty influencer Susan Yara. \n\n\t“Susan was one of the O.G. makeup influencers. She has a channel on YouTube called Mixed Makeup, and she launched [skin care produc Naturium] in the summer of 2020, in COVID. Three years later, she sold it to e.l.f. Beauty for $350 million — with nothing but an influencer marketing campaign and a dash of PR. There was no paid media,” he says.\n\n\tO’Dowd explains how he strategically acquired firms to create a flywheel effect in which Dolphin represent creator clients and do work on behalf of brands.\n\n\t“When you can see it from both sides, what each side is trying to accomplish to serve in that matchmaking role, it’s just one of the great advantages that the company has,” O’Dowd says. “Traditional celebrities want to play in the influencer space and certainly in the brand space, if they feel like they can communicate authentically to their audience.”\n\n\t“Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

    "body": "\n\tShia LaBeouf is sharing his side of the story after being arrested on two counts of simple battery earlier this month during Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans. \n\n\t“My behavior… I gotta deal with that. Does that mean I gotta go to rehab again? I’m just not into it, bro,” the “Transformers” actor said during an interview with Andrew Callaghan’s Channel 5. “I don’t think my answers are there. I don’t. I really, genuinely, don’t. If I genuinely did, I’d go. I don’t think I have a drinking problem.” \n\t\n\n\tThe actor, who was ordered by a New Orleans judge to return to rehab on Thursday, said he instead has a Napoleon complex: “I think I have a different problem, and I’m gonna address it. I think I have a small man complex.” \n\n\n\tHe continued: “I think it’s something that has to do with anger and ego more so than my drinking, but that’s where I’m at now on my journey, and I’m trying to navigate it. I’ll figure it out.” \n\n\tIn the interview, LeBeouf also claimed the recent altercation was prompted when three gay men began touching his leg. \n\n\t“I’ll be honest with you, big gay people are scary to me,” he said. “I’m like, standing by myself and three gay dudes are next to me, touching my leg, I get scared. I’m sorry if that’s homophobic. Then I’m that.” \n\n\tWhen asked by Callaghan if this happens a lot, LaBeouf responded: “It just happened one time recently… Well, that’s why I got arrested.” He continued, acknowledging that things shouldn’t have gotten physical: “I am wrong for touching anyone ever. And that’s the end of my statement on this whole shit.” \n\t\n\n\tAccording to a statement from the New Orleans Police Department shared with Variety, LaBeouf was “reportedly causing a disturbance and becoming increasing[ly] aggressive” at a business on Royal Street the night of the arrest. “Once removed from the building, the victim reported being struck by LaBeouf, who used his closed fists on the victim several times,” the department said.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe five Oscar-nominated doc shorts pack a lot of punch into their brief time on screen. The filmmakers talked to Variety about their documentaries.\n\n\tAll the Empty Rooms\n\n\tJoshua Seftel’s “All the Empty Rooms” explores the bedrooms of eight American children who were killed during a school shooting. Each room, preserved by the victim’s parents, looks exactly how it did when each child left on their final day off to school. “There are over 100 school shootings a year in the U.S., and it’s so disheartening to me that this has become normal and acceptable to us,” says Seftel. “I wanted to make a film that could reframe this issue. To remove the issue from the usual political debate and focus on the part we all agree upon: That we all want our children to be safe at school.” Seftel hopes that the 34-minute Netflix doc will help Americans across the country fully appreciate the human toll of school shootings. “My hope is that by laying bare the stories of these empty rooms and these forgotten families who are grappling with grief and loss, we can begin to feel something again.”\n\t\n\n\tChildren No More: Were and Are Gone\n\n\n\tDirected by Hilla Medalia and produced by the documentary industry’s grande dame, Sheila Nevins, “Children No More: Were and Are Gone” follows Tel Aviv activists who gather weekly to demonstrate their opposition to the war in Gaza with a silent vigil for the children killed in Israeli attacks. “When I first encountered the vigil and experienced the power of their activism, I immediately felt the need to document the experience,” Medalia says. “Their silence was powerful — a tool that encourages reflection rather than explanation — and I felt a very clear sense of courage in a simple action filled with deep meaning. As a filmmaker, I had been grappling with my role and responsibilities during this war, and for me this work became a way to step outside our shared pain and to look directly at things that are absent from the media — including the devastating human toll of Israel’s policies in Gaza, especially on children who were full of life and possibility and are now no more.” The film is being distributed by Roadside Attractions.\n\t\n\n\tThe Devil Is Busy\n\n\tThe 32-minute HBO short takes viewers on a daylong journey with Tracii, the head of security at a women’s healthcare clinic in Atlanta, as she works to ensure the safety of women seeking abortions in the face of new restrictions and persistent protests. Directors Geeta Gandbhir (also Oscar-nominated for “The Perfect Neighbor”) and Christalyn Hampton say that they made the film “because we wanted everyone to see what this intense, disturbing new reality looks like on a human level. We wanted viewers to experience the impact of this abortion decision and see the complexity of emotions around abortion as it relates to faith, agency, power, and how it hurts women and the people struggling to care for them. We wanted people to see this raw, unflinching portrait long after the media and the activism had died down and no one was talking about abortion. We didn’t want these women to be forgotten.”\n\n\tThe Life and Death of Brent Renaud\n\n\tIn 2022, filmmaker Brent Renaud became the first American journalist to die when Russian soldiers killed him while reporting on the war in Ukraine. His younger brother and lifelong filmmaking partner, Craig Renaud, recovered Brent’s body and decided to make a film that weaves together decades of the brothers’ reporting from global conflict zones, including Iraq, Haiti, Somalia, and Central America. Renaud hopes that the 37-minute HBO doc incites change. “According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, it is the deadliest time to be a journalist on record. Since Brent’s death on March 13, 2022, more than 400 journalists and media workers have been killed worldwide,” Renaud says. “My hope is that the film will inspire people and governments to protect the free press, the right to witness and the right of journalists to report the news, and of the public to receive it.”\n\n\tPerfectly a Strangeness\n\n\tIn Alison McAlpine’s “Perfectly a Strangeness,” three donkeys discover an abandoned astronomical observatory. McAlpine made the 15-minute film for several reasons. “I wanted to redefine what a story can be, working with texture, movement, light, shadow, reflections, sound, rhythm, no text, (thus) creating cinema that you want to touch like an exquisite painting, or a poem that you want to experience again and again,” McAlpine says. “I wanted to express not the well-known anthropomorphic view of animals, in particular donkeys, nor the familiar perception of astronomical observatories. But rather to immerse the viewer in a sensorial experience. which feels animalic, fresh, and unforgettable.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWhen a racial slur was shouted from the audience as Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented at the BAFTA Awards, many viewers experienced a familiar mix of shock and exhaustion.\n\n\tThe moment was brief. The impact was not.\n\n\tSubsequent reporting indicated that the individual responsible is a Tourette’s activist and that a warning had been given to audience members in attendance. Even so, for millions watching at home and online, the word landed without context. It reverberated as harm.\n\t\n\n\tThe ceremony was not broadcast live. There was a delay window in which the moment could have been removed before airing. It was left intact. BAFTA issued a response. For many, it felt restrained and procedural in the face of something deeply personal.\n\n\n\tThis was not necessarily a malicious act by the institution. It was likely an unpredictable and complicated circumstance. But it illustrates a larger truth about public spaces and cultural power. Even at the highest levels of artistic celebration, Black people can still find themselves exposed.\n\n\tThat is why safe spaces matter.\n\n\tThe term is often misunderstood. It is caricatured as fragility or separation. In reality, safe spaces are civic infrastructure. They are places where dignity is not negotiable.\n\n\tIn the entertainment world, those spaces include institutions like the American Black Film Festival, ABFF Honors, the NAACP Image Awards, the Essence Black Women in Hollywood Awards luncheon, the AAFCA Awards and the BET Awards. They exist not because Black artists are unwilling to compete globally, but because history has shown that celebration without cultural grounding can be fragile.\n\t\n\n\tThese institutions create environments where achievement is contextualized, where cultural nuance is understood, and where affirmation is intentional rather than incidental.\n\n\tWhen a Black actor stands on a stage built by and for their community, they are not navigating whether the room sees them fully. They are surrounded by people who do.\n\n\tThe goal is not withdrawal from the mainstream. Black artists should continue to win Oscars, BAFTAs, Emmys and Golden Globes. They should claim every international platform available to them.\n\n\tBut moments like this remind us that representation alone is not protection.\n\n\tSafe spaces are not about exclusion. They are about ensuring that celebration does not come with an asterisk. They are about building institutions strong enough that validation does not depend solely on global approval.\n\n\tThey are also about the next generation. When established artists commit to showing up in culturally anchored spaces, they reinforce ecosystems that nurture emerging talent. They help sustain pipelines that make future success possible.\n\n\tThe BAFTA incident is a painful moment. It is also a clarifying one.\n\n\tIt asks institutions to examine how they respond to harm. It asks audiences to consider the difference between context and consequence. And it asks Black artists and cultural leaders to remember the importance of supporting spaces where dignity is foundational, not aspirational.\n\n\tThe global stage matters.\n\n\tHome matters too.\n\n\tJeff Friday is the CEO of Nice Crowd and the founder of the American Black Film Festival and ABFF Honors.\n\n\t[Pictured: Wunmi Mosaku at the NAACP Creative Honors ceremony; Ryan Coogler at the AAFCA Awards; Angela Bassett at ABFF Honors; and Kendrick Lamar at the BET Awards.]\n",

She claimed she felt off after taking it and said she woke up the next day in her bed with only her underwear on.\n      \n    \n          Here, it sounds like Motsinger wants to play the deposition for the jury.\n      \n      \n              \n          \n                          \n                Donna Motsinger\n              \n                          \n                Bill Cosby\n              \n                          \n                Celebrity News\n              \n                          \n                TV Stars\n              \n                          \n                Exclusive\n              \n                          \n                Fairly Legal\n              \n                      \n        \n          \n          ",
